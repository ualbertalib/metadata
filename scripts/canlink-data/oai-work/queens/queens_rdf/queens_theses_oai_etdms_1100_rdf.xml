      <dcterms:abstract>Cooperative communications have the ability to induce spatial diversity, increase channel capacity, and attain broader cell coverage with single-antenna terminals. This thesis focuses on the performance study of both unidirectional and bidirectional cooperative diversity networks employing the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
For the unidirectional cooperative diversity network, we study the average bit-error rate (BER) performance of a DF protocol with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. Closed-form approximate average BER expressions involving only elementary functions are presented for a cooperative diversity network with one or two relays. The proposed BER expressions are valid for both coherent and non-coherent binary signallings. With Monte-Carlo simulations, it is verified that the proposed BER expressions are extremely accurate for the whole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.&#xD;
&#xD;
For the bidirectional cooperative diversity network, we study and compare the performance of three very typical bidirectional communication protocols based on the decode-and-forward relaying: time division broadcast (TDBC), physical-layer network coding (PNC), and opportunistic source selection (OSS). Specifically, we derive an exact outage probability in a one-integral form for the TDBC protocol, and exact closed-form outage probabilities for the PNC and OSS protocols. For the TDBC protocol, we also derive extremely tight upper and lower bounds on the outage probability in closed-form. Moreover, asymptotic outage probability performance of each protocol is studied. Finally, we study the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) performance of each protocol both in the finite and infinite SNR regimes. The performance analysis presented in this thesis can be used as a useful tool to guide practical system designs for both unidirectional and bidirectional cooperative diversity networks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have the potential to address scaling challenges in CMOS technology because of their regular structures and the flexibility they possess by being re-configurable after fabrication. One of the potential approaches in attacking scaling challenges, such as negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI) and process variation (PV), is by using placement techniques that are aware of these problems. Such techniques aim at placing a circuit in an FPGA such that the critical path delay is &#xD;
improved compared to the expected worst case. This can be achieved by placing NBTI-critical blocks of a circuit in areas with fast transistors in an FPGA chip.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we present a detailed research effort that addresses the joint effect of NBTI and PV in FPGAs. We follow an experimental methodology in that we use actual PV data that we measure from 15 FPGA chips. The measured data is used to study the joint effect of NBTI and PV on the timing performance of circuits that are placed and routed in FPGAs. Enhancements are made to a well-known FPGA placement algorithm, T-VPlace, in order to make the placement process aware of the joint effect of NBTI and PV. Results are given for the placement and routing of Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmark circuits to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in addressing scaling challenges in FPGAs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common injuries  responsible for lost time claims to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). The main purpose of this study was to determine whether measurable sensorimotor changes exist in asymptomatic individuals who are at risk for CTS such that sensory impairment and/or functional tests may be used in the early detection and intervention to reduce the impact of CTS on individuals, industry and the health care system. Participants were recruited into three strata: (1) individuals diagnosed with mild CTS, (2) asymptomatic individuals who were deemed to be at risk of developing CTS due to exposure to etiological risk factors and (3) asymptomatic individuals who were deemed to be at minimal risk of developing CTS based on non-exposure to risk factors. The main outcome measures included two-point discrimination ability, pressure acuity, vibration sense, Purdue Pegboard Test performance and tracking error and tracking variance on a manual tracking task performed at two different speeds.  Seven individuals with CTS, fourteen individuals at risk of developing CTS and nine control individuals with minimal risk participated. The CTS group was significantly different from the at-risk and control groups on the main and work sections of the DASH questionnaire, and the symptom severity scale and functional status scale of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire.  The only outcome measure that showed a significant difference between the at-risk and the minimal risk group was the assembly task of the Purdue Pegboard Test (p = 0.044), however other measures including median nerve conduction latencies, and manual tracking abilities showed promise that with further recruitment, a significant difference may be seen. The sensory impairment tests did not demonstrate degradation in sensory function in individuals at risk of developing CTS, however analysis of sensory nerve conduction latencies and some aspects of fine motor skills testing did show some promise in their ability to detect individuals at risk of developing CTS. A future prospective study that follows individuals at risk of developing CTS may determine that it is possible to implement a screening tool for the early identification and treatment of CTS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2005, MTV Movies and ThinkFilm released Murderball, a groundbreaking documentary about wheelchair rugby. Due to its popularity and its subject matter, the film presents a unique opportunity to reflect on representations of disability in the contemporary North American context. The narrative of the film constructs a rivalry between Team U.S.A., captained by Mark Zupan, and Team Canada, coached by Joe Soars. Murderball works exceptionally well to disrupt notions of people with disabilities as fragile and helpless, countering ableist assumptions about what persons with quadriplegia can accomplish. However, based on a close reading of the film, I suggest that Murderball accomplishes this disruption by also celebrating ableist, sexist and heterosexist representations. I critique the film’s construction of the relationship between competitive international sport settings, disability, and masculinity by drawing on the tools of feminism and anti-normative politics. I also examine representations of hegemonic masculinity that are discursively linked to sport competition and violence in ways that work to support a U.S. nationalist and imperialist impulse. Overall, I suggest&#xD;
that recuperations of normative identity in Murderball rely on a jingoistic and violent air of moral authority where American men work to preserve the winning reputation of the U.S.A., while subjecting themselves to the constraints of normalcy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Auctoritas was the foundation of Augustus' legitimacy, success, and survival in Roman politics. The necessary precondition of successfully founding political legitimacy upon auctoritas, however, was that Augustus' auctoritas had to be supreme. This thesis will show that one of the most important ways Augustus achieved supreme auctoritas was by integrating himself into traditional beliefs about the stars and by harnessing the associations with the divine and supernatural that were latent in these beliefs. Augustus reinforced his association with these beliefs by employing a number of powerful symbols drawn from among the stars. Chapters Two and Three will focus upon one of these symbols, the sidus Iulium (the comet of Caesar). Chapter Two will demonstrate how Augustus harnessed the general acceptance of Caesar's astral apotheosis (catasterism) and of catasterism in general in the Roman world at that time and then used the sidus Iulium as a symbol of his connection with Divus Iulius and of his own semi-divine status. Chapter Three will explore how Augustus promoted the sidus Iulium as the harbinger of a golden age for the Roman people and as an omen of the fact that it was his destiny to lead them into it. Chapter Four will turn to another astral symbol, the constellation Capricorn. This chapter will examine how Augustus integrated himself into the greatly popular discipline of astrology and used its language of fate to promote himself as a man of great destiny. Throughout we will consider a variety of evidence, particularly numismatic and literary. This will help us to achieve the fullest possible picture of the lengths to which Augustus went to create a useful ally of the stars in his never-ending quest for auctoritas.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Simulations were performed to determine the effect of turbulence on protoplanets as they accrete inside of a planetary gas disk at the stage of planet formation that involves interactions between relatively large, similar sized bodies. The effect of turbulence was implemented into an existing N-Body code using a parameterization of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence performed by Laughlin et. al. (2004). The investigation focussed on the effect of turbulent perturbations on planetary dynamics and accretion at various locations in the disk, particularly at large semimajor axis. At these distances, protoplanet collisions are generally less frequent due to the large induced eccentricities from close encounters and due to the trapping of protoplanets in mutual resonances. It is, however, essential that large protoplanets develop at these distances since some must eventually grow large enough to accrete the massive gas envelopes indicative of the giant planets. &#xD;
&#xD;
The interaction between a protoplanet and the surrounding gas disk creates a torque imbalance acting on the protoplanet, which is generally believed to result in the rapid inward spiraling of the protoplanet. In order to create a fixed region in the disk within which protoplanets may interact without migrating into the central star, two scenarios were considered that would inhibit the inward migration of the protoplanets. The first scenario involved a gas disk that had been truncated at the inner edge, referred to as a planet trap, and the second involved the existence of a stationary giant planet within a gap in the disk, referred to as a planet barrier. Each scenario was tested using different density profiles of the gas disk, different numbers and masses of initial protoplanets, various rates of gas disk decay and also four different levels of turbulence intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
The results demonstrated that the addition of turbulence to the gas disk promotes planet mixing and results in an increased number of collisions between planets, even at large heliocentric distances. A turbulent disk has the tendency to create a final system where the planets are, on average, larger than those produced in a non-turbulent disk.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this dissertation, I focus on a number of British novels written since 1995 that engage with the events of the Second World War. I analyze the extent to which these literary representations of WWII enable and/or subvert the consolidation and justification of current imperialist ideology and practice, through the reproduction and/or deconstruction of WWII nostalgia. I argue that nostalgia for the “just war” depends upon the repression of the colonial past and, thus, I also explore evidence in this literature of the return of the repressed: colonialism haunts these narratives. However, alongside the racialism of colonialism, my readings of these texts expose traditional gender norms and capitalist triumphalism as the other major ideological currents that sustain both WWII nostalgia and contemporary forms of imperialism.&#xD;
The novels I deal with are from a range of literary categories, from those characterized as “low” or “middle-brow,” to those canonized within the pantheon of “high-brow” literature, as well as those characterized as “multicultural” or “postcolonial.” I examine the ways in which the literary “classes” or categories, within which these various texts are circumscribed, condition and frame their reception. Ultimately, I seek to to reveal the ways in which various accounts of the past, and specifically the Second World War, enable different understandings of the present.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Adiponectin regulates feeding behavior, energy expenditure and autonomic function through the activation of two receptors present in nuclei throughout the central nervous system, however much remains unknown about the mechanisms mediating these effects. Here I investigate the actions of adiponectin in autonomic centers of the hypothalamus (the paraventricular nucleus) and brainstem (the nucleus of the solitary tract) through examining molecular, electrical, hormonal and physiological consequences of peptidergic signalling. &#xD;
     RT-PCR and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrate the presence of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus. Investigation of the electrical consequences following receptor activation in the paraventricular nucleus indicates that magnocellular-oxytocin cells are homogeneously inhibited while magnocellular-vasopressin neurons display mixed responses. Single cell RT-PCR analysis shows oxytocin neurons express both receptors while vasopressin neurons express either both receptors or one receptor. Co-expressing oxytocin and vasopressin neurons express neither receptor and are not affected by adiponectin. Median eminence projecting corticotropin releasing hormone neurons, brainstem projecting oxytocin neurons, and thyrotropin releasing hormone neurons are all depolarized by adiponectin. Plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone concentration is increased following intracerebroventricular injections of adiponectin. &#xD;
     I demonstrate that the nucleus of the solitary tract, the primary cardiovascular regulation site of the medulla, expresses mRNA for AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 and mediates adiponectin induced hypotension. Adiponectin has electrical effects on a majority of medial solitary tract neurons and depolarizes those expressing mRNA for the hypotensive neuropeptide Y, revealing a central mechanism to modulate blood pressure. &#xD;
     Finally, I show that adiponectin controls paraventricular nucleus neuron excitability by either inhibiting a tetraethyl ammonium-sensitive potassium current thereby depolarizing neurons or activating a glibenclamide-sensitive voltage independent potassium current hyperpolarizing neurons. Therefore, adiponectin differentially modulates potassium current to confer its central effects. &#xD;
     These results are the first to show the physiological and electrical actions of adiponectin on individual neurons in blood brain barrier protected central autonomic nuclei. This thesis provides a framework for how adiponectin acts centrally to coordinate whole body energy homeostasis and feeding behavior in the rat.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Niagara Tunnel Project is a 10.4 km long water diversion tunnel being excavated under the city of Niagara Falls, Ontario by a 14.4 m diameter tunnel boring machine. This tunnel has descended through the entire stratigraphy of the Niagara Escarpment, including dolomites, limestones, sandstones, shales and interbedded zones of these rock types, passed under St. Davids Buried Gorge ascending to surface. Working at the tunnel provided an opportunity to assess and&#xD;
document the horizontally laminated ground behaviour for this large diameter circular tunnel and provided the backdrop for this study. A detailed understanding of the geological history was necessary.&#xD;
 Modelling of laminations, ranging between 0.16 to 16 m in thickness, was conducted to&#xD;
determine critical behaviour and cut-offs for failure modes. A critical normalized lamination thickness (thickness/radius) of 0.9 was found to exist, above which the excavation response is similar to the equivalent isotropic model, and below which the laminated behaviour corresponds&#xD;
to a characteristic failure mode controlled by bed deflections and bed parallel shear. Initially, as the normalized lamination thickness is decreased below 0.9, the stresses are channeled through&#xD;
the crown beam which concentrates the yield and increases the crown deflections. This results in crown beam failure. As the lamination thickness decreases, further the stresses are shed to multiple laminations increasing the displacements significantly and changing the shape and extent&#xD;
of the yield zone. From multiple lamination coupling to self-limiting yield the development of chimney style failure is controlled by the degree of tensile yielding. Tensile yielding first begins&#xD;
in the haunch area and progressively extends above the crown, as the lamination thickness&#xD;
decreases, until a self-limiting plastic yield zone shape is reached at normalized lamination thicknesses below 0.026. Incorporation of discrete anisotropy is necessary to accurately model&#xD;
the excavation response in horizontally laminated ground.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pre-deployment field testing in is the process of testing software to uncover unforeseen problems before it is released in the market.  It is commonly conducted by recruiting users to experiment with the software in as natural setting as possible.  Information regarding the software is then sent to the developers as logs.  Log data helps developers fix bugs and better understand the user behaviors so they can refine functionality to user needs.  More importantly, logs contain specific problems as well as call traces that can be used by developers to trace its origins.  However, developers focus their analysis on post-deployment data such as bug reports and CVS data to resolve problems, which has the disadvantage of releasing software before it can be optimized.  Therefore, more techniques are needed to harness field testing data to reduce post deployment problems.&#xD;
We propose techniques to process log data generated by users in order to resolve problems in the application before its deployment.  We introduce a metric system to predict the user perceived quality in software if it were to be released into market in its current state.  We also provide visualization techniques which can identify the state of problems and patterns of problem interaction with users that provide insight into solving the problems.  The visualization techniques can also be extended to determine the point of origin of a problem, to resolve it more efficiently.  Additionally, we devise a method to determine the priority of reported problems.&#xD;
The results generated from the case studies on mobile software applications.  The metric results showed a strong ability predict the number of reported bugs in the software after its release.  The visualization techniques uncovered problem patterns that provided insight to developers to the relationship between problems and users themselves.   Our analysis on the characteristics of problems determined the highest priority problems and their distribution among users.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>ABSTRACT&#xD;
     Learning through epiphanies, especially those not born out of dire crises, can be exciting, hugely satisfying, and life-validating ways to augment the significance of a lesson. In a moment of clarity, they have the ability to transform knowledge into wisdom, to provide a sense of interconnectedness within the grander scheme, and to contribute instant resolutions to persistent dilemmas seemingly irresolvable by less extraordinary means. This study involves a hermeneutic phenomenological investigation of epiphanies as they occur in lived experience. Its primary goal was to address the question, “What does it mean to have an epiphany?” Using data collected from 16 first-person, retroactive accounts of the experience, an analysis strategy using six spectra of contrasting dimensions was used to highlight the importance of the interplay between various characteristics of epiphanies. A significant finding of the study is that there is no such thing as an archetypical epiphany. Nevertheless, we can still recognize the phenomenon as a coherent entity mainly because there is agreement about many of its characteristics in the moment that it happens. Having an epiphany involves inductively rearranging patterns of deductively organized information with personally, and sometimes universally significant results. These may include dramatic shifts of perspectives, impulses that lead us to action on important matters, and occasionally whole-scale transformations of identity. Enhancing formal education settings to facilitate the experience can renew one’s passion for learning by making lessons more personally meaningful. In order to reap the benefits of the experience, we must hold space for the creative and introspective pursuits that allow them to happen. However, a challenge for facilitators of epiphanies involves learning how to direct the result of an epiphany to an intended outcome, such as a curricular goal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Strong group affiliations based on race have been found in children at a very young age (Aboud, 1988) and may lead to a higher risk of involvement in bullying for certain racial groups. Little research, however, has addressed the relationship among bullying, race, and immigrant status in a Canadian sample. As well, few studies have directly examined racial bullying and victimization. Thus, the two studies in the current project aim to examine race and immigrant status as individual risk factors for bullying involvement, while also examining the individual- and school-level factors associated with racial bullying. In Chapter Two, an empirical examination of the relationship among race, immigrant status, and bullying and victimization in adolescence reveals that racial minority adolescents experience racial bullying. Immigrant status, however, does not appear to predict victimization, but it may be a risk factor for bullying others. In Chapter Three, a multilevel investigation of racial bullying and victimization at the individual and school levels indicates that African-Canadian students are at risk of engaging in both racial bullying and victimization, and that being male is also associated with participation in this type of bullying. At the school level, school climate is not found to account for the differences in racial bullying and victimization across schools, but increased school support is associated with decreased racial bullying in schools with more teacher diversity. Together, the results of the current research clarify the roles of race and immigrant status in bullying and victimization, but these results also raise important concerns and further questions regarding possible interventions in schools for students who engage in racial bullying and racial victimization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: Exercise is a critical treatment modality in persons with Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), however people with this disease experience chronic fatigue and a decreased exercise capacity, which affects their ability or willingness to participate in physical activity.  Studies suggest that this exercise intolerance may be partly due to a reduced exercising muscle blood flow (MBF), and in particular to a reduced ability of red blood cells (RBCs) to evoke ATP-mediated vasodilation and an increase in MBF as they traverse areas of high O2 demand.  Additional evidence suggests that caffeine may attenuate this impairment by enhancing the release of ATP from RBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
HYPOTHESIS:  Persons with T2DM would have reduced Forearm Blood Flow (FBF), oxygen consumption (VO2), and exercise tolerance responses to exercise compared to control (CON) subjects, and caffeine would attenuate these impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
METHODS:  T2DM (n = 4) and CON (n = 4) participants performed rhythmic forearm handgrip exercise at an intensity equivalent to 17.5 kg until “task failure” or 20 minutes of exercise was reached, after having consumed either a caffeine (5mg/kg; Caff) or placebo (Pl) capsule.  FBF (Doppler and Echo ultrasound of the brachial artery), VO2 and lactate efflux (deep venous blood sampling), forearm vascular conductance (FVK), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were quantified for each minute of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
RESULTS:  Steady state FBF was similar across groups and treatment conditions (mean ± SE ml/min; CONCaff 553.80 ± 82.35, CONPl 583.42 ± 112.62, T2DMCaff 523.33 ± 105.39, T2DMPl 569.08 ± 134.20, NS), and this was due to similar MAP and FVK (across groups and treatment conditions, NS).  VO2 and Time to Task Failure (TTF) were not different between groups and treatment conditions (NS), although TTF tended to be improved with caffeine versus placebo (10.00 ± 2.02 vs 8.24 ± 1.79 min, P=0.295).  There was a strong positive relationship between FBF and TTF (r2=0.763; P=0.005).&#xD;
&#xD;
CONCLUSIONS:  In the exercise model utilized, persons with T2DM do not have impaired cardiovascular responsiveness or reduced exercise tolerance, and caffeine does not provide any benefit.  Differences in exercising MBF may be an underlying mechanism regarding differences in exercise tolerance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Common brown colour in natural diamond forms by plastic deformation during storage in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Dislocation movement generates vacancies, which aggregate into clusters of perhaps 30–60 vacancies. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) support such vacancy clusters as the cause of brown colour.&#xD;
&#xD;
Brief treatment in a high-pressure–high-temperature (HPHT) vessel at 1800–2700 °C can destroy the brown colour. There has been speculation that similar colour removal should occur continuously at depth in the SCLM. Diamonds are stored at 900–1400 °C in the SCLM, according to inclusion thermometry. The effect of temperature on the time required to destroy brown colour has been calculated from published data. The activation energy for the breakup of vacancy clusters is a critical component.&#xD;
&#xD;
The time required to destroy brown colour in the SCLM is significant at the scale of geological time. Brown diamonds should easily maintain their colour for millions of years during cooler mantle storage at or below about 1000 °C. Warmer temperatures toward the base of the lithosphere may be able to reduce or eliminate brown colour within thousands of years. The survival of brown colour in the lithospheric mantle does not require the colour to be formed late&#xD;
in the storage history nor does it require metastable storage in the graphite stability field.&#xD;
&#xD;
Crystal strain is preserved upon loss of brown colour during HPHT treatment. Inhomogeneous crystal strain was measured in 18 natural diamonds using micro-X-ray diffraction (μXRD) χ-dimension peak widths. There is a correlation between strain and depth of brown colour. None of the colourless diamonds examined have high strain, as should be expected for a&#xD;
diamond that has gained and lost brown colour. This suggests that removal of brown colour is not a common natural occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Infrared spectroscopy was used to determine nitrogen concentration and aggregation state&#xD;
in 60 natural diamonds. A loose association was found between brown colour and lower total nitrogen content. Within single diamonds, regions with less nitrogen tend to exhibit more anomalous birefringence due to strain. Colour zoned diamonds tend to have less nitrogen in the darker brown regions. This supports the hypothesis that diamonds with less nitrogen are more susceptible to plastic deformation and the development of brown colour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Phosphorylation of substrates by kinase proteins is one of the most prominent mechanisms by which signal transduction occurs and dysregulation of this activity is implicated as a major underlying cause of a number of diseases including cancer. Much of the current work focuses on developing inhibitors for various kinases in an effort to restore normal function in pathways where this deregulation occurs. However the vast majority of kinases remain uncharacterized and the roles they play in many of these signaling pathways are still unclear.  This study examines the role of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fer in two malignant cells lines, MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and PC3 (prostate cancer). Using a lentiviral based RNA interference approach, the level of Fer was reduced to 6% in MDA-MB-231 and 10% in PC3 cells relative to WT levels.  Fer knockdown correlated with enhanced migration in MDA-MB-231 cells, but impaired migration in PC3 cells, suggesting opposing roles for Fer in regulating migration in each cell type. Fer knockdown correlated with enhanced proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells, but was slightly reduced in the PC3 cells, again suggesting opposing roles for Fer in regulating proliferation between these two cell lines. In Fer knockdown PC3 cells, N-cadherin expression was increased, while E-cadherin levels were decreased; and in a fraction of cells E-cadherin relocalized from a predominantly intracellular vesicular compartment to a plasma membrane localization. In xenografting experiments, Fer knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells showed reduced tumor growth rates compared with tumors established with WT cells, suggesting that Fer may influence tumorgenesis on a tumor cell intrinsic basis. Separate xenografting studies showed that MDA-MB-231 derived tumors grew slower in fer-knockout compared to fer-wild type nude mice. This trend failed to show any statistical significance however it may still suggest an additional tumor promoting role for Fer in the stroma.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work is an example of a CFD-assisted design and characterization process for thermal energy storage vessels. A general modeling technique for future works is also proposed. The Short-Term Thermal Storage (STTS) tanks at the Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC) were used as the principal case study.&#xD;
The performance characterization of the STTS tanks and the evaluation of other tank designs were made under solar charging conditions and for the STTS “Hot Tank” only. Three sets of simulations were undertaken for each tank design, each representing a different state of inlet conditions reflected in the DLSC’s operational manual. Characterization of the STTS tanks was done mainly by applying a set of 2nd Law characterization indices, both existing and new, using exergy as the primary Figure of Merit. &#xD;
It was evident that significant mixing occurs in the current STTS tanks due to the ineffective placement of the inlet ports and the lack of an appropriate flow diffuser to prevent mixing. For example, at the end of the simulations exhibiting constant inlet temperature and flow rate, the total exergy in the original STTS tank was only 68% of a perfectly-stratified vessel. A modified design of the STTS tanks, which only shifted the position of the inlet port and center baffle, significantly improved this value to over 90%. Additional analysis also indicated that the STTS tanks would benefit from a simple flow distributor or inlet manifold that would address stratification issues inherent to variable temperature inlet conditions. However, further analysis on this particular design configuration is needed.&#xD;
The characterization methods employed in this work represent an effective means to differentiate between the stratification effectiveness of various thermal storage vessel designs. This work would further benefit from a future study that compares changes to the STTS tanks’ stratification efficiency with changes to the DLSC’s overall performance, including a cost-benefit analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Modern weapon-mounted technologies, such as novel sighting devices, detachable grenade launchers, and telescopic butt stocks, add considerable weight to weapons and alter the center of mass (COM).  Currently, few objective studies have investigated the effects of these alterations on soldiers’ rifle handling.  &#xD;
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of weight and weight distribution on upper extremity muscular fatigue during static rifle aiming.  Custom testing rigs were designed to allow the weight and COM of the in-service C7A2 assault rifle to be altered using supplementary weights and an adjustable rail system.  Seven rifle configurations, each of which represented the weight and COM of a potential future design, were assessed.  Soldiers performed static rifle holds with each of the rifle configurations.  Upper extremity muscle activity was monitored using surface electromyography (EMG) and a subjective scale of perceived exertion.  Dependent measures included muscular activity level (integrated EMG), rate of muscular fatigue (slope of the median power frequency), and subjective ratings of perceived exertion (Borg CR10 scale).  The body areas exhibiting the most muscular strain throughout testing were also subjectively assessed using a body map.  &#xD;
The results revealed that the muscle activation levels of the supporting arm were substantially greater (&gt;30% increase) when the COM was shifted forward 7cm.  This objective finding was supported by the soldiers’ subjective perceptions of muscle effort.  Conversely, muscle activity levels did not make evident the effects of added weight; although this may have been largely due to the fact that muscle activity from the lower back was not captured.  Rates of muscle fatigue were found to be greater in the anterior deltoid than other extremity muscles and fatigue levels were greater in the supporting arm than the trigger arm.  However, using rates of fatigue it was not possible to differentiate between weight conditions and COM positions.   Despite the limitations of this study, it has provided a starting point toward developing a standardized protocol for assessing muscular demands during rifle aiming.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Climate change has coincided with expansion of deciduous shrub species in the Arctic. Increased deciduous vegetation in the tundra could have profound implications on regional climate, carbon balance, and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients. Winter biological processes may be a mechanism explaining shrub expansion in the Arctic. Tall shrubs accumulate relatively deep snowcover, raising winter soil temperature minima, enhancing microbial activity and promoting nitrogen mobilization that may then be taken up by shrubs. However, it has yet to be determined if shrubs can acquire winter-mobilized nitrogen, and if so, whether they acquire it early in the spring, or over the growing season. The purpose of this study was to test if increased snow alone or the combination of vegetation-type and snow depth affect nitrogen cycling and plant uptake.  To test this, inorganic 15nitrogen tracer was added to control and experimentally deepened snow plots (using snowfences) in low birch hummock tundra, and to tall birch-dominated plots near Daring Lake, N.W.T. in the Canadian low Arctic.&#xD;
	The first study (Chapter 2) characterizes soil 15nitrogen cycling over a single winter to investigate if experimentally deepened snow in low birch hummock ecosystems enhances nutrient availability to plants in the early spring. In addition, 15nitrogen cycling in low birch hummock and tall birch ecosystems were compared to characterize the combined impacts of vegetation-type and snow depth on nutrient availability to plants by early spring. The second study (Chapter 3) investigated the longer term fate of added 15nitrogen to determine if 15nitrogen acquisition and allocation differs among plant species over a two year period. Together, the results indicate that nitrogen cycling in the low birch hummock tundra was not significantly affected by deeper snow over short (after one winter) or longer terms (two years). By contrast, nitrogen availability in early spring, and birch shrub 15nitrogen uptake after two years were enhanced in the tall birch as compared to the low birch hummock ecosystem. These results suggest that the combination of vegetation-type and snow depth effects in the tall birch ecosystem could be a mechanism contributing to tundra to shrubland transitions across the Arctic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) maintain vascular integrity by regulating the passage of solutes, macromolecules, and cells between the vascular and perivascular space and are critical in a wide number of physiological processes, such as the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to surrounding tissues, leukocyte trafficking, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. VEC permeability is regulated, at least in part, by VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions that coordinate inter-VEC contacts and communicate the strength of these interactions to the cell via the actin cytoskeleton. Although the ubiquitous second messenger, cyclic adenosine 3'€™, 5'€™-monophosphate (cAMP), has been shown to reduce VEC permeability, the molecular basis of this effect is currently unclear. Herein, we report that cAMP and its two effectors, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-II (PKA-II) and exchange protein activated by cAMP-1 (EPAC1), improve barrier function and differentially coordinate this effect through both VE-cadherin and actin cytoskeletal structures. We have also identified cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 as the major PDE regulating VEC barrier function. Through the use of cAMP-elevating agents and RNAi-mediated knockdown of PKA-Cα, EPAC1 and PDE4D, we have identified a dominant role for EPAC1 in VEC permeability as well as recognized PDE4D as a potential adaptor protein VE-cadherin-based complexes. Our results are consistent with previous reports of a role for both PKA and EPAC1 in controlling VE-cadherin mediated barrier function and additionally provide novel insight into the differential roles that PKA, EPAC1 and PDE4D play in stabilizing VEC barrier function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ca2+ dynamics affect many critical cellular processes. In the bag cell neurons of Aplysia californica, intracellular Ca2+ is elevated during a prolonged period of firing known as the afterdischarge. This consists of a fast and slow phase of firing, which triggers peptide secretion and culminates in egg-laying.  The present study examines how Ca2+ influx and release shape neurosecretion and membrane activity.  Using capacitance tracking as an index of secretion, a 5 Hz, 1 min train, to mimic the fast phase, induced a clear elevation in the membrane surface area of cultured bag cell neurons. The capacitance change was abolished by replacing external Ca2+ with Ba2+ or addition of the Ca2+ channel blocker, Ni2+.  Additionally, the response was reduced by either strong buffering of intracellular Ca2+ or pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, an alkylating agent that disrupts vesicular transport.  Depleting mitochondrial Ca2+ with the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP), also elevated capacitance, while depleting endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid, did not.  Similarly, FCCP alone depolarized bag cell neurons.  In a concentration-dependent manner, FCCP elicited an inward current that was insensitive to Ni2+, associated with an increase in conductance, and a linear current/voltage relationship that reversed around -40 mV.  Removal of extracellular Ca2+ reduced the current and left-shifted the reversal, consistent with opening a Ca2+-permeable, voltage-independent, non-selective cation channel.  The current was decreased when intracellular Ca2+ was strongly buffered, while fura-imaging demonstrated that FCCP elevated intracellular Ca2+ with a similar time course, suggesting a dependence on intracellular Ca2+.  Although both oligomycin A and bafilomycin A, inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP sythetase and V-type H+-ATPase, respectively, gradually increased Ca2+, neither produced a current.  The FCCP-induced Ca2+ elevation and the current were also diminished by disabling the mitochondrial permeability transition pore with N-ethylmaleimide.  The data suggests that a cation current is preferentially gated by Ca2+ released from the mitochondria, rather than disruption of ATP production. This current could provide depolarizing drive for the afterdischarge.  While Ca2+ entry appears to be responsible for initiating neurosecretion, mitochondrial Ca2+ may support prolonged peptide release during and subsequent to the afterdischarge.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Aspect-Oriented Requirement Engineering (AORE) is an emerging software engineering paradigm with increasing attention from academic as well as industrial communities. AORE aims at the systematic identification, modularization, composition and analysis of crosscutting concerns that manifest in requirements. It is believed that systematically managing crosscutting concerns early on at the requirement engineering stage can provide valuable insight at the architecture design and implementation stages and can help identify and thus manage crosscutting concerns at these stages. Moreover, identifying crosscutting concerns in requirements can help to reveal the scope of each concern in a software system, to detect potential conflicts between concerns and to facilitate trade-off negotiation early on. Hundreds of papers regarding AORE have been published in AORE communities. However, few of them address crosscutting concerns in real world requirements. Whether the proposed AORE approaches are productive when applied to real world requirements is unknown. In this thesis, we conduct an AORE case study consisting of an experiment using a real world software requirement specification in order to examine how crosscutting concerns present in real world requirement documents, explore the difference between crosscutting concerns in requirements and crosscutting concerns in code, and reason whether identifying and thus managing crosscutting concerns from real world requirements is a productive practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy disorder that affects roughly 5-7% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of both maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality.  With no present cure for the disease, researchers are interested in the lower incidence of PE observed among the cigarette smoking pregnant population.  However, women who use smokeless tobacco do not experience the same decreased incidence of PE, leading to hypothesis of protection against PE from the largest combustible product of cigarette smoke, carbon monoxide (CO). Studies evaluated levels of CO in PE women and found that they were statistically lower than those of healthy pregnancy. Researchers have found CO to possess many cytoprotective and regulatory properties and specifically within the placenta, it has been found to increase perfusion pressure, decrease oxidative stress, decreases ischemia/reperfusion induced apoptosis and maintain endothelial functioning.  The idea for use of CO as a possible therapeutic for PE has thus become a real possibility.  &#xD;
&#xD;
This study determined CO levels in pregnant women ± smoking as well as in PE women±smoking, as to discover a possible therapeutic range for future treatments.  The best correlated automated CO measurement device with blood CO levels was determined, for use in future clinical studies. This thesis also sought a possible CO delivery concentration, in order to achieve the CO levels observed in the human correlation study. A threshold level of maternal CO exposure in a murine animal model was found, for which fetal and maternal negative toxicities were not observed.  The results of this thesis lend a few more pieces to the complicated puzzle involving CO and PE and offer another step toward the possibility of a therapeutic treatment/prevention using this gaseous molecule.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Family physician (FP) knowledge regarding breast cancer risk assessment and prevention strategies such as chemoprevention are important in ensuring that women at high risk for breast cancer are identified and receive proper preventive care. There are many factors which can moderately increase a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer, such as short-term hormone replacement therapy use and being nulliparous over the age of 30 years. Some factors increase a woman’s risk to such an extent that she is deemed “high risk” for breast cancer development, including having a family history of breast cancer or having a personal history of atypical benign breast disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a stratified random sample of 2500 family physicians selected from across Canada to examine breast cancer risk assessment knowledge and practices, chemoprevention knowledge and prescribing practices, attitudes towards breast cancer chemoprevention, and barriers towards its utilization in Canadian FPs. We found that while the majority of physicians identified a woman with a family history of breast cancer (97%) as being high risk, a large proportion of physicians (40%) underestimated the risk associated with having a personal history of atypical benign breast disease. Physicians also tended to overestimate the risk associated with hormone replacement therapy use (70%) and the risk associated with nulliparity over the age of 30 years (50%). We also found that less than 15% of our sample had knowledge about chemoprevention and less than 7% had ever prescribed breast cancer chemoprevention (i.e. tamoxoifen or raloxifene) for primary prevention. Possible predictors of both knowledge of risk assessment and chemoprevention and prescription of chemoprevention were examined. Using multiple logistic regression, we found that several variables significantly predicted physician knowledge of these risk factors and prescription practices including patient load, medical experience and sex. The results of this study indicate that family physicians may need to become more aware about breast cancer prevention methods and risk factors for breast cancer, and in particular those that place a woman at high risk for breast cancer development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High plasma concentrations of Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) have been identified as a risk factor for a variety of atherogenic disorders such as cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary heart disease. Lp(a) consists of a lipoprotein moiety containing apolipoproteinB-100 (apoB-100), as well as apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), a unique glycoprotein to which the majority of Lp(a) functions are attributed. Variation in the number of identically repeated kringle IV type 2 (KIV2) motifs of apo(a) forms the molecular basis of Lp(a) isoform size heterogeneity, which is a hallmark of this lipoprotein. There is a general inverse correlation between apo(a) size and plasma Lp(a) concentrations, attributed in part to less efficient secretion of larger apo(a) isoforms from hepatic cells. The present study provides a preliminary investigation into processes involved in apo(a) secretion, with respect to isoform size, to understand this inverse correlation at a molecular level.  Pulse-chase experiments were performed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, both stably expressing differently-sized recombinant apo(a) isoforms representing the range of apo(a) sizes observed in the population. The folding kinetics for the different apo(a) isoforms were determined by changes in the mobility of the non-reduced radiolabelled species on SDS-PAGE gels. In HEK 293 cells, the rate at which apo(a) is folded correlated well with isoform size. In HepG2 cells, however, folding times were comparable regardless of isoform size. Apo(a) secretion from both cell lines exhibited size-dependency. Preliminary experimentation on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein modifications of apo(a) was performed, resulting in the identification of apo(a) interactions with PDI, Erp57, Calnexin, Grp78, Grp94, and EDEM. Preliminary experiments indicate a role for intracellular apo(a) degradation in the amount of apo(a) that is secreted from HepG2 cells, although an isoform size dependency of this degradation process cannot be established with current experimental data.  Further experimentation is required to confirm enzyme interactions with differently-sized apo(a) isoforms, to identify other chaperones involved in apo(a) secretion, and to confirm the role of proteasomes in intracellular apo(a) degradation. This may, in turn, provide information regarding the mechanism of how apo(a) secretion from hepatic cells is regulated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines Canada West’s colonial perceptions and reactions towards the Fenian Brotherhood in the Confederation era. Its focus is on the impact of the Fenians on the contemporary public mind, beginning in the fall of 1864 and culminating with the Fenian Raid on the Niagara frontier in June 1866. Newspapers, sermons, first-hand accounts, and popular poems and books from the time suggest the Fenians had a significant impact on the public mind by nurturing and reflecting the province’s social and defensive concerns, and the Raid on Canada West was used by contemporaries after the fact to promote Confederation and support a young Canadian identity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this study was to prepare biologically active insulin-loaded alginate microparticles by spray drying. Particles were produced from three alginate feed&#xD;
concentrations of 1, 1.5 and 2% w/v, with respective insulin loadings of 11.8, 7.8 and 5.8 mg/g of alginate and investigated in terms of mass yield, moisture content, particle size, morphology and encapsulation efficiency. The mass yield of the system was determined to be between 15 and 30%, with approximately 3% of the initial dry mass ending up in the exhaust filter. The moisture content of the particles was found to be between 4.9 and&#xD;
11.1% and the mean size ranged between 1.2 and 1.6 μm. Particulate morphologies were observed to be mostly spherical with some ‘divots’ present on the surface. Lastly, the encapsulation efficiency determined by absorbance assay was approximately 40%. Particles produced from a 2% alginate feed were further assayed by determining the release of insulin in simulated gastrointestinal conditions and looking at the insulin and&#xD;
alginate distribution within spray dried particles. A steep release profile was observed in the first 120 min of the simulation in a gastric pH of 1.2 and a longer, more sustained release is observed in intestinal conditions, where an additional 20% of the total insulin in&#xD;
the particles is released over 600 min. Fluorescent labels revealed that insulin and alginate are concentrated towards the periphery of the particles. The residual bioactivity of insulin was assessed by an in vitro bioactivity assay, which was developed using Fast&#xD;
Activated Cell Based ELISA (FACE™) AKT kits specific for phosphylated AKT. The bioactivity of insulin in the particles after spray drying was determined to be 87.9 ±&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: The primary purpose of this research was to determine whether women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) demonstrate pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength or endurance deficits and/or changes in the motor control patterns used during maximum voluntary PFM contractions (PFM MVCs) and coughing. A secondary purpose was to determine the effect of age on these parameters. Methods: After first validating the use of vaginal pressure to study the functional output of the PFMs, three studies were carried out to address these objectives. In two studies vaginal pressure and PFM and abdominal muscle electromyography (EMG) data were recorded simultaneously during PFM MVCs and maximum effort coughs in continent women, women with mild SUI and women with moderate to severe SUI in both supine and standing. In the final study, the effect of continence status and age on PFM strength and endurance was measured with vaginal pressure. Results: Changes in vaginal pressure induced by PFM MVCs and coughing were found to reflect changes in urethral pressure. The women with SUI and the continent women were found to be equally able to produce peak PFM EMG and vaginal pressure amplitudes during PFM MVCs and coughs. Compared to the continent women, the women with SUI delayed activating their abdominal muscles during the PFM MVCs. During coughing, vaginal pressure and PFM EMG peaked simultaneously in the continent women, while in the women with SUI vaginal pressure peaked after PFM EMG. During both the PFM MVCs and the coughs, the EMG activity in all of the muscles tested was higher at the onset of vaginal pressure generation in the women with SUI compared to the continent women. No difference was found in PFM endurance between the women with and without SUI. The ability to generate peak vaginal pressure during coughing decreased with age. Conclusions: PFM weakness does not appear to play a significant role in SUI. Rather, the results of this research suggest that a combination of motor control deficits and delays in pressure transmission are associated with SUI in women.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study is to experimentally and numerically investigate flame acceleration in an obstructed channel. The motivation for this research is for the development of Pulse Detonation Engines (PDEs), which are unsteady propulsion devices that utilize the detonative mode of combustion. A literature survey on flame acceleration in the context of PDEs is presented, which covers a wide range of combustion regimes including laminar combustion, turbulent combustion, and finally detonation. An overview of current numerical modeling strategies is also presented along with a selection of recent numerical studies focused on flame acceleration in obstructed channels. Experimentally, the effect of obstacle blockage ratio on flame acceleration was investigated in a modular channel. The channel had a square cross-section and obstacles were mounted onto the top and bottom surfaces. Schlieren images were used to study the flame shape and the centerline flame velocity. A novel visualization technique has been developed to study the unburned gas flow ahead of the flame front. Flame propagation at speeds above the speed of sound in the reactants was also studied as compression waves formed in the unburned gas. It was found that shock reflection from obstacle surfaces and subsequent flame interaction dominates flame acceleration at these higher flame speeds. The unburned gas flow field ahead of the flame front was simulated using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and was compared to the visualization technique developed experimentally. The detailed unsteady calculation was used to further study the development of recirculation zones behind the obstacle surfaces and the generation of turbulence in the shear layers. The unburned gas flow field was investigated to give insight into the speed and shape of the flame as it propagates into these regions.

      <dcterms:abstract>A study of gouges and dents in the context of pipelines has been completed, using the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques of magnetic flux leakage (MFL) and magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN).  The research is part of an ongoing effort by the Applied Magnetics Group (AMG) at Queen's University to improve the interpretation of the MFL signal, which is used extensively by industry for defect detection and evaluation.        &#xD;
        The gouges were found to have distinctive MFL signatures depending on their orientation relative to the magnetization axis.  Features in the MFL signal were identified as superpositions of geometry-related effects and strain or work hardening of the surface material.  A qualitative magnetic permeability distribution in the material near a gouge has been proposed.  The distribution is expected to vary in magnitude and extent according to the defect severity.        &#xD;
        The MFL results of the dent studies, on samples made available by Gaz de France (GdF), largely agreed qualitatively with previous research of dents.  However, the differences pointed to the need for study of more varied dent shapes; new signal features were observed that suggested tensile residual strain in the dent rim is more prominent than earlier studies and modeling have predicted.        &#xD;
        Additionally, upgrades made to the MFL scanning system used by the AMG and a novel approach for building computer models are detailed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is intended as a critique of Will Kymlicka’s groundbreaking and elegant defense of a liberal theory of minority rights.  It argues that although Kymlicka has succeeded in showing that a minority nation may seek and exercise minority rights while still respecting, and even furthering, the ability of its members to live autonomously, Kymlicka is mistaken when he contends that liberalism’s commitment to individual autonomy requires the liberal democratic state to provide minority nations with the self-government and language rights necessary to allow them to sustain their “societal cultures.”  &#xD;
     Specifically, it is argued that Kymlicka’s autonomy-based argument for according self-government and language rights to national minorities fails to pay sufficient regard to both the fact that the personal costs associated with leaving one’s culture will vary depending on the individual and the cultures involved, and the fact that some national minorities, in order to sustain themselves as distinct societal cultures, will require not only external protections from the actions of the cultural majority, but also the ability to impose liberty-infringing preservationist measures against their own members.  Further, since, as I argue, individual autonomy does not actually require that one has continued access to one’s societal culture, it is suggested that both granting and refusing a minority nation the means to sustain its societal culture could be in keeping with a liberal conception of justice, depending on the particular circumstances of the groups at issue. Consequently, the thesis concludes that the question of how to accommodate national minorities should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Oort Cloud (OC) is a roughly spherical cloud of comets surrounding the&#xD;
solar system, stretching from well beyond the orbit of Neptune, half way to the&#xD;
nearest star. This body of comets is interesting because it contains a record of the&#xD;
gravitational perturbations suffered by the solar system over its&#xD;
lifetime. Here, we investigate the effects of a particular class of&#xD;
perturbing objects - enormous complexes of molecular gas called giant&#xD;
molecular clouds (GMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
Recent evidence has shown that the classical picture of Oort Cloud&#xD;
formation is inadequate to describe certain properties of the OC. To&#xD;
re-investigate the dynamical evolution of the Oort Cloud,&#xD;
we simulate the Sun's emergence from its natal&#xD;
molecular cloud, and its subsequent encounters with GMCs. While the&#xD;
role of giant molecular clouds in OC formation has&#xD;
been explored before, they have been implemented in a general&#xD;
way, not explicitly taking into account the 3D structure of the&#xD;
cloud. In this research, we draw on an extensive body of evidence which suggests&#xD;
that GMCs are not uniform, diffuse objects, but are instead organized&#xD;
into high density clumps, connected by a very diffuse inter-clump&#xD;
medium. Recent research has shown that GMCs are likely to be fractal&#xD;
in nature, and so we have modeled them as fractal distributions&#xD;
with dimension 1.6. We then perform N-body simulations of the passage&#xD;
of the Sun and its Oort Cloud through such a&#xD;
molecular cloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
We find that the fractal structure of the GMC is, in fact,&#xD;
an important parameter in the magnitude of the cometary energy&#xD;
change. The significant energy changes occur as a result of&#xD;
interactions with the GMC substructure, not simply as a result of its&#xD;
overall density distribution. We find that interactions with GMCs can&#xD;
be quite destructive to the OC, but can also serve to move comets from&#xD;
tightly bound orbits to less tightly bound orbits, thus partially&#xD;
replacing those lost to stripping. Simulations of the Sun's relatively&#xD;
slow exit&#xD;
from its birth GMC paint a picture of a potentially very destructive&#xD;
era, in which a large portion of the OC's evolution may have occured.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Primary health care reform is currently underway in Ontario with the goals of improving health care access, quality and continuity of care while increasing patient and provider satisfaction and cost effectiveness. Interprofessional collaboration in the provision of primary health care has been widely espoused in the health care literature as a means of achieving the goals of primary health care reform. Primary health care nurse practitioners in collaboration with physicians and other allied health professionals have a fundamental role in enhancing primary health care in Ontario. &#xD;
The purpose of this study was to explore and describe nurse practitioners’ experiences and perceptions of interprofessional collaboration with physicians in the provision of primary health care in Ontario. A qualitative descriptive study design was used and six nurse practitioners working in a variety of primary health care settings in Ontario were purposively sampled and interviewed regarding their experiences and perceptions of interprofessional collaboration with partnering physicians.  Interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis techniques and themes were identified.&#xD;
Seven themes were identified as key factors influencing collaboration within the nurse practitioner – physician dyad from the nurse practitioner’s perspective.  These themes included: quality of communication, complementary vision, physician remuneration methods, establishing and maintaining relationships, investing time and energy, nurse practitioner competency and expertise and mutual trust and respect. A model of nurse practitioner – physician interprofessional collaboration is used to organize the themes identified.&#xD;
The findings of this study support current recommendations for joint education initiatives for health care professionals and practice initiatives aimed at improving collaboration between partnering nurse practitioners and physicians.  Areas for future research include incorporating the client’s experiences and perceptions within collaborative practice as well as developing and evaluating interventions that strengthen collaboration within the health care team</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With particular focus on the processes of rewriting and adaptation of works by Marguerite Duras, this study will examine the generic, stylistic, and thematic differences between the novel Un Barrage contre le Pacifique (The Sea Wall) and the play adapted from that novel, L'Eden Cinéma (Eden Cinema). &#xD;
The transition from narrative to drama first of all implies formal changes, but we will see that with Marguerite Duras, the texts are often hybrid, thereby minimizing the generic differences between the novel and the theatrical adaptation and accentuating their similarities. In terms of style, we can perceive a more feminine tendency ; however it is especially at the thematic level that we find significant differences, whether because of a change in family relationships which seem to undergo a healing process, or because of Suzanne, the main character’s gradual emancipation.&#xD;
Thanks to the use of comparisons, analyses and hypotheses already published by Duras’ literary critics, we will not only compare these two works but we will also see under what circumstances these hypotheses are applicable to our own corpus. We will analyze the relationships between the characters, taking into account their alienation and submission, their contradictory feelings of love and hatred, and escalating tensions between them with the goal of determining the link between the generic and thematic changes between the two texts. Ultimately, we will ask ourselves if it is through the rewriting of her own family narrative that the author can not only emancipate herself but also represent herself in her text.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis will look at the depiction of the Achilles and Troilos death myth on the Attic Black-Figure “Tyrrhenian” Group and its possible influence in Etruria from the mid 6th century BC to the Hellenistic period.  The appearance of this Attic-made export ware in Etruscan sites of the 6th century BC, distribution of extant group pots with known provenance along with the emulation of the “Tyrrhenian” neck-amphora style and narrative frieze content in mid to late 6th century BC Etruscan pottery supports evidence for the popularity of the group amongst the Etruscan population.   I will approach my investigation in Chapter Three by first giving an overview of the construction and decoration of the Attic-made “Tyrrhenian” Group and listing the variety of traits that characterize this group as being a true case of Athenian export product to Etruria.&#xD;
In Chapter Four I will focus on the appearance of the Achilles and Troilos myth on pots of the “Tyrrhenian” Group and trace the development of the myth’s iconography in Greek art starting in the mid 7th century BC.  In Chapter Five I will focus on the appearance of the myth in Etruscan art in the mid 6th century BC and its subsequent development in Etruscan mythology through the analysis of Etruscan-made specimens.  I will also attempt to give a reasoning behind the Etruscans’ adaptation of the Greek myth into their corpus.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Recent research indicates that inadequate vitamin D status may incur increased cancer risk, particularly for breast and colon cancer. Cutaneous generation of vitamin D through direct absorption of summer sunlight is considered the principal source of vitamin D; however, at latitudes above 40ºN, UVB rays are insufficient to permit cutaneous synthesis during winter. Vitamin D can also be obtained from natural and fortified dietary sources and through supplement use, although dietary reference intake values do not seem to compensate for restricted cutaneous synthesis in winter.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: To determine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency post-winter and post-summer, to determine the seasonal variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, and to investigate determinants of 25(OH)D concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: A cross-sectional study of vitamin D status post-winter and post-summer was conducted among 49 premenopausal rotating shift nurses at Kingston General Hospital. In each season, vitamin D levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay to quantify serum 25(OH)D from fasting blood samples, and personal, lifestyle, and dietary factors potentially influencing vitamin D levels were assessed from a self-report questionnaire. Nurses were classified as vitamin D sufficient (&gt;30ng/mL) or insufficient (≤30ng/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: A statistically significant difference was found between mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations post-winter (32.6ng/mL) and post-summer (42.5ng/mL) (p=0.0003). The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency post-winter was 49% compared to 24% post-summer p=0.02). Tanning bed use was associated with significantly higher winter serum 25(OH)D levels was tanning bed, while controlling for age, BMI, and vitamin D-fortified yogurt consumption (R2=0.41, p=0.007). For summer, predictors of higher serum 25(OH)D levels were supplement use and tanning bed use in the past six months, while controlling for age, BMI, and beef/veal consumption (R2=0.53, p=0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency was prevalent both post-winter and post-summer, but with much higher prevalence post-winter. Controlling for age and BMI, tanning bed use was a determinant of serum 25(OH)D concentrations in both seasons, while fortified yogurt consumption also contributed in winter, and beef/veal consumption and supplement use contributed in summer. These findings support the need to improve vitamin D status among this population, and to increase the dietary reference intake values and supplement recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examines ecotourism as a form of sustainable development in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Tourism is one of the world’s largest industries, with ecotourism being one of the fastest growing sectors. Ecotourism can provide a superior and sustainable alternative to traditional, resource dependent industries that are prevalent in developing countries. This research offers a multi-disciplinary perspective incorporating economic, environmental and social issues surrounding the implementation of an ecotourism industry. A  framework for sustainable ecotourism development is created  using indicators developed by the World Tourism Organization. This framework is  applied to three case studies within the Eastern Cape. The case studies demonstrate both common and uniqe opportunities and challeges for ecotourism development throughout the Eastern Cape. The end result of this project is to create a better understanding of the tourism-environment relationship, and to explore how ecotourism, and more specifically backpacking, can contribute to sustainable development. This study contributes to the literature on the use of indicators in ecotourism. A framework of indicators for sustainable ecotourism represents the final product of this research. This framework can be used by local governments and organizations to aid in the planning and management of ecotourism both in South Africa and other developing nations, and lead to improvements in both the physical and social environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis was to synthesize N2-modified guanosines (N2G) in order to introduce fluorescent and chelating ligands, such as diphenylamino, 2,2’-dipridylamino, 2-(2’-pyridyl)benzimidazolyl and p-pyrenylphenyl functionalities. Their photophysical properties were examined in order to gain further knowledge about the effect of guanine modification on its electronic structure.&#xD;
The impact of N2-modification was first studied in terms of self-assembly of the luminescent guanosines in solution and gas phase. Extensive NMR and ESI MS studies provided evidence that these N2-modified guanosines self-assemble exclusively into octamers with high-fidelity, in the presence of Group 1 and Group 2 metal ions. In addition, the first example of “empty” G-octamer (free of metal cations) was identified by ESI MS. Experimental results suggested that N2-substituents provide additional electronic and steric effects which drive the diastereoselectivity of self-assembly and provide additional stability.&#xD;
Hydrogen bonding of N2Gs with cytidine was monitored using fluorescence and NMR. In addition to GC base pair formation, the G-quartet-to-GC base pair structural transformation was studied using CD, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy.&#xD;
Due to the luminescent and chelating nature of some of the N2G derivatives, their interactions with a number of metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, La3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions, were probed by using various spectroscopic methods. The overall optical response in the presence of metal ions was highly dependent on the nature of N2-substituent, and it varied from “turn-on” to “turn-off” response, clearly indicating that the modification at the N2-site of guanosine can be used to finely tune the optical response of these nucleosides. Finally, synthesis of a phosphorescent N2-arylguanosine containing the Ru2+ metal center was achieved and its photophysical and electrochemical properties were examined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that elevated plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentrations are a significant risk factor for the development of a number of vascular diseases including coronary heart disease and stroke. Lp(a) consists of a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like moiety and an unique glycoprotein, apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), that is covalently attached to the apolipoproteinB-100 (apoB-100) component of LDL by a single disulfide bond. Many studies have suggested a role for Lp(a) in the process of endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, Lp(a) has been shown to increase both the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (EC), as well as monocyte and leukocyte chemotactic activity in these cells. We have previously demonstrated that Lp(a), through its apo(a) moiety, increases actomyosin-driven EC contraction which, as a consequence, increases EC permeability. In this thesis, we have demonstrated a role for the strong lysine-binding site in the kringle IV type 10 domain of apo(a) in increasing EC permeability, which occurs through a Rho/Rho kinase-dependent pathway. We have further validated these findings using mouse mesenteric arteries in a pressure myograph system. We also have dissected another major signaling pathway initiated by apo(a) that involves in a disruption of adherens junctions in EC. In this pathway, apo(a)/Lp(a) activates the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β-dependent pathway to facilitate nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. In the nucleus beta-catenin induced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from the EC. Finally, we have presented data to suggest a novel inflammatory role for apo(a) in which it induces the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB through promotion of the dissociation of IkappaB from the inactive cytoplasmic complex; this allows the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB with attendant effects on the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Taken together, our findings may facilitate the development of new drug targets for mitigating the harmful effects of Lp(a) on vascular EC which corresponds to an early step in the process of atherogenesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bullying is a pervasive problem in schools, but more recent attention has been given to bullying that takes place via electronic media. To study electronic bullying and aggression effectively research needs to consider the unique qualities of the electronic medium including its capacity for anonymity, disinhibition, public forum, and under-regulated content. Electronic bullying does not occur in isolation; therefore it must be studied in relation to peer processes that occur in the “real world.” Research has neither uncovered the potential “real world” precursors of electronic bullying and aggression nor has it uncovered how students perceive the harmfulness of electronic aggression. The two studies presented here fill these gaps in the literature.&#xD;
The first study examined the precursors of electronic bullying and victimization in a sample of grade 9 and 10 students who were followed longitudinally. Students were administered questionnaires assessing electronic bullying/victimization, perceived harm of electronic aggression, empathy, normative beliefs, and prosocial behavior. The results indicated that “real world” behaviors such as verbal bullying and prosocial behavior were precursors of electronic bullying, while victimization by social bullying and social aggression were precursors for electronic victimization. In addition, females, older students, and students with less prosocial behavior were at risk for involvement in electronic bullying. Implications for these findings include the importance of integrating interventions that foster positive behavior in the “real world” and online, particularly for students at highest risk for involvement. &#xD;
&#xD;
The second study examined students’ harm perceptions of electronic aggression and how similar behavioral and cognitive factors may also influence perceptions of electronic aggression. Cross-sectional data were collected from students in grades 7 through 9 who were administered the same questionnaires above. Electronic bullying was perceived as more harmful than physical and social aggression, particularly for girls and students with highly prosocial behavior. Thus, electronic aggression is a very serious issue for students and education is needed to change the social norms for acceptable behavior in cyberspace. Consistent with social-cognitive theory, similar demographics and behaviors predicted electronic behavior and perceptions. Future research should continue to extend the social-cognitive model to electronic conflict.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work presents the calibration of the energy response of the Sudbury Neutrino&#xD;
Observatory (SNO). The development of the energy response processor RSP and its&#xD;
use in setting the energy scale of SNO and reconstructing the energy&#xD;
of neutrino-like events is presented for each of the three phases of SNO: the pure&#xD;
heavy water phase, the salt phase, and the neutral current detector (NCD) phase. A 16N calibration&#xD;
source, producing mainly 6.13 MeV γ-rays, is the primary energy calibration source.&#xD;
It is used to set the energy scale of the detector and to test for errors in the energy&#xD;
calibration and reconstruction process. The errors associated with energy reconstruction in the pure heavy water and salt phase data, that is to be used in a low energy threshold&#xD;
solar 8B neutrino analysis, are derived for the RSP energy response processor and&#xD;
shown to be in agreement with other analyses. The largest of the errors, that associated with using the 16N source to set the energy scale of the detector, is improved&#xD;
through a detailed and thorough analysis.&#xD;
    The calibration of the energy scale of the photomultiplier tube array in the third&#xD;
phase, with an array of 3He proportional counters (NCDs) distributed within the heavy water, is presented. The event energy reconstruction errors in the NCD phase are reassessed&#xD;
with more precise measurements and shown to be in agreement with the conservative&#xD;
estimates used in the analysis SNO presented in 2008. The implications of the improvements in the&#xD;
error are assessed and the solar 8B neutrino fluxes—charged current (CC), elastic&#xD;
scattering (ES), and neutral current (NC)—are determined to be:&#xD;
                                   φCC = 1.68+0.09−0.07,&#xD;
                                   φES = 1.79+0.25-0.22, and&#xD;
                                   φNC = 5.52+0.48-0.45,&#xD;
in units of 10^6/cm^2/s. The errors quoted are the combined statistical and systematic&#xD;
uncertainties. These results are in good agreement with the results published by SNO in 2008 with a modest improvement in the CC measurement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this investigation was to assess the between-day reliability of selected force-time curve indices and the activity onset of selected neck muscles in the performance of maximal, isometric contractions in five different directions. The measures extracted are deemed important for future investigations aimed at exploring the role of cervical musculature in reduction of concussion occurrences in sports.&#xD;
Twenty eight physically active male participants performed two testing sessions separated by 7-8 days. In each testing session, force and surface electromyography (EMG) data were recorded simultaneously in a custom-made testing apparatus whilst subjects performed four randomized maximal isometric efforts in extension, flexion, and left and right lateral bending and protraction.  The variables examined were the peak force, rate of force development (RFD), time to 50% of peak force and bilateral activity onset of the splenius capitis, upper trapezius, and sternocleidomastoid. For all variables, reliability was assessed by: 1) difference scores between the testing sessions and corresponding 95% confidence intervals; 2) standard error of measurement (SEM), expressed in either the original units of measurement, or as a coefficient of variation; and, 3) Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The results indicated that for all variables, in all testing directions, no differences in scores were observed between the first and second testing sessions. The precision of measurement for all measures, barring muscle onsets obtained in protraction, was deemed acceptable for future clinical application. ICC score ranges for force-time curve-based measurements were high (&lt; 0.90), while for muscle onsets, the ICC ranges are low to moderate (0.23 -0.79). &#xD;
Based on these results, it was concluded that, in highly active male participants, a dedicated familiarization session for the elimination of potential learning effects is not required. In addition, for the majority of testing directions, the force-time curve-based variables as well as muscle activity onsets are recorded with a sufficiently high level of precision, which make them prime candidates for utilization in future investigations concerned with quantitative assessment of cervical musculature function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In light of the recognition of continuing Indigenous sovereignty by the Supreme Court of Canada and the requirement that that sovereignty and de facto Crown sovereignty be reconciled within a shared constitutional order, Canada needs a new approach to negotiating the exercise of Indigenous sovereignty.  Any new approach must be built around a coherent understanding of the Constitution as a whole, most importantly the constitutional principle of reconciliation and the other unwritten principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Reference re. Secession of Quebec.  &#xD;
The four unwritten principles which the Supreme Court of Canada identified in the Quebec Secession Reference do not represent a barrier to the exercise of Indigenous sovereignty, if interpreted in light of the reconciliation principle.  Indeed, the principles of federalism and the protection of minorities support the protection of distinct Indigenous political and legal institutions.  Because they are exercising a continuing sovereignty, rather than an aboriginal right as that term is currently understood under section 35, Indigenous peoples also need not return to traditional forms of governance in their entirety in a modern self-government regime; they may also adopt more or less of the Euro-Canadian forms with which they have become familiar as citizens of Canada, such that modern Indigenous institutions could be quite consistent with mainstream understandings of the four unwritten principles of the Constitutions.&#xD;
As with other institutions of governance, Indigenous peoples have long traditions of dispute resolution that they could draw upon in the context of the modern exercise of their sovereignty.  Nor do Indigenous peoples need to return to these traditional methods in their entirety, either; again, they could adopt elements of Euro-Canadian legal traditions.  There are numerous precedents around the world for Indigenous legal institutions that combine elements of Indigenous customs of dispute resolution and common-law judicial structures.  What is important is that Indigenous peoples have the right to design their own institutions for the interpretation, as well as the creation, of law and the resolution of disputes if they are to exercise their sovereignty within the Canadian constitutional and political system as a third order of government.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>RET is a transmembrane receptor that is implicated in a variety of processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, and death. One of the proteins that is activated downstream of RET is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), BetaPIX. BetaPIX removes GDP bound to inactive Cdc42/Rac, freeing a space for GTP-binding and transformation of Cdc42/Rac to the active GTPase state. BetaPIX is vital in cytoskeletal rearrangements and the regulation of focal adhesion complex assembly and disassembly. Although our lab has previously shown that RET and BetaPIX do not directly interact, the mechanism through which BetaPIX is activated downstream of RET is not yet known.&#xD;
	In the current study, we confirmed that RET activation mediates BetaPIX phosphorylation. We showed that mutations in the SH3 and Dbl-homology domains of BetaPIX result in slower rates and in some cases impairment of wound healing and cell migration downstream of RET, indicating a role for BetaPIX in RET-mediated cell migration. In contrast, we have shown that GTPase mutants of Cdc42 and Rac were not sufficient to impair wound healing, but did result in less cell migration. This suggests that similar, yet distinct roles exist for Cdc42 and Rac in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. We have shown that SH3 and Dbl-homology domain mutations in BetaPIX result in changes in cell morphology, suggesting a role of BetaPIX in the development of cell extensions downstream of RET. Alternatively, we have shown that GTPase mutants of Cdc42 or Rac alone do not induce cell morphology changes, further emphasizing the similar, yet distinct roles for Cdc42 and Rac in RET-mediated cell migration. Lastly, we have shown that BetaPIX is re-localized from the focal adhesion to the cytoplasm upon RET activation, suggesting that following focal adhesion complex formation, BetaPIX may be recycled.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Current trends in education and school architecture reflect a growing awareness of the interconnectedness of people and spaces. Spaces acquire meaning through the experiences of those who use them and can contribute to the development of a sense of place. Purpose-built schools have long been valued and built in Iceland. The broad purpose of this study was to explore Icelandic students’ perceptions of their purpose-built school. Specific research questions included: (a) What spaces in purpose-built schools are important to students? (b) What happens in these spaces? (c) What meaning, if any, do these identified spaces hold for students? and (d) In ascribing meaning to some of the identified spaces, do students develop a sense of place? This phenomenological research initiative used an emergent design methodology. Seven Grade 9 and three Grade 10 students were recruited for this study. Primary data sources included students’ photographs of important school spaces, individual photo-elicitation interviews, and walking tours. Participants identified 25 important school spaces and 7 issues of concern within these spaces. Further analysis examined participants’ complex construction of importance and meaning. Participants described that school spaces were more likely to become meaningful places, when the design of the educational facility was in harmony with students’ experiences. The results of this study should raise awareness of the importance of building such schools in Canada and encourage the inclusion of students’ unique perspectives in the design of future schools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Coordinated gaze and hand movements predominate a number of our interactions in reachable space and yet few studies examine the potential contribution of tactile feedback in planning these actions. This thesis was designed to investigate eye and hand coordination during movement sequences when reaching out to interact with objects. We developed a virtual reality paradigm that allowed us to control visual, tactile, and in some cases, auditory feedback provided to participants. Participants reached and touched five objects in succession. We measured behaviour that resulted from removing one or more of the aforementioned sources of feedback – focusing on task accuracy, and the timing and dynamics of eye and hand movements. Our principle manipulations were to remove visual feedback of the hand, and/or to change the object response to contact. We also unexpectedly removed tactile feedback signaling contact. In Experiment 1, we examined gaze and hand movement timing relative to contact events. Gaze remained long enough to capture contact in central vision, but also followed a time course indicating that contact timing was predicted. In Experiment 2 we examined the influence of dynamic object consequences (i.e., motion). Gaze remained to monitor consequences that follow initial contact especially when the hand was invisible; with longer delays it became difficult to differentiate between predictive or reactive movements. In Experiment 3 we directly tested whether gaze would hold upon a site of action during prolonged manipulation. Here, gaze remained past contact time and instead its departure was associated with the completion of action. Our findings are congruent with the notion that visually guided reaches are controlled to facilitate directing the hand to viewed locations of action – without visual feedback of the hand accuracy diminished and hand approach changed across all experiments. However, we provide consistent evidence that gaze is also controlled to capture planned sensory consequences related to action at its viewed location. Monitoring these sites would facilitate comparing predicted sensory events with those that are actively measured and improve control throughout the movement sequence. Such a process also indicates the importance of considering tactile feedback when examining coordinated eye and hand movements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Evidence is accumulating that the imposed lifestyle associated with shift-work can adversely affect many aspects of nurses’ mental health.  The 2005 National Survey of the Work and Health of Nurses stated depression is more common in nurses than in the general population.  Minimal research has focused on depression as a direct outcome of shift-work for registered nurses. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shift-work and depressive symptoms in female nurses.   This study was a discrete analysis of data collected from 151 registered nurses enrolled in the primary study entitled “Work and health: Optimizing nurses’ physical health in hospital work environments” (Tranmer, McGillis-Hall, Katzmarzyk, Parry, et al,  2007).  A descriptive correlational design was utilized to describe the relationships between shift-work and depressive symptoms.  Shift work was categorized as participants working 8 hours, 12 hours, or a combination of both 8 and 12 hour shifts. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).   Bivariate analysis showed no statistical significant correlations between CES-D scores and shift-work.  However, correlational analysis between individual CES-D questions showed a positive association between shift-work and lack of concentration, decreased motivation to complete tasks, feeling depressed and difficulty sleeping as adverse effects.  Fifty-two percent of these shift workers identified problems with keeping focus on the tasks they were performing, 40% described an alteration in motivation, 31% felt depressed and 69% reported sleep disturbances. This study found no direct association between shift-work and depression but found that individual symptoms of depression were related to the shift-work schedule.  Studies addressing the effects of shift-work on mental health need to explore options to decrease depressive symptoms, such as impaired cognition and motivation, that were shown to impact upon the worker’s quality of life and quality of care provided.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the representation of Heimat in contemporary German novels and films by authors and directors born in the 1960s and 1970s within the context of globalisation. The following texts and films are examined: Hierankl (2003) and Winterreise (2006) by Hans Steinbichler, Wer früher stirbt, ist länger tot (2006) and Beste Gegend (2008) by Marcus H. Rosenmüller, Der Geschmack von Apfelkernen (2008) by Katharina Hagena, Klausen (2002) by Andreas Maier, and Usambara (2007) by Christof Hamann. I argue that the static notion of the concept of Heimat and concomitant concepts of identity are challenged by these authors and filmmakers as they pit them against the cultural, political, and social changes brought on by globalisation with its altered notions of identity. Within German political and public discourse, globalisation is often presented as a foreign concept threatening German institutions, customs, and even national identity itself. The dynamics between dwelling and travel/movement are at the centre of the films and novels under discussion. Each of the four chapters focuses on one of the major topics of current literary discourses of Heimat and globalisation: changing images and roles of women in general and mothers in particular; the house, which has often been fundamental in representations of Heimat, as the site at which patriarchal norms and values are being renegotiated; nature and environment as sites of threatened Heimat within the context of Heimat, tourism, and Umweltschutz; and Africa as other Heimat, threatened by, yet relatively untouched by globalisation. In their exploration of notions of Heimat, all of the texts and films discussed in this thesis self-consciously refer to the texts and films of the Heimat and the anti-Heimat genre respectively. But far from focusing on the tainted notion of Heimat within the German historical and political context, as did the generation of 1968 in their films and texts, the new generation of writers and filmmakers marks notions of Heimat much more positively and appropriates them for its own purposes. Nostalgia, irony, and ambivalence are the major characteristics of the new “Heimatroman” and “Heimatfilm.”</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The past decade has seen a tremendous growth in the amount of biomedical literature, specifically in the area of bioinformatics. As a result, biomedical text categorization has become a central task for providing researchers with literature appropriate for their specific information needs. &#xD;
&#xD;
Pan et al. have explored a method that automatically identifies information-bearing sentence fragments within scientific text. Their proposed method aims to automatically classify sentence fragments into certain sets of categories defined to satisfy specific types of information needs. The categories are grouped into five different dimensions known as Focus, Polarity, Certainty, Evidence, and Trend. The reason that fragments are used as the unit of classification is that the class value along each of these dimensions can change mid-sentence.&#xD;
&#xD;
In order to automatically annotate sentence fragments along the five dimensions, automatically breaking sentences into fragments is a necessary step. The performance of the classifier depends on the sentence fragments. In this study, we investigate the problem of automatic fragmentation of biomedical sentences, which is a fundamental layer in the multi-dimensional fragment classification. In addition, we believe that our proposed fragmentation algorithm can be used in other domains such as sentiment analysis. The goal of sentiment analysis is often to classify the polarity (positive or negative) of a given text. Sentiment classification can be conducted at different levels such as document, sentence, or phrase (fragment) level. Our proposed fragmentation algorithm can be used as a prerequisite for phrase-level sentiment categorization which aims to automatically capture multiple sentiments within a sentence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chirality can be induced in achiral solvent molecules located near a chiral molecule or surface, but there have been very few systematic studies in this field either experimentally or theoretically.  The focus of this thesis is to study the chirality transfer from chiral molecules to achiral solvents.&#xD;
&#xD;
To capture the chirality transfer in solvent molecules, a solvent model that is sensitive to the changes in the environment is needed.  We developed new polarizable and flexible models based on an extensive series of ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The models include electric field dependence in both the atomic charges and the intramolecular degrees of freedom.  Modified equations of motion are required and we have implemented a multiple time step algorithm to solve these equations.  Our methodology is general and has been applied to ethanol as a test.  For other solvents in our simulations, such as 2-propanol, limited models are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
The chirality transfer from chiral solutes to achiral solvents and its dependence on the solute and solvent characteristics are then explored using the new polarizable models in molecular dynamics simulations.  The chirality induced in the solvent is assessed based on a series of related chirality indexes originally proposed by Osipov[Osipov et al., Mol. Phys.84, 1193(1995)].  Two solvents are considered: Ethanol and benzyl alcohol.  The solvation of three chiral solutes is examined: Styrene oxide, acenaphthenol, and n-(1-(4-bromophenyl)ethyl)pivalamide (PAMD).  All three solutes have the possibility of hydrogen-bonding with the solvent, the last two may also form π-π interactions, and the last has multiple hydrogen bonding sites. &#xD;
&#xD;
The chirality transfer from chiral surfaces to achiral solvents is also explored.  Emphasis is placed on the extent of this chirality transfer and its dependence on the surface and solvent characteristics is explored.  Three surfaces employed in chiral chromatography are examined:  The Whelk-O1 interface; a phenylglycine-derived chiral stationary phase (CSP); and a leucine-derived CSP.  The solvents consist of ethanol, a binary n-hexane/ethanol solvent, 2-propanol, and a binary n-hexane/2-propanol solvent.  Molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated chiral interfaces form the basis of the analysis and position dependent chirality indexes are analyzed in detail.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zircaloy-2 is used extensively in the nuclear industry as a structural material for the reactor core in both light and heavy water reactors.  The intergranular strains and texture greatly affect the mechanical properties of the material while in operation.  Understanding the plastic deformation of Zircaloy-2 will improve on current plastic deformation models, particularly for twinning mechanisms, which are more active at lower temperatures, and are not yet well understood.  For this study, neutron diffraction was used to track the lattice spacing and peak intensity in warm-rolled and recrystallized Zircaloy-2 slab for various crystallographic orientations at 77 K.  Tests were performed in all three principle directions under tension and compression.  The texture was measured for the deformed samples to help interpret the dominant deformation systems and then Electron Back Scattering Diffraction was used to identify and image the active twinning modes.  Prism &lt;a&gt; slip, basal &lt;a&gt; slip, {10-12} and {11-2 1} tensile twinning, and {11-2 2} compression twinning were found to be contributing deformation systems in Zircaloy-2 at 77K.&#xD;
	In this study, the diffraction elastic constants for Zircaloy-2 at room temperature and 77K are reported for the first time in open literature.  These values will be useful in future experimental work by allowing a conversion between lattice spacing and residual stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neuropathic (NP) pain is a debilitating form of chronic pain that can result from a&#xD;
variety of disease states that target the sensory nervous system. NP pain can manifest as burning or shooting pain, and is commonly refractory to traditional analgesics including opioids. Clinically used opioids target the mu opioid receptors (MORs); preclinical reports, however, suggest that the delta opioid receptor (DOR) may be a valid target. It is now accepted that MORs and DORs oligomerize in heterologous expression systems and exhibit novel pharmacology distinct from their monomers. This research aimed to utilize both functional and molecular evidence to identify if a heteromeric mu-delta opioid&#xD;
receptor oligomer (M/DOR) forms in vivo and whether it is upregulated in NP pain. In an&#xD;
animal model of NP pain, animals displayed characteristic behaviours including&#xD;
protecting of the ipsilateral hindpaw from environmental stimuli, and mechanical&#xD;
allodynia in this paw. Behavioural studies reported that acute injection of DOR- selective agonists that bind M/DOR produced enhanced thermal antinociception and reversed&#xD;
mechanical allodynia in NP rats. DOR agonists that have low binding affinity for M/DOR did not produce enhanced thermal antinociception but did reverse mechanical allodynia in NP rats. Molecular studies were employed to characterize the molecular species of ORs in the lumbar spinal cord. Isolated spinal cord membranes were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation&#xD;
with a M/DOR antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation was unable to&#xD;
conclusively identify changes in M/DOR levels in the dorsal horn but did confirm that such a species exists in vivo. Furthermore, antibody characterization was completed to determine if the commercial antibodies used were labeling the appropriate OR proteins. HEK293T cells transfected with MOR and/or DOR plasmids were used in Western blotting and immunocytochemistry protocols to test commercially available antibodies.&#xD;
These studies determined that MOR and DOR antibodies do label their respective OR&#xD;
type, but also recognize additional proteins (non-specifically) in Western blotting&#xD;
protocols. In conclusion, behavioural studies revealed a putative role for M/DOR agonists in the treatment of NP pain; however, more sensitive tools and protocols must be developed before molecular experiments are able to identify quantifiable changes with endogenous M/DORs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  The current practice in northern Canada is to transfer pregnant women residing in communities without hospital facilities to larger centres at 37 weeks gestation.  Little research has been conducted on how the practice of transferring women for childbirth affects available prenatal care continuity and prenatal care options, and whether or not this in turn affects health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives:  The aim of this study is to examine whether differences exist in prenatal care, risk factor distribution, and neonatal morbidity, between women who are transferred for childbirth, and women who are able to remain in their home community to give birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods:  Secondary analysis of the Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey 2006-2007 data was conducted in order to examine the relationship between transfer for childbirth, prenatal care, maternal risk factors, and neonatal morbidity.  Crude odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to assess the relationships between variables using multiple logistic regression, with bootstrap weights applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Women who were transferred for childbirth were more likely to experience a negative neonatal morbidity outcome (OR=1.9, 95% CIs 1.3-2.8), though this relationship disappeared when the relationship was adjusted for potential confounders.  When these results were adjusted for potential confounding, smoking during pregnancy was the only risk factor shown to be significantly associated with neonatal morbidity in this study (OR=1.8, 95% CIs 1.0-3.0).  &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion:  More detailed and widespread data collection is needed to be able to properly assess prenatal care, maternal risk factors and neonatal morbidity in northern Canada.  A perinatal database, constructed for surveillance purposes, would assist in further exploring the effect of transfer policy on prenatal care practices and maternal risk factor distribution, and the effect this has on neonatal health outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research in the field of intellectual disability (ID) has long recognized that social skills and, in turn, social acceptance, are key areas of difficulty for children with ID. However, little work has been done to examine the factors that may contribute to the development of these difficulties. This study examined early childhood parent-child interactions, as well as early characteristics of both the parent and the child, in order to identify the factors that may be relevant to the later development of social competence and social integration. The study found that the social competence of school-aged children with ID affects the extent to which they are integrated within the social and academic domains. Furthermore, school-age social competence was affected by child and parent functioning in toddlerhood. The findings have important implications for intervention, as mentally healthy, well-supported parents may pose a protective factor for at-risk children. Future studies will need to further examine the role of parent-child interactions in child development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis was concerned with the proof of concept for mid-grade, 250-500oC, industrial waste heat recovery using a thermally regenerative electrochemical system. Proposed thermally regenerative electrochemical systems are limited to high operating temperatures (&gt; 900oC) and suffer from poor conversion efficiencies (&lt; 20%). As such, a single chamber design that is free of moving parts was presented in this work. The concept for this novel regenerative system relies on gravity and a liquid medium to convey dissolved sodium hydride in a hydride-borohydride solution from cold to hot regions in a continuous circuit. Such a liquid transport medium could allow for operation below 500oC while stabilizing the hydride from thermal decomposition. Investigations on this system were carried out using a custom pressure differential thermal analyzer that was able to operate above temperatures of 700oC and pressures of 2.2MPa. The results of the experiments provided valuable information concerning the phase diagrams of various hydride-borohydride mixtures. The eutectic composition of the NaH-KBH4 system was found to be 43 mole% NaH. The corresponding eutectic temperature (503oC) was determined using the differential cooling curves. Appreciable NaH decomposition was noticed in mixtures above 59.0 mole% NaH. Mixtures up to 42.5 mole% KH in KBH4 were also investigated. The eutectic composition of the KH-KBH4 binary system was determined by extrapolating the liquidus curve to intersect the solidus curve. The KH-KBH4 eutectic temperature was found to be 390oC at 66 mole% KH. The experimental work successfully demonstrates that thermally unstable hydrides can be obtained in the liquid phase below their melting points, under moderate pressures, when mixed with alkali borohydrides. This significantly lowers the achievable operating temperature of the thermally regenerative electrochemical systems currently proposed. The use of the single chamber design with a hydride-borohydride liquid medium offers numerous advantages including: reduced maintenance, reduced operating temperature, reduced system weight, reduced parasitic losses, increased voltage, and increased reliability. The viability for mid-grade industrial waste heat recovery requires construction of a prototype which optimizes power outputs and explores the hydrodynamic transport of material.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The impact of two constitutional isomers, 2-(4-BMes2-Ph)-pyridine (p-B-ppy) and 5-BMes2-2-ph-pyridine (p-ppy-B), as N,C-chelate ligands on the structures, stabilities, electronic and photophysical properties, and Lewis acidities of Pt(II) complexes has been investigated. Six Pt(II) complexes, Pt(p-B-ppy)Ph(DMSO), Pt(p-B-ppy)Ph(Py), [Pt(p-B-ppy)Ph]2(4,4’-bipy), Pt(p-ppy-B)Ph(DMSO), Pt(p-ppy-B)Ph(Py), and [Pt(p-ppy-B)Ph]2(4,4’-bipy), have been synthesized and fully characterized. The Lewis acidity of the complexes was examined by fluoride titration experiments using UV-Vis, phosphorescence, and NMR spectroscopic methods, establishing that the p-ppy-B complexes have stronger binding constants while the p-B-ppy complexes have a much lower affinity toward F-.&#xD;
A diboron compound with both 3-coordinate boron and 4-coordinate boron centers, (5-BMes2-2-ph-py)BMes2 (B2ppy) has been synthesized, which is luminescent but have a high sensitivity toward light. UV and ambient light cause this compound to isomerize via the formation of a C−C bond between a mesityl and the phenyl group, accompanied by a drastic color change from yellow to dark olive green. The structure of the dark color species was established by 2D NMR experiments and geometry optimization by DFT calculations. The dark color species can thermally reverse back to (5-BMes2-2-ph-py)BMes2 via the breaking of a C−C bond. The N, C-chelate ligand was found to play a key role in promoting this unusual and reversible photo–thermal isomerization process on a tetrahedral boron center. &#xD;
The impact of Pt(II) on the photoisomeration of four-coordinate boron center was also studied. The free ligand four-coordinate organoboron derivative B-ppy-ppy behaved in the same way as B2ppy. The photoisomeration process in the corresponding Pt(II) coupled complex (B-ppy-ppy)PtPh(t-Bu-py) is nearly completely deactivated, which may be attributed to either the low-lying 3MLCT excited state through which the excess energy in excited state was dissipated as phosphorescence or the greater π conjugation which can stabilize the excited state.</dcterms:abstract>

Objectives: The objectives of this thesis were to a)identify health system-related and patient-related factors associated with the use of PRT for bone and brain metastases , and b) describe temporal trends in the use of PRT for bone and brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: The Ontario Cancer Registry was used to identify patients who died of cancer between the years 1984 and 2004. Temporal trends in the use of PRT were described by year and disease site, using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. A multivariate logistic regression was conducted to describe the relationship between health system-related and patient-related factors, and the use of PRT, while controlling for disease-related factors. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Overall, 10.0% and 4.1% of patients dying of cancer received at least one course of PRT within the last two years of life for bone metastases and brain metastases, respectively. The use of PRT for bone metastases significantly decreased from 10.4% to 9.5% (p&lt;0.0001), while the use of PRT for brain metastases more than doubled from 2.2 to 5.1% during the same period (p&lt;0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, age was negatively associated with the use of PRT in both cases. Patients residing in the richest communities were more likely to receive treatment. A farther distance to the nearest cancer was negatively associated with the use of PRT. The level of radiotherapy (RT) services at the diagnosing hospital was positively associated with the use of PRT for bone metastases. Prevailing waiting time did not significantly influence the use of PRT in either case.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Over the course of the study period, the use of PRT for bone metastases decreased, while the use of PRT for brain metastases increased. Access to PRT for both bone and brain metastases was influenced by factors unrelated to need.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The sounds generated by a writing instrument ("pen-chant") provide a rich and under-utilized source of information for pattern recognition.  We examine the feasibility of recognition of handwritten cursive text, exclusively through an analysis of acoustic emissions.  We design and implement a family of recognizers using a template matching approach, with templates and similarity measures derived variously from: smoothed amplitude signal with fixed resolution, discrete sequence of magnitudes obtained from peaks in the smoothed amplitude signal, and ordered tree obtained from a scale space signal representation.  Test results are presented for recognition of isolated lowercase cursive characters and for whole words.  We also present qualitative results for recognizing gestures such as circling, scratch-out, check-marks, and hatching.  Our first set of results, using samples provided by the author, yield recognition rates of over 70% (alphabet) and 90% (26 words), with a confidence of 8%, based solely on acoustic emissions.  Our second set of results uses data gathered from nine writers.  These results demonstrate that acoustic emissions are a rich source of information, usable - on their own or in conjunction with image-based features - to solve pattern recognition problems.  In future work, this approach can be applied to writer identification, handwriting and gesture-based computer input technology, emotion recognition, and temporal analysis of sketches.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare form of breast cancer associated with a poor prognosis.  This study describes the incidence, survival, and management of IBC in the province of Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods:  We conducted a retrospective, population-based, cohort study using data systems held at the Division of Cancer Care and Epidemiology at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.  Using the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR), we identified all primary, pathologically confirmed cases of breast cancer.  IBC cases were identified using the unique histology code ‘85303’.  OCR records were linked to Statistics Canada data, Canadian Institutes of Health Information (CIHI) records of surgical procedures, and cancer centre records detailing radiotherapy and chemotherapy administration.  We calculated age-adjusted incidence rates of IBC for cases diagnosed between 1984 and 2005.  Using the Kaplan Meier product-limit method and log-rank statistics we compared overall survival for IBC and non-IBC, and assessed temporal and regional variations in IBC survival.  We described the management of IBC for patients diagnosed between 1984 and 2004, and assessed variations over time and across cancer centres. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results:  Age-adjusted incidence rates of IBC increased from 0.57/105 women-years in 1984-1987 to 1.15/105 women-years in 2003-2005 (p&lt;0.0001).  10-year survival was 21.5% for IBC compared to 61.7% for non-IBC (p&lt;0.0001).  For IBC, 10-year survival increased from 12.0% (95% CI: 8.3–16.3) for those diagnosed between 1984-1994 to 24.0% (95% CI: 20.1–28.2) for those diagnosed between 1995-2005.  The utilization of combined mastectomy and postoperative radiotherapy increased from 28.9% in 1984-1994 to 46.1% in 1995-2004 (p&lt;0.0001).  We observed no statistically significant difference in the utilization of chemotherapy over time.  Differences in the utilization of combined mastectomy and postoperative radiotherapy were observed across cancer centres (29.8% at centre C vs. 54.7% at centre A, p&lt;0.0001).  We also observed wide variations in the estimates of survival across cancer centres.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Discussion: Rates of IBC have increased over time in Ontario and we observed an improvement in the long-term survival.  Management has shifted over time towards increased use of mastectomy and postoperative radiotherapy.  Additional prognostic information is needed to determine how variations in practice may be related to variations in outcome.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Both Plato and the Cambridge Platonists hold the view that moral knowledge depends primarily on cognitive resources which are innate to the mind.  There is, nevertheless, a need for our minds to be prompted through experience in order for knowledge to occur.  The following study is an attempt to reconstruct and compare the accounts in Plato and the Cambridge Platonists of the empirical conditions that are required for knowledge.  &#xD;
For Plato, these conditions are a result of a decline in political and psychological constitutions, through which the intellect is increasingly developed.  Dialectical analysis of received customs, laws, opinions, and language may then reveal the moral ideas upon which the polity was initially based and which remain implicit in common sense throughout the historical decline.  Philosophical knowledge consists of a recollection of the ancient wisdom which was revealed to the original lawgiver by the gods.  &#xD;
In the Cambridge Platonists, philosophical knowledge likewise consists of a recollection of revealed knowledge that stood at the foundation of a form of life, namely, Judaism.  The revival of ancient Greek and Jewish philosophical theories in modern times heralds the end of history, in which the complete system of knowledge is both attainable and necessary for salvation.  From the perspective of humanity as a whole, knowledge is initially granted through revelation, then generally forgotten, and finally recollected in a highly intellectual age of deteriorating morality and stability.  The esoteric traditions of knowledge, coupled with recent developments in science and philosophy, act as the prompts for knowledge, given an intuitive basis that has been formed through the spread of Christianity.  This intuitive basis serves as the concrete way in which the natural anticipations of the mind are gradually shaped in order to recognize the truth when it appears in a shrouded manner in modern philosophy.  &#xD;
Both Plato and the Cambridge Platonists are critics of the similar intellectual trends in their times and they respond with similar arguments; however, unlike Plato, the Cambridge Platonists are unable to connect their rational critique with their genetic critique of modern ideas, rendering the latter ineffective.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Software security failures are common and the problem is growing. A vulnerability is a weakness in the software that, when exploited, causes a security failure. It is difficult to detect vulnerabilities until they manifest themselves as security failures in the operational stage of the software, because security concerns are often not addressed or known sufficiently early during the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Complexity, coupling, and cohesion (CCC) related software metrics can be measured during the early phases of software development such as design or coding. Although these metrics have been successfully employed to indicate software faults in general, the relationships between CCC metrics and vulnerabilities have not been extensively investigated yet. If empirical relationships can be discovered between CCC metrics and vulnerabilities, these metrics could aid software developers to take proactive actions against potential vulnerabilities in software.&#xD;
In this thesis, we investigate whether CCC metrics can be utilized as early indicators of software vulnerabilities. We conduct an extensive case study on several releases of Mozilla Firefox to provide empirical evidence on how vulnerabilities are related to complexity, coupling, and cohesion. We mine the vulnerability databases, bug databases, and version archives of Mozilla Firefox to map vulnerabilities to software entities. It is found that some of the CCC metrics are correlated to vulnerabilities at a statistically significant level. Since different metrics are available at different development phases, we further examine the correlations to determine which level (design or code) of CCC metrics are better indicators of vulnerabilities. We also observe that the correlation patterns are stable across multiple releases. These observations imply that the metrics can be dependably used as early indicators of vulnerabilities in software.&#xD;
We then present a framework to automatically predict vulnerabilities based on CCC metrics. To build vulnerability predictors, we consider four alternative data mining and statistical techniques – C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Naïve-Bayes – and compare their prediction performances. We are able to predict majority of the vulnerability-prone files in Mozilla Firefox, with tolerable false positive rates. Moreover, the predictors built from the past releases can reliably predict the likelihood of having vulnerabilities in future releases. The experimental results indicate that structural information from the non-security realm such as complexity, coupling, and cohesion are useful in vulnerability prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The relative treatment effectiveness of surgery versus radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer is uncertain and randomized clinical trials are unlikely to be performed. This study describes the difference in cause-specific survival between patients treated with radiotherapy versus surgery, using a number of design and analytic steps to mitigate confounding by indication within an observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: We conducted a population-based case-cohort study, sampling patients from the Ontario Cancer Registry who were treated or were candidates for cure by radiotherapy or surgery. Cases were those who died of prostate cancer within 10 years. Cause-specific survival was analyzed using Cox-proportional hazard regression, with variance adjustment for the case-cohort sampling. Analysis using intent to treat was compared to that using treatment received. Propensity scores were also calculated and Cox-proportional hazard regression was conducted within each propensity score quintile. We formed instrumental variable groups based on radiotherapy rates in Cancer Care Ontario Regions (CCORs) using the study population sampling frame and checked the instrumental variable assumption of equal distribution of covariates by comparing those covariates across these groups using data from the subcohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The adjusted hazard ratios for risk of prostate cancer death for radiotherapy compared to surgery were 1.44 (95% CI 0.86-2.40) and 1.84 (1.06-3.17) using intent to treat and treatment received respectively. Stratified hazard ratios comparing radiotherapy to surgery for death from prostate cancer from the lowest propensity quintile to the highest propensity quintile were 0.30 (0.04-2.28), 1.54 (0.35-6.77), 0.90 (0.29-2.82), 2.71 (1.01-7.31) and 1.08 (0.41-2.81). Differences among these hazard ratios were not statistically significant (p=0.13). The distributions of all prognostic indicators were statistically significantly different between instrumental variable groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: Analysis by intent to treat produced a hazard ratio closer to the null than analysis by treatment received, indicating that uncontrolled confounding toward more serious cases getting radiotherapy was present in the analysis by treatment received. Future studies should focus on obtaining enough numbers for subgroup analysis such as the stratification by risk groups. Caution should be used when using the instrumental variable approach in this population, as prognostic indicators were not as equally distributed as expected.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Unbonded post-tensioned (UPT) flat plate concrete slabs have seen widespread use in multi-storey office and condominium buildings since the 1960s. The popularity of these systems can be attributed to various economic and structural benefits, including reductions in slab thickness, storey height, building mass, and excellent deflection control over large spans. The “inherent fire resistance” of these systems is often quoted as a key additional benefit as compared with competing structural systems. Such statements are apparently based largely on satisfactory results from large scale standard fire resistance tests performed on UPT slabs during the 1960s and on experience from real fires in UPT buildings. However, much remains unknown about the true structural behaviour of continuous multiple bay UPT slabs in real building fires. For instance, relatively little data exist on the effects of elevated temperature on cold drawn prestressing steel under realistic, sustained service stress levels. The primary objective of this thesis is to provide a greater understanding of the high-temperature performance (predominantly related to prestress relaxation) of prestressing steel used in UPT flat plate slabs. A computational model is developed, extending previous research by others, to predict transient high temperature stress relaxation (i.e., prestress loss) for a tendon in a typical UPT multiple span flat plate concrete slab under transient heating and cooling. The computational model is validated by comparison against a series of novel high temperature experiments on locally-heated, stressed, and restrained prestressing tendons with realistic as-built configurations. Reasonable agreement between measured and predicted prestress losses is observed, although some refinement of the model’s input parameters may be required. Test data also indicate that the most crucial fire scenario on a UPT concrete slab may be localized heating rather than a global, fully developed fire. The model is subsequently used to predict the capacity in flexure and punching shear of a UPT flat plate structure under various spatial and temporal heating regimes. The results highlight the need for particular care in the construction of UPT slabs to ensure adequate, robust concrete cover for structural fire safety.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: The prevalence and burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a concern.  While CVD events will occur later in a woman’s life, modifiable risk factors for CVD occur earlier during adult years.  While, there is strong evidence linking modifiable risk factors to CVD, the influence of the work environment on CVD risk is poorly understood.  &#xD;
OBJECTIVES:  The study objectives were to: 1) determine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk indicators; 2) determine the relationships between work patterns and lifestyle behaviours in female hospital workers; 3) determine the relationships between work patterns and cardiovascular risk indicators; and 4) determine the relationships between work patterns, lifestyle behaviours and cardiovascular risk while controlling for covariates.&#xD;
METHODS: Participants were female hospital workers (N= 466) from 2 hospital sites in Southeastern Ontario.  Cardiovascular risk data were obtained through anthropometric measurements, blood sampling and self-report.  Work pattern data were collected through self-report and linked with hospital administrative work data.  Lifestyle behaviour data were obtained through self-report using validated questionnaires.  Metabolic syndrome was classified in accordance with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) (III) guidelines. &#xD;
RESULTS:   Approximately 1 in 4 female participants had the metabolic syndrome, with elevated waist circumference being the most common CVD risk factor.  After adjustments, the multivariate analysis found a few key significant associations between irregular work patterns, specifically extended shifts and CVD risk, specifically elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  However, consistent with the literature, the bivariate analyses revealed that after 6 or more years of shift work, female workers were more likely to develop the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.12, 3.17) and abdominally obesity (OR = 2.0, 95% CI, 1.31, 3.11).  &#xD;
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that generally work patterns do not influence the development of unhealthy behaviours and cardiovascular risk factors, although a few key exceptions exist. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms linking harmful and protective work pattern characteristics to CVD risk.  Given the prevalence of abdominal obesity and overall CVD risk, hospital decision makers need to consider cardiovascular health within healthy workplace initiatives as the healthcare workforce is aging.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The PICASSO experiment located 2 km underground in SNOLAB is directly&#xD;
searching for dark matter signals by looking for interactions between dark matter&#xD;
particles and an active target made of superheated droplets of freon C4F10. During&#xD;
the interaction, energy is deposited to the freon triggering a phase transition,&#xD;
inducing pressure waves which are detected by piezo-electric sensors.&#xD;
A temperature dependent analysis of the amplitudes of the signals for detector&#xD;
71 showed that, above 25 ◦C, between 20 and 80 % of the events were saturated&#xD;
implying that the preamplifiers had too high a gain. Decreasing this gain by a fixed&#xD;
factor was not found to be a suitable solution to the problem. Ideally, a temperature&#xD;
dependent gain should be established. In addition, some channels have intrinsic&#xD;
problems and should be repaired.&#xD;
A threshold analysis was used to establish the trigger efficiency which was found&#xD;
to be 90% above 25 ◦C but only 50% at lower temperatures with the current setting&#xD;
of the threshold. A temperature dependent threshold setting has been proposed.&#xD;
A new setup at Queen’s University has been built and a gamma calibration using&#xD;
three different radioactive sources (22Na,137Cs,57Co) was undertaken leading to a&#xD;
new detector response curve for gammas. For a proper analysis, new and more&#xD;
appropriate cuts were implemented. The analysis confirmed the expectation that&#xD;
the PICASSO detectors are mostly blind to gammas below 50 ◦C. However, the&#xD;
detectors appear to be more sensitive to 122 keV gammas than to 622 keV gammas&#xD;
by a factor of about 10. The sensitivity for 22Na also differs by a large factor from&#xD;
what was expected from old calibrations on detectors with much smaller bubbles.&#xD;
The rate plots exhibit a strong exponential increase in rate above 40 ◦C which is not&#xD;
due to any of the gamma sources used, but could be due to neutrons or low energy&#xD;
x-rays. This remains under investigation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Tattoo culture and the community it has created have undergone a renaissance since the 1980s. Persons with tattoos now account for an estimated 34% of the North American population between the ages of 18-30. Despite this relatively recent surge towards acceptance of tattoos in the current social context, much of the academic literature and media portrayals of tattoos characterize social deviancy among tattoo enthusiasts. Tattoo enthusiasts are pushed to the periphery of society and marginalized as bikers, criminals, and people with psychological problems. The purpose of this study is to describe and understand tattoo culture in a way that is accessible to non-members of that culture, particularly teachers and parents. The primary research questions proposed by this study include what motivates people to become tattooed, what motivates members of the tattooed community to stay minimally involved in the culture or to increase their involvement, and how members of the community perceive their tattoos within the current social context. To answer these questions, this study focuses on the lived experiences of six tattoo enthusiasts from one small community. Through the study of these shared experiences, this study questions the nature of tattoos in this small community and whether these acts can be considered deviant or culturally normative.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The class I myosins are an ubiquitous family of non-filamentous, single-headed actin-binding motor proteins. The objective of this study was to identify the light chain composition of the short-tailed Dictyostelium class I myosins, MyoIA and MyoIE. Flag-tagged MyoIA head-neck and MyoIE head-neck constructs were generated and expressed in Dicyostelium discoidem. The MyoIA and MyoIE head-neck constructs both co-purified with a 17-kDa protein that reacted with an anti-calmodulin antibody and exhibited a mobility shift on SDS gels in the presence of calcium.  Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the light chain bound to MyoIA and MyoIE was calmodulin. The finding that the short-tailed class I Dictyostelium myosins use the generic calcium-binding protein calmodulin as a light chain contrasts with previous work showing that the long-tailed Dictyostelium class I myosins MyoIB, MyoIC, and MyoID each bind a unique, specialized light chain called MlcB, MlcC, and MlcD, respectively. Despite having a calmodulin light chain, calcium did not affect the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activities of MyoIA or MyoIE.&#xD;
The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac.  PAKs phosphorylate a site in the motor domain of Dictyostelium class I myosins that is required for myosin activity. Studies were carried out to determine whether Dictyostelium RacB, which is known to bind to and activate Dictyostelium PAKs, promotes the phosphorylation of MyoID in vivo. A vector that expresses a constitutively active RacB under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter was created and transformed into Dictyostelium cells.  Immunostaining demonstrated that the constitutively active RacB increased actin filament formation in AX3 cells by ~3-fold but by only ~1.5-fold in PakB-null cells.  A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the MyoID tail was made. An anti-phospho antibody raised against a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the MyoID TEDS site was tested and found to specifically recognize purified phosphorylation MyoIA and MyoID.  The anti-phospho antibody did not detect phosphorylated MyoIA or MyoID in crude Dictyostelium cell extracts or in immunoprecipitates prepared using the anti-MyoID antibody.  Further work is needed to improve the specificity of the anti-phospho MyoID antibody.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Glucose is the primary metabolic signal reflecting the current energy state of the body.  Glucose influences the excitability of neurons in the area postrema (AP), a circumventricular organ (CVO), prompting my interest in investigating whether the subfornical organ (SFO), another sensory CVO can also detect glucose.  Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we investigated the influence of changing glucose concentrations on the excitability of SFO neurons. &#xD;
&#xD;
In dissociated SFO neurons, altering the bath concentration of glucose (1mM, 5mM, 10mM) influenced the excitability of 49% of neurons tested (n=67).  Glucose-inhibited (GI, hyperpolarized by increased glucose or depolarized by decreased glucose) and glucose-excited (GE, depolarized by increased glucose or hyperpolarized by decreased glucose) neurons were observed.  GI neurons (27%, n=18) depolarized in response to decreased glucose (n=10, mean 4.6 ± 1.0 mV) or hyperpolarized in response to increased glucose (n=8, mean -4.4 ± 0.8 mV).  In contrast, GE neurons (22%, n=15) depolarized in response to increased glucose (n=9, mean 6.4 ± 0.4) or hyperpolarized in response to decreased glucose (n=6, mean -4.8 ± 0.6 mV).  These data show that glucose acts on a subpopulation of SFO neurons to produce both excitatory and inhibitory actions.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Using voltage-clamp recordings two groups of SFO neurons were identified: those producing an outward current (GI) and those producing an inward current (GE) in response to increasing concentrations of glucose from 1 to 10 mM (n=23).  The mean glucose-induced inward current had a reversal potential of -24 ± 12 mV (mean input resistance 2.0 ± 0.4 GΩ, n= 5), suggesting it may be mediated by a NSCC.  The mean glucose-induced outward current (mean input resistance 1.7 ± 0.3 GΩ, n=7) had a mean reversal potential of -78 mV ± 1.2 mV (n = 5), suggesting it may be mediated by an activation of either K+ or Cl-current (ECl = -67 mV, EK = -89 mV).  &#xD;
&#xD;
The SFO has projections to the PVN, a &#xD;
regulator of energy balance.  I investigated the effects of increasing concentrations of glucose (1 to 10 mM) on the membrane potential of dissociated SFO neurons projecting to the PVN.  Thirty percent of SFO-PVN neurons tested (n=10) responded with membrane hyperpolarizations (mean -4.2 ± 0.8 mV, n=3) suggesting a proportion of these cells are GI neurons.      &#xD;
&#xD;
These data indicate that SFO neurons are glucose-responsive, which supports a role for the SFO as a regulator of energy balance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Contour laser transmission welding (LTW) is a technology that has potential for joining large and complicated thermoplastic parts.  Thermal expansion is the primary driving force to bridge potential gaps at the weld.  A comprehensive investigation into gap bridging was performed using experimental studies, finite element (FE) thermal-mechanical coupled modeling, and analytical analysis of the contour welding process for polycarbonate (PC), polyamide 6 (PA6) , and glass fibres reinforced polyamide 6 (PA6GF).  The effects of material properties (carbon black level, glass fibres and crystallinity), process parameters (laser scan power, scan speed) and weld gap thickness on weld shear strength were assessed.  &#xD;
The experimental study indicated that low concentration of laser absorbing pigment accompanied with high power laser scan improves gap bridging.  Damage on the top surface of the laser-transparent part limited the allowable laser power that could be delivered onto the weld interface.  Maximum gaps of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.25 mm were bridged in the experiment for the three types of polymers respectively.&#xD;
The thermal behavior of polymers in contour LTW was analyzed by the 3-D quasi-static thermal FE models.  Thermal expansion into the gap was simulated by the simplified 2-D transient, thermal-mechanical coupled FE models.  An analytical model describing laser beam transmission and absorption in light-scattering polymers was developed and applied in the FE simulation for PA6 and PA6GF.  FE simulated results agree well with the experiment in contour welding with gap of PC and PA6.  The optimum material and process parameters have been searched in the model to maximize gap bridging for PC.  &#xD;
An analytical model has been developed to predict the temperature rise and the thermal expansion in high speed contour welding of amorphous polymers.  The model indicates that the maximum temperature at weld increases linearly with the laser line energy and the laser absorption coefficient.  Thermal expansion and hence gap bridging increases with laser line energy.  Lower laser absorption coefficient allows higher laser scan energy to be delivered onto the weld interface so helps bridge larger gap.  The predicted thermal expansions by the model agree well with the measured maximum gaps bridged for polycarbonate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cosmological simulations show that dark matter halos contain a wealth of substructure. These subhalos are assumed have a mass distribution that extends down to the smallest mass in the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) hierarchy, which lies below the current resolution limit of simulations. Substructure has important ramifications for indirect dark matter detection experiments as the signal depends sensitively on the small-scale density distribution of dark matter in the Galactic halo. A clumpy halo produces a stronger signal than halos where the density is a smooth function of radius.&#xD;
However, the small-scale Universe presents a daunting challenge for models of structure formation. In the CDM paradigm, structures form in a hierarchical fashion, with small-scale perturbations collapsing first to form halos that then grow via mergers. However, near the bottom of the hierarchy, dark matter structures form nearly simultaneously across a wide range of scales.&#xD;
To explore these small scales, I use a series of simulations of scale-free cosmological models, where the initial density power spectrum is a power-law. I can  effectively examine various scales in the Universe by using the index in these artificial cosmologies as a proxy for scale. This approach is not new, but my simulations are larger than previous such simulations by a factor of 3 or more.&#xD;
My results call into question the often made assumption that the subhalo population is scale-free. The subhalo population does depend on the mass of the host. By combining my study with others, I construct a phenomenological model for the subhalo mass function. This model shows that the full subhalo hierarchy does not greatly boost the dark matter annihilation flux of a host halo. Thus, the enhancement of the Galactic halo signature due to substructure can not alone account the observed flux of cosmic rays produced by annihilating dark matter.&#xD;
Finally, I examine the nonlinear power spectrum, which is used to determine cosmological parameters based on large-scale, observational surveys. I find that in this nonlinear regime, my results are not consistent with currently used fitting formulae and present my own empirical formula.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis begins with the simple observation that the term ‘green consumption’ would have appeared, at the very least, oxymoronic to those concerned with environmental issues some thirty years ago. Yet now it is a commonplace aspect of popular, academic and policy discourse in the global north. In recognizing the diversity of products and services that fall under the rubric of ‘green consumption,’ this project situates it as a form of discursive positioning and a potential set of a practices that indicate a ‘friendly’ or benign association between consumption and the environment. The thesis has three components. Firstly, it reviews the literature on consumer culture and environmentalism, highlighting relevant thematic debates concerning the critique of consumer culture and its potential effects upon the environment. Secondly, the thesis constructs a post-Foucauldian ‘analytics of green consumption’ in order to understand such a radical shift in representations of consumption and environmental thinking. Thirdly, the thesis employs this analytics to examine two dominant ‘environmentalities’ or programmes of green consumption – Eco Labelling and the Ecological Footprint – wherein the advanced liberal rhetorics of ‘choice,’ ‘freedom’ and ‘responsibility’ are found to operate in different ways. Drawing upon the work of Rose (1999), Barry et al. (1996) and others, the thesis shows how these ‘informational’ techniques are predicated upon and reproduce specific conceptions of consumer behaviour, encouraging the formation of ‘green consumer-subjects.’ It is argued that the terrain of consumption has become the primary locus where political, social, economic and cultural elements overlap to shape the decisions of consumers. The field of consumption is being restructured around lifestyle choice-driven models of responsible subjectivity, with consumption becoming the key means for shaping the conduct of individual citizens. The thesis goes on to argue that such a market-based approach to engendering green consumption is problematic in terms of its conception of how consumer choice and freedom are constrained, raising difficult issues for policy efforts in this area. The thesis also points toward the limits of post-Foucauldian analyses of green consumption, especially the impossibility of knowing whether, and for what reasons, practices of green consumption are taken up by consumers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Male birds of many species use conspicuous song and plumage displays in both courtship and territorial interactions. In some species, one or both of these signalling traits may not reach full adult maturity until a male’s second year of life. While the prevalence of delayed plumage maturation is well documented, delayed song maturation may be more difficult to detect. As a result, there are few studies which report age-based song differences between first-year and adult males. Additionally, despite the potentially large degree of variation of each trait within yearling males, little work has examined the benefits for young males who appear or sound more adult-like. Here, I investigate variation in both song and plumage displays of yearling male American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) as they relate to success during the breeding and non-breeding seasons.&#xD;
I first demonstrate a relationship between the degree of adult-like black plumage and both non-breeding season habitat quality in Jamaica and breeding season arrival date in Ontario. Previous studies have linked breeding season arrival date with winter habitat quality in adult males using stable-carbon isotope analysis. Together, these results suggest that variation in yearling male appearance may signal an individual’s competitive ability for high-quality resources. Next, I quantified the mate-attraction songs of both adult and yearling males and demonstrate a delayed maturation in this song type. I also present evidence of the potential benefits of expressing a more adult-like song by linking song structure with reproductive success in adult males. Finally, I demonstrate a potential relationship between the degree of adult-like song and plumage expression in yearling males, but not adult males. This work demonstrates that the delayed maturation of sexual signals may play an important role in the life-history of yearling male American redstarts, and highlights the need for in-depth analyses of individual variation of multiple sexual signals in this poorly-studied age class of birds.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chapter 1 constitutes a review of current methods of aromatic substitution focusing on Directed ortho Metalation (DoM) and Directed remote Metalation (DreM). The field of mesoporous silica is reviewed in Chapter 2, focusing on the preparation, characterization, and application of mesoporous silicates.&#xD;
Chapter 3 presents an introduction of phosphorus based Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs). The development of the directed ortho metalation (DoM) reaction of the tetraethyl phosphorodiamidate DMG is described. In addition to being one of the most powerful DMGs, migration of the OPO(NEt2)2 group to the ortho and remote positions is demonstrated, constituting new reactions as well as affording new organophosphorus compounds.&#xD;
Attempts to improve the synthetic utility of the DMG led to the discovery and optimization of a two new nickel-catalyzed cross coupling reactions, which is described in Chapter 4. Both the OPO(NEt2)2 and OCONEt2 DMGs are demonstrated to undergo cross coupling reactions with aryl boronic acids. &#xD;
By means of DoM and cross coupling tactics, the concise synthesis of a chiral binaphthol bridged silasesquioxane is described. Chapter 5 explores new methods to prepare chiral periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials using this monomer. PMOs are prepared by the co-condensation of a relatively small amount of chiral binaphthyl dopant which acts to twist the bulk prochiral biphenylene framework.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study was conducted to explore the ability and propensity to verbally deceive others in children with and without autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We also explored the relationships among lie-telling ability, false belief understanding as measured using a standard battery of false belief tasks, and verbal mental age as measured using a standardized test of language ability. To explore antisocial lie-telling ability, we used a modified temptation resistance paradigm in which children were tempted to commit a transgression in the experimenter’s absence and given the opportunity to tell a lie about their transgression and to exercise semantic leakage control (SLC)—that is, to maintain consistency between the lie and subsequent statements that they make. To explore prosocial lie-telling ability, we used a modified undesirable gift paradigm in which children were awarded an unattractive prize for winning a game and given the opportunity to lie about liking the prize that the experimenter gave them. We found that children with ASD, like typically developing children, can and do tell antisocial lies to conceal a transgression, and prosocial lies in politeness settings. However, children with ASD were less able than typically developing children to exercise SLC. Furthermore, we found that, unlike in typically developing children, lie-telling ability in children with ASD was not related to their false belief understanding. The pattern of relations among lie-telling ability, false belief understanding, and verbal mental age are discussed with respect to possible contentions regarding the underlying processes by which children with ASD tell lies and succeed on false belief tasks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is a growing interest in the impact of waiting for surgery, a common experience for many Canadians. Pain and psychological symptoms prior to surgical management are frequently problems for women with gynaecological conditions, however minimal research was found to investigate pain and psychological symptoms in these women prior to surgery. Also pain is recognized to increase healthcare utilization, but this has not been previously examined in this population. The objectives of this research project were to examine levels of pain, psychological factors associated with pain and frequency of healthcare utilization due to pain in a population of women waiting for gynaecological surgery, predominantly undergoing hysterectomies. Four hundred and twenty nine women in a tertiary care centre in southeastern Ontario were included in the study. Anxiety was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), depression with the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), somatization using the Seven Symptom Screening Test (SSST) and catastrophizing was measured using an abbreviated coping strategies questionnaire (CSQ). Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Women also reported on their healthcare utilization for pain over the past 12 months. The length of wait was obtained from hospital waiting data. Results showed a moderate to severe pain intensity score occurred in 30.5% of women and a moderate to severe interference score in 31.5%. Being younger, married, employed and with high trait anxiety were factors associated with higher rates of healthcare utilization. High levels of depression, somatization and catastrophizing were associated with higher pain intensity and interference scores. This study supports the need for preoperative assessment of physical and psychological symptoms in women waiting for gynaecological surgery. Improving patients’ health prior to surgery will potentially reduce their healthcare demands on a financially constrained healthcare service.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the intersections of visual culture with processes of folklorization in Maritime Canada between 1964 and 2007. Throughout this thesis, I explore how visual culture helps make history public in the Maritimes for local and tourist audiences alike. Ultimately, I question which visions succeed when it comes to looking at this “region’s” past in order to visualize its future. I outline chapters that consider how Nova Scotia’s first provincial gallery, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (AGNS), labelled the cultural production of local self-taught artists “folk” art and, by collecting these objects, became the foremost expert in a category of artistic expression it had itself created; how the provincial state ideologically and economically invested in a certain “folk” aesthetic by gathering objects under the authority of a few prominent collectors; how those institutions and collectors who sought to develop contemporary folk art for the art market also became concerned with the new confrontation of a global mass culture by the last few decades of the twentieth century; how the AGNS transformed self-taught artist Maud Lewis from a local tourist attraction in the 1960s into an internationally recognized cultural icon by the 1990s through the institutionalization of her life story’s public history; and how those with state and corporate authority came to brand the Maritimes for global tourism at the turn of the twenty-first century, by employing what they understood to be the region’s strongest cultural resources. Part of my rationale here is to explore what it means to label the cultural production of self-taught artists “folk” art and the implications of state and corporate investment in this cultural form for the public narrative associated with the experience of culture in Maritime Canada. I posit a complex hegemonic relationship here between relatively powerful artworld professionals and relatively powerless self-taught artists that speaks both to the inequities and contradictions of a capitalist liberal order. In doing so, I also tackle the broader implications of writing “the history of region” in an age of “global” analyses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Elevated plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] have been identified as an independent risk factor for vascular diseases including coronary heart disease and stroke.  In the current study, we have examined the binding and degradation of recombinant forms of apolipoprotein(a) [r-apo(a)], the unique kringle-containing moiety of Lp(a), using a cultured cell model.  We found that the incubation of human hepatoma (HepG2) cells with an iodinated 17 kringle-containing (17K) recombinant form of apo(a) resulted in a two-component binding system characterized by a high affinity (Kd = 12 nM), low capacity binding site, and a low affinity (Kd = 249 nM), high capacity binding site.  We subsequently determined that the high affinity binding site on HepG2 cells corresponds to the LDL receptor.  In the HepG2 cell model, association of apo(a) with the LDL receptor was shown to be dependent on the formation of Lp(a) particles from endogenous LDL.  Using an apo(a) mutant incapable of binding to the high affinity site through its inability to form Lp(a) particles (17KΔLBS7,8), we further demonstrated that the LDL receptor does not participate in Lp(a) catabolism.  The low affinity binding component observed on HepG2 cells, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) fibroblasts and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells may correspond to a member(s) of the plasminogen receptor family, as binding to this site(s) was decreased by the addition of the lysine analogue epsilon-aminocaproic acid.  The lysine-dependent nature of the low affinity binding site was further confirmed in HepG2 binding studies utilizing r-apo(a) species with impaired lysine binding ability.  We observed a reduction maximum binding capacity for 17K r-apo(a) variants lacking the strong lysine binding site (LBS) in kringle IV type 10 (17KΔAsp) and the very weak LBS in kringle V (17KΔV).  Degradation of Lp(a)/apo(a) was found to be mediated exclusively by the low affinity component on both HepG2 cells and FH fibroblasts.  Fluorescence confocal microscopy, using the 17K r-apo(a) variant fused to green fluorescent protein, further confirmed that degradation by the low affinity component on HepG2 cells does not proceed by the activity of cellular lysosomes.  Taken together, these data suggest a potentially significant route for Lp(a)/apo(a) clearance in vivo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hypothalamic control of food intake may be overridden by cortical and limbic brain regions that process reward and the hedonic aspect of food, affecting the ability to discriminate between homeostatic and hedonic feeding. Women, in particular may be affected since cognition and perception of reward change during the menstrual cycle. Changes in estrogen and progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle induce changes in appetite and eating behavior. Food intake declines in the peri-ovulatory period when estrogen levels peak, but increases in the luteal phase when progesterone levels increase. In this novel study we introduce a different context in which to study appetite regulation; the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
The two main study objectives were: 1) to compare the BOLD response between the peri-ovulatory and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and 2) to compare the BOLD response between women in a negative and positive affect state in response to visual food stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Pictures of food, regardless of their caloric content stimulated greater activation during the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase in the orbitofrontal cortex, fusiform, amygdala and inferior operculum. Activity was present in the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in response to high calorie images but not low calorie images during the follicular phase. The insula showed selective activity responding to high calorie pictures in the luteal phase and low calorie pictures in the follicular phase. &#xD;
High calorie food cues elicited greater BOLD signal for women reporting negative affect in the putamen, amygdala, pulvinar, prefrontal cortex, pallidum, fusiform and ventral tegmental area. &#xD;
In summary, visual food cues produced a more robust response during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and during a negative mood state in brain regions modulating the rewarding and motivational effects of food images. An increased understanding of how appetite-regulating brain regions respond during the menstrual cycle and in different mood states may facilitate the development of new therapies to reduce the incidence of obesity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bioretention systems are best management practices (BMPs) that make use of the biogeochemical processes within a forest-type ecosystem to provide at-source stormwater retention and pollutant removal. Laboratory studies and field monitoring have shown great potential for water quantity and quality control through the use of bioretention, but reported nutrient removal has been inconsistent between these systems. In particular, the processes involved in the cycling of phosphorus within bioretention systems are not clearly understood. Some studies report high phosphorus removal from bioretention systems, while phosphorus leaching was observed in other systems.&#xD;
Phosphorus is a macronutrient required by all forms of life. It is also an important water pollutant, as it controls algal growth in most freshwater environments. High phosphorus loadings to these aquatic ecosystems can lead to eutrophication, which has significant ecological, environmental and economical impacts. &#xD;
The Bioretention Phosphorus Removal Model (BPRM), an event-based one-dimensional finite difference model, was developed to simulate phosphorus removal in bioretention systems. The model includes four completely-mixed layers to simulate hydrologic processes as well as both soluble and particulate phosphorus transport in a bioretention system. Model processes include evapotranspiration, infiltration, overflow, exfiltration to native soils, underdrain discharge, soluble phosphorus sorption and vegetative uptake, and particulate phosphorus capture. &#xD;
Monitoring data collected by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) at a bioretention system installed on Seneca College’s King City campus, in Ontario, Canada, was used to evaluate the performance of BPRM. The model was found to overestimate total underdrain discharge volumes, but total phosphorus concentration and mass predictions were found to be useful for design purposes. BPRM correctly predicted phosphorus leaching from the Seneca College bioretention system for all storm events considered but one. The model can be used by practitioners to evaluate the potential for phosphorus leaching in a bioretention system.&#xD;
A detailed sensitivity analysis revealed that BPRM phosphorus transport predictions are particularly sensitive to the drainage properties of bioretention soils, which highlights the importance of hydrologic transport processes for water quality control in bioretention systems. Modelling results suggested that soluble phosphorus desorption from bioretention soils was responsible for phosphorus leaching from the Seneca College bioretention system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research indicates that multiprocessor-based architectures will provide a flexible alternative to hard-wired application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) suitable to implement the multitude of wireless standards required by mobile devices, while meeting their strict area and power requirements.  This shift in design philosophy has led to the software-defined radio (SDR) paradigm, where a significant portion of a wireless standard's physical layer is implemented in software, allowing multiple standards to share a common architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
Turbo codes offer excellent error-correcting performance, however, turbo decoders are one of the most computationally complex baseband tasks of a wireless receiver.  Next generation wireless standards such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), support enhanced double-binary turbo codes, which offer even better performance than the original binary turbo codes, at the expense of additional complexity.  Hence, the design of efficient double-binary turbo decoder software is required to support wireless standards in a SDR environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis describes the optimization, parallelization, and simulated performance of a software double-binary turbo decoder implementation supporting the WiMAX standard suitable for SDR.  An adapted turbo decoder is implemented in the C language, and numerous software optimizations are applied to reduce its overall computationally complexity.  Evaluation of the software optimizations demonstrated a combined improvement of at least 270% for serial execution, while maintaining good bit-error rate (BER) performance.  Using a customized multiprocessor simulator, special instruction support is implemented to speed up commonly performed turbo decoder operations, and is shown to improve decoder performance by 29% to 40%.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The development of a flexible parallel decoding algorithm is detailed, with multiprocessor simulations demonstrating a speedup of 10.8 using twelve processors, while maintaining good parallel efficiency (above 89%).  A linear-log-MAP decoder implementation using four iterations was shown to have 90% greater throughput than a max-log-MAP decoder implementation using eight iterations, with comparable BER performance.  Simulation also shows that multiprocessor cache effects do not have a significant impact on parallel execution times.  An initial investigation into the use of vector processing to further enhance performance of the parallel decoder software reveals promising results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Disequilibrium between coagulation and fibrinolysis can lead to severe haemostatic disorders such as thrombosis and hemophilia. Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a carboxypeptidase B-like pro-enzyme that, once activated, attenuates fibrinolysis. TAFI may also mediate connections between coagulation and inflammation. Studies have associated high plasma TAFI levels with risk for thrombotic diseases. Interestingly, steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progestogens used in hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptive preparations, have been shown to affect plasma TAFI levels. Regulation of the expression of the gene encoding TAFI, CBP2, is likely an important determinant of the role of the TAFI pathway in vivo; this concept motivated the investigations described in this thesis.&#xD;
	In Chapter 2, the results of my research lead to the identification of key transcription factors regulating CPB2. Specifically, we described the binding of NF-Y and HNF-1 to the CPB2 promoter. NF-Y was shown to be an important factor for the basal CPB2 promoter activity. Binding of HNF-1 is essential for the activity of the promoter and is potentially responsible for the liver specific expression of CPB2.&#xD;
	In Chapter 3, we set to investigate the effect of female sex hormone on hepatic expression of CPB2. We demonstrated that the levels of TAFI protein secreted from cultured hepatoma cells (HepG2) are decreased by 17beta-estradiol and progesterone. The change in protein expression was paralleled by decreases in CPB2 mRNA abundance and promoter activity. Deletion analysis of the CPB2 promoter indicated that the genomic effects of estrogen and progesterone are likely mediated via a non-classical mechanism.&#xD;
	In Chapter 4, we evaluated the effects of various inflammatory mediators on expression of the gene encoding mouse TAFI (Cpb2). Our results showed that Cpb2 mRNA abundance and promoter activity are up-regulated by inflammatory mediators IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha. We also showed that TNFalpha mediates its effect via the binding of NFkB. Additionally, our results suggest that TNFalpha promotes the binding of NFkB to the promoter by increasing its translocation to the nucleus. The NFkB site is not conserved between human and mouse and may explained the different responses to inflammation observed in vivo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been extensively used in the study of building energy usage and thermal comfort in buildings, however there remains the need to thoroughly evaluate the accuracy of the results given by such CFD methods.&#xD;
The present study involves a numerical investigation of the flow and temperature distribution in the atrium situated in the Concordia University Engineering Building. The study involved a steady-state simulation of the conditions in the atria on August 1, 2007, a date for which experimental data was available for validation of the numerical results. The commercial CFD solver FLUENT was used to solve the equations that govern the flow in the atrium. The realizable k- turbulence model incorporating buoyancy force effects was used. During the period studied a forced airflow through the atrium existed due to a mechanical air supply vent near the floor level. The natural convection in the atrium, induced by the temperature differences resulting mainly from the incoming solar radiation, was modeled using the bousinessq approximation. In general, good agreement was obtained between the numerical and experimental results. The numerical results also predicted the thermal stratification in the atrium relatively accurately. &#xD;
A parametric study was performed to assess the sensitivity of the numerical results to the assumed boundary conditions used in the study. An evaluation of the thermal comfort levels in the atrium was also undertaken using the numerical results. This indicated that while regions of thermal discomfort did exist in the atrium, these regions constituted only a small part of the atrium.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Goldstrike property is located in northern Nevada and contains one of the largest and highest-grade Carlin-type gold deposits. The majority of the Eocene Au mineralization (e.g., Ore I) is hosted in intensely altered Paleozoic lower-plate impure carbonate rocks, and is characterized by strong to moderate silicification, higher calculated pyrite and ore-related element concentrations (e.g., As, Cu, Hg, Ni, Tl, Sb, W, and Zn) than Ore II, which is weakly altered. However, both ore types contain similar Au concentration in whole rock and pyrite chemistry analyses.&#xD;
Lithogeochemical and microprobe data suggest that the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks may have been a major source of Cd, Mo, Ni, U, V, and Zn and minor As, Cu, Hg, and Se. The Jurassic lamprophyre dikes might have been a significant source of Ba, Co, and Se, and minor Au, and some of the Jurassic and Eocene intrusive rocks may have provided some Fe. Moreover, the Eocene magmas are interpreted to be the main source of auriferous mineralizing fluids and ore-related elements.&#xD;
Trace element abundances and ratios of the Jurassic intrusive rocks suggest that they are shoshonitic and formed from a metasomatized mantle-derived magma, crystal fractionation, and crustal contamination. The Eocene dikes, also shoshonitic, are considerably more evolved and contaminated than the studied Jurassic rocks. Furthermore, Ar-Ar results show that the Jurassic intrusive rocks were negligibly affected by the Eocene thermal event, and that temperature of mineralizing fluids were below the closure temperature of biotite (&gt; 3500C).&#xD;
A magmatic-related model is proposed to explain the formation of the Carlin-type gold deposits at the studied area. In this model, Au and the ore-related elements were exsolved along with volatiles by degassing of a deep and large plutonic complex during its early stage of crystallization. As these magmatic-hydrothermal fluids moved upward along major conduits (e.g., NNW-striking faults), they may have interacted with a Fe-rich fluid, pervasively altering the Paleozoic impure carbonate rocks (e.g., carbonate dissolution, silicification, pyritization) and forming Ore I. Subsequently, these fluids moved laterally further away from the major conduits, became cooler, less acidic, and depleted in ore-related elements and interacted with the Fe-bearing host rocks (e.g., sulfidation), favoring the precipitation of Ore II.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An unusually high level of inter- and intraspeciﬁc variability in spermatozoa has been well documented. However, recent evidence indicates that the level of variation within spermatozoa differs markedly across taxa. In particular, it appears that the variability in spermatozoa&#xD;
tends to decrease across species as the risk of sperm competition increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, I present a model that explains how variability in spermatozoa may arise due to errors made during the sperm production process. In doing so, I also provide an explanation for why variability in sperm traits tends to decrease as the level of sperm competition experienced by males of a given species increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
The model presented in this study provides a novel perspective on spermatozoa and their production. While many sperm traits are thought to be selected upon, I suggest&#xD;
that variability in spermatozoa may also be the result of evolutionary forces such as sperm competition. Variability in spermatozoa, then, can be adaptive and can represent an optimal reproductive strategy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Rideau River Waterway, also known as the Rideau Canal, is a constructed navigation channel that links Ottawa to Kingston, Ontario. Opened in 1832, it was designated a Canadian Heritage Site in 2003 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007. South of Smiths Falls, the Rideau Canal consists of a series of 14 interconnected lakes, primarily used for recreational purposes, as well as commercial fishing. The objectives of this study were to examine the spatial and temporal distributions of anthropogenic elements to three headwater lakes of the Rideau Canal system and to examine the relationship between sport fish Hg and historical sediment Hg concentrations.  &#xD;
Utilizing paleolimnological techniques, historical records of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, K, Ni, Pb, Rb, and Zns were analyzed from chronologically deposited lake sediments. Overall, Indian Lake, though the smallest of the three studied lakes, consistently had the highest overall As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations. While all peak concentrations were buried, recent surface sediment Hg, Cd, and Zn concentrations still remain above the federal interim sediment quality guideline and the concentration of Pb remains above the federal probable effect level within Indian Lake, leading to continued concern for human and ecosystem health. The general agreement between lake sediment profiles for Cd, Pb and Zn and then Cu and Ni suggest that each group of elements is primarily contributed from the same source. The similarity in trends and timing of peak concentrations between the study lakes and other Ontario lakes suggests large-scale, atmospheric contributions of elements to the freshwater systems in the area. &#xD;
Although only historical northern pike (Esox lucius) THg tissue concentration data was available for analysis, results indicate that concentrations in fish have decreased more than 60% since the late 1970â€™s, while sediment THg concentrations have decreased 35% within the same time period.  Overall, this study has demonstrated that the headwater lakes to the Rideau Canal are presently impacted by elements, at concentrations which are of potential concern for human health.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Soil nitrogen availability to plants is a fundamental control on the structure and functioning of arctic tundra ecosystems.  Despite recent evidence that biogeochemical and microbial dynamics during the non-growing season impact nitrogen availability to plants in tundra ecosystems, very little is known about soil microbial patterns and mechanisms for nutrient mobilization in the winter, spring and fall.  In this dissertation I have examined the environmental and microbial controls on seasonal nitrogen mobilization in a widespread Canadian low arctic birch hummock tundra ecosystem.  In particular, I have investigated the potential for increased winter snow depth and different above-ground vegetation-types to alter soil microbial community patterns and nutrient mobilization from organic matter into plant-available pools.  First, I demonstrated that experimentally deepened winter snow altered soil microbial physiology during winter, defined as increased microbial carbon limitation to growth and activity. Second, I established that deepened snow enhanced spring nutrient mobilization during distinct environmental phases, producing large peaks in the soil microbial biomass and soil solution carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus during snow thaw.  Third, I showed that laboratory predictions of early-spring air temperature freeze-thaw cycles promoting tundra soil nitrogen loss are not relevant, as the soil environment and soil biogeochemistry were relatively stable after snow melt and before plant growth began.  Fourth, I demonstrated that microbial functional groups did not differ strongly under different tundra vegetation types, but higher quality shrub litter induced positive feedbacks on soil carbon availability and soil nitrogen mineralization in the late summer.  Finally, I illustrated that annual patterns of tundra soil microbial community structure and composition were strongly linked to soil biogeochemistry and that significant shifts in fungal/bacterial ratios occur during snowmelt.  This research suggests two broad conclusions: a) that soil microbial activity is responsive to changes in above-ground vegetation; and b) that seasonal changes in microbial community structure and microbial biochemistry are strongly correlated.  Therefore, the synchronicity of microbial seasonal succession and plant species-specific timing of nitrogen uptake is a critical factor restricting the potential for ecosystem N losses at spring thaw and ultimately in supplying growth-limiting nutrients to plants in the following summer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There exists considerable debate in the texture community about whether grain interactions are a necessary factor to explain the development of deformation textures in polycrystalline metals. Computer simulations indicate that grain interactions play a significant role, while experimental evidence shows that the material type and starting orientation are more important in the development of texture and microstructure. A balanced review of the literature on face-centered cubic metals shows that the opposing viewpoints have developed due to the lack of any complete experimental study which considers both the intrinsic (material type and starting orientation) and extrinsic (grain interaction) factors. In this study, a novel method was developed to assemble ideally orientated crystalline aggregates in 99.99\% aluminum (Al) or copper (Cu) to experimentally evaluate the effect of grain interactions on room temperature deformation texture. Ideal orientations relevant to face-centered cubic rolling textures, Cube $\{100\}\left&lt;001\right&gt;$, Goss $\{110\}\left&lt;001\right&gt;$, Brass $\{110\}\left&lt;1\bar{1}2\right&gt;$ and Copper $\{112\}\left&lt;11\bar{1}\right&gt;$ were paired in different combinations and deformed by plane strain compression to moderate strain levels of 1.0 to 1.5. Orientation dependent mechanical behavior was distinguishable from that of the neighbor-influenced behavior. In interacting crystals the constraint on the rolling direction shear strains ($\gamma_{_{XY}}, \gamma_{_{XZ}}$) was found to be most critical to show the effect of interactions via the evolution of local microstructure and microtexture. Interacting crystals with increasing deformations were observed to gradually rotate towards the S-component, $\{123\}\langle\bar{6}\bar{3}4\rangle$. Apart from the average lattice reorientations, the interacting crystals also developed strong long-range orientation gradients inside the bulk of the crystal, which were identified as accumulating misorientations across the deformation boundaries. Based on a statistical procedure using quaternions, the orientation and interaction related heterogeneous deformations were characterized by three principal component vectors and their respective eigenvalues for both the orientation and misorientation distributions. For the case of a medium stacking fault energy metal like Cu, the texture and microstructure development depends wholly on the starting orientations. Microstructural instabilities in Cu are explained through a local slip clustering process, and the possible role of grain interactions on such instabilities is proposed. In contrast, the texture and microstructure development in a high stacking fault energy metal like Al is found to be dependent on the grain interactions. In general, orientation, grain interaction and material type were found to be key factors in the development of rolling textures in face-centered cubic metals and alloys. Moreso, in the texture development not any single parameter can be held responsible, rather, the interdependency of each of the three parameters must be considered. In this frame-work polycrystalline grains can be classified into four types according to their stability and susceptibility during deformation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Social life, and particularly health care delivery, in a small isolated community is more complex and nuanced than has been reflected in much of the literature on physician retention, which has never extended the notion of the “workload” past the physician’s formal role in the health care setting.  Despite having been acknowledged by provincial and national government policies, few of what Anderson and Rosenberg (1990) describe as “unidimensional solutions” have resolved the “multidimensional issues” of physician retention in northern Canada. This thesis employs a qualitative framework to investigate the practice and lifestyle experiences of general practitioners on the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii) to provide a local analysis of physician retention problems experienced by isolated communities. By including both physicians and community members as key informants, the project attempts to determine whether a difference exists between physicians’ perceptions of place and their roles and the voiced expectations of the communities they serve.  The research uses a combination of in-depth interviews and questionnaires with physicians (n=6) and community members (n=12) to determine the various roles played by a physician in a small community.  It queries whether the community in question expects physician to take up roles outside of the medical space, whether physicians are influenced by these expectations and whether these may contribute to the cessation of practice in remote communities.  This thesis examines not only health care-related factors involved in medical practice, but also the informal settings of the community at large, including the general interactions that are incorporated into a physician’s character in a close-knit and isolated place.  The findings of the thesis demonstrate that there are significant gaps between what community members and physicians believe is reasonable behaviour and the reality of physicians’ experiences in their respective island communities. The lack of boundaries perceived by physicians in their communities often leads to social isolation, which has the opposite intended effect of respite, instead leading to further disengagement from the local community, finally resulting in a decision to locate elsewhere.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A micro-cogeneration system based on an ArtesJet KJ-66 hobby microturbine may be able to provide a single family dwelling with required heat and power, increasing total efficiency due to utilization of waste heat.  The feasibility of such a system was investigated.  An engine model based on the similar JG-100 engine was developed, written in Microsoft Excel™ and Visual Basic™.  The predicted running characteristics of the KJ-66 were simulated, and a prediction of how these characteristics would be shifted if a diffuser was attached to the engine was made.  &#xD;
	An experimental test program was carried out on the KJ-66 engine to determine if this prediction was correct, and to more accurately characterize the performance of the engine.  Two diffusers were constructed to use with the testing, along with the nozzle that was supplied with the engine.  Having the diffusers on the engine reduced the fuel air ratio by approximately 20% as predicted.  &#xD;
	A hypothetical micro-cogeneration system was simulated building on the earlier engine model, with modified turbomachinery maps and combustor performance based on the experimental data.  An 85% effective recuperator was included in the model, as well as a recovery heat exchanger.  The simulation showed an electrical output of 8.9 kW, a heat output of 30.9 kW, an electrical efficiency of 15.5%, and a total efficiency of 69.0%.  While these efficiencies are low, improvements could be made by modifying the turbomachinery and by using a condensing recovery heat exchanger to give a better overall efficiency for the micro-cogeneration system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis I critically analyze the ways in which the work of Nova Scotian artist Maud Lewis circulates within the categories of “fine art” and “Folk art” by examining three documentary films that deal with her life and work.  My aim is to draw attention to Lewis’s current status in Canada as an artistic genius –an individual of seemingly exceptional talent who is also a Folk artist – that is, paradoxically, a “Folk artist-genius.”  As vehicles through which to explore the construction of Maud Lewis and the concept of the Folk artist-genius I examine three films about Maud Lewis produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the National Film Board (NFB): The Once-Upon-A-Time World of Maud Lewis (CBC, 1965), Maud Lewis: A World Without Shadows (NFB, 1976) and The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis (NFB, 1998).&#xD;
Lewis exemplifies the qualities identified with the Folk, including geographic isolation, rusticity, simplicity, closeness to nature, industriousness and innocence.  Yet, while she is thoroughly imbued with Folkishness, she is simultaneously viewed as the artist-genius, an individualized and mythologized character of sublime talent.  Her originality, prodigy, virtuosity and spirituality are hailed as indicative of her genius, in the expression of which she is perceived to have overcome ordinary relations to the material world – social seclusion, physical disability and poverty.  This thesis explores the paradoxical conflation of the concepts of the “Folk” and the “artist-genius” in the figure of Lewis, an under-analyzed yet superlative example of this phenomenon. Lewis, as Folk artist-genius, navigates between these two domains; she possesses the qualities of the traditional artistic “master,” but remains representative of the quintessential Folk, at once transcending and “typical” of the rustic Nova Scotian people.  This is a seemingly impossible position to occupy; by the very definition of “Folk,” the concept of a “Folk artist-genius” should not exist, yet cultural institutions and agents unproblematically hail Lewis as such.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Motivated by the longest increasing subsequence problem, we examine sundry&#xD;
topics at the interface of enumerative/algebraic combinatorics and random matrix theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
We begin with an expository account of the increasing subsequence problem, &#xD;
contextualizing it as an ``exactly solvable'' Ramsey-type problem and introducing&#xD;
the RSK correspondence.  New proofs and generalizations&#xD;
of some of the key results in increasing subsequence theory are given.  These include Regev's single&#xD;
scaling limit, Gessel's Toeplitz determinant identity, and Rains' integral representation.  The double scaling limit (Baik-Deift-Johansson theorem) is briefly described, although we have no &#xD;
new results in that direction.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Following up on the appearance of determinantal generating functions in increasing subsequence type problems, we are led to a connection between combinatorics and the ensemble of truncated random &#xD;
unitary matrices, which we describe in terms of Fisher's random-turns vicious walker model&#xD;
from statistical mechanics.  We prove that the moment generating function of the trace&#xD;
of a truncated random unitary matrix is the grand canonical partition function for Fisher's &#xD;
random-turns model with reunions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we consider unitary matrix integrals of a very general type, namely the ``correlation functions'' of entries of Haar-distributed random matrices.  We show &#xD;
that these expand perturbatively as generating functions for class multiplicities in symmetric functions of Jucys-Murphy elements, thus addressing a problem originally raised by De Wit and t'Hooft and &#xD;
recently resurrected by Collins.  We argue that this expansion is the CUE counterpart of genus expansion.</dcterms:abstract>

This dissertation applies high energy X-ray diffraction to directly measure the mechanical properties of zirconium hydrides in the bulk and at stress concentrations in zirconium alloys. The current study is presented as a manuscript format dissertation comprised of three manuscript chapters. Chapter 3 reports the in-situ loading of hydrided Zircaloy-2 and discusses hydride/Zircaloy-2 matrix interactions as a function of applied load. Chapter 4 reports the mechanical behavior at a fatigue pre-crack in un-hydrided Zircaloy-2, comparing the results to finite element and polycrystalline plasticity models of the crack tip. Chapter 5 reports the effect of hydrides on the notch tip strain field. The three manuscript chapters are followed by a general discussion in Chapter 6 and conclusions in Chapter 7.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The allylic bromide functionality within brominated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene), or BIIR, is amenable to substitution by a wide range of nucleophiles. The objective of this work was to gain insight into the dynamics of these substitution reactions, and to develop methods for accelerating these processes.  Of particular interest was the reactivity of exomethylene (Exo-Br) and bromomethyl (BrMe) isomers found within BIIR toward various nucleophiles, and catalytic techniques for affecting the proportion of these isomers. &#xD;
&#xD;
BIIR isomerization can be catalyzed through ionic chemistry involving soluble Lewis acids such as zinc stearate and through a nucleophilic SN2’ rearrangement with soluble bromide salts such as tetrabuylammonium bromide (TBAB). The compatibility of TBAB with other nucleophiles makes it a preferable choice, but further rate enhancements can be realized using the corresponding iodide salt (TBAI).  TBAI serves not only as nucleophilic isomerization catalyst, but also accelerates halide displacement from BIIR by an in-situ formation of an allylic iodide intermediate.&#xD;
&#xD;
Studies of BIIR isomerization and substitution reactions involved solvent-borne reactions of tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAAc) and solvent-free reactions with PPh3 and 2-[2-(dimethylaminoethoxy)ethanol].  In all cases, the BrMe isomers were more reactive to nucleophilic substitution than Exo-Br.  Since the esterification of BIIR with TBAAc generates TBAB as a reaction by-product, displaced bromide catalyzes the isomerization of Exo-Br to the more reactive BrMe isomers.  As a result, these esterifications exhibit auto-accelerating dynamics.  Similar behaviour is observed for solvent-fee alkylations of PPh3 and tertiary amines, since the resulting onium bromide salts are effective isomerization catalysts.  All reactions show some increase in rate with the addition of TBAI, supporting the concept of nucleophilic catalysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Attracting prey by exploiting a visual sensory bias is a common theme in stationary predators across many taxa, particularly for obligate ambush predators, such as orb-weaving spiders, because they construct complex prey traps. Mimicry of UV-reﬂecting ﬂoral-guides has been suggested as the mechanism behind the tendency for spiders and silk web decorations (stabilimenta) to reﬂect in the UV, to attract pollinators that they then prey upon. Also, many insects are attracted to UV because it most  commonly indicates open sky, or a safe ﬂight path. My study focuses on the prey attraction function of stabilimenta, in Argiope trifasciata in eastern Ontario. Decorated webs were no more likely to contain prey than undecorated webs, but for adult spiders, longer stabilimenta were associated with increased likelihood of prey capture. For both adults and juveniles, larger webs were more likely to contain prey in undecorated webs, but for decorated webs, web size was not a predictor of prey presence. I interpret this as evidence for a trade-off between two alternative prey capture strategies: building a web with a  large capture area, or building a small web with a stabilimentum. In further support of this trade-off, smaller webs were more likely to contain a stabilimentum, for both juveniles and adults. My data also suggest that close neighbours compete rather than cooperate with each other. Adult webs were spaced farther apart from each other than juvenile webs, more than would be expected based on web diameter difference. For juveniles, webs with a closer neighbour were more likely to be decorated, implying an increased need for prey attraction in the presence of a nearby competitor. For adults, prey was more likely to be found in webs that were more solitary. My results do not support the hypothesis that visually attractive spiders increased prey capture by aggregating.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Osseointegrated transfemoral implants have been introduced as an alternative to conventional, socket-based prostheses for above knee amputees. This method is showing great promise; however, the frequency of device failure is of concern. As a means to understand some of these failures, this study investigates the mechanical behaviour of three osseointegrated transfemoral implant systems; an in-house prototype design and two assemblies comprised of implant-grade parts provided by Integrum AB, Sweden. A series of mechanical tests were administered to evaluate the effects of tightening specifications and connection geometry on the material response, and mechanical behaviour of the assemblies. The tests included torque-elongation measurements, torque to failure tests, and strain analyses during loading.&#xD;
This research was carried out in an attempt to better understand the behaviour of components under loading, in order to optimize the assembly specifications and improve the useful life of the system.&#xD;
The results obtained confirm that the Integrum assemblies exhibit improved performance when tightened to a level beyond the current specified tightening torque of 12 Nm. Increased tightening torque provides an improved connection between components, leading to increased torque retention, decreased peak tensile strain values and a more gradual, primarily compressive distribution of strains throughout the assembly.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Polymerization processes require adequate monitoring to ensure that the final product meets specification. Various on-line measuring techniques have been developed and implemented to track polymer properties in reactors. For most processes, however, on-line measurement cannot be implemented. In other situations, certain polymer properties or states might not be measurable and hence have to be estimated. This work deals with improving an on-line optimization technique and demonstrating its eff ectiveness by sensitivity analysis. In addition, state estimation is used as a tool to reconstruct states that are unavailable for measurement in a styrene and butyl methacrylate batch-fed solution free-radical copolymerization process subject to on-line optimization. A hybrid extended Kalman filter is used to observe the nonlinear dynamic system which is subject to real-time dynamic optimization. With very limited measurement information, the states of the system were reconstructed. Additional unobservable quantities were reconstructed using the process model and estimated states.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goals of this study are to examine why seniors volunteer and how where they volunteer affects their everyday lives. A group of volunteers from a seniors association in southeastern Ontario are used to investigate how seniors become volunteers, why individuals continue to volunteer at a particular place, what tasks senior volunteers perform, and the number of years and hours seniors volunteer at a particular organization.  The study makes use of 23 interviews with volunteers aged 54 to 89.  The findings from the interviews were then compared to national data on senior volunteers gathered from the 2004 Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (CSGVP). The secondary data were used to examine such things as, the tasks senior volunteers perform and the reasons seniors volunteer across Canada.  The analysis reveals that the group of volunteers show several similarities to volunteers aged 55 and over across Canada.  The interviews show that the specific characteristics of the place influence why seniors volunteer and continue to volunteer at this particular organization.  In addition to the characteristics of the place, the interviews disclose the potential to view the seniors centre as a therapeutic landscape, where healing, well-being and maintained health are enhanced.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Twenty-seven years after the adoption of the Constitution Act, 1982, the Constitution of Canada is still not officially bilingual in its entirety. A new translation of the unilingual English texts was presented to the federal government by the Minister of Justice nearly twenty years ago, in 1990. These new French versions are the fruits of the labour of the French Constitutional Drafting Committee, which had been entrusted by the Minister with the translation of the texts listed in the Schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982 which are official in English only. These versions were never formally adopted.&#xD;
Among these new translations is that of the founding text of the Canadian federation, the Constitution Act, 1867. A look at this translation shows that the Committee chose to depart from the textual tradition represented by the previous French versions of this text. Indeed, the Committee largely privileged the drafting of a text with a modern, clear, and concise style over faithfulness to the previous translations or even to the source text.&#xD;
This translation choice has important consequences. The text produced by the Committee is open to two criticisms which a greater respect for the prior versions could have avoided. First, the new French text cannot claim the historical legitimacy of the English text, given their all-too-dissimilar origins. Its adoption through a constitutional amendment will not grant it the requisite legitimacy, as the nature of such an amendment is generally misunderstood by lawyers, let alone the ordinary citizen.&#xD;
In addition, the new text is, in many instances, anachronistic, as a result both of the purism and the modernism of the Committee. This desire to erase the “mistakes” of our ancestors, to “refrancize” the language of the era, leads to the drafting of a text which is entirely divorced from its original context, a text which cannot be a true reflection of the historical source text. This necessarily results in a lack of historical accuracy in the new translation.&#xD;
These two problems might have been avoided by giving greater weight to the translations of the past. In the current circumstances, the unreflecting adoption of the new text would have unfortunate effects for the understanding of our constitutional law and its history.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Recent evidence suggests weight loss is not necessary to reduce obesity related co-morbidities.  The principal finding within these reports is based on examination of group mean values.  Accordingly, it is possible that within a given group, the subjects who failed to lose weight did not experience any health improvement, a finding masked by the exaggerated improvement in those who did lose weight.  We sought to determine whether a gradient exists between the inter-individual change in bodyweight and corresponding changes in body composition and metabolic risk factors in response to minimal or no weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Total adipose tissue (AT) and skeletal muscle (SM) were determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 46 men and 42 women participating in lifestyle-based programs designed to reduce obesity and related metabolic risk factors.  Visceral AT (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous AT (ASAT) were calculated from a single image at the L4-L5 inter-vertebral space.  Glucose uptake was calculated using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.  Blood pressure (BP) was determined using an electronic cuff or manually using standard procedures.  Waist circumference (WC) was taken at the level of the last rib.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Bodyweight did not change in men or women (p&gt;0.10).  Collapsed across gender, with the exception of ASAT, SM, and systolic BP, all other anthropometric, body composition, and metabolic risk factor measures improved significantly following treatment (p&lt;0.05).  With few exceptions, regression analysis revealed that changes in bodyweight or WC were not associated with corresponding changes in body composition measures or metabolic risk factors (p&gt;0.05).  To further consider whether a gradient existed between weight change or WC change on body composition and metabolic risk factors, subjects were cross-classified according to their level of weight/waist change (tertiles) and their respective change in either body composition or metabolic risk factor.  Neither weight nor WC change tertile was related to any body composition or metabolic risk factor in a gradient fashion (p&gt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: These findings reinforce and extend the observation that independent of gender, lifestyle-based interventions are associated with reductions in obesity and related metabolic risk factors despite minimal or no weight loss.</dcterms:abstract>
