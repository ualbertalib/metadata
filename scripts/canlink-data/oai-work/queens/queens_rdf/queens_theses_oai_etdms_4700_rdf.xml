      <dcterms:abstract>The photochemistry of the polar regions of Earth, as well as the interstellar medium, is driven by the effect of ultraviolet radiation on ice surfaces and on the materials trapped within them. While the area of ice photochemistry is vast and much research has been completed, it has only recently been possible to study the dynamics of these processes on a microscopic level. One of the leading techniques for studying photoreaction dynamics is Velocity Map Imaging (VMI). This technique has been used extensively to study several types of reaction dynamics processes. Although the majority of these studies have utilized molecular beams as the main medium for reactants, new studies showed the versatility of the technique when applied to molecular dynamics of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces. Herein the development of a velocity map imaging apparatus capable of studying the photochemistry of condensed phase materials is described. The apparatus is used to study of the photo-reactivity of NO2 condensed within argon matrices to illustrate its capabilities. A doped ice surface is formed by condensing Ar and NO2 gas onto a sapphire rod which is cooled using a helium compressor to 20 K. The matrix is irradiated using an Nd:YAG laser at 355 nm, and the resulting NO fragment is state-selectively ionized using an excimer-pumped dye laser. In all, we are able to detect transient photochemically generated species and can collect information on their quantum state and kinetic energy distribution. It is found that the REMPI spectra changes as different sections of the dissociating cloud are probed. The rotational and translational energy populations are found to be bimodal with a low temperature component roughly at the temperature of the matrix, and a second component with much higher temperature, the rotational temperature showing a possible population inversion, and the translational temperature of 100-200 K. The low temperature translational component is found to dominate at long delay times between dissociation and ionization, while at short time delays the high temperature component plays a larger role. The velocity map imaging technique allows for the detection of both the axial and radial components of the translational energy. The distribution of excess energy over the rotational, electronic and translational states of the NO photofragments provides evidence for collisional quenching of the fragments in the Ar-matrix prior to their desorption.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
	The purpose of this study was to examine the technical adequacy of the Developmental Reading Assessment (Beaver &amp; Carter, 2004).  Internal consistency analysis, factor analysis, and linear regression analyses were used to test whether the DRA is a statistically reliable measuring of reading comprehension for Grades 7 and 8 students.  Correlational analyses, decision consistency analyses, and a focus group of experienced Intermediate (Grades 7 and 8) teachers examined whether there is evidence that the results from the DRA provide valid interpretations regarding students’ reading skills and comprehension. Results indicated that, as currently scored, internal consistency is low and skewness of distribution is high.  Factor analyses did not replicate those cited by the DRA developers to prove construct validity. Two-way contingency analyses determined that decision consistency did not vary greatly between the DRA, EQAO, scores and report card marks.  Views expressed during the focus group echoed many of the challenges to validity found in the statistical analysis.  The teachers found that the DRA was somewhat useful, as there were limited alternative reading assessments available for the classroom, but did not endorse it strongly.  The study found little evidence that the DRA provides valid interpretations regarding Intermediate students’ reading skills.  Indicated changes to the structure and administration procedures of the DRA may ameliorate some of these issues.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Underground hardrock mining can be very energy intensive and in large part this can be attributed to the power consumption of underground ventilation systems. In general, the power consumed by a mine’s ventilation system and its overall scale are closely related to the amount of diesel power in operation. This is because diesel exhaust is a major source of underground air pollution, including diesel particulate matter (DPM), NO2 and heat, and because regulations tie air volumes to diesel engines.&#xD;
Furthermore, assuming the size of airways remains constant, the power consumption of the main system increases exponentially with the volume of air supplied to the mine. Therefore large diesel fleets lead to increased energy consumption and can also necessitate large capital expenditures on ventilation infrastructure in order to manage power requirements. Meeting ventilation requirements for equipment in a heading can result in a similar scenario with the biggest pieces leading to higher energy consumption and potentially necessitating larger ventilation tubing and taller drifts.&#xD;
Depending on the climate where the mine is located, large volumes of air can have a third impact on ventilation costs if heating or cooling the air is necessary. Annual heating and cooling costs, as well as the cost of the associated infrastructure, are directly related to the volume of air sent underground.&#xD;
This thesis considers electric mining equipment as a means for reducing the intensity and cost of energy consumption at underground, hardrock mines. Potentially, electric equipment could greatly reduce the volume of air needed to ventilate an entire mine as well as individual headings because they do not emit many of the contaminants found in diesel exhaust and because regulations do not connect air volumes to electric motors. Because of the exponential relationship between power consumption and air volumes, this could greatly reduce the amount of power required for mine ventilation as well as the capital cost of ventilation infrastructure.&#xD;
As heating and cooling costs are also directly linked to air volumes, the cost and energy intensity of heating and cooling the air would also be significantly reduced. A further incentive is that powering equipment from the grid is substantially cheaper than fuelling them with diesel and can also produce far fewer GHGs. Therefore, by eliminating diesel from the underground workers will enjoy safer working conditions and operators and society at large will gain from a smaller impact on the environment.&#xD;
Despite their significant potential, in order to produce a credible economic assessment of electric mining equipment their impact on underground systems must be understood and considered in their evaluation. Accordingly, a good deal of this thesis reviews technical considerations related to the use of electric mining equipment, especially ones that impact the economics of their implementation.&#xD;
The goal of this thesis will then be to present the economic potential of implementing the equipment, as well as to outline the key inputs which are necessary to support an evaluation and to provide a model and an approach which can be used by others if the relevant information is available and acceptable assumptions can be made.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Water remains a predominant vector for human enteric pathogens not just for developing countries but also developed nations, where numerous infectious disease outbreaks, linked to the contamination of drinking water have been documented. Private drinking water wells are a source of drinking water that is largely unstudied even though a significant percentage of the population in Ontario relies on wells as their primary water source. As there exists little to no systematic surveillance for enteric infections or outbreaks related to well water sources, these individuals may be at higher risk of waterborne infectious diseases. The relationships between various fecal indicators in the water of private drinking water wells, including E. coli, Total Coliforms (TC) and Bacteroides, and enteric pathogens, including Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., and Shiga toxin producing E. coli, were studied. Convenience private well water samples collected from various regions of interest during the summer of 2014 underwent membrane filtration and culture to determine quantities of E. coli and TC colony forming units. 289 E. coli positive and 230 TC-only waters were successfully analyzed by individual qPCR assays for the aforementioned enteric pathogens. Microbial source tracking methods targeted to specific Bacteroides were used to determine the source of fecal contamination as either human or bovine. The source of fecal contamination varied by geographic region and is thought to be due to such things as differences in septic tank density and underlying geology, among others. Fecal indicators, E. coli and Bacteroides, were significantly correlated. E. coli as measured by qPCR was more strongly correlated to both total and human-specific Bacteroides genetic markers than culturable E. coli. Lastly, 1.9% of samples showed molecular evidence of contamination with enteric pathogens. Although low, this finding is significant given the limited volume of water available for testing, and suggests a potential health risk to consumers. Knowing the extent of contamination, as well as the biologic source, can better inform risk assessment and the development of potential intervention strategies for private well water in specific regions of Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We present an extensive photometric catalog for 548 CALIFA galaxies observed as of the summer of 2015. CALIFA is currently lacking photometry matching the scale and diversity of its spectroscopy; this work is intended to meet all photometric needs for CALIFA galaxies while also identifying best photometric practices for upcoming integral field spectroscopy surveys such as SAMI and MaNGA. This catalog comprises gri surface brightness profiles derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, a variety of non-parametric quantities extracted from these pro files, and&#xD;
parametric models  fitted to the i-band pro files (1D) and original galaxy images (2D). To compliment our photometric analysis, we contrast the relative performance of our 1D and 2D modelling approaches. The ability of each measurement to characterize&#xD;
the global properties of galaxies is quantitatively assessed, in the context of constructing the tightest scaling relations. Where possible, we compare our photometry with existing photometrically or spectroscopically obtained measurements from the literature. Close agreement is found with Walcher et al. (2014), the current source of basic photometry and classifications of CALIFA galaxies, while comparisons with spectroscopically&#xD;
derived quantities reveals the effect of CALIFA's limited  field of view&#xD;
compared to broadband imaging surveys such as the SDSS. The colour-magnitude diagram, star formation main sequence, and Tully-Fisher relation of CALIFA galaxies are studied, to give a small example of the investigations possible with this rich&#xD;
catalog. We conclude with a discussion of points of concern for ongoing integral&#xD;
field spectroscopy surveys and directions for future expansion and exploitation of this work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The transition of epithelial-like tumour cells to those exhibiting mesenchymal characteristics (Epithelial-to-mesenchymal Transition; EMT) is an integral process in breast cancer metastasis. EMT can be promoted by Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) which can be found at high levels in the tumour stroma. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) can also induce EMT in breast cancer cells, which is one way that they promote breast cancer metastasis. Vitamin D signalling has been implicated in EMT suppression and plays a role in modulating macrophage differentiation and stimulating their anti-inflammatory functions. This project had two major aims. First, we aimed to create and verify a unique fluorescent reporter gene construct designed to evaluate the dynamics of EMT in real-time and at the single-cell level. While some components of this reporter system were successfully validated, work to complete the final reporter construct is ongoing. The second and main aspect of this project focused on exploring the ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) to modulate the interaction between mesenchymal mammary tumour cells and TAMs. Unexpectedly, in short-term treatment (48 hours) studies of 4T1 murine mammary tumour cells, we observed that 1,25D3 and TGF-β signalling work together to increase expression of the mesenchymal markers, Snai1, Fn1, and Col1a1. 1,25D3 and TGF-β also synergistically activate transcription of the gene encoding the 1,25D3-catabolizing enzyme, Cyp24a1. The ability of 1,25D3 and TGF-β to enhance expression of these genes was diminished in a long-term treatment (14 days) of 4T1 cells, and this effect was accompanied by a decrease in cell proliferation. 1,25D3 may also cooperate with cytokines produced by normal macrophages and macrophages considered to be TAM-like. Conditioned media experiments revealed that in the presence of factors from normal macrophages, 1,25D3 enhanced expression of  Fn1, and in the presence of factors from TAM-like macrophages, 1,25D3 enhanced expression of Fn1 and Cyp24a1. Rather than mitigating the interaction as hypothesized, 1,25D3 may exacerbate the tumour-promoting effects of the EMT-TAM relationship. Also, signalling pathways involved in the EMT-TAM relationship may synergize with 1,25D3 to upregulate Cyp24a1 expression. These findings are important for understanding the potential of vitamin D compounds to be used in the treatment of breast cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Several determinants of fear of falling (FoF) and low balance confidence overlap with the consequences/complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). FoF is strongly associated with low balance confidence, and balance confidence mediates the relationship between FoF and balance and physical function. The purpose of this thesis was two-fold: (1) to examine the prevalence, severity and determinants of FoF in older adults (aged≥65) with DM, and (2) to evaluate the validity of the short version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-6) and its association with balance and postural control in older adults with DM. Three separate studies were conducted of older adults with DM (DM-group) and without DM (noDM-group). Study I revealed that although FoF prevalence adjusted for age and sex was not different between-groups, the DM-group had 8.8% fewer participants in the low and 8.4% more in the high Falls-Efficacy Scale International categories when compared to the noDM-group. Higher FoF severity in the DM-group was associated with poor physical performance, being female, fall history and clinical depressive symptoms. Study II provided evidence of convergent, discriminant and concurrent validity of the ABC-6 for use in older adults with DM with and without diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Notably, the ABC-6 was more sensitive in detecting subtle differences in balance confidence between the DM-group and noDM-group when compared to the original ABC scale (ABC-16), and can be administered in less time. Study III explored balance confidence (ABC-6) and its association with balance and postural control in older adults with DM. Subtle differences in axial segmental control (i.e., lower trunk roll velocity and higher head-trunk correlations) while walking and lower balance confidence were apparent in the DM-group, even in the absence of DPN, when compared to the noDM-group. Balance confidence partially explained the variance in head-trunk stiffening between-groups, and consequently low balance confidence in older adults with DM may contribute to the dependence on postural control strategies that are normally only utilized in high-risk situations. Findings from this thesis will help to guide the development of protocols for screening and intervention recommendations of patient education and targeted rehabilitation programs for older adults with DM.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The advent of next-generation sequencing has significantly reduced the cost of obtaining large-scale genetic resources, opening the door for genomic studies of non-model but ecologically interesting species. The shift in mating system, from outcrossing to selfing, has occurred thousands of times in angiosperms and is accompanied by profound changes in the population genetics and ecology of a species. A large body of work has been devoted to understanding why the shift occurs and the impact of the shift on the genetics of the resulting selfing populations, however, the causes and consequences of the transition to selfing involve a complicated interaction of genetic and demographic factors which are difficult to untangle. Abronia umbellata is a Pacific coastal dune endemic which displays a striking shift in mating system across its geographic range, with large-flowered outcrossing populations south of San Francisco and small-flowered selfing populations to the north. Abronia umbellata is an attractive model system for the study of mating system transitions because the shift appears to be recent and therefore less obscured by post-shift processes, it has a near one-dimensional geographic range which simplifies analysis and interpretation, and demographic data has been collected for many of the populations. In this study, we generated transcriptome-level data for 12 plants including individuals from both subspecies, along with a resequencing study of 48 individuals from populations across the range. The genetic analysis revealed a recent transition to selfing involving a drastic reduction in genetic diversity in the selfing lineage, potentially indicative of a recent population bottleneck and a transition to selfing due to reproductive assurance. Interestingly, the genetic structure of the populations was not coincident with the current subspecies demarcation, and two large-flowered populations were classified with the selfing subspecies, suggesting a potential need for re-evaluation of the current subspecies classification. Our finding of low diversity in selfing populations may also have implications for the conservation value of the threatened selfing subspecies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Mechanisms underlying the effect of estrogen exposure on breast cancer risk remain unclear. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels have been positively associated with breast cancer and are a potential mechanism.&#xD;
Objectives: The objectives of this thesis are: 1) to explore whether the reproductive risk factors and the lifetime cumulative number of menstrual cycles (LCMC), as measures for long-term estrogen exposure, are associated with IGF-1 levels, and 2) to examine the effect of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) on IGF-1 levels, and the potential interaction with BMI. &#xD;
Methods: A cross sectional study and a randomized controlled trial nested with the MAP.3 chemoprevention trial were used to address objective 1 and 2, respectively. 567 postmenopausal women were selected. Anthropometric measurements, lifestyle factors, reproductive characteristics and serum IGF-1 concentrations were collected at baseline and one year.  Objective 1. The LCMC was computed as a composite measure of the reproductive characteristics. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the association between IGF-1 levels and LCMC and the hormonal risk factors, while adjusting for potential covariates. Objective 2. Changes in IGF-1 were compared between the exemestane and placebo, and effect modification by BMI was tested with an interaction term. &#xD;
Results: Objective 1. Women aged 55 years or older at menopause had 16.26 ng/mL (95% CI: 1.76, 30.75) higher IGF-1 compared to women aged less than 50 years at menopause. Women in the highest category of menstrual cycles (≥500 cycles) had an average 19.00 ng/mL (95%CI: 5.86, 32.14) higher concentration of IGF-1 compared to women in the lowest category (&lt;350). Exogenous hormones had no effect on postmenopausal IGF-1 levels. Objective 2. Exemestane significantly increased IGF-1 levels by 18% (95% CI: 14%-22%); while, placebo had no effect on IGF-1. The changes in IGF-1 were significantly different between the treatment arms (P&lt;0.0001) and no significant interaction was observed between treatment and BMI on IGF-1 changes (P=0.1327).&#xD;
Conclusion:  Objective 1. Larger number of menstrual cycles and a later age at menopause are positively associated with IGF-1. IGF-1 may be one mechanism by which prolonged estrogen exposure increases cancer risk. Objective 2. We conclude that the reduced cancer risk observed with AI therapy likely occurs in an IGF-1 independent mechanism. Further studies exploring the clinical consequences of increased IGF-1 on AI therapy are needed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the voltage-gated K+ channel, hERG (Kv11.1). This channel passes the rapidly-activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), which is important for cardiac repolarization. A reduction in IKr due to loss-of-function mutations or drug interactions causes long QT syndrome (LQTS), which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The density of hERG channels in the plasma membrane is a key determinant of normal physiological function, and is balanced by trafficking to and from the cell surface. Many LQTS-associated hERG mutations result in a trafficking deficiency of otherwise functional channels. Thus, elucidating mechanisms of hERG regulation at the plasma membrane is useful for the prevention and treatment of LQTS. We previously demonstrated that M3 muscarinic receptor activation increases mature hERG expression through a Gq protein-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. In addition to conventional Gq protein-coupling, M3 receptors recruit β-arrestins upon agonist binding. Traditionally known for their role in receptor desensitization and internalization, β-arrestins also act as adaptor proteins to facilitate G protein-independent signaling. In the present work, I investigated the exclusive effect of β-arrestin signaling on hERG expression by utilizing an arrestin-biased M3 designer receptor (M3D-arr) exclusively activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). By expressing M3D-arr in hERG-HEK cells and treating with CNO under various conditions, I found that M3D-arr activation increased mature hERG expression and current. Within this paradigm, M3D-arr recruited β-arrestin to the plasma membrane, and promoted the PI3K-dependent activation of Akt. I further found that the activated Akt acted through phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) and Rab11 to facilitate endosomal recycling of hERG channels to the plasma membrane.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Knot/knotting Practice in Craft and Space is a three part research-creation project that used a study of knotting techniques to locate craft in an expanded field of spatial practice. The first part consisted of practical, studio based exercises in which I worked with various natural and synthetic fibres to learn common knotting techniques. The second part was an art historical study that combined craft and architecture history with critical theory related to the social production of space. The third part was an exhibition of drawing and knotted objects titled Opening Closures.&#xD;
&#xD;
This document unifies the lines inquiry that define my project. The first chapter presents the art historical justification for knotting to be understood as a spatial practice. Nineteenth-century German architect and theorist Gottfried Semper’s idea that architectural form is derived from four basic material practices allies craft and architecture in my project and is the point of departure from which I make my argument. In the second chapter, to consider the methodological concerns of research-creation as a form of knowledge production and dissemination, I adopt the format of an instruction manual to conduct an analysis of knot types and to provide instructions for the production of several common knots. In the third chapter, I address the formal and conceptual underpinnings of each artwork presented in my exhibition. I conclude with a proposal for an expanded field of spatial practice by adapting art critic and theorist Rosalind Krauss’s well-known framework for assessing sculpture in 1960s.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Measuring and tracking athletic performance is crucial to an athlete’s development and the countermovement vertical jump is often used to measure athletic performance, particularly lower limb power. The linear power developed in the lower limb is estimated through jump height. However, the relationship between angular power, produced by the joints of the lower limb, and jump height is not well understood. This study examined the contributions of the kinetic value of angular power, and its kinematic component, angular velocity, of the lower limb joints to jump height in the countermovement vertical jump. Kinematic and kinetic data were gathered from twenty varsity-level basketball and volleyball athletes as they performed six maximal effort jumps in four arm swing conditions: no-arm involvement, single-non-dominant arm swing, single-dominant arm swing, and two-arm swing. The displacement of the whole body centre of mass, peak joint powers, peak angular velocity, and locations of the peaks as a percentage of the jump’s takeoff period, were computed. Linear regressions assessed the relationship of the variables to jump height.&#xD;
Results demonstrated that knee peak power (p = 0.001, ß = 0.363, r = 0.363), its location within takeoff period (p = 0.023, ß = -0.256, r = 0.256), and peak knee peak angular velocity (p = 0.005, ß = 0.310, r = 0.310) were moderately linked to increased jump height. Additionally, the location, within the takeoff period, of the peak angular velocities of the hip (p = 0.003, ß = -0.318, r = 0.419) and ankle (p = 0.011, ß = 0.270, r = 0.419) were positively linked to jump height. These results highlight the importance of training the velocity and timing of joint motion beyond traditional power training protocols as well as the importance of further investigation into appropriate testing protocol that is sensitive to the contributions by individual joints in maximal effort jumping.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Los Negritos porphyry copper deposit is located ~ 4 km to the northeast of Carmen de Andacollo Mine in the Chilean Cretaceous metallogenic belt. The mineralization is hosted in andesite of the Quebrada Marquesa Formation and a series of at least four early to intramineral porphyry intrusive rock types: plagioclase quartz biotite porphyry (P1b and P1a dated at 109.60± 0.75 Ma and 107.22± 0.40 Ma); plagioclase biotite porphyry (P2: 106.30 ± 0.47 Ma); and quartz plagioclase biotite porphyry (P3: 106.19 ± 0.42 Ma). These units are cut by late‐ to post‐mineral plagioclase‐hornblende porphyritic rocks (P4b: 106.20 ± 0.69 Ma and P4a: 106.50 ± 0.68 Ma). The earliest intrusive units (P1) were affected by an initial stage of K‐feldspar‐biotite alteration, with chalcopyrite, molybdenite (date at 108.5 ± 0.5 Ma) and gold (up to 0.11 ppm), and the surrounding volcanic host rock was overprinted by chlorite‐epidote dominated (propylitic) alteration. Subsequent to the P2 and P3 intrusion, these rocks were affected by albite and then a second stage of potassic alteration. The Ti and Ba contents in hydrothermal biotite are notably lower (typically Ti = 0.100‐0.144 a.p.f.u. and Ba = 0.001‐0.005 a.p.f.u) than in magmatic ones (generally Ti = 0.186‐0.222 a.p.f.u. and Ba = 0.014‐0.023 a.p.f.u.), and constitute an excellent discriminant of the nature of biotite.&#xD;
These early stages of alteration were overprinted by copper‐molybdenum bearing chlorite‐sericite alteration at 106.60 ± 0.5 Ma (Re‐Os age in molybdenite) and by quartz‐sericite‐pyrite veins (phyllic), respectively in the southwest and northeast areas. The average temperature associated with these two alteration facies is estimated around 305 °C. Weak albite‐calcite alteration, spatially associated with sulfosalts and distributed along the margins of P3, overprinted the phyllic facies.&#xD;
The intrusive rock units at the Los Negritos and Carmen de Andacollo deposits are geochemically classified as diorite to granodiorite with a calc‐alkaline magmatic affinity, and formed in a volcanic arc setting from partial melting of a metasomatized mantle wedge. They are interpreted to be cogenetic, and related to a common long‐lived magma chamber that emplaced during a period of tectonic inversion known as the Subhercynian, Peruvian or Pacific event.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper explores the ways in which the construction of militarized masculinities in Cold War&#xD;
Canadian media reflected the hegemonic masculinities and broader social trends of the period.&#xD;
This paper focuses specifically on the recruiting materials produced for and by the Canadian&#xD;
Army between 1956 and 1959, the time of the Suez Canal Crisis and the beginnings of&#xD;
“Canadian peacekeeping.” Through the mobilization of modern and anti-modern masculine&#xD;
identities attached to hegemonic and idealized Cold War Canadian masculinities, the Army&#xD;
created the image of the “Modern Warrior” to portray itself as an occupation and culture for “real&#xD;
Canadian men.” This identity simultaneously corresponded with Canada’s new “peacekeeping”&#xD;
identity. By presenting certain images of Canadian manhood as the “ideal” Canadian identity and&#xD;
by associating this “ideal” masculinity with military service, the Army’s recruitment&#xD;
advertisements conflated Cold War rhetoric of service, defence, national citizenship, cultural&#xD;
belonging, and “ideal” ethnicity with a Canadian identity available only to a specific (and often&#xD;
exclusive) segment of society. Because military service has long been considered the crux of&#xD;
citizenship, these advertisements (re)entrenched patterns of middle-class, heterosexual, Anglo-&#xD;
Saxon masculine power and dominance in a time of social uncertainty and cultural anxiety&#xD;
through the reaffirmation of this group’s “privilege” to serve the nation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The psychosis phenotype is thought to exist on a continuum, such that the same symptoms experienced by individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorders can also manifest in the general population to a less severe degree. The subclinical psychotic-like experiences reported by healthy individuals share a number of risk factors with psychotic disorders and confer greater risk of developing a psychotic disorder. Thus, healthy individuals with psychotic-like experiences comprise a valid population in which to study the underlying mechanisms of clinically significant psychotic symptoms. In this thesis, we aimed to further our understanding of psychotic-like experiences and the individuals who report them. We explored the relationships between tasks measuring different aspects of self-awareness and self-reported psychotic-like experiences using data obtained from 30 university students. We found that greater sensitivity to the difference between one’s own voice and another person’s voice predicted fewer symptoms of persecutory ideation. Additionally, we found that greater tendency to misattribute one’s own voice to an external source predicted greater symptoms of persecutory ideation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The focus of this thesis is to explore and quantify the response of large-scale solid mass transfer events on satellite-based gravity observations. The gravity signature of large-scale solid mass transfers has not been deeply explored yet; mainly due to the lack of significant events during dedicated satellite gravity missions‘ lifespans. In light of the next generation of gravity missions, the feasibility of employing satellite gravity observations to detect submarine and surface mass transfers is of importance for geoscience (improves the understanding of geodynamic processes) and for geodesy (improves the understanding of the dynamic gravity field). The aim of this thesis is twofold and focuses on assessing the feasibility of using satellite gravity observations for detecting large-scale solid mass transfers and on modeling the impact on the gravity field caused by these events. A methodology that employs 3D forward modeling simulations and 2D wavelet multiresolution analysis is suggested to estimate the impact of solid mass transfers on satellite gravity observations. The gravity signature of various submarine and subaerial events that occurred in the past was estimated. Case studies were conducted to assess the sensitivity and resolvability required in order to observe gravity differences caused by solid mass transfers. Simulation studies were also employed in order to assess the expected contribution of the Next Generation of Gravity Missions for this application.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Assertion is a speech act that stands at the intersection of the philosophy of language and social epistemology. It is a phenomenon that bears on such wide-ranging topics as testimony, truth, meaning, knowledge and trust. It is thus no surprise that analytic philosophers have devoted innumerable pages to assertion, trying to give the norms that govern it, its role in the transmission of knowledge, and most importantly, what assertion is, or how assertion is to be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis I attempt to show that all previous answers to the question “What is assertion?” are flawed. There are four major traditions in the literature: constitutive norm theories of assertion, accounts that treat assertion as the expression of speaker attitudes, accounts that treat assertion as a proposal to add some proposition to the common ground, and accounts that treat assertion as the taking of responsibility for some claim. Each tradition is explored here, the leading theories within the tradition developed, and then placed under scrutiny to demonstrate flaws within the positions surveyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
I follow the work of G.E. Moore and William P. Alston, whilst drawing on the work of Robert Brandom in order to give a new bipartite theory of assertion. I argue that assertion consists in the explicit presentation of a proposition, along with a taking of responsibility for that proposition. Taking Alston's explicit presentation condition and repairing it in order to deal with problems it faces, whilst combining it with Brandom's responsibility condition, provides, I believe, the best account of assertion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite its large impact on the individual and society, we currently have only a rudimentary understanding of the biological basis of Major Depressive Disorder, even less so in adolescent populations. This thesis focuses on two research questions.  First, how do adolescents with depression differ from adolescents who have never been depressed on (1a) brain morphology and (1b) DNA methylation? We studied differences in the fronto-limbic system (a collection of areas responsible for emotion regulation) and methylation at the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and FK506 binding protein gene (FKBP5) genes (two genes strongly linked to stress regulation and depression).  Second, how does childhood trauma, which is known to increase risk for depression, affect (2a) brain development and (2b) SLC6A4 and FKBP5 methylation?  Further, (2c) how might DNA methylation explain how trauma affects brain development in depression?  We studied these questions in 24 adolescent depressed patients and 21 controls.  We found that (1a) depressed adolescents had decreased left precuneus volume and greater volume of the left precentral gyrus compared to controls; however, no differences in fronto-limbic morphology were identified.  Moreover, (1b) individuals with depression had lower levels of FKBP5 methylation than controls.  In line with our second hypothesis (2a) greater levels of trauma were associated with decreased volume of a number of fronto-limbic regions.  Further, we found that (2b) greater trauma was associated with decreased SLC6A4, but not FKBP5, methylation.   Finally, (2c) greater FKBP5, but not SLC6A4, methylation was associated with decreased volume of a number of fronto-limbic regions.  The results of this study suggest an association among trauma, DNA methylation and brain development in youth, but the direction of these relationships appears to be inconsistent.  Future studies using a longitudinal design will be necessary to clarify these results and help us understand how the brain and epigenome change over time in depressed youth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>South’s Africa’s position as global platinum supplier provides a unique opportunity for an emergent fuel cell industry. The innovative technology’s reliance on platinum has sparked interest in the mining sector, promoting the clean energy-producing devices in their own operations. This research focuses upon contemporary structures of racial oppression within the industry, to analyse how these dynamics influence the development and implementation of innovative technology. It also challenges the sustainability discourse associated with fuel cell technology in South Africa.&#xD;
The study follows a qualitative research approach, incorporating a political ecology focus to highlight the politicized nature of these interactions. The methodology incorporates a literature review, key informant interviews, fieldwork observations and document analysis. Findings indicate that the implementation of fuel cell technology in South Africa’s platinum mines will disproportionately burden historically disadvantaged South Africans, with the lack in technical knowledge-base considered a major challenge. Additionally, it was found that sustainability claims surrounding fuel cell technology are largely based on environmental characteristics. This has resulted in an oversimplification and a depoliticised account of the impacts of the technology. &#xD;
This study looked critically at the convergence of history and innovation, placing emphasis on context, power relations and knowledge to provide a more holistic account of the research problem. Opportunities exist for making a meaningful and viable contribution towards development and sustainability by means of investing in a South African fuel cell industry. The challenge will be in deliberately seeking pathways which address the more complex components of sustainability, benefitting all stakeholders and paying particular attention to the historical, political and social contexts from which the technology emerges. It is this particular context which allows for a questioning and perhaps even a re-evaluation of the sustainability narratives broadly applied to fuel cell technology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous research on person perception has shown that people form first impressions with remarkable speed and accuracy, but relatively little is known about the speed and accuracy of trustworthiness judgments across cultures. The present research examined these by asking Chinese and Canadians to infer trustworthiness from faces of criminals and non-criminals from different cultural backgrounds across two domains (i.e., financial crime in Study 1 and violent crime in Study 2). Across both studies, we found that when participants were given time and opportunity, Chinese tended to take a longer time than Canadians to make trustworthiness judgments (although this difference did not reach statistical significance in Study 2). In Study 1, we found that perceivers from both cultures were accurate at judging European North Americans (ENA) corporate criminals as less trustworthy than ENA non-criminal executives, although they did not differentiate Asian corporate criminals from Asian non-criminal executives. In Study 2, we found that perceivers from both cultures were accurate at judging both Asian and ENA violent criminals as less trustworthy than Asian and ENA non-criminals. Chinese were also accurate at rating Middle Eastern violent criminals as less trustworthy than Middle Eastern non-criminals, but Canadians did not differentiate them in terms of their trustworthiness ratings. In terms of their crime likelihood ratings, however, both Chinese and Canadians accurately rated all the criminals as more likely to commit violent crimes than the non-criminals, regardless of the targets’ ethnicities. Finally, we discussed some of the practical implications of our findings on detection of deception, as well as how providing a context for trustworthiness judgments might have played an important role in people’s judgmental accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: As the global population is ageing, studying cognitive impairments including dementia, one of the leading causes of disability in old age worldwide, is of fundamental importance to public health. As a major transition in older age, a focus on the complex impacts of the duration, timing, and voluntariness of retirement on health is important for policy changes in the future. Longer retirement periods, as well as leaving the workforce early, have been associated with poorer health, including reduced cognitive functioning. These associations are hypothesized to differ based on gender, as well as on pre-retirement educational and occupational experiences, and on post-retirement social factors and health conditions. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: A cross-sectional study is conducted to determine the relationship between duration and timing of retirement and cognitive function, using data from the five sites of International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS). Cognitive function is assessed using the Leganes Cognitive Test (LCT) scores in 2012. Data are analyzed using multiple linear regressions. Analyses are also done by site/region separately (Canada, Latin America, and Albania). Robustness checks are done with an analysis of cognitive change from 2012 to 2014, the effect of voluntariness of retirement on cognitive function. An instrumental variable (IV) approach is also applied to the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses as a robustness check to address the potential endogeneity of the retirement variable. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Descriptive statistics highlight differences between men and women, as well as between sites. In linear regression analysis, there was no relationship between timing or duration of retirement and cognitive function in 2012, when adjusting for site/region. There was no association between retirement characteristics and cognitive function in site/region/stratified analyses. In IV analysis, longer retirement and on time or late retirement was associated with lower cognitive function among men. In IV analysis, there is no relationship between retirement characteristics and cognitive function among women. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: While results of the thesis suggest a negative effect of retirement on cognitive function, especially among men, the relationship remains uncertain. A lack of power results in the inability to draw conclusions for site/region-specific analysis and site-adjusted analysis in both linear and IV regressions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Drawing upon Ontario Social Science and History curriculum documents and textbook imagery and language, this paper examines how narratives of settler landownership strategically present Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples within the Canadian grand narrative. The curriculum and text material educators and learners are guided by ignore ongoing colonial violence towards Indigenous peoples and perpetuate the ideology of inevitable ‘peaceful’ interrelationships in national contexts. Learners develop identities in relation to land and how land is acquired. They come to understand themselves as part of a just nation in the particular sequence of Canadian Social Science and History teaching and learning. To go beyond simply adding content about Indigenous peoples in the classroom, educators and learners must adapt a decolonial approach to instead learn from Indigenous perspectives. Such a methodology would require the opening of a “third space” where the transmission of western curricular knowledge is interrupted. Educators and learners must create a space for problematizing the source itself and deconstruct the national grand narrative using inquiry, questioning and reflection, rather than repetition and regurgitation. This analysis reveals that particular placements of Indigenous peoples and settler Canadians in curriculum and classroom text material must be challenged by educators and learners to disrupt colonial narratives and to seek ongoing reconciliatory opportunities in and beyond the school walls.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Since 2008, more than 6000 Bhutanese refugees have been resettled in over 21 communities across Canada, with nearly 300 individuals residing in Ottawa. This resettling process is associated with physical and psychological stress, as individuals acclimatize to a new country. A lack of understanding of the impact of this transition exists. This study assessed the relationship between coping strategies and psychological well-being of Bhutanese refugees resettled in Ottawa.&#xD;
A cross sectional survey of a representative sample of Bhutanese adults (n = 110) was conducted between November and December 2015. Coping strategies and psychological well-being were measured using the Brief COPE and General Well-being (GWB) scales. The total GWB mean score of 69.04 ± 12.09 suggests that respondents were in moderate distress. GWB did not significantly differ by sex, marital status, religion, employment, part time or full time job, or length of stay in Canada. Using multiple linear regression, significant independent variables from univariate analysis with GWB (age, education, positive reframing, self-blame and venting) were modeled to determine the best predictors of general well-being (GWB, F (11, 96) = 3.61, p &lt; .001, R² = 21.2%). Higher levels of education and positive reframing were associated with greater GWB scores while self-blame and ages 41-50 were inversely associated with general well-being. &#xD;
It was found that above 66% of the unemployed participants were from age groups 41 and above. This finding suggests that career guidance services and vocational training to address unemployment may benefit this community. Nurses can provide support and counselling to assist refugees to minimize the use of negative coping strategies like self-blame and venting and promote positive coping strategies. Further, collaboration between nurses, other interdisciplinary professionals and community organizations is necessary to address social determinants of health and enhance refugee psychological well-being.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The formulation of a geotechnical model and the associated prediction of the mechanical behaviour is a challenge engineers need to overcome in order to optimize tunnel design and meet project requirements. Special challenges arise in cases where rocks and rockmasses are susceptible to time-effects and time-dependent processes govern. Progressive rockmass deformation and instability, time-dependent overloading of support and delayed failures are commonly the result of time-dependent phenomena.&#xD;
	The research work presented in this thesis serves as an attempt to provide more insight into the time-dependent behaviour of rocks. Emphasis is given on investigating and analyzing creep deformation and time-dependent stress relaxation phenomenon at the laboratory scale and in-depth analyses are presented. This thesis further develops the understanding of these phenomena and practical yet scientific tools for estimating and predicting the long-term strength and the maximum stress relaxation of rock materials are proposed. The identification of the existence of three distinct behavioural stages during stress relaxation is presented and discussed.&#xD;
	The main observations associated with time-dependent behaviour are employed in numerical analyses and applied at the tunnel scale. A new approach for simulating and capturing the time-dependent behaviour coupled with the tunnel advancement effect is also developed and analyzed. Guidance is provided to increase the understanding of the support-rockmass interaction and the main implications and significance of time-dependent behaviour associated with rock tunnelling are discussed. &#xD;
	The work presented in this thesis advances the scientific understanding of time-dependent rock and rockmass behaviour, increases the awareness of how such phenomena are captured numerically, and lays out a framework for dealing with such deformations when predicting tunnel deformations. Practical aspects of this thesis are also presented, which will increase their usage in the associated industries and close the gap between the scientific and industry communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Tree planting is one of the most physically demanding occupations in Canada and as a result, tree planters are at an elevated risk of injury, specifically at the wrist. Wrist injuries develop on account of the highly repetitive nature of the job, as well as other musculoskeletal risk factors including non-neutral wrist postures and high impact forces sustained at the wrist during shovel-ground impact.  As a result, wrist brace use has become common among planters, in an effort to limit deviated wrist postures while also providing enhanced stability at the wrist.  The external stability provided by a wrist brace is thought to reduce the muscular effort required to provide stiffness at the wrist during shovel-ground impact. Since these prospective benefits have not been formally investigated, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a wrist brace on wrist posture, muscle activity, and joint rotational stiffness about the wrist joint (for two degrees of freedom: flexion/extension and ulnar/radial deviation). We hypothesized that the brace would promote more neutrally aligned wrist angles, and that muscle activity and joint rotational stiffness would also decrease when participants wore the brace. &#xD;
Fourteen tree planters with at least one season of experience were recruited to complete two planting conditions in a laboratory setting: one condition while wearing the brace (with brace, WB) and one condition without the brace (no brace, NB). The results from this study showed that at shovel-ground impact muscle activity trended towards increasing in three muscles when participants wore the brace. Additionally, wrist angles improved about the flexion/extension axis of rotation while increasing in deviation about the ulnar/radial axis of rotation when participants wore the brace. Joint rotational stiffness increased when participants wore the wrist brace. Participants from this study indicated difficulty gripping the shovel due to the bulk of the wrist brace, and this feature is discussed with possible suggestions for future iterations of design. In addition to grip diameter this analysis also prompts the suggestion that hand length and experience should also be considered in the design of tree planting tools, specifically an ergonomic aid such as a wrist brace.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>When plastic pipe is solidified, it proceeds through a long cooling chamber.  Inside this chamber, inside the hollow extrudate, the plastic is molten, and this inner surface solidifies last. Sag, the flow due to the self-weight of the molten plastic, then happens in this cooling chamber, and sometimes, thickened regions (called knuckles) arise in the lower quadrants, especially of large diameter thickwalled pipes. To compensate for sag, engineers normally shift the die centerpiece downward. This thesis focuses on the consequences of this decentering. Specifically, when the molten polymer is viscoelastic, as is normally the case, a downward lateral force is exerted on the mandrel. Die eccentricity also affects the downstream axial force on the mandrel. These forces govern how rigidly the mandrel must be attached (normally, on a spider die). We attack this flow problem in eccentric cylindrical coordinates, using the Oldroyd 8-constant constitutive model framework. Specifically, we revise the method of Jones (1964), called polymer process partitioning. We estimate both axial and lateral forces. We develop a corresponding map to help plastics engineers predict the extrudate shape, including extrudate knuckles. From the mass balance over the postdie region, we then predict the shape of the extrudate entering the cooling chamber. We further include expressions for the stresses in the extruded polymer melt. We include detailed dimensional worked examples to show process engineers how to use our results to design pipe dies, and especially to suppress extrudate knuckling.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bidirectional DC-DC converters are widely used in different applications such as energy storage systems, Electric Vehicles (EVs), UPS, etc. In particular, future EVs require bidirectional power flow in order to integrate energy storage units into smart grids. These bidirectional power converters provide Grid to Vehicle (V2G)/ Vehicle to Grid (G2V) power flow capability for future EVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
 Generally, there are two control loops used for bidirectional DC-DC converters: The inner current loop and The outer loop. The control of DAB converters used in EVs are proved to be challenging due to the wide range of operating conditions and non-linear behavior of the converter. In this thesis, the precise   mathematical model  of the converter is derived and non-linear control schemes are proposed for the control system of bidirectional DC-DC converters based on the derived model. The proposed inner current control technique is developed based on a novel Geometric-Sequence Control (GSC) approach. The proposed control technique offers significantly improved performance as compared to one for conventional  control approaches. The proposed technique  utilizes a simple control algorithm which saves on the computational resources. Therefore, it has higher reliability, which is essential in this application. Although, the proposed control technique is based on the mathematical model of the converter, its robustness against parameter uncertainties is proven. &#xD;
 &#xD;
 Three different control modes for charging the traction batteries in EVs are investigated in this thesis: the voltage mode control, the current mode control, and the power mode control. The outer loop control is determined by each of the three control modes. The structure of the outer control loop  provides the current reference for the inner current loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
Comprehensive computer simulations have been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed control methods. In addition, the proposed control have been  verified on a 3.3 kW    experimental prototype. Simulation and experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed control techniques over the conventional ones.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To achieve academic success, children with learning-related disabilities often receive special education supports at school. Currently, Canada does not have a federal department or integrated national system of education. Instead, each province and territory has a separate department or ministry that is responsible for the organization and delivery of education, including special education, at the elementary level. At the macro (national) level, inclusive education is the policy across Canada. However, each province and territory has its own legislation, definitions, and policies mandating special education services. These variations result in little consistency at the micro (individual school) level. Differences between eligibility requirements, supports offered, and delivery methods may present challenges for highly mobile families who must navigate new special education systems on behalf of their children with medical or learning challenges. One of the defining features of the Canadian military lifestyle is geographic mobility. As a result, many families are tasked with navigating new school systems for their children, a task that may be more difficult when children require special education services. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of geographic mobility on Canadian military families and their children’s access to special education services. The secondary objective was to gain insight into supports that helped facilitate access to services, as well as supports that participants believe would have helped facilitate access. A qualitative approach, interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA), was employed due to of its focus on individuals’ experiences and their understandings of a particular phenomenon. IPA allowed participants to reflect on the significance of their experiences, while the researcher engaged with these reflections to make sense of the meanings associated with their experiences.  Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with civilian caregivers who have a child with special education needs. An interview guide and probes were used to elicit rich, detailed, first-person accounts of their experiences navigating new special education systems. The main themes that emerged from the participants’ combined experiences addressed the emotional components of experiencing a transition, factors that may facilitate access to special education services, and career implications associated with accessing and maintaining special education services. Findings from the study illustrate that Canadian families experience many, and often times severe, barriers to accessing special education services after a posting. Furthermore, the impacts reported throughout the study echo the existing American literature on geographic mobility and access to special education services. Building on the literature, this study also highlights the need for further research exploring factors that create unique barriers to access in a Canadian context, resulting from the current special education climate, military policies, and military family support services.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this work I study the optical properties of helical particles and chiral sculptured thin films, using computational modeling (discrete dipole approximation, Berreman calculus), and experimental techniques (glancing angle deposition, ellipsometry, scatterometry, and non-linear optical measurements).&#xD;
The first part of this work focuses on linear optics, namely light scattering from helical microparticles. I study the influence of structural parameters and orientation on the optical properties of particles: circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotation (OR), and show that as a consequence of random orientation, CD and OR can have the opposite sign, compared to that of the oriented particle, potentially resulting in ambiguity of measurement interpretation. &#xD;
Additionally, particles in random orientation scatter light with circular and elliptical polarization states, which implies that in order to study multiple scattering from randomly oriented chiral particles, the polarization state of light cannot be disregarded.&#xD;
To perform experiments and attempt to produce particles, a newly constructed multi stage thin film coating chamber is calibrated. It enables the simultaneous fabrication of multiple sculptured thin film coatings, each with different structure. With it I successfully produce helical thin film coatings with Ti and TiO_{2}.&#xD;
The second part of this work focuses on non-linear optics, with special emphasis on second-harmonic generation. The scientific literature shows extensive experimental and theoretical work on second harmonic generation from chiral thin films. Such films are expected to always show this non-linear effect, due to their lack of inversion symmetry. However no experimental studies report non-linear response of chiral sculptured thin films. In this work I grow films suitable for a second harmonic generation experiment, and report the first measurements of non-linear response.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hurricane Sandy was the largest storm on historical record in the Atlantic Ocean&#xD;
basin with extensive coastal damage caused by large waves and high storm surge.&#xD;
The primary objectives of this thesis are to compare and evaluate three different&#xD;
spatially-varying surface wind fields of Hurricane Sandy to investigate the impact&#xD;
of the differences between the complex wind fields on predictions of the sea surface evolution, and to evaluate the impact of the storm on the hydrodynamics in Great South Bay (GSB) and the discharge of ocean water into the back-barrier bay from overwash over Fire Island.&#xD;
Three different spatially-varying surface wind fields were evaluated and compared&#xD;
to wind observations, including the parametric Holland (1980) model (H80), the parametric Generalized Asymmetric Holland Model (GAHM), and results from the WeatherFlow Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (WRAMS). The winds were used to&#xD;
drive the coupled Delft3D-SWAN hydrodynamic and ocean wave models on a regional grid. The results indicate that the WRAMS wind field produces wave model&#xD;
predictions in the best agreement with significant wave height observations, followed by the GAHM and H80 wind fields and that a regional atmospheric wind model is best for hindcasting hurricane waves and water levels when detailed observations are available, while a parametric vortex model is best for forecasting hurricane sea surface conditions. &#xD;
Using a series of four connected Delft3D-SWAN grids to achieve finer resolution&#xD;
over Fire Island and GSB, a higher resolution WRAMS was used to predict waves and storm surge. The results indicate that strong local winds have the largest influence on water level fluctuations in GSB. Three numerical solutions were conducted with varying extents of barrier island overwash. The simulations allowing for minor and major overwash indicated good agreement with observations in the east end of GSB and suggest that island overwash provided a significant contribution of ocean water to GSB during the storm. Limiting the overwash in the numerical model directly impacts the total discharge into GSB from the ocean through existing inlets. The results of this study indicate that barrier island overwash had a significant impact on the water levels in eastern GSB.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is a place where a Canadian citizen can be sent to 30 days detention, by someone who is not a judge, without being represented by counsel, and without having a meaningful right to appeal. It is the summary trial system of the Canadian Armed Forces. This thesis analyses that system and suggests reforms. It is aimed at those who have an interest in improving the administration of military justice at the unit level but want to sufficiently understand the issues before doing so.&#xD;
	Through a classic legal approach with elements of legal history and comparative law, this study begins by setting military justice in the Canadian legal firmament. The introductory chapter also explains fundamental concepts, first and foremost the broader notion of discipline, for which summary trial is one of the last maintaining tools. Chapter II describes the current system. An overview of its historical background is first given. Then, each procedural step is demystified, from investigation until review.&#xD;
Chapter III identifies potential breaches of the Charter, highlighting those that put the system at greater constitutional risk: the lack of judicial independence, the absence of hearing transcript, the lack of legal representation and the disparity of treatment between ranks. Alternatives adopted in the Canadian Armed Forces and in foreign jurisdictions, from both common law and civil law traditions, in addressing similar challenges are reviewed in Chapter IV.&#xD;
Chapter V analyses whether the breaches could nevertheless be justified in a free and democratic society. Its conclusion is that, considering the availability of reasonable alternatives, it would be hard to convince a court that the current system is a legitimate impairment of the individual’s legal rights.&#xD;
The conclusion Chapter presents options to address current challenges. First, the approach of ‘depenalization’ taken by the Government in recent Bill C-71 is analysed and criticised. The ‘judicialization’ approach is advocated through a series of 16 recommendations designed not only to strengthen the constitutionality of the system but also to improve the administration of military justice in furtherance of service members’ legal rights.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: Follow-up care aims to provide surveillance with early detection of recurring cancers and to address treatment complications and other health issues in survivorship. It is assumed that follow-up care fulfills these aims, however little evidence supports routine surveillance detecting curable disease early enough to improve survival. Cancer survivors are a diverse patient population, suggesting that a single follow-up regimen may not meet all patients’ follow-up needs. Little is known about what effective follow-up care should include for head and neck cancer patients in a Canadian setting. Identification of subgroups of patients with specific needs and current practices would allow for hypotheses to be generated for enhancing follow-up care.&#xD;
OBJECTIVES: 1a) To describe the follow-up needs and preferences of head and neck cancer patients, 1b) to identify which patient characteristics predict needs and preferences, 1c) to evaluate how needs and preferences change over time, 2a) to describe follow-up care practices by physician visits and imaging tests, and 2b) to identify factors associated to the delivered follow-up care.&#xD;
METHODS: 1) 175 patients who completed treatment between 2012 and 2013 in Kingston and London, Ontario were recruited to participate in a prospective survey study on patients’ needs and preferences in follow-up care. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed to describe patient survey responses and to identify patient characteristics that predicted needs and preferences. 2) A retrospective cohort study of 3975 patients on routine follow-up from 2007 to 2015 was carried out using data linkages across registry and administrative databases to describe follow-up practices in Ontario by visits and tests. Multivariate regression analyses assessed factors related to follow-up care.&#xD;
RESULTS: 1) Patients’ needs and preferences were wide-ranging with several characteristics predicting needs and preferences (ORECOG=2.69 and ORAnxiety=1.13). Needs and preferences declined as patients transitioned into their second year of follow-up (p&lt;0.05). 2) Wide variation in practices was found, with marked differences compared to existing consensus guidelines. Multiple factors were associated with follow-up practices (RRTumor site=0.73 and RRLHIN=1.47).&#xD;
CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics can be used to personalize care and guidelines are not informing practice. Future research should evaluate individualized approaches to follow-up care.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stress during early development produces lasting effects on psychopathological outcomes. The impact of prior intermittent, physical stress (IPS) during early-adolescence (PD 22-33) on anxiety-related behaviour of female rats was analyzed in adulthood. After behavioural testing, serotonergic innervation was evaluated using immunohistochemistry for the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus. Administration of IPS (i.e., water immersion, elevated platform, foot shock) in early adolescence increased rats’ anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze but had no effects in the shock-probe burying test. In the social interaction test, IPS decreased social interaction, and this effect was driven by selective decreases in the duration of playfighting with no evident changes in contact or investigative behaviour.  Selective stress-induced increases in SERT-immunoreactive axon density were found in the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the mPFC, but not in the cingulate or prelimbic (PL) subregions. IPS in early adolescence did not affect serotonergic innervation profiles in any sub-fields of the ventral hippocampus. The findings confirm and extend on earlier evidence that stress during early adolescence promotes the emergence of an anxious phenotype, and provide novel evidence that these effects may be mediated, at least in part, by increased serotonergic innervation of the IL mPFC.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is an abundance of research that examines disability and technology in the context of computers and the Internet, however few have examined disability and mobile devices. Also largely absent from existing literature are the voices of disabled people themselves. This dissertation draws upon science and technology studies (STS) and disability studies to address these gaps by conducting in-depth qualitative research that examines disabled people’s experiences using smartphones and tablets. &#xD;
At its core, this dissertation aims to provide insight on the following: 1) an understanding of how disability is perceived in the digital age and the subjective meanings of access, inclusion and equality; 2) the ways in which mobile devices impact the lived experience of disability; and 3) how perspectives in disability studies and STS can be applied to understand the relationship between the body, disability and technology. The empirical contribution of this research draws from participant diaries and interviews with disabled people, as well as from open-ended questionnaires completed by mobile app developers. The concept of ‘subjectivities of disability’ is introduced to refer to the uniquely personal and individual experience of disability. &#xD;
Findings reveal that mobile device use amongst disabled people redefines their subjectivities of disability through socio-technical interactions whereby disabled people use their devices in ways that are integrated into their everyday lives and positively shapes how they view themselves in relation to their experience of disability. The responses from app developers reveal that there is a place for disability in the mobile market and that disabled people play a key role in making apps accessible. The data suggests that mobile devices facilitate access, inclusion and equality by integrating the body in ways that recognize and accommodate diversity. The results furthermore make it clear that the interaction between disabled people and mobile devices takes on an embodied and social characteristic. This research concludes that both on an individual level and collectively, disabled people are engaging with digital artifacts in ways that promote agency and independence as well as reshaping how disability is experienced and perceived in the digital age.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For decades scientists have attempted to use ideas of classical mechanics to choose basis functions for calculating spectra. The hope is that a classically-motivated basis set will be small because it covers only the dynamically important part of phase space. One popular idea is to use phase space localized (PSL) basis functions. This thesis improves on previous efforts to use PSL functions and examines the usefulness of these improvements. Because  the overlap matrix, in the matrix eigenvalue problem obtained by using PSL functions with the variational method, is not an identity, it is costly to use iterative methods to solve the matrix eigenvalue problem. We show that it is possible to circumvent the orthogonality (overlap) problem and use iterative eigensolvers. We also present an altered method of calculating the matrix elements that improves the performance of the PSL basis functions, and also a new method which more efficiently chooses which PSL functions to include. These improvements are applied to a variety of single well molecules. We conclude that for single minimum molecules, the PSL functions are inferior to other basis functions.  However, the ideas developed here can be applied to other types of basis functions, and PSL functions may be useful for multi-well systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One challenge related to transit planning is selecting the appropriate mode: bus, light rail transit (LRT), regional express rail (RER), or subway. This project uses data from life cycle assessment to develop a tool to measure energy requirements for different modes of transit, on a per passenger-kilometer basis. For each of the four transit modes listed, a range of energy requirements associated with different vehicle models and manufacturers was developed. The tool demonstrated that there are distinct ranges where specific transit modes are the best choice. Diesel buses are the clear best choice from 7-51 passengers, LRTs make the most sense from 201-427 passengers, and subways are the best choice above 918 passengers. There are a number of other passenger loading ranges where more than one transit mode makes sense; in particular, LRT and RER represent very energy-efficient options for ridership ranging from 200 to 900 passengers. The tool developed in the thesis was used to analyze the Bloor-Danforth subway line in Toronto using estimated ridership for weekday morning peak hours. It was found that ridership across the line is for the most part actually insufficient to justify subways over LRTs or RER. This suggests that extensions to the existing Bloor-Danforth line should consider LRT options, which could service the passenger loads at the ends of the line with far greater energy efficiency. It was also clear that additional destinations along the entire transit line are necessary to increase the per passenger-kilometer energy efficiency, as the current pattern of commuting to downtown leaves much of the system underutilized. It is hoped that the tool developed in this thesis can be used as an additional resource in the transit mode decision-making process for many developing transportation systems, including the transit systems across the GTHA.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Traditionally, importance has been measured using subjective measures. The present thesis explores the possibility of a second type of importance, designated as “associative importance”. A new measure, the IIAT, was designed to capture the strength of association between an object and the attribute of importance. This thesis then evaluated the validity of the IIAT via an intervention paradigm in 2 studies, and by using the measure to predict a memory outcome in 2 other studies. Subjective measures of importance were also included in these studies and correlations between subjective measures and IIAT results were examined. Across all 4 studies, subjective-objective correlations were weak to modest and non-significant. The intervention studies provided promising evidence that interventions do affect associative importance as measured by the IIAT. The prediction studies provided somewhat mixed, but encouraging evidence that the IIAT may be able to predict memory performance. Notably, subjective measures were not able to predict memory performance at all, whereas the IIAT was able to predict some memory indices. Overall, there is some evidence supporting the existence of an associative importance construct, and that the IIAT provides valid results that are nonetheless different from that of subjective measures of attitude importance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: Across Canada, undergraduate university students are one of the highest alcohol-consuming populations. Many students engage in hazardous drinking and are at risk for negative health and social consequences. Social Norms Theory suggests that students’ overestimation of drinking norms can result in an increase in their drinking behaviour. As of yet, none of the literature addresses the possible link between drinking norm (mis)perception and hazardous drinking in a Canadian undergraduate context. This is the first Canadian study to examine this potential association in first-year undergraduate students across multiple universities using gender as an effect modifier.&#xD;
Methods: Using data collected by the Caring Campus Project, for 2347 first-year students from three Canadian universities, I evaluated the prevalence of drinking norm misperceptions by site and gender. Using multiple-logistic regression models, I analyzed the relationship between misperceived drinking norms and hazardous drinking behaviours (assessed via AUDIT-C).&#xD;
Results: The proportion of students who overestimated drinking and binge drinking frequency norms varied by site and gender. There was a positive relationship between overestimated drinking/ binge drinking frequency norms and hazardous drinking, modified by gender. Controlling for living arrangement and site, the odds of female students being hazardous drinkers increased by a factor of 2.27 (CI: 1.73-2.99) when the drinking frequency norm was overestimated.  A non-significant association was found for male students. Among female students, when living arrangement and site were controlled, the odds of being a hazardous drinker were 1.83 (0.84-3.95) and 2.69 (1.24-5.83) times greater when the drinking frequency norm was perceived at “2-4 times per month” and “2 or more times per week”, respectively. Among male students, when living arrangement, previous residence and site were controlled, the odds of being a hazardous drinker were 4.03 (2.62-6.19) and 8.54 (5.41-13.49) times greater when the binge drinking frequency norm was perceived at “2-4 times per month” and “2 or more times per week”, respectively. &#xD;
Conclusion: This novel study enhances the understanding of the association between (mis)perceived drinking norms and drinking behaviours in Canadian undergraduate students. The demonstrated importance of gender and site provides a strong impetus for Canadian universities to develop targeted alcohol reduction interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The first objective of this research was to develop closed-form and numerical probabilistic methods of analysis that can be applied to otherwise conventional methods of unreinforced and geosynthetic reinforced slopes and walls. These probabilistic methods explicitly include random variability of soil and reinforcement, spatial variability of the soil, and cross-correlation between soil input parameters on probability of failure. The quantitative impact of simultaneously considering the influence of random and/or spatial variability in soil properties in combination with cross-correlation in soil properties is investigated for the first time in the research literature. Depending on the magnitude of these statistical descriptors, margins of safety based on conventional notions of safety may be very different from margins of safety expressed in terms of probability of failure (or reliability index). The thesis work also shows that intuitive notions of margin of safety using conventional factor of safety and probability of failure can be brought into alignment when cross-correlation between soil properties is considered in a rigorous manner. &#xD;
The second objective of this thesis work was to develop a general closed-form solution to compute the true probability of failure (or reliability index) of a simple linear limit state function with one load term and one resistance term expressed first in general probabilistic terms and then migrated to a LRFD format for the purpose of LRFD calibration. The formulation considers contributions to probability of failure due to model type, uncertainty in bias values, bias dependencies, uncertainty in estimates of nominal values for correlated and uncorrelated load and resistance terms, and average margin of safety expressed as the operational factor of safety (OFS). Bias is defined as the ratio of measured to predicted value. Parametric analyses were carried out to show that ignoring possible correlations between random variables can lead to conservative (safe) values of resistance factor in some cases and in other cases to non-conservative (unsafe) values. Example LRFD calibrations were carried out using different load and resistance models for the pullout internal stability limit state of steel strip and geosynthetic reinforced soil walls together with matching bias data reported in the literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The overall purpose of this study was to explain the overlap and distinctiveness of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality from a diathesis-stress perspective. The first part of this study evaluated the third variable theory as an explanation for the high rates of lifetime co-occurrence between NSSI and suicidality. Specifically, it was hypothesized that these forms of self-harm share a common vulnerability profile comprised of five affective, cognitive and behavioural diatheses. The second part of this study tested the hypothesis that NSSI and suicidality become distinguishable on the basis of immediate, proximal stressors, namely psychache and survival and coping beliefs (SCB). Participants (N = 262) were community individuals aged 16-24 years who reported either no history of self-harm (i.e., no history of NSSI, suicidality, or both), a history of NSSI, suicidality or both, or current NSSI-only or current NSSI+suicidality. They were recruited online to complete an online battery of questionnaires.  Using a set of discriminant function analyses, it was found that the vulnerability profile was unable to distinguish between the three self-harm groups, but was able to differentiate the no self-harm group from a collated self-harm group. Result patterns were also analyzed for gender differences. It was also found that a current NSSI+suicidality group exhibited significantly higher psychache and lower SCB (for women only) than a current NSSI-only group. These results suggest that NSSI and suicidality may tend to co-occur because they have similar long-term diatheses, but that they may become more distinct with respect to immediate psychological stressors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The rate of non-full-time faculty members has increased rapidly over the last decade (Louis, 2009; MacKay, 2014; Meranze &amp; Newfield, 2013), as the post-secondary landscape of fluctuating enrolment, fiscal and operational challenges, and the requirement to hire specialized skill sets have required institutions to rely heavily on this demographic. In the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology (CAATs) system, institutions have tried to preserve and enhance educational quality with fewer resources through greater reliance on non-full-time faculty. &#xD;
The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of teaching and support of non-full-time faculty at one Eastern Ontario college. Employing a narrative inquiry methodology, data were collected from four participants through their writing three individual letters at the end of each month and participating in one interview at the end of the contract period. The data were analyzed and coded. This analysis revealed five themes: motivation, connection and engagement, compensation, teaching and development, and performance evaluation. &#xD;
Differences in the participants’ perceptions tended to reflect divergences across career stage: retired versus early career. The compensation package provided to non-full-time faculty was considered inadequate for those in the early career stage, especially comparing it to that of full-time faculty. In addition, the amount of previous teaching experience was an important indicator for the appropriate level of teaching resources and support provided by the institution. The newer faculty members required a higher level of support to combat feelings of role isolation. The temporary nature of the role made it difficult to establish a feeling of a strong connection to the institution and subsequently opportunities to engage further to deepen the relationship. Despite these differences across participants, autonomous motivators were consistent across all narratives, as participants expressed their desire to teach and share their knowledge to help students achieve their goals. Participants concluded their narratives by sharing future advice for faculty interested in pursuing the role. &#xD;
The narratives provided areas for improvement that would help increase the level of job satisfaction for non-full-time college faculty members: (a) establishing a more thorough performance evaluation process to align with institutional supports, (b) offering more diverse teaching resources to better prepare faculty and enhance teaching practices, (c) overhauling the compensation package to better recognize the amount of time and effort spent in the role and aligning with the compensation provided to full-time faculty, and (d) including rewards and incentives as part of the compensation package to enhance the level of commitment and availability for the role. These changes might well increase the job satisfaction and improve the retention of non-full-time faculty members.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Developmental evaluation (DE) is an evaluation approach that aims to support the development of an innovation  (Patton, 1994, 2011). This aim is achieved through supporting clients’ information needs through evaluative inquiry as they work to develop and refine the innovation. While core concepts and principles are beginning to be articulated and refined, challenges remain as to how to focus a developmental evaluation beyond those knowledge frameworks most immediate to clients to support innovation development. Anchoring a DE in knowledge frameworks other than those of the clients might direct attention to issues not yet obvious to clients, but which might further the goal of supporting innovation development if attended to. Drawing concepts and practices from the field of design may be one avenue with which to inform developmental evaluation in achieving its aim. &#xD;
Through a case study methodology, this research seeks to understand the nuances of operationalizing the guiding principles of DE as well as to investigate the utility, feasibility, and consequences of integrating design concepts and practices into developmental evaluation (design-informed developmental evaluation, “DI-DE”). It does so by documenting the efforts of a design-informed developmental evaluator and a task force of educators and researchers in a Faculty of Education as they work to develop a graduate-level education program. A systematic review into those purposeful efforts made to introduce DI-DE thinking into task force deliberations, and an analysis into the responses and consequences of those efforts shed light on what it had meant to practice DI-DE. As a whole, this research on evaluation is intended to further contemporary thinking about the closely coupled relationship between program development and evaluation in complex and dynamic environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is widely accepted that thyroid hormones (THs) influence gonadal development and functioning; however, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TH-induced effects with regard to reproduction is limited. There is increasing evidence that TH actions are mediated via androgenic mechanisms in gonadal tissues. I first investigated the degree to which induced hypothyroid conditions affect molecular mechanisms underlying crosstalk between the TH and reproductive axes. To do this, frogs were chronically exposed to low concentrations of potassium perchlorate (KClO4) for one year. KClO4 altered TH- and androgen-related gene expression in tissues of both developing and sexually mature Silurana tropicalis frogs; female growth (e.g., body mass, snout vent length, and hind limb length) was reduced and male-biased traits such as plasma androgen content and sperm motility were also negatively impacted. THs (triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)) as well as the deiodinase inhibitor iopanoic acid (IOP) were used as model compounds to further assess the consequences of TH status on select stages in frog development. I also incorporated the use of androgens (testosterone (T), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), and 5β-dihydrotestosterone (5β-DHT)) to elucidate potential reciprocal mechanisms of crosstalk between the androgen and TH axes. Ex vivo exposures using male and female juvenile reproductive tissues were performed to examine mechanisms of crosstalk sans hypophyseal feedback as well as investigate possible sex-specific molecular responses to THs and androgens. Ex vivo exposures provided (i) evidence that TH-related gene expression can be directly regulated by androgens and (ii) demonstrated for the first time the sex-specific transcriptional effects of TH and androgen mediated actions on gonadal tissues of frogs. Lastly, I established sex-determining gene transcript profiles during S. tropicalis early development and investigated the putative role of THs in determining gonadal fate. Elevated TH levels increased the expression of gonadal differentiating genes in larval S. tropicalis and in silico analysis identified TH binding motifs in the putative promoter regions further supporting TH-mediated regulation. This doctoral research provides not only novel mechanistic and developmental insight into the bidirectional crosstalk between the TH and androgen axes, but also elaborates upon the putative role of THs throughout the reproductive lifecycle of frogs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
 	Professional language assessment is a new concept that has great potential to benefit Internationally Educated Professionals and the communities they serve.  This thesis reports on a qualitative study that examined the responses of 16 Canadian English Language Benchmark Assessment for Nurses (CELBAN) test-takers on the topic of their perceptions of the CELBAN test-taking experience in Ontario in the winter of 2015. &#xD;
An Ontario organization involved in registering participants distributed an e-mail through their listserv. Thematic analyses of focus group and interview transcripts identified 7 themes from the data. These themes were used to inform conclusions to the following questions: (1) How do IENs characterize their assessment experience? (2) How do IENs describe the testing constructs measured by the CELBAN? (3) What, if any, potential sources of construct irrelevant variance (CIV) do the test-takers describe based on their assessment experience? (4) Do IENs feel that the CELBAN tasks provide a good reflection of the types of communicative tasks required of a nurse?  &#xD;
Overall, participants reported positive experiences with the CELBAN as an assessment of their language skills, and noted some instances in which they felt some factors external to the assessment impacted their demonstration of their knowledge and skill. Lastly, some test-takers noted the challenge of completing the CELBAN where the types of communicative nursing tasks included in the assessment differed from nursing tasks typical of an IENs country or origin. The findings are discussed in relation to literature on high-stakes large-scale assessment and IEPs, and a set of recommendations are offered to future CELBAN administration. These recommendations include (1) the provision of a webpage listing all licensure requirements (2) monitoring of CELBAN location and dates in relation to the wider certification timeline for applicants (3) The provision of additional CELBAN preparatory materials (4) Minor changes to the CELBAN administrative protocols. Given that the CELBAN is a relatively new assessment format and its widespread use for high-stakes decisions (a component of nursing certification and licensure), research validating IEN-test-taker responses to construct representation and construct irrelevant variance is critical to our understanding of the role of competency testing for IENs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Climate change is expected to have marked impacts on forest ecosystems. In Ontario forests, this includes changes in tree growth, stand composition and disturbance regimes, with expected impacts on many forest-dependent communities, the bioeconomy, and other environmental considerations. In response to climate change, renewable energy systems, such as forest bioenergy, are emerging as critical tools for carbon emissions reductions and climate change mitigation. However, these systems may also need to adapt to changing forest conditions. Therefore, the aim of this research was to estimate changes in forest growth and forest cover in response to anticipated climatic changes in the year 2100 in Ontario forests, to ultimately explore the sustainability of bioenergy in the future. Using the Haliburton Forest and Wildlife Reserve in Ontario as a case study, this research used a spatial climate analog approach to match modeled Haliburton temperature and precipitation (via Fourth Canadian Regional Climate Model) to regions currently exhibiting similar climate (climate analogs). From there, current forest cover and growth rates of core species in Haliburton were compared to forests plots in analog regions from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). This comparison used two different emission scenarios, corresponding to a high and a mid-range emission future. This research then explored how these changes in forests may influence bioenergy feasibility in the future. It examined possible volume availability and composition of bioenergy feedstock under future conditions. This research points to a potential decline of softwoods in the Haliburton region with a simultaneous expansion of pre-established hardwoods such as northern red oak and red maple, as well as a potential loss in sugar maple cover. From a bioenergy perspective, hardwood residues may be the most feasible feedstock in the future with minimal change in biomass availability for energy production; under these possible conditions, small scale combined heat and power (CHP) and residential pellet use may be the most viable and ecologically sustainable options. Ultimately, understanding the way in which forests may change is important in informing meaningful policy and management, allowing for improved forest bioenergy systems, now and in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research is an examination into the ways online abuse functions in certain online spaces. By analyzing text-based online abuse against women who are content creators, this research maps how aspects of violence against women offline extends online. This research examines three different explorations into how online abuse against women functions. Chapter two considers what online abuse against women looks like on Twitter as a case study. This chapter contends that online abuse can be understood as an unintentional use of Twitter’s design. Chapter three focuses specifically on the textual descriptions of sexual violence women who are journalists receive online. Chapter four analyzes Gamergate, an online movement that specifically looks to organize online abuse towards women. Chapter five concludes by meditating on the need to look at a bigger picture that includes cultural shifts that dismantle the normalization of violence against women both on and offline.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is a variant of olefin metathesis used to polymerize strained cyclic olefins. Ruthenium-based Grubbs’ catalysts are widely used in ROMP to produce industrially important products. While highly efficient in organic solvents such as dichloromethane and toluene, these hydrophobic catalysts are not typically applied in aqueous systems. With the advancements in emulsion and miniemulsion polymerization, it is promising to conduct ROMP in an aqueous dispersed phase to generate well-defined latex nanoparticles while improving heat transfer and reducing the use of volatile organic solvents (VOCs). Herein I report the efforts made using a PEGylated ruthenium alkylidene as the catalyst to initiate ROMP in an oil-in-water miniemulsion. 1H NMR revealed that the synthesized PEGylated catalyst was stable and reactive in water. Using 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD) as monomer, we showed the highly efficient catalyst yielded colloidally stable polymer latexes with ~ 100% conversion at room temperature. Kinetic studies demonstrated first-order kinetics with good livingness as confirmed by the shift of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) traces. Depending on the surfactants used, the particle sizes ranged from 100 to 300 nm with monomodal distributions. The more strained cyclic olefin norbornene (NB) could also be efficiently polymerized with a PEGylated ruthenium alkylidene in miniemulsion to full conversion and with minimal coagulum formation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The feasibility of monitoring fluid flow subsurface processes that result in density changes, using the iGrav superconducting gravimeter, is investigated. Practical targets include steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) bitumen depletion and water pumping from aquifers, for which there is currently a void in low-impact, inexpensive monitoring techniques. This study demonstrates that the iGrav has the potential to be applied to multi-scale and diverse reservoirs. &#xD;
&#xD;
Gravity and gravity gradient signals are forward modeled for a real SAGD reservoir at two time steps, and for surface-fed and groundwater-fed aquifer pumping models, to estimate signal strength and directional dependency of water flow. Time-lapse gravimetry on small-scale reservoirs exhibits two obstacles, namely, a µgal sensitivity requirement and high noise levels in the vicinity of the reservoir. In this study, both limitations are overcome by proposing (i) a portable superconducting gravimeter, and (ii) a pair of instruments under various baseline geometries. This results in improved spatial resolution for locating depletion zones, as well as the cancellation of noise common in both instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results indicate that a pair of iGrav superconducting gravimeters meet the sensitivity requirements and the spatial focusing desired to monitor SAGD bitumen migration at the reservoir scales. For SAGD reservoirs, the well pair separation, reservoir depth, and survey sampling determine the resolvability of individual well pair depletion patterns during the steam chamber rising phase, and general reservoir depletion patterns during the steam chamber spreading phase. Results show that monitoring water table elevation changes due to pumping and tracking whether groundwater or surface water is being extracted are feasible.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Smart cities, cities that are supported by an extensive digital infrastructure of sensors, databases and intelligent applications, have become a major area of academic, governmental and public interest.  Simultaneously, there has been a growing interest in open data, the unrestricted use of organizational data for public viewing and use. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS), Urban Studies and Political Economy, this thesis examines how digital processes, open data and the physical world can be combined in smart city development, through the qualitative interview-based case study of a Southern Ontario Municipality, Anytown. The thesis asks what are the challenges associated with smart city development and open data proliferation, is open data complimentary to smart urban development; and how is expertise constructed in these fields? The thesis concludes that smart city development in Anytown is a complex process, involving a variety of visions, programs and components. Although smart city and open data initiatives exist in Anytown, and some are even overlapping and complementary, smart city development is in its infancy. However, expert informants remained optimistic, faithful to a technologically sublime vision of what a smart city would bring. The thesis also questions the notion of expertise within the context of smart city and open data projects, concluding that assertions of expertise need to be treated with caution and scepticism when considering how knowledge is received, generated, interpreted and circulates, within organizations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The section of CN railway between Vancouver and Kamloops runs along the base of many hazardous slopes, including the White Canyon, which is located just outside the town of Lytton, BC. The slope has a history of frequent rockfall activity, which presents a hazard to the railway below. Rockfall inventories can be used to understand the frequency-magnitude relationship of events on hazardous slopes, however it can be difficult to consistently and accurately identify rockfall source zones and volumes on large slopes with frequent activity, leaving many inventories incomplete.&#xD;
We have studied this slope as a part of the Canadian Railway Ground Hazard Research Program and have collected remote sensing data, including terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), photographs, and photogrammetry data since 2012, and used change detection to identify rockfalls on the slope. The objective of this thesis is to use a subset of this data to understand how rockfalls identified from TLS data could be used to understand the frequency-magnitude relationship of rockfalls on the slope. This includes incorporating both new and existing methods to develop a semi-automated workflow to extract rockfall events from the TLS data.&#xD;
We show that these methods can be used to identify events as small as 0.01 m3 and that the duration between scans can have an effect on the frequency-magnitude relationship of the rockfalls. We also show that by incorporating photogrammetry data into our analysis, we can create a 3D geological model of the slope and use this to classify rockfalls by lithology, to further understand the rockfall failure patterns. When relating the rockfall activity to triggering factors, we found that the amount of precipitation occurring over the winter has an effect on the overall rockfall frequency for the remainder of the year.&#xD;
These results can provide the railways with a more complete inventory of events compared to records created through track inspection, or rockfall monitoring systems that are installed on the slope. In addition, we can use the database to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of events. The results can also be used as an input to rockfall modelling programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The exhibition, The Map of the Empire (30 March – 6 May, 2016), featured photography, video, and installation works by Toronto-based artist, Brad Isaacs (Mohawk | mixed heritage). The majority of the artworks within the exhibition were produced from the Canadian Museum of Nature’s research and collections facility (Gatineau, Québec). The Canadian Museum of Nature (CMN), is the national natural history museum of (what is now called) Canada, with its galleries located in Ottawa, Ontario. The exhibition was the first to open at the Centre for Indigenous Research Creation at Queen’s University under the supervision of Dr. Dylan Robinson. Through the installment of The Map of the Empire, Isaacs effectively claimed space on campus grounds – within the geopolitical space of Katarokwi | Kingston – and pushed back against settler colonial imaginings of natural history. The Map of the Empire explored the capacity of Brad’s artistic practice in challenging the general belief under which natural history museums operate: that the experience of collecting/witnessing/interacting with a deceased and curated more-than-human animal will increase conservation awareness and facilitate human care towards nature. The exhibition also featured original poetry by Cecily Nicholson, author of Triage (2011) and From the Poplars (2014), as a response to Brad’s artwork. I locate the work of The Map of the Empire within the broader context of curatorship as a political practice engaging with conceptual and actualized forms of slow violence, both inside of and beyond the museum space. By unmapping the structures of slow, showcased and archived violence within the natural history museum, we can begin to radically transform and reimagine our connections with more-than-humans and encourage these relations to be reciprocal rather than hyper-curated or preserved.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many dynamical processes are subject to abrupt changes in state. Often these perturbations can be periodic and of short duration relative to the evolving process. These types of phenomena are described well by what are referred to as impulsive differential equations, systems of differential equations coupled with discrete mappings in state space. In this thesis we employ impulsive differential equations to model disease transmission within an industrial livestock barn. &#xD;
&#xD;
In particular we focus on the poultry industry and a viral disease of poultry called Marek's disease. This system lends itself well to impulsive differential equations. Entire cohorts of poultry are introduced and removed from a barn concurrently. Additionally, Marek's disease is transmitted indirectly and the viral particles can survive outside the host for weeks. Therefore, depopulating, cleaning, and restocking of the barn are integral factors in modelling disease transmission and can be completely captured by the impulsive component of the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our model allows us to investigate how modern broiler farm practices can make disease elimination difficult or impossible to achieve. It also enables us to investigate factors that may contribute to virulence evolution. &#xD;
&#xD;
Our model suggests that by decrease the cohort duration or by decreasing the flock density, Marek's disease can be eliminated from a barn with no increase in cleaning effort. Unfortunately our model also suggests that these practices will lead to disease evolution towards greater virulence. Additionally, our model suggests that if intensive cleaning between cohorts does not rid the barn of disease, it may drive evolution and cause the disease to become more virulent.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project is about Fast and Female, a community-based girls’ sport organization, that focuses on empowering girls through sport. In this thesis I produce a discourse analysis from interviews with six expert sportswomen and a textual analysis of the organization’s online content –  including its social media pages. I ground my analysis in poststructural theory as explained by Chris Weedon (1997) and in literature that helps contextualize and better define empowerment (Collins, 2000; Cruikshank, 1999; Hains, 2012; Sharma, 2008; Simon, 1994) and neoliberalism (Silk &amp; Andrews, 2012). My analysis in this project suggests that Fast and Female develops a community through online and in-person interaction. This community is focused on girls’ sport and empowerment, but, as the organization is situated in a neoliberal context, organizers must take extra consideration in order for the organization to develop a girls’ sport culture that is truly representative of the desires and needs of the participants rather than implicit neoliberal values. It is important to note that Fast and Female does not identify as a feminist organization. Through this thesis I argue that Fast and Female teaches girls that sport is empowering – but, while the organization draws on “empowerment,” a term often used by feminists, it promotes a notion of empowerment that teaches female athletes how to exist within current mainstream and sporting cultures, rather than encouraging them to be empowered female citizens who learn to question and challenge social inequity. I conclude my thesis with suggestions for Fast and Female to encourage empowerment in spite of the current neoliberal situation. I also offer a goal-setting workbook that I developed to encourage girls to set goals while thinking about their communities rather than just themselves.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In radiotherapy planning, computed tomography (CT) images are used to quantify the electron density of tissues and provide spatial anatomical information. Treatment planning systems use these data to calculate the expected spatial distribution of absorbed dose in a patient. CT imaging is complicated by the presence of metal implants which cause increased image noise, produce artifacts throughout the image and can exceed the available range of CT number values within the implant, perturbing electron density estimates in the image. Furthermore, current dose calculation algorithms do not accurately model radiation transport at metal-tissue interfaces. Combined, these issues adversely affect the accuracy of dose calculations in the vicinity of metal implants. As the number of patients with orthopedic and dental implants grows, so does the need to deliver safe and effective radiotherapy treatments in the presence of implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Medical Physics group at the Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario and Queen's University has developed a Cobalt-60 CT system that is relatively insensitive to metal artifacts due to the high energy, nearly monoenergetic Cobalt-60 photon beam. Kilovoltage CT (kVCT) images, including images corrected using a commercial metal artifact reduction tool, were compared to Cobalt-60 CT images throughout the treatment planning process, from initial imaging through to dose calculation. An effective metal artifact reduction algorithm was also implemented for the Cobalt-60 CT system.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Electron density maps derived from the same kVCT and Cobalt-60 CT images indicated the impact of image artifacts on estimates of photon attenuation for treatment planning applications. Measurements showed that truncation of CT number data in kVCT images produced significant mischaracterization of the electron density of metals. Dose measurements downstream of metal inserts in a water phantom were compared to dose data calculated using CT images from kVCT and Cobalt-60 systems with and without artifact correction. The superior accuracy of electron density data derived from Cobalt-60 images compared to kVCT images produced calculated dose with far better agreement with measured results. These results indicated that dose calculation errors from metal image artifacts are primarily due to misrepresentation of electron density within metals rather than artifacts surrounding the implants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Moving through a stable, three-dimensional world is a hallmark of our motor and perceptual experience. This stability is constantly being challenged by movements of the eyes and head, inducing retinal blur and retino-spatial misalignments for which the brain must compensate. To do so, the brain must account for eye and head kinematics to transform two-dimensional retinal input into the reference frame necessary for movement or perception. The four studies in this thesis used both computational and psychophysical approaches to investigate several aspects of this reference frame transformation. In the first study, we examined the neural mechanism underlying the visuomotor transformation for smooth pursuit using a feedforward neural network model. After training, the model performed the general, three-dimensional transformation using gain modulation. This gave mechanistic significance to gain modulation observed in cortical pursuit areas while also providing several testable hypotheses for future electrophysiological work. In the second study, we asked how anticipatory pursuit, which is driven by memorized signals, accounts for eye and head geometry using a novel head-roll updating paradigm. We showed that the velocity memory driving anticipatory smooth pursuit relies on retinal signals, but is updated for the current head orientation. In the third study, we asked how forcing retinal motion to undergo a reference frame transformation influences perceptual decision making. We found that simply rolling one's head impairs perceptual decision making in a way captured by stochastic reference frame transformations. In the final study, we asked how torsional shifts of the retinal projection occurring with almost every eye movement influence orientation perception across saccades. We found a pre-saccadic, predictive remapping  consistent with maintaining a purely retinal (but spatially inaccurate) orientation perception throughout the movement. Together these studies suggest that, despite their spatial inaccuracy, retinal signals play a surprisingly large role in our seamless visual experience. This work therefore represents a significant advance in our understanding of how the brain performs one of its most fundamental functions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zr-Excel alloy (Zr-3.5Sn-0.8Nb-0.8Mo) is a dual phase (α + β) alloy in the as-received pressure tube condition. It has been proposed to be the pressure tube candidate material for the Generation-IV CANDU-Supercritical Water Reactor (CANDU-SCWR). In this dissertation, the effects of heavy ion irradiation, deformation and heat treatment on the microstructures of the alloy were investigated to enable us to have a better understanding of the potential in-reactor performance of this alloy. &#xD;
 In-situ heavy ion (1 MeV) irradiation was performed to study the nucleation and evolution of dislocation loops in both α- and β-Zr. Small and dense &lt;a&gt; type dislocation loops form under irradiation between 80 and 450 °C. The number density tends to saturate at ~ 0.1 dpa. Compared with the α-Zr, the defect yield is much lower in β-Zr. The stabilities of the metastable phases (β-Zr and ω-Zr) and the thermal-dynamically equilibrium phase, fcc Zr(Mo, Nb)2, under irradiation were also studied at different temperatures. Chemi-STEM elemental mapping was carried out to study the elemental redistribution caused by irradiation. The stability of these phases and the elemental redistribution are strongly dependent on irradiation temperature. &#xD;
In-situ time-of-flight neutron diffraction tensile and compressive tests were carried out at different temperatures to monitor lattice strain evolutions of individual grain families during these tests. The β-Zr is the strengthening phase in this alloy in the as-received plate material. Load is transferred to the β-Zr after yielding of the α-Zr grains. The temperature dependence of static strain aging and the yielding sequence of the individual grain families were discussed. Strong tensile/compressive asymmetry was observed in the {0002} grain family at room temperature.&#xD;
The microstructures of the sample deformed at 400 °C and the samples only subjected to heat treatment at the same temperature were characterized with TEM. Concentration of β phase stabilizers in the β grain and the morphology of β grain have significant effect on the stability of β- and ω-Zr under thermal treatment. Applied stress/strain enhances the decomposition of isothermal ω phase but suppresses α precipitation inside the β grains at high temperature. An α → ω/ZrO phase transformation was observed in the thin foils of Zr-Excel alloy and pure Zr during in-situ heating at 700 °C in TEM.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Most essay rating research in language assessment has examined human raters’ essay rating as a cognitive process, thus overlooking or oversimplifying the interaction between raters and sociocultural contexts. Given that raters are social beings, their practices have social meanings and consequences. Hence it is important to situate essay rating within its sociocultural context for a more meaningful understanding. Drawing on Engeström’s (1987, 2001) cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) framework with a sociocultural perspective, this study reconceptualized essay rating as a socially mediated activity with both cognitive (individual raters’ goal-directed decision-making actions) and social layers (raters’ collective object-oriented essay rating activity at related settings). In particular, this study explored raters’ essay rating at one provincial rating centre in China within the context of a high-stakes university entrance examination, the National Matriculation English Test (NMET).&#xD;
 This study adopted a multiple-method multiple-perspective qualitative case study design. Think-aloud protocols, stimulated recalls, interviews, and documents served as the data sources. This investigation involved 25 participants at two settings (rating centre and high schools), including rating centre directors, team leaders, NMET essay raters who were high school teachers, and school principals and teaching colleagues of these essay raters. Data were analyzed using Strauss and Corbin’s (1990) open and axial coding techniques, and CHAT for data integration.&#xD;
The findings revealed the interaction between raters and the NMET sociocultural context. Such interaction can be understood through a surface structure (cognitive layer) and a deep structure (social layer) concerning how raters assessed NMET essays, where the surface structure reflected the “what” and the deep structure explained the “how” and “why” in raters’ decision-making. This study highlighted the roles of goals and rules in rater decision-making, rating tensions and raters’ solutions, and the relationship between essay rating and teaching. This study highlights the value of a sociocultural view to essay rating research, demonstrates CHAT as a sociocultural approach to investigate essay rating, and proposes a direction for future washback research on the effect of essay rating. This study also provides support for NMET rating practices that can potentially bring positive washback to English teaching in Chinese high schools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis reports on 17O (I = 5/2) and 59Co (I = 7/2) quadrupole central transition (QCT) NMR studies of three classes of biologically important molecules: glucose, nicotinamide and Vitamin B12 derivatives. Extensive QCT NMR experiments were performed over a wide range of molecular motion by changing solvent viscosity and temperature. 17O-labels were introduced at the 5- and 6-positions respectively: D-[5-17O]-glucose and D-[6-17O]-glucose following the literature method. QCT NMR greatly increased the molecular size limit obtained by ordinary solution NMR. It requires much lower temperatures to get the optimal spectral resolution, which are preferable for biological molecules. In addition, quadrupolar product parameter (PQ) and shielding anisotropy product parameter (PSA) were obtained for hydroxide group and amide group for the first time. For conventional NMR studies of quadrupolar nuclei, only PQ is accessible while QCT NMR obtained both PQ and PSA simultaneously. Our experiments also suggest the resolution of QCT NMR can be even better than that obtained by conventional NMR. We observed for the first time that the second-order quadrupolar interaction becomes a dominant relaxation mechanism under ultraslow motion. All these observations suggest that QCT NMR can become a standard technique for studying quadrupolar nuclei in solution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>DNA sequences that are rich in the guanine nucleic base possess the ability to fold into higher order structures called G-quadruplexes. These higher level structures are formed as a result of two sets of four guanine bases hydrogen-bonding together in a planar arrangement called a guanine quartet. Guanine quartets subsequently stack upon each other to form quadruplexes. G-quadruplexes are mainly localized in telomeres as well as in oncogene promoters. One unique and promising therapeutic approach against cancer involves targeting and stabilizing G-quadruplexes with small molecules, generally in order to suppress oncogene expression and telomerase enzyme activity; the latter has been found to contribute to “out-of control” cell growth in ca. 80-85% of all cancer cells and primary tumours while being absent in normal somatic cells.&#xD;
In this work, we present efforts towards designing and synthesizing acridine-based macrocycles (Mh) and (Mb) with the purpose of providing potential G4 ligands that are suited for selective binding to G4 vs. duplex DNA, and stabilize G-quadruplex structures.&#xD;
Two ligands described in this study include an acridine core which provides an aromatic surface capable of π-π interactions with the surface of G-quadruplexes. The successful synthesis of 4,5-diaminoacridine is described in chapter 2, as an essential fragment of the macrocycles (Mh) and (Mb).&#xD;
In order to investigate the synthetic method for macrocyclization, model compounds composing almost half of the designed macrocycles were explored. As discussed in chapter 3, the synthesis of the model compound for (Mb) turned out to be challenging. However, as a step towards the synthesis of (Mh), the synthesis of the hydrogen-containing model compound, which is almost half of the desired macrocycle (Mh) was achieved in our group and proved to be promising.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Commemorations are a critical window for exploring the social, political, and cultural trends of a specific time period. Over the past two centuries, the commemorative landscape of Ontario reaffirmed the inclusion/exclusion of particular racial groups. Intended as static markers to the past, monuments in particular visually demonstrated the boundaries of a community and acted as ongoing memorials to existing social structures. Using a specific type of iconography and visual language, the creators of monuments imbued the physical markers of stone and bronze with racialized meanings. As builders were connected with their own time periods and social contexts, the ideas behind these commemorations shifted. Nonetheless, creators were intent on producing a memorial that educated present and future generations on the boundaries of their “imagined communities.” This dissertation considers the carefully chosen iconographies of Ontario’s monuments and how visual symbolism was attached to historical memory. Through the examination of five case studies, this dissertation examines the shifting commemorative landscape of Ontario and how memorials were used to mark the boundaries of communities. By integrating the visual analysis of monuments and related images, it bridges a methodological and theoretical gap between history and art history. This dissertation opens an important dialogue between these fields of study and demonstrates how monuments themselves are critical “documents” of the past.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the affective and political life of anti-violence labour, with particular attention to the ways that neoliberalism comes to bear on subjectivity, embodiment, and relationality among women responding to violence. In fall of 2015, I conducted qualitative interviews with six women engaged in the work of responding to violence. The participants in this project articulated rich descriptions of the affective life of neoliberalism and the demands of neoliberal subjectivity, drawing particular attention to the affective labour involved in navigating the political complexities of anti-violence organizations, negotiating burnout, and affectively self-managing in order to meet norms of professionalism. Bringing participant narratives into conversations with feminist theories of affect, I argue for an account affective labour that centers the specific, materially embodied experiences of that work and for an account of neoliberalism as a system of embodied and affective pressures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spontaneous fetal loss (25-40%) leading to decrease in litter size is a significant concern to the pork industry. A deficit in the placental vasculature has emerged as one of the important factors associated with fetal loss. During early pig pregnancy, the endometrium becomes enriched with immune cells recruited by conceptus-derived signals including specific chemokine stimuli. These immune cells assist in various aspects of placental development and angiogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs: small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression) regulate immune cell development and their functions. In addition, intercellular communication including exchange of biomolecules (e.g. miRNAs) between the conceptus and endometrium regulate key developmental processes during pregnancy. To understand the biological significance of immune cell enrichment, regulation of their functions by miRNAs and transfer of miRNAs across the maternal fetal-interface, we screened specific sets of chemokines and pro- and anti-angiogenic miRNAs in endometrial lymphocytes (ENDO LY), endometrium, and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) isolated from conceptus attachment sites (CAS) during early, gestation day (gd)20 and mid-pregnancy (gd50). We report increased expression of selected chemokines including CXCR3 and CCR5 in ENDO LY and CXCL10, CXCR3, CCL5, CCR5 in endometrium associated with arresting CAS at gd20. Some of these differences were also noted at the protein level (CXCL10, CXCR3, CCL5, and CCR5) in endometrium and CAM. We report for the first time significant differences for miRNAs involved in immune cell-derived angiogenesis (miR-296-5P, miR-150, miR-17P-5P, miR-18a, and miR-19a) between ENDO LY associated with healthy and arresting CAS. Significant differences were also found in endometrium and CAM for some miRNAs (miR-17-5P, miR-18a, miR-15b-5P, and miR-222). Finally, we confirm that placenta specific-exosomes contain proteins and 14 select miRNAs including miR-126-5P, miR-296-5P, miR-16, and miR-17-5P that are of relevance to early implantation events. We further demonstrated the bidirectional exosome shuttling between porcine trophectoderm cells (PTr2) and porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAOEC). PTr2-derived exosomes were able to modulate the endothelial cell proliferation that is crucial for the establishment of pregnancy. Our data unravels the selected chemokines and miRNAs associated with immune cell-regulated angiogenesis and reconfirm that exosome mediated cell-cell communication opens-up new avenues to understand porcine pregnancy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is used to treat cancer using carefully designed plans that maximize the radiation dose delivered to the target and minimize damage to healthy tissue, with the dose administered over multiple occasions. Creating treatment plans is a laborious process and presents an obstacle to more frequent replanning, which remains an unsolved problem. However, in between new plans being created, the patient's anatomy can change due to multiple factors including reduction in tumor size and loss of weight, which results in poorer patient outcomes. Cloud computing is a newer technology that is slowly being used for medical applications with promising results. The objective of this work was to design and build a system that could analyze a database of previously created treatment plans, which are stored with their associated anatomical information in studies, to find the one with the most similar anatomy to a new patient. The analyses would be performed in parallel on the cloud to decrease the computation time of finding this plan. METHODS: The system used SlicerRT, a radiation therapy toolkit for the open-source platform 3D Slicer, for its tools to perform the similarity analysis algorithm. Amazon Web Services was used for the cloud instances on which the analyses were performed, as well as for storage of the radiation therapy studies and messaging between the instances and a master local computer. A module was built in SlicerRT to provide the user with an interface to direct the system on the cloud, as well as to perform other related tasks. RESULTS: The cloud-based system out-performed previous methods of conducting the similarity analyses in terms of time, as it analyzed 100 studies in approximately 13 minutes, and produced the same similarity values as those methods. It also scaled up to larger numbers of studies to analyze in the database with a small increase in computation time of just over 2 minutes. CONCLUSION: This system successfully analyzes a large database of radiation therapy studies and finds the one that is most similar to a new patient, which represents a potential step forward in achieving feasible adaptive radiation therapy replanning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
	This dissertation explores damaging tendencies that exist within autonomy-oriented activism in the West.  I examine how affect shapes the way that internal conflict is approached and internal strife is dealt with in radical communities. I adopt Sara Ahmed’s proposition “that our emotions are bound up with the securing of the social hierarchy” (Ahmed, 2004b: 4) and given that autonomy-oriented practices are committed to dismantling existing hierarchies, it follows that the less oppressive social configurations sought by autonomous social movements must have different emotional underpinnings.  My thesis involves applying critical theory on affect and emotion in social movements to interview data gathered from activists both currently and historically involved in autonomy-oriented social movement communities in Kingston, Ontario. I ask whether anglophone, western-based, autonomy-oriented social movements reproduced understandings of affect/emotions/feelings that underwrite the social order they are working against?  I also ask, “how are our emotions conditioned by capitalism?”.  The research that I engage with provides responses to these questions by pointing out how the dominant discourse on emotions in the West encourages and informs certain modes of identity production that affect the diminishing and sad practices of autonomy-oriented communities and the (re)production of oppressive practices found in the dominant order. My work critically places this psychologizing view of emotions, and its damaging effects on resistance, within the context of neoliberal capitalism. I argue that the way we understand the politics of affect is an important dimension of radical struggle, and will inform and impact upon our individual and collective capacities to respond to, and refuse to reproduce relations of control and domination. I look for an understanding of “why” and to “what extent” these determinations exists, and look for hope in a politics of affect which supports an autonomy-oriented ethic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arginase 1 deficiency, a urea cycle disorder resulting from an inability of the body to convert arginine into urea, results in hyperargininemia and sporadic episodes of hyperammonemia. Arginase 1 deficiency can lead to a range of developmental disorders and progressive spastic diplegia in children, and current therapeutic options are limited. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) /CRISPR associated protein (Cas) 9 gene editing systems serve as a novel means of treating genetic disorders such as Arginase 1 (ARG1) deficiency, and must be thoroughly examined to determine their curative capabilities. In these experiments numerous guide RNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems targeting the ARG1 gene were designed and observed by heteroduplex assay for their targeting capabilities and cleavage efficiencies in multiple cell lines. &#xD;
The CRISPR/Cas9 system utilized in these experiments, along with a panel of guide RNAs targeting various locations in the arginase 1 gene, successfully produced targeted cleavage in HEK293, MCF7, A549, K562, HeLa, and HepG2 cells; however, targeted cleavage in human dermal fibroblasts, blood outgrowth endothelial cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells was not observed. Additionally, a CRISPR/Cas system involving partially inactivated Cas9 was capable of producing targeted DNA cleavage in intron 1 of ARG1, while a Cas protein termed Cpf1 was incapable of producing targeted cleavage. &#xD;
These results indicate a complex set of variables determining the CRISPR/Cas9 systems’ capabilities in the cell lines and primary cells tested. By examining epigenetic factors and alternative CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting systems, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be more thoroughly considered in its ability to act as a means towards editing the genome of arginase 1-deficient individuals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two decades of unprecedented changes in the media landscape have increased the complexity of informing the public through news media. With significant changes to the way the news industry does business and the way news consumers access this information, a new set of skills is being proposed as essential for today’s news consumer. News literacy is the use of critical thinking skills to assess the reliability and source of the information that people consume on a daily basis, as well as fostering self-awareness of personal news consumption habits and how it can create audience bias. The purpose of this study was to examine how adults experience the news in their everyday lives and to describe the nature of the news literacy skills people employ in their daily news consumption. This study purposefully selected four adults who have completed high school, and who regularly consume news information across a number of platforms, both traditional and digital. Two of the participants, one man and one woman, were over 50 years old. One other male participant was in his 30’s and the final participant, a young woman, was in her 20’s. They all utilized both traditional and digital media on a regular basis and all had differing skill levels when using social media for information. Their news experiences were documented by in-depth interviews and the completion of seven daily news logs. In their daily logs the participants differentiated news information from other information available on-line but the interviews revealed a contradiction between their intentions and their news consumption practices. All four participants had trouble distinguishing between news and opinion pieces in the news information realm. In addition all but one seemed unaware of their personal bias and any possible effect it was having on their news consumption.&#xD;
	Further research should explore the benefits of an adult-centered news literacy curriculum on news consumers similar to the participants, and should examine the development of audience bias and its relationship to the daily exposure people have to the torrent of information that is available to them on a daily basis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research presents a new design of an adjustable suture that could provide a better intraocular pressure (IOP) control in the post treatment of trabeculectomy surgery and limit associated complication with the current suturing techniques. A better control in tension suture brings a great deal of advantages to this surgical technique compared with the traditional adjustable suture. A length adjustment can be added in advance to a 10-0 nylon suture which enables suture tension to be released during the postoperative period of trabeculectomy surgery. This adjustment has a D-ring geometry made of 10-0 nylon suture adhered to a 10-0 nylon surgical suture which is used to close the scalar flap. The D ring was adhered with about 180 microdroplet of Loctite 4311that was found to form a strong joint to connect the D ring to the main 10-0 nylon suture and strong enough to carry the added tension instead after cutting the central suture between the two joints of the D ring. The geometry of adjustment is the key factor of maintaining the IOP at the normal range and keeping the scleral flap tight enough and secure so that aqueous humor continues to percolate under the subconjunctiva. It has been found that a 365, and 450 µm length extensions can release suture tension postoperatively and relieve the intraocular pressure within the eye by 33, and 66% respectively.&#xD;
The fabrication process of the new adjustable suture was divided into two steps: fabrication of micro jig and forming microdroplets. A micro jig was fabricated in order to form and bond a precise length extension to the new design of the adjustable suture. In addition, a new liquid separation technique has been followed in this study in order to generate micro adhesive droplets as small as 50µm for bonding the new adjustable suture structure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Because of high efficacy, long lifespan, and environment-friendly operation, LED lighting devices become more and more popular in every part of our life, such as ornament/interior lighting, outdoor lightings and flood lighting. The LED driver is the most critical part of the LED lighting fixture. It heavily affects the purchasing cost, operation cost as well as the light quality. Design a high efficiency, low component cost and flicker-free LED driver is the goal. &#xD;
The conventional single-stage LED driver can achieve low cost and high efficiency. However, it inevitably produces significant twice-line-frequency lighting flicker, which adversely affects our health. The conventional two-stage LED driver can achieve flicker-free LED driving at the expenses of significantly adding component cost, design complexity and low the efficiency. &#xD;
The basic ripple cancellation LED driving method has been proposed in chapter three. It achieves a high efficiency and a low component cost as the single-stage LED driver while also obtaining flicker-free LED driving performance. The basic ripple cancellation LED driver is the foundation of the entire thesis. As the research evolving, another two ripple cancellation LED drivers has been developed to improve different aspects of the basic ripple cancellation LED driver design. &#xD;
The primary side controlled ripple cancellation LED driver has been proposed in chapter four to further reduce cost on the control circuit. It eliminates secondary side compensation circuit and an opto-coupler in design while at the same time maintaining flicker-free LED driving. A potential integrated primary side controller can be designed based on the proposed LED driving method.   &#xD;
The energy channeling ripple cancellation LED driver has been proposed in chapter five to further reduce cost on the power stage circuit. In previous two ripple cancellation LED drivers, an additional DC-DC converter is needed to achieve ripple cancellation. A power transistor has been used in the energy channeling ripple cancellation LED driving design to successfully replace a separate DC-DC converter and therefore achieved lower cost.&#xD;
The detailed analysis supports the theory of the proposed ripple cancellation LED drivers. Simulation and experiment have also been included to verify the proposed ripple cancellation LED drivers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The intention of this thesis, “Ceramics in Britain (1840–90): Meanings and Metaphors” is to present new approaches for interpreting ceramics in nineteenth-century Britain by situating, problematizing, and contextualizing pottery and porcelain in the popular debates of the day within the methodologies of material culture, design, cultural and art histories. I ask how did ceramics—portable, functional, and often decorative objects—contribute to shaping modes of experiences? Crockery, tableware and blue-white-porcelain, admittedly largely mediated in texts and paintings, are at the centre of this research to examine how they imposed symbolism and influenced the engagement of their subjects beyond their intended meanings and functions. This thesis tracks a common rhetoric shared by writers and artists across genres and understood by readers and viewers: crockery in the cupboard, on the mantel, the table or the floor were popular motifs exemplifying class, gender, character, etiquette, and taste. This thesis also seeks to map ceramics’ relations with other objects and people depicted. Their meanings and metaphors changed, depending on their exchange with other objects in the room and who uses them. The conventions of representing ceramics dictated a particular grammar that writers and artists used, critiqued, discarded or personalized. The examination of ceramics mediated in text and image especially in comparison with extant objects invites a deeper probing of both material culture and artistic practice, which helps to situate the agency of the ceramic objects themselves.&#xD;
Also this thesis, in attempt to explore new methodological approaches for ceramic studies, examines the social life of the mid-Victorian relief-moulded “Minster” Jug in the Gardiner Museum in Toronto. The product originating in Staffordshire in 1843 and exported to the colonies holds significance due to its multiple life histories. Viewing the “Minster” through the lenses of curator, collector, consumer, and critic its layered lives unfold to reveal the protocols of museum praxis as well as important aspects of mid-nineteenth-century British society related to design reform, gender, imperialism and consumption patterns. This thesis contends that the British experienced ceramics in sometimes unexpected ways, unrelated to their original purpose, such as tools of violence or containers of solace, and transformative fantasy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pipelines extend thousands of kilometers across wide geographic areas as a network to provide essential services for modern life. It is inevitable that pipelines must pass through unfavorable ground conditions, which are susceptible to natural disasters. This thesis investigates the behaviour of buried pressure pipelines experiencing ground distortions induced by normal faulting.&#xD;
A recent large database of physical modelling observations on buried pipes of different stiffness relative to the surrounding soil subjected to normal faults provided a unique opportunity to calibrate numerical tools. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed to enable the complex soil-structure interaction phenomena to be further understood, especially on the subjects of gap formation beneath the pipe and the trench effect associated with the interaction between backfill and native soils. &#xD;
Benchmarked numerical tools were then used to perform parametric analysis regarding project geometry, backfill material, relative pipe-soil stiffness and pipe diameter. Seismic loading produces a soil displacement profile that can be expressed by isoil, the distance between the peak curvature and the point of contraflexure. A simplified design framework based on this length scale (i.e., the Kappa method) was developed, which features estimates of longitudinal bending moments of buried pipes using a characteristic length, ipipe, the distance from peak to zero curvature.&#xD;
Recent studies indicated that empirical soil springs that were calibrated against rigid pipes are not suitable for analyzing flexible pipes, since they lead to excessive conservatism (for design). A large-scale split-box normal fault simulator was therefore assembled to produce experimental data for flexible PVC pipe responses to a normal fault. Digital image correlation (DIC) was employed to analyze the soil displacement field, and both optical fibres and conventional strain gauges were used to measure pipe strains.&#xD;
A refinement to the Kappa method was introduced to enable the calculation of axial strains as a function of pipe elongation induced by flexure and an approximation of the longitudinal ground deformations. A closed-form Winkler solution of flexural response was also derived to account for the distributed normal fault pattern. Finally, these two analytical solutions were evaluated against the pipe responses observed in the large-scale laboratory tests.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Studies of Alexander Pope's poetry tend to examine only the footnotes to his Dunciads, if they examine his footnotes at all.  This dissertation will address this deficit in our understanding of Pope's poetics through an examination of Pope's use of footnotes in support of his verse throughout his career.  With Gerard Genette's taxonomy of footnotes as variously paratext and text and Hugh Kenner's idea of the technological space of the printed page as frameworks within which Pope's footnotes operate, this dissertation will show that – over the course of his career – Pope developed a poetics of annotation that deployed footnotes rhetorically as appeals to ethos and pathos that both built up Pope's own authorial ethos for his audience in the literary market place of early eighteenth-century London and for posterity and used that authorial ethos in support of his literary and political friends.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Global niobium production is presently dominated by three operations, Araxá and Catalão (Brazil), and Niobec (Canada). Although Brazil accounts for over 90% of the world’s niobium production, a number of high grade niobium deposits exist worldwide. The advancement of these deposits depends largely on the development of operable beneficiation flowsheets. Pyrochlore, as the primary niobium mineral, is typically upgraded by flotation with amine collectors at acidic pH following a complicated flowsheet with significant losses of niobium. This research compares the typical two stage flotation flowsheet to a direct flotation process (i.e. elimination of gangue pre-flotation) with the objective of circuit simplification. In addition, the use of a chelating reagent (benzohydroxamic acid, BHA) was studied as an alternative collector for fine grained, highly disseminated pyrochlore. For the amine based reagent system, results showed that while comparable at the laboratory scale, when scaled up to the pilot level the direct flotation process suffered from circuit instability because of high quantities of dissolved calcium in the process water due to stream recirculation and fine calcite dissolution, which ultimately depressed pyrochlore. This scale up issue was not observed in pilot plant operation of the two stage flotation process as a portion of the highly reactive carbonate minerals was removed prior to acid addition. A statistical model was developed for batch flotation using BHA on carbonatite ore (0.25% Nb2O5) that could not be effectively upgraded using the conventional amine reagent scheme. Results showed that it was possible to produce a concentrate containing 1.54% Nb2O5 with 93% Nb recovery in ~15% of the original mass. Fundamental studies undertaken included FT-IR and XPS, which showed the adsorption of both the protonized amine and the neutral amine onto the surface of the pyrochlore (possibly at niobium sites as indicated by detected shifts in the Nb3d binding energy). The results suggest that the preferential flotation of pyrochlore over quartz with amines at low pH levels can be attributed to a difference in critical hemimicelle concentration (CHC) values for the two minerals. BHA was found to be absorbed on pyrochlore surfaces by a similar mechanism to alkyl hydroxamic acid. It is hoped that this work will assist in improving operability of existing pyrochlore flotation circuits and help promote the development of niobium deposits globally. Future studies should focus on investigation into specific gangue mineral depressants and inadvertent activation phenomenon related to BHA flotation of gangue minerals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is an exploration of how a small but important group of Romantic critics, finding fault in the ideal of three unities developed by neoclassical Academicians and wrongly attributed to Aristotle, turned to the terminology and practices of the fine arts to emphasize their conception of organic unity in literature. The Romantic analogy to painting in particular enables a philosophical criticism of literature to present the aesthetic semblance of painting, the comprehension of a multitude of details in a harmonious whole that is a natural unity to its medium, as a paradigm of modern-romantic poetry and its aspirations to similar complexity, particularity, and imaginative colour. Further, in extension of the French Querelle des anciens et des modernes of the seventeenth century, the division of ancient and romantic art by Romantic critics like August Schlegel, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and William Hazlitt not only establishes an ethnological and historical difference between the artistic productions of these two cultural periods but also allows, unlike the neoclassical unities, a non-anachronistic philosophical vocabulary of whole and parts or of the general and particular in the criticism of poetry, which involution provides a “rule” more consonant with the laws of the imagination rather than with the rhetorical and absolutist dicta that were thither available in the literary canon.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stitching Settler Identities: Canadian Quilts and their Makers, 1800-1880 explores the making, use, and circulation of handmade settler quilts as representation of nineteenth-century women’s social, cultural and economic histories in Canada. An important part of Canadian settlement history is the making and use of handmade quilts in the settler homestead. Handmade coverlets that provided both physical and emotional warmth in the home were a measure of a settler-woman’s careful management of resources and a display of her innovation and creativity. Few settler women recorded their daily experiences; however, most women could sew and quilts offered a method of expression that allowed them to reflect and portray their identities.&#xD;
Thus far, the few studies of quilts have been limited to exhibition catalogues or research that considers a quilt’s aesthetics or its historic significance. While several scholars have called for a reclassification of textile production and needle arts to advance the way in which settler women were viewed as social beings – creating, producing, communicating, and circulating cultural values, most studies on quilts have overlooked a coverlet’s materiality. This study aims to expand the research on quilts as material culture within the context of art history by also considering a quilt’s materiality and when possible, its maker's biography.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation articulates the basic aims and achievements of education. It recognizes language as central to thinking, and philosophy and education as belonging profoundly to one another. The first step is to show that although philosophy can no longer claim to dictate the foundations of knowledge or of disciplines of inquiry, it still offers an exceptionally general level of self-understanding. Education is equally general and faces a similar crisis of self-identity, of coming to terms with reality.&#xD;
Language is the medium of thought and the repository of historical mind; so a child’s acquisition of language is her acquisition of rational freedom. This marks a metaphysical change: no longer merely an animal, she comes to exercise her powers of rationality, transcending her environment by seeking and expressing reasons for thinking and doing. She can think about herself in relation to the universe, hence philosophize and educate others in turn.&#xD;
The discussion then turns to the historical nature of language. The thinking already embedded in language always anticipates further questioning. Etymology serves as a model for philosophical understanding, and demonstrates how philosophy can continue to yield insights that are fundamental, but not foundational, to human life. The etymologies of some basic educational concepts disclose education as a leading out and into the midst of Being.&#xD;
The philosophical approach developed in previous chapters applies to the very idea of an educational aim. Discussion concerning the substantiality of educational ideals results in an impasse: one side recommends an open-­ended understanding of education’s aims; the other insists on a definitive account. However, educational ideals exhibit a conceptual duality: the fundamental achievements of education, such as rational freedom, are real; but how we should understand them remains an open question.&#xD;
The penultimate chapter investigates philosophical thinking as the fulfillment of rational freedom, whose creative insights can profoundly transform our everyday activities. That this transformative self-understanding is without end suggests the basic aims of education are unheimlich.&#xD;
The dissertation concludes with speculative reflection on the shape and nature of language, and with the suggestion that through education reality awakens to itself.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Thermal and fatigue cracking are the major pavement distresses that contribute to a drastic reduction of the pavement’s service life and performance in Ontario. Chemical oxidation and hardening of asphalt binders deteriorates its physical properties since physical properties of asphalts depend on its chemical composition. This thesis is aimed to establish a relationship between physical and chemical properties of asphalt binders. A secondary objective is to show the strong correlation between CTOD and temperature.&#xD;
All recovered and straight Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) samples were investigated using conventional Superpave® test method dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) as well as improved MTO test methods such as extended bending beam rheometer (eBBR) and double-edge-notched tension (DENT) test. DENT test was conducted for all Ontario contract samples at three different temperatures based on their performance grade after three hours of thermal conditioning and compared the results in terms of essential work of fracture, plastic work of fracture and CTOD at different temperatures. Good correlation exists between CTOD and temperature according to the DENT data.&#xD;
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis was conducted to detect the presence of heavy metals such as zinc and molybdenum believed to have originated from waste engine oil. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to determine the abundance of functional groups such as carbonyl, sulfoxides, polyisobutylene, etc. XRF and FTIR analysis confirmed that most of the samples contain waste engine oil and/or oxidized residues, which is believed to be a root cause of premature pavement failures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a conceptual examination of the positions from which we teach in public education. As it is philosophical in nature, it takes no qualitative or quantitative data. It offers a review of selected relevant literature and an analysis of personal and professional experience, with the intent to pose critical questions about teaching and learning. &#xD;
   The framework of this thesis represents the following contentions: First, from its inception, public schooling served capital by preparing skilled labour for emerging industrial markets. This history is the hegemonic shadow that hangs over public education today. Second, movements toward the standardization of funding, curriculum, and evaluation support the further commodification of public schooling. The “accountability” that standardization offers, the “back to basics” that it aims for, is counter to the potential that public education might critically inform citizens and seek social justice. Third, movements toward the privatization of public schooling under the guise of “choice” and “mobility”, brought on by manufactured crisis, serve only to widen socio-economic inequities as capitalist neoliberal interests seek profit in both the product of public schools and in schooling itself. &#xD;
   If we recognize and understand the power of public education to inform vast numbers of citizens who will, in turn, either maintain or reform society, we must ask: What do we want public education to be? What are the effects of continuing down historically conventional and increasingly standardized paths? What do progressive pedagogies offer? How might teachers destandardize their pedagogy and pursue equitable opportunities for marginalized students? How might students name themselves and their world, that they might play a part in its reimagining? For whom do we teach, and under what conditions? From where do we teach, and why? &#xD;
   For educators to ask these questions, and to employ what they discover, will necessitate taking substantial risks. It will necessitate taking a stand and cannot be done alone. Teachers must seek out the collaboration of their students. They must offer students the time and the space to find their own voices, to create their own selves, and to envision previously uncharted paths on which we might walk together.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work examines independence in the Canadian justice system using an approach adapted from new legal realist scholarship called ‘dynamic realism’. This approach proposes that issues in law must be considered in relation to their recursive and simultaneous development with historic, social and political events. Such events describe ‘law in action’ and more holistically demonstrate principles like independence, rule of law and access to justice. My dynamic realist analysis of independence in the justice system employs a range methodological tools and approaches from the social sciences, including: historical and historiographical study; public administrative; policy and institutional analysis; an empirical component; as well as constitutional, statutory interpretation and jurisprudential analysis. &#xD;
&#xD;
In my view, principles like independence represent aspirational ideals in law which can be better understood by examining how they manifest in legal culture and in the legal system. This examination focuses on the principle and practice of independence for both lawyers and judges in the justice system, but highlights the independence of the Bar. It considers the inter-relation between lawyer independence and the ongoing refinement of judicial independence in Canadian law. It also considers both independence of the Bar and the Judiciary in the context of the administration of justice, and practically illustrates the interaction between these principles through a case study of a specific aspect of the court system. This work also focuses on recent developments in the principle of Bar independence and its relation to an emerging school of professionalism scholarship in Canada. &#xD;
&#xD;
The work concludes by describing the principle of independence as both conditional and dynamic, but rooted in a unitary concept for both lawyers and judges. In short, independence can be defined as impartiality, neutrality and autonomy of legal decision-makers in the justice system to apply, protect and improve the law for what has become its primary normative purpose: facilitating access to justice. While both independence of the Bar and the Judiciary are required to support access to independent courts, some recent developments suggest the practical interactions between independence and access need to be the subject of further research, to better account for both the principles and the practicalities of the Canadian justice system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major global health issue as it is the most prevalent sustained supraventricular arrhythmia. Catheter-based ablation of some parts of the atria is considered an effective treatment of AF. The main objective of this research is to analyze atrial intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) and extract insightful information for the ablation therapy. Throughout this thesis we propose several computationally efficient algorithms that take streams of IEGMs from different atrial sites as the input signals, sequentially analyze them in various domains (e.g., time and frequency), and create color-coded three-dimensional map of the atria to be used in the ablation therapy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Aberrant behavior of biological signaling pathways has been implicated in diseases such as cancers. Therapies have been developed to target proteins in these networks in the hope of curing the illness or bringing about remission. However, identifying targets for drug inhibition that exhibit  good therapeutic index has proven to be challenging since signaling pathways have a large number of components and many interconnections such as feedback, crosstalk, and divergence. Unfortunately, some characteristics of these pathways such as redundancy, feedback, and drug resistance reduce the efficacy of single drug target therapy and necessitate the employment of more than one drug to target multiple nodes in the system. However, choosing multiple targets with high therapeutic index poses more challenges since the combinatorial search space could be huge. To cope with the complexity of these systems, computational tools such as ordinary differential equations have been used to successfully model some of these pathways. Regrettably, for building these models, experimentally-measured initial concentrations of the components and rates of reactions are needed which are difficult to obtain, and in very large networks, they may not be available at the moment. Fortunately, there exist other modeling tools, though not as powerful as ordinary differential equations, which do not need the rates and initial conditions to model signaling pathways. Petri net and graph theory are among these tools. In this thesis, we introduce a methodology based on Petri net siphon analysis and graph network centrality measures for identifying prospective targets for single and multiple drug therapies. In this methodology, first, potential targets are identified in the Petri net model of a signaling pathway using siphon analysis. Then, the graph-theoretic centrality measures are employed to prioritize the candidate targets. Also, an algorithm is developed to check whether the candidate targets are able to disable the intended outputs in the graph model of the system or not. We implement structural and dynamical models of ErbB1-Ras-MAPK pathways and use them to assess and evaluate this methodology. The identified drug-targets, single and multiple, correspond to clinically relevant drugs. Overall, the results suggest that this methodology, using siphons and centrality measures, shows promise in identifying and ranking drugs. Since this methodology only uses the structural information of the signaling pathways and does not need initial conditions and dynamical rates, it can be utilized in larger networks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Within Canada there are more than 2.5 million bundles of spent nuclear fuel with another approximately 2 million bundles to be generated in the future. Canada, and every country around the world that has taken a decision on management of spent nuclear fuel, has decided on long-term containment and isolation of the fuel within a deep geological repository. At depth, a deep geological repository consists of a network of placement rooms where the bundles will be located within a multi-layered system that incorporates engineered and natural barriers. The barriers will be placed in a complex thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical-biological (THMCB) environment. A large database of material properties for all components in the repository are required to construct representative models. Within the repository, the sealing materials will experience elevated temperatures due to the thermal gradient produced by radioactive decay heat from the waste inside the container. Furthermore, high porewater pressure due to the depth of repository along with possibility of elevated salinity of groundwater would cause the bentonite-based materials to be under transient hydraulic conditions. Therefore it is crucial to characterize the sealing materials over a wide range of thermal-hydraulic conditions. A comprehensive experimental program has been conducted to measure properties (mainly focused on thermal properties) of all sealing materials involved in Mark II concept at plausible thermal-hydraulic conditions. The thermal response of Canada’s concept for a deep geological repository has been modelled using experimentally measured thermal properties. Plausible scenarios are defined and the effects of these scenarios are examined on the container surface temperature as well as the surrounding geosphere to assess whether they meet design criteria for the cases studied. The thermal response shows that if all the materials even being at dried condition, repository still performs acceptably as long as sealing materials remain in contact.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: It is well known that sprint interval training (SIT), induces significant increases in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) at the group level. However, there have been only a few studies that have addressed the variability of VO2peak response following SIT, and precise mechanism(s) that may explain individual magnitude of response are unknown. Purpose: Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to: 1) examine the inter-individual variability of the VO2peak response following SIT, 2) to inspect the relationship between changes in both central and peripheral measures and changes in VO2peak, and 3) to assess if peripheral or central adaptations play a role in whether an individual is a high or low responder with respect to VO2peak. Subjects: Twenty-two young, recreationally active males (age: 20.4  1.7 years; weight: 78.4  10.2 kg; VO2peak: 3.7  0.62 L/min) Methods: VO2peak (L/min), peak cardiac output (Qpeak [L/min]), and peak deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHbpeak [mM]) were measured before and after 16 sessions of SIT (Tabata Protocol) over four weeks. Peak a-vO2diff was calculated using a derivation of the Fick equation. Results: Due to a systematic error, HHbpeak could not be used to differentiate between individual responses. There was a large range of VO2peak response from pre to post testing (-4.75 to 32.18% change) and there was a significant difference between the Low Response Group (LRG) (n=8) and the High Response Group (HRG) (n=8) [f(1, 14)= 64.27, p&lt;0.001]. Furthermore, there was no correlation between delta () VO2peak and  Qpeak (r=-0.18, p=0.46) for all participants, nor was there an interaction effect between the Low and High Response Groups [f(1,11)=0.572, p=0.47]. Lastly, there was a significant correlation between VO2peak and peak a-vO2diff [r=0.692, p&lt;0.001], and a significant interaction effect with peak a-vO2diff [f(1, 14)= 13.27, p&lt;0.004] when comparing the HRG to the LRG. Conclusions: There was inter-individual variability of VO2peak response following 4 weeks of SIT, but central adaptations did not influence this variation. This suggests that peripheral adaptations may be responsible for VO2peak adaptation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the global phenomena with threats to environmental health and safety is artisanal mining. There are ambiguities in the manner in which an ore-processing facility operates which hinders the mining capacity of these miners in Ghana.  These problems are reviewed on the basis of current socio-economic, health and safety, environmental, and use of rudimentary technologies which limits fair-trade deals to miners.&#xD;
		This research sought to use an established data-driven, geographic information (GIS)-based system employing the spatial analysis approach for locating a centralized processing facility within the Wassa Amenfi-Prestea Mining Area (WAPMA) in the Western region of Ghana.  A spatial analysis technique that utilizes ModelBuilder within the ArcGIS geoprocessing environment through suitability modeling will systematically and simultaneously analyze a geographical dataset of selected criteria.  The spatial overlay analysis methodology and the multi-criteria decision analysis approach were selected to identify the most preferred locations to site a processing facility.&#xD;
		For an optimal site selection, seven major criteria including proximity to settlements, water resources, artisanal mining sites, roads, railways, tectonic zones, and slopes were considered to establish a suitable location for a processing facility. Site characterizations and environmental considerations, incorporating identified constraints such as proximity to large scale mines, forest reserves and state lands to site an appropriate position were selected. The analysis was limited to criteria that were selected and relevant to the area under investigation.&#xD;
		Saaty’s analytical hierarchy process was utilized to derive relative importance weights of the criteria and then a weighted linear combination technique was applied to combine the factors for determination of the degree of potential site suitability. The final map output indicates estimated potential sites identified for the establishment of a facility centre. The results obtained provide intuitive areas suitable for consideration</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Thermal and fatigue cracking are the two of the major pavement distress phenomena that contribute significantly towards increased premature pavement failures in Ontario. This in turn puts a massive burden on the provincial budgets as the government spends huge sums of money on the repair and rehabilitation of roads every year. Governments therefore need to rethink and re-evaluate their current measures in order to prevent it in future. The main objectives of this study include: the investigation of fatigue distress of 11 contract samples at 10oC, 15oC, 20oC and 25oC  and the use of  crack-tip-opening-displacement (CTOD) requirements at temperatures other than 15oC; investigation of thermal and fatigue distress of the comparative analysis of 8 Ministry of Transportation (MTO) recovered and straight asphalt samples through double-edge-notched-tension test (DENT) and extended bending beam rheometry (EBBR); chemical testing of all samples though X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR); Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) higher and intermediate temperature grading; and the case study of a local Kingston road. Majority of 11 contract samples showed satisfactory performance at all temperatures except one sample. Study of CTOD at various temperatures found a strong correlation between the two variables. All recovered samples showed poor performance in terms of their ability to resist thermal and fatigue distress relative to their corresponding straight asphalt as evident in DENT test and EBBR results. XRF and FTIR testing of all samples showed the addition of waste engine oil (WEO) to be the root cause of pavement failures. DSR high temperature grading showed superior performance of recovered binders relative to straight asphalt. The local Kingston road showed extensive signs of damage due to thermal and fatigue distress as evident from DENT test, EBBR results and pictures taken in the field. In the light of these facts, the use of waste engine oil and recycled asphalt in pavements should be avoided as these have been shown to cause premature failure in pavements. The DENT test existing CTOD requirements should be implemented at other temperatures in order to prevent the occurrences of premature pavement failures in future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Primary care is the sector of health care in which patients first establish contact with the health system, are provided person-focused care over time for all new or common needs, and receive coordinated integrated health services provided elsewhere by other members of the health care team. Registered Nurses (RNs) in Canada provide care within this sector in varying roles. The extent to which RNs enact their full scope of practice in primary care settings in Canada is not known. The Actual Scope of Practice questionnaire (ASCOP) is a 26 item Likert scale questionnaire developed by researchers in Canada and validated in the acute care setting to measure the extent to which RNs apply the knowledge, skills and competencies of the professional full scope of practice. Similar to the acute care setting, there is a need to measure scope of practice enactment in the primary care setting.&#xD;
Objectives: The overall aim of this thesis was to measure scope of practice enactment in the primary care setting. Two research objectives were addressed: (1) to revise and adapt the ASCOP questionnaire for use in the primary care setting, and (2) to determine internal consistency, construct validity, and sensitivity of the modified instrument, the ASCOP-PC.&#xD;
Methods: To address the first objective, a narrative literature review and synthesis and an expert panel review was conducted. To address the second objective a cross-sectional survey of 178 RNs working in primary care organizations in Ontario was conducted&#xD;
Results: The ASCOP, with few modifications, addressed key attributes of nursing scope of practice in the primary care setting. The ASCOP-PC yielded acceptable alpha coefficients ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 and explained variances from 44.2 to 62.6. Total mean score of 5.16 suggests that RNs within these models of care almost always engage in activities reflected in the ASCOP-PC.&#xD;
Interpretation: Findings from this study support the use of a the modified ASCOP questionnaire as a reliable and valid measure of scope of practice enactment among primary care nurses in the primary care setting.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is characterized by physiological sexual arousal (vasocongestion, sensitivity of the genitals and nipples) that is described as distressing, and sometimes painful. Although awareness of PGAD is growing, there continues to be a lack of systematic research on this condition. The vast majority of published reports are case studies. Little is known about the symptom characteristics, biological factors, or psychosocial functioning associated with the experience of persistent genital arousal (PGA) symptoms. &#xD;
This study sought to characterize a sample of women with PGA (Study One); compare women with and without PGA symptoms on a series of biopsychosocial factors (Study Two); and undertake an exploratory comparison of women with PGA, painful PGA, and genital pain (Study Three)—all within a biopsychosocial framework. Symptom-free women, women with PGA symptoms, painful PGA, and genital pain, completed an online survey of biological factors (medical history, symptom profiles), psychological factors (depression, anxiety) and social factors (sexual function, relationship satisfaction). &#xD;
Study One found that women report diverse symptoms associated with PGA, with almost half reporting painful symptoms. In Study Two, women with symptoms of PGA reported significantly greater impairment in most domains of psychosocial functioning as compared to symptom-free women. In particular, catastrophizing of vulvar sensations was related to symptom ratings (i.e., greater severity, distress) and psychosocial outcomes (i.e., greater depression and anxiety). Finally, Study Three found that women with PGA symptoms reported some overlap in medical comorbidities and symptom expression as those with combined PGA and vulvodynia and those with vulvodynia symptoms alone; however, there were also a number of significant differences in their associated physical symptoms. &#xD;
These studies indicate that PGA symptoms have negative consequences for the psychosocial functioning of affected women. As such, future research and clinical care may benefit from a biopsychosocial approach to PGA symptoms. These studies highlight areas for more targeted research, including the role of catastrophizing in PGA symptom development and maintenance, and the potential conceptualization of both PGA and vulvodynia (and potentially other conditions) under a general umbrella of ‘genital paraesthesias’ (i.e., disorders characterized by abnormal sensations, such as tingling and burning).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A functional nervous system requires the precise arrangement of all nerve cells and their neurites. To achieve this correct assembly, a myriad of molecular guidance cues works together to direct the outgrowth of neurites to their correct positions. The small nematode C. elegans provides the ideal model system to study the complex mechanisms of neurite guidance due to its relatively simple nervous system, composed of 302 neurons. I used two mechanosensory neurons, called the posterior lateral microtubule (PLM), to investigate the role of the ephrin and Eph receptor protein family in neurite termination in C. elegans. Activation of the C. elegans Eph receptor VAB-1 on the PLM growth cone is sufficient to cause PLM termination, but the identity and location of the activating ligand has not been established. In my thesis I investigated the ability of the ephrin ligand EFN-1 to activate VAB-1 to cause PLM termination when expressed on the same cell (in cis) and on opposing cells (in trans) to the receptor. I showed that EFN-1 is able to activate VAB-1 in cis and in trans to cause PLM termination. I also assessed the hypodermal seam cells as the source of the ephrin stop cue using fluorescently labelled and seam cell mutant transgenic worms. I found that although the PLM shows consistent termination on the seam cell V2 in wild type worms independent of PLM length, this process is not significantly disrupted in seam cell mutants. With this information I have created a new hypothesis that the PLM neurite is able the provide a positional cue for the developing seam cells, and have created a new transgenic strain which can be used to assess the impact of PLM and ALM cell ablation on seam cell position. My research is the first to demonstrate the ability of an ephrin ligand to activate its ephrin receptor in cis, and further research can investigate if this finding has in vivo applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Visualization and interpretation of geological observations into a cohesive geological model are essential to Earth sciences and related fields. Various emerging technologies offer approaches to multi-scale visualization of heterogeneous data, providing new opportunities that facilitate model development and interpretation processes. These include increased accessibility to 3D scanning technology, global connectivity, and Web-based interactive platforms. The geological sciences and geological engineering disciplines are adopting these technologies as volumes of data and physical samples greatly increase. However, a standardized and universally agreed upon workflow and approach have yet to properly be developed. In this thesis, the 3D scanning workflow is presented as a foundation for a virtual geological database. This database provides augmented levels of tangibility to students and researchers who have little to no access to locations that are remote or inaccessible. A Web-GIS platform was utilized jointly with customized widgets developed throughout the course of this research to aid in visualizing hand-sized/meso-scale geological samples within a geologic and geospatial context. This context is provided as a macro-scale GIS interface, where geophysical and geodetic images and data are visualized. Specifically, an interactive interface is developed that allows for simultaneous visualization to improve the understanding of geological trends and relationships. These developed tools will allow for rapid data access and global sharing, and will facilitate comprehension of geological models using multi-scale heterogeneous observations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is a large degree of heterogeneity in response to regular physical activity at the individual level, with some exhibiting no or very small improvements in VO2peak following highly controlled exercise training. The purpose of this thesis was to examine individual variation in VO2peak response to sprint interval training (SIT) in relation to individual responses to multiple measures of peripheral physiological adaptation. Specifically, VO2peak, capillary density, fibre-specific SDH content, and type I fibre % were measured in 23 young, healthy, recreationally active males before and after 4 weeks SIT (Tabata protocol 4 x per week). The key findings of this experiment included that, when separated into tertiles of VO2peak response, the high (HI) and low (LO) groups differed significantly in VO2peak change after training. Secondly, there was no difference between HI and LO groups for response in any of capillary density, fibre-specific SDH content, or fibre type %, with no correlation found between individual VO2peak response and changes in any measured peripheral variable. Together, these results confirm that individuals respond heterogeneously to SIT and suggest that this heterogeneity does not result from differences in individual changes in capillary density, fibre-specific SDH content or type I fibre %. It is speculated that some other combination of peripheral physiological adaptation must explain variability in VO2peak response to 4 weeks of SIT.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The subfornical organ (SFO) is a critical circumventricular organ involved in the control of cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis. Despite the abundant literature clearly demonstrating the ability of SFO neurons to sense and respond to a plethora of circulating signals that influence various physiological systems, investigation of how simultaneously sensed signals interact and are integrated in the SFO is lacking. In this study, we use patch clamp techniques to investigate how the traditionally classified ‘cardiovascular’ hormone angiotensin II (ANG), ‘metabolic’ hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) and ‘metabolic’ signal glucose interact and are integrated in the SFO. Sequential bath-application of CCK (10nM) and ANG (10nM) onto dissociated SFO neurons revealed that: 63% of responsive SFO neurons depolarized to both CCK &amp; ANG; 25% depolarized to ANG only; and 12% hyperpolarized to CCK only. We next investigated the effects of glucose by incubating and recording neurons in either hypo-, normo- or hyperglycemic conditions for a minimum of 24 hours and comparing the proportions of responses to ANG (n=55) or CCK (n=83) application in each condition. A hyperglycemic environment was associated with a larger proportion of depolarizing responses to ANG (X2, p&lt;0.05), and a smaller proportion of depolarizing responses along with a larger proportion of hyperpolarizing responses to CCK (X2, p&lt;0.01). These data demonstrate that SFO neurons excited by CCK are also excited by ANG, suggesting that CCK may influence fluid intake or blood pressure via the SFO, complementary to the well-understood actions of ANG at this site. Additionally, the demonstration that glucose environment affects the responsiveness of neurons to both these hormones highlights the ability of SFO neurons to integrate multiple metabolic and cardiovascular signals to affect transmission of information from the circulation to the brain, which has important implications for this structure’s critical role regulation of autonomic function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recreational fisheries in North America are valued between $47.3 billion and $56.8 billion. Fisheries managers must make strategic decisions based on sound science and knowledge of population ecology, to effectively conserve populations. Competitive fishing, in the form of tournaments, has become an important part of recreational fisheries, and is common on large waterbodies including the Great Lakes. Black Bass, Micropterus spp., are top predators and among the most sought after species in competitive catch-and-release tournaments. This study investigated catch-and-release tournaments as an assessment tool through mark-recapture for Largemouth Bass (&gt;305mm) populations in the Tri Lakes, and Bay of Quinte, part of the eastern basin of Lake Ontario. The population in the Tri Lakes (1999-2002) was estimated to be stable between 21,928-29,780, and the population in the Bay of Quinte (2012-2015) was estimated to be between 31,825-54,029 fish. Survival in the Tri Lakes varied throughout the study period, from 31%-54%; while survival in the Bay of Quinte remained stable at 63%. Differences in survival may be due to differences in fishing pressure, as 34-46% of the Largemouth Bass population on the Tri Lakes is harvested annually and only 19% of catch was attributed to tournament angling. Many biological issues still surround catch-and-release tournaments, particularly concerning displacement from initial capture sites. In the past, the majority of studies have focused on small inland lakes and coastal areas, displacing bass relatively short distances. My study displaced Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass up to 100km, and found very low rates of return; only 1 of 18 Largemouth Bass returned 15 km and 1 of 18 Smallmouth Bass returned 135 km. Both species remained near the release sites for an average of approximately 2 weeks prior to dispersing. Tournament organizers should consider the use of satellite release locations to facilitate dispersal and prevent stockpiling at the release site. Catch-and-release tournaments proved to be a valuable tool in assessing population variables and the effects of long distance displacement through the use of mark recapture and acoustic telemetry on large lake systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Large calcareous eolianites cover the remote island of Bermuda, accounting for more than 90% of the limestone bedrock. This study examines the sedimentology and geochemistry of these eolianites to better understand Pleistocene oceanography and the meteoric alteration of subtropical carbonate sediments. Cluster analyses reveal that the eolian carbonate sediments fall into two natural groups that represent lagoonal and reefal end members of marine sediment production. Coral fragments are uncharacteristically absent, possibly destroyed prior to their incorporation into eolian deposits by endolithic microboring organisms or broken up during transport. Sediment assemblages lead to the following interpretations of the Bermudan offshore environment: (1) the Ledge Flats reef system along the southwestern coast has been active since MIS 11, contributing coralline algal-rich sediment to the northern beaches of Sandy’s Parish and acting as an energy barrier in the south, allowing for low energy sedimentation in the quiet back- reef region; (2) on the northeastern coast, the low energy back-reef region landward of the Ledge Flats has thrived since MIS 11; (3) during MIS 5e, slightly warmer water temperatures led to the hindrance of coralline algal growth along the southern coast and in the North Lagoon. These are the first interpretations of Pleistocene marine assemblages on Bermuda.&#xD;
Meteoric fluids progressively transformed the pristine carbonate sediments into hardened limestones in a predictable solubility-dependent manner. The progressive alteration is coincident with: (1) divergence of δ18O and δ13C values from those similar to unaltered sediment towards those of calcrete, due to interaction with CO2-charged meteoric fluids; (2) depletion of elements with low partitioning coefficients and low meteoric concentrations, such as barium, boron, magnesium, potassium, sodium, strontium, and uranium; (3) enrichment of iron from Terra Rossa-hosted iron oxides; (4) enrichment of aluminum via detrital minerals sourced from protosol horizons; and (5) manganese concentrations that remain uncharacteristically low, owing to the lack of a consistent manganese source. Elemental correlations are useful for characterizing meteoric diagenesis, assuming the primary mineralogy is recognized, all components have been fully altered, and inter-particle cements are ubiquitous.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The map representation of an environment should be selected based on its intended application. For example, a geometrically accurate map describing the Euclidean space of an environment is not necessarily the best choice if only a small subset its features are required. One possible subset is the orientations of the flat surfaces in the environment, represented by a special parameterization of normal vectors called axes. Devoid of positional information, the entries of an axis map form a non-injective relationship with the flat surfaces in the environment, which results in physically distinct flat surfaces being represented by a single axis. This drastically reduces the complexity of the map, but retains important information about the environment that can be used in meaningful applications in both two and three dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents axis mapping, which is an algorithm that accurately and automatically estimates an axis map of an environment based on sensor measurements collected by a mobile platform. Furthermore, two major applications of axis maps are developed and implemented. First, the LiDAR compass is a heading estimation algorithm that compares measurements of axes with an axis map of the environment. Pairing the LiDAR compass with simple translation measurements forms the basis for an accurate two-dimensional localization algorithm. It is shown that this algorithm eliminates the growth of heading error in both indoor and outdoor environments, resulting in accurate localization over long distances. Second, in the context of geotechnical engineering, a three-dimensional axis map is called a stereonet, which is used as a tool to examine the strength and stability of a rock face. Axis mapping provides a novel approach to create accurate stereonets safely, rapidly, and inexpensively compared to established methods. The non-injective property of axis maps is leveraged to probabilistically describe the relationships between non-sequential measurements of the rock face. The automatic estimation of stereonets was tested in three separate outdoor environments. It is shown that axis mapping can accurately estimate stereonets while improving safety, requiring significantly less time and effort, and lowering costs compared to traditional and current state-of-the-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

Drawing primarily on the United States, this project problematizes the notion of consumer financial big data as a ‘new era’ by tracing its roots historically from late nineteenth century through to the present. Using a qualitative case study approach, this project applies a unique theoretical framework to three instances of governance in consumer credit big data.  Throughout, the historically specific means used to govern consumer credit data are rooted in dominant ideas, institutions and material factors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation offers an investigation of the role of visual strategies, art, and representation in reconciling Indian Residential School history in Canada. This research builds upon theories of biopolitics, settler colonialism, and race to examine the project of redress and reconciliation as nation and identity building strategies engaged in the ongoing structural invasion of settler colonialism. It considers the key policy moments and expressions of the federal government—from RCAP to the IRSSA and subsequent apology—as well as the visual discourse of reconciliation as it works through archival photography, institutional branding, and commissioned works. These articulations are read alongside the creative and critical work of Indigenous artists and knowledge producers working within and outside of hegemonic structures on the topics of Indian Residential School history and redress. In particular the works of Jeff Thomas, Adrian Stimson, Krista Belle Stewart, Christi Belcourt, Luke Marston, Peter Morin, and Carey Newman are discussed in this dissertation. These works must be understood in relationship to the normative discourse of reconciliation as a legitimizing mechanism of settler colonial hegemony. Beyond the binary of cooptation and autonomous resistance, these works demonstrate the complexity of representing Indigeneity: as an ongoing site of settler colonial encounter and simultaneously the forum for the willful refusal of contingency or containment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With applications ranging from aerospace to biomedicine, additive manufacturing (AM) has been revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. The ability of additive techniques, such as selective laser melting (SLM), to create fully functional, geometrically complex, and unique parts out of high strength materials is of great interest. Unfortunately, despite numerous advantages afforded by this technology, its widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of on-line, real time feedback control and quality assurance techniques. In this thesis, inline coherent imaging (ICI), a broadband, spatially coherent imaging technique, is used to observe the SLM process in 15 - 45 $\mu m$ 316L stainless steel. Imaging of both single and multilayer builds is performed at a rate of 200 $kHz$, with a resolution of tens of microns, and a high dynamic range rendering it impervious to blinding from the process beam. This allows imaging before, during, and after laser processing to observe changes in the morphology and stability of the melt.&#xD;
&#xD;
Galvanometer-based scanning of the imaging beam relative to the process beam during the creation of single tracks is used to gain a unique perspective of the SLM process that has been so far unobservable by other monitoring techniques. Single track processing is also used to investigate the possibility of a preliminary feedback control parameter based on the process beam power, through imaging with both coaxial and 100 $\mu m$ offset alignment with respect to the process beam. The 100 $\mu m$ offset improved imaging by increasing the number of bright A-lines (i.e. with signal greater than the 10 $dB$ noise floor) by 300\%. The overlap between adjacent tracks in a single layer is imaged to detect characteristic fault signatures. Full multilayer builds are carried out and the resultant ICI images are used to detect defects in the finished part and improve upon the initial design of the build system. Damage to the recoater blade is assessed using powder layer scans acquired during a 3D build. The ability of ICI to monitor SLM processes at such high rates with high resolution offers extraordinary potential for future advances in on-line feedback control of additive manufacturing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The walls of blood vessels are lined with a single-cell layer of endothelial cells. As blood flows through the arteries, a frictional force known as shear stress is sensed by mechanosensitive structures on the endothelium. Short and long term changes in shear stress can have a significant influence on the regulation of endothelial function. Acutely, shear stress triggers a pathway that culminates in the release of vasodilatory molecules from the endothelium and subsequent vasodilation of the artery. This endothelial response is known as flow mediated dilation (FMD). FMD is used as an index of endothelial function and is commonly assessed using reactive hyperemia (RH)-FMD, a method which elicits a large, short lived increase in shear stress following the release of a brief (5 min) forearm occlusion. A recent study found that a short term exposure (30 min) to a sustained elevation in shear stress potentiates subsequent RH-FMD. FMD can also result from a more prolonged, sustained increase in shear stress elicited by handgrip exercise (HGEX-FMD). There is evidence to suggest that interventions and conditions impact FMD resulting from sustained and transient shear stress stimuli differently, indicating that HGEX-FMD and RH-FMD provide different information about endothelial function. It is unknown whether HGEX-FMD is improved by short term exposure to shear stress. Understanding how exercise induced FMD is regulated is important because it contributes to blood flow responses during exercise. The study purpose was therefore to assess the impact of a handgrip exercise (intervention) induced sustained elevation in shear stress on subsequent brachial artery (BA) HGEX-FMD. Twenty healthy male participants (22±3yrs) preformed a 30-minute HGEX intervention on two experimental days. BA-FMD was assessed using either an RH or HGEX shear stress stimulus at 3 time points: pre-intervention, 10 min post and 60 min post. FMD and shear stress magnitude were determined via ultrasound. Both HGEX and RH-FMD increased significantly from pre-intervention to 10 min-post (p&lt;0.01).  These findings indicate that FMD stimulated by exercise induced increases in shear stress is potentiated by short term shear stress exposure.  These findings advance our understanding regarding the regulation of endothelial function by shear stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a nine amino acid neuropeptide (CYFQNCPRG- NH2) fulfills a dual function: (i) in the periphery, AVP acts as a peptide hormone and (ii) in the CNS, AVP is a neuromodulatory peptide. AVP produces its effects through 3 AVP receptors (AVPRs). AVPR1a and AVPR1b are expressed in the CNS and periphery, whilst AVPR2 is not found centrally but instead solely expressed in the kidneys. Recent evidence revealed a high density of AVP-binding sites in the juxtacapsular nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (jxBNST). While in other regions of the brain, AVP acts at AVPRs to regulate an array of biological processes, including male-typical social behaviours, social memory, stress adaptation, fear, anxiety, and fluid homeostasis, its role in the jxBNST remains elusive. Furthermore, the neurophysiological properties of AVP in the jxBNST are unknown so this study aimed to examine how AVP modulates synaptic transmission in the rat jxBNST. The BNST being one of the most notable sexually dimorphic brain regions and AVPR expression being influenced by gonadal steroids, we investigated the putative influence of sex on the modulatory effects of AVP in the jxBNST. Finally, due to AVP being released at a substantially higher concentration following periods of water deprivation, we examined changes in AVPs modulatory role following water deprivation. Male and female Long Evans rats were euthanized and brain slice whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology was done in the jxBNST to measure the effects of AVP on synaptic transmission of GABA synapses. Exogenous application of AVP produced three responses; either postsynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) of GABAA-inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC), postsynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of GABAA-IPSC, or no change in GABAA-IPSC amplitudes. Interestingly, the proportion of neurons responding in each of these ways did not differ between sexes and within females was not estrous cycle-dependent. Finally, although not statistically significant, 24-hour water deprivation abolished GABAA-LTD, an effect that was not a consequence of social isolation. Taken together, our data show that AVP modulates GABAA synaptic transmission in the jxBNST in fluid homeostasis- but not sex-dependent manner.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the gentleman-scholar depicted at home in Dutch seventeenth-century genre paintings, focusing primarily on art created in the Northern Netherlands from the 1630s through the 1670s. The methodological approach is art historical but also pertains to history of architecture, history of dress, and gender studies. Employing the framework of the 'Ages of Man', this thesis investigates three related pictorial themes: the student, the scholar in his prime, and the aged scholar. 	Variations of male scholarly figures and the accoutrements of the study have a long history in Europe. Prototypical sources include religious history paintings of learned hermit-saints; artistic interest in the allegorical Saturnine persona; portraits of famous scholars; and the iconography of scholarly melancholy implied through vanitas allusions in portraiture and genre paintings. &#xD;
While the majority of Dutch genre paintings pertain to themes of women, male domestic routines form a small but important subset of this imagery and have not been studied. By the 1640s, this subject is readily identified by his setting, clothing, and actions. The ubiquity of scholarly attributes, such as books and globes, paired with the wearing of scholarly robes suggest the merits of intellectual curiosity and the privileges of studying as a pastime and designating a room as a study (studeerkamer). Distinct themes in genre also imply the challenges and rewards of scholarly activity pursued in concert with masculine civic and familial duty. Central to the development of this pictorial theme were: the innovative treatment of learned men by Rembrandt and his circle; the fijnschilder subjects of Dou; and the practice of amateur study by elite men, as suggested by the art of Vermeer. As this dissertation reveals, this convention did not grow to be consistent across the Northern Netherlands, nor was artistic interest limited to university towns. Rather, the larger relevance of scholars in Dutch society is evident in visual and literary sources. The domesticity of this figure in genre painting suggests that scholars mediated between an active and a contemplative life. Societal respect was garnered for scholars through their balance of familial and social duties with the honorable pastime of scholarly leisure.</dcterms:abstract>
