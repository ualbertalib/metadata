      <dcterms:abstract>On March 2, 2017, a potential loophole to the United States Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) was presented to the United States Congress. Bill H.R.1313 seeks to amend the GINA, to allow companies to subject their employees to genetic testing as part of Workplace Wellness Programs (WWPs). By conducting an analysis of congressional hearings related to WWPs and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as well as meetings held by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a civil rights group, this thesis argues that wellness programs have risen in popularity among US employers as a response to the ACA. Wellness programs are presented as an opportunity for employees to reduce their insurance premiums. I argue, however, that employers offer lower premiums to those who practice ‘healthy lifestyles’ and are knowledgeable about their bodies and those who do not meet these outcomes pay more for their health. Wellness programs foster what some scholarship refers to as ‘biological citizenship’ (Rose and Novas 2003, Petryna 2002): the idea that individuals must take responsibility for their own health and well-being; as well as ‘technological citizenship’ (Barry 2001): the expectation that individuals must have technoscientific knowledge about the self as well as institutional knowledge about how to navigate the health care system. This thesis seeks to understand how wellness programs are grounded in particular conceptions of what it means to be healthy, and how the programs could open the door to discrimination based on genetics, but also based on categories of class, gender, age, race, and disability. As wellness programs can be used as a tool to assign more responsibility and cost to the individual, they could create a shift from health care to self-care.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Organizations are rife with paradox, or the seemingly contradictory yet interdependent forces that surface across organizational levels (Smith &amp; Lewis, 2011). This dissertation seeks to answer the recent call for greater scholarly attention to the micro-foundation, collective influence, and effective management of organizational paradox (Miron-Spektor et al., 2018; Schad et al., 2016). I conducted two lab experiments (Study 1a and Study 1b) and two field surveys (Study 2 and Study 3) to examine how people think, feel, and behave in paradoxical workplaces individually and collectively. Building upon the burgeoning body of research on mindfulness - the degree to which one brings full attention and awareness to the present in a non-judgmental way (Baer et al., 2006; Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003) – I further explored when, how and why highly mindful individuals and teams could benefit from seeming contradictions. &#xD;
In Study 1a and Study 1b I explore what people think and how they feel when tackling paradoxical demands and the moderating role of trait mindfulness. Results from two experiments (NStudy 1a = 83; NStudy 1b = 100) reveal that mindfulness may foster positive psychological experiences (e.g., higher integrative complexity, fewer interfering thoughts, and maintained calming emotions) in the face of paradox.  Study 2 investigates proactive (i.e., job crafting) and destructive workplace behaviours (i.e., withdrawal) in response to organizational paradoxes, as a function of employee mindfulness. By conducting a longitudinal field survey (Nemployee = 201), I find that competing work priorities are associated with more withdrawal, and that high mindfulness may buffer such detrimental effects of paradox. Yet, as they stay on the job, highly mindful employees (versus low mindful employees) make less effort to craft their jobs.  Study 3 turns to paradoxical responses in collectives and examines the salutary effect of team mindfulness in managing paradox as a team. Results from a two-wave team-based survey (Nteam = 54) suggest that mindful teams can leverage opposing forces to improve innovation without suffering from relationship conflict.  Overall, this dissertation informs not only the paradox and mindfulness scholarship but also practitioners about the peculiar nature of organizational paradox and strategies to leverage competing work priorities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Since 2013, Cuban authorities have taken significant steps towards the regularization of public Internet access in the Island. Before that date, policies regarding the Internet benefited specific sectors and limited the broader access of most of the Cuban population. Cubans managed to stay current, creating original alternatives or adjusting pre-existing initiatives to get access to information and knowledge. This thesis explores some of the configurations that characterize the Cuban communicative ecosystem. Building on Don Slater’s concepts of communicative ecologies and communicative assemblages (2013), I define the Cuban communicative ecosystem as the combination of online and offline alternatives to access information and enable communication needs. Such alternatives involve human agents, tools and media that work within institutional, irregular, and illegal networks. Those networks coexist, not necessarily in harmony, within everyday life in Cuba. Rather than disappearing with Internet access, the irregular and illegal aspects of the communicative ecosystem continue to emerge and develop, providing in some cases more suitable solutions in a context of scarcity. The emergence of irregular and illegal networks is an expression of agency in the face of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). I argue that Cubans’ agency reflects a cultural sense of connectedness, based on imaginaries about modernity, modernization, development, and normality that have been part of Cuban tradition since its formation as a nation. I will approach the concept of modernity as a metaphor that expresses the goals and illusions of modernization and development. In the Cuban case, being part of modernity historically reflected an obsession to transcend geographical and intellectual insularity, embracing the global flows of technological and social modernization. Throughout this thesis, I seek to answer two central questions: What is the Internet adding regarding individual agency to the fabric of Cuban society? And how does the creation of alternative communicative structures, enriched by the Internet, relate to an inherent and mainly not deliberate sense of connectedness with a global community?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The introduction of Cobalt 60 (Co 60) units in the 1950s established megavoltage radiation therapy worldwide. Unfortunately, advances for the Co 60 radiation treatment units were not heavily pursued over the years and Co 60 units have been steadily replaced by clinical linear accelerators (linacs) x ray systems, which can offer more precise radiation treatments.  The Medical Physics Department at the Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario (CCSEO) has shown, however, that the Co 60 unit can be developed to enable modern radiation treatments similar to linacs. In 2015, the CCSEO collaborated with Best Theratronics (Kanata, Ontario) to upgrade a Theratron 780C Co 60 radiation therapy unit to an Equinox 100 external beam radiation therapy system. This was the first upgrade of a T780C Co-60 unit in the world, which represents an exciting opportunity to advance Co 60 radiation therapy to provide treatments equivalent to those available from modern linacs.  &#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, an upgraded Equinox 100 unit is commissioned in the Varian Eclipse treatment planning systems (TPS) to ascertain if the Analytical Anisotropic Algorithm (AAA) in the Eclipse could be used to generate Co 60 3D based treatment plans. Firstly, mechanical commissioning of the upgraded unit was performed according to Task Group 45 report (AAPM) recommendations. Secondly, various commissioning beam measurements were acquired using an ion chamber in standard water phantom on the upgraded unit to model the beams in the Eclipse TPS. The AAA validation was performed to test the accuracy of the Eclipse TPS dose prediction based on the local percentage differences between the measurements and the Eclipse model calculations in various simple open and blocked plans using the ion chamber in the phantom. &#xD;
&#xD;
The mechanical acceptance tests are generally comparable to clinical linac tolerances, which suggest that upgrading conventional Co 60 units may improve treatments without compromising the mechanical accuracy. Similarly, the Eclipse model calculations of the validation plans show overall excellent agreements with measurements within the recommended clinical criteria for large fields starting at 5 × 5 cm2. This suggests that the Eclipse TPS is appropriate for forward planning of Co 60 3D conformal radiation therapy for large fields. Further investigations for small fields are required.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arsenic concentrations in lake sediments in the Yellowknife region, Northwest Territories, Canada are elevated from the weathering of mineralized bedrock and/or from the mining and processing of arsenic (As)-bearing ores at legacy gold mines in the area. Specifically, 50 years of ore roasting at Giant Mine (1948-2004) resulted in the release of approximately 20,000 t of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) to the atmosphere as stack emissions. Historical tailings disposal at Giant also introduced As- and antimony (Sb)-rich materials to sediments in Yellowknife Bay, adjacent to the mine property. This research aimed to understand the origin and long-term fate of As in lake sediments in the Yellowknife region. &#xD;
&#xD;
Elevated As concentrations in regional lake sediments are largely the result of ore roasting at legacy gold mines. Radiometric dating of sediment cores indicated that the majority of As was introduced to the sediments during the period of maximum regional stack emissions. Anthropogenic As2O¬3 has persisted in lake sediments for more than 60 years, though its partial dissolution has resulted in the formation of less bioaccessible As-hosting phases including iron (Fe)-oxyhydroxide and As-bearing sulphides. &#xD;
The analysis of 47 sediment cores from a single emissions-impacted lake showed that sediment As concentrations and solid-phase speciation vary across the lake bottom and with sediment depth. Two distinct types of down-core As concentration profiles were identified and are interpreted to represent erosional and depositional areas. Statistical analysis revealed that water depth, as a proxy for sediment focusing, is the best predictor of As concentration in the top 5 cm of sediments. Iron concentration, as an indicator of As, Fe, and sulphur (S) co-diagenesis, is the best predictor of As concentration in deeper sediments. Sediments are a source of As to the overlying water column through diffusion-controlled release to bottom waters. &#xD;
&#xD;
The solid-phase distribution of As and Sb in Yellowknife Bay sediments was a complex mixture of flotation tailings, roaster waste, and aerially deposited stack emissions. Arsenic and Sb in Yellowknife Bay exhibited differences in post-depositional behaviour that can be attributed to the anthropogenic controls governing the solid-phase speciation of these elements in mine waste produced at Giant.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is a growing demand over the last two decades for generating digital surface models (DSMs) in real-time. One of the important applications for real-time DSMs is aircraft landing, especially in a degraded visual environment. In such a challenging environment, no clear visual conditions exist, which can potentially result in the loss of equipment and/or life. These conditions can be caused by snow, rain, blowing sand and dust, fog, smoke, clouds, darkness, and flat light conditions that currently hamper aviation operations. With the growing demand for such applications, there is a need for efficient LiDAR processing algorithms capable of generating DSMs in real-time and provide the safe landing zone (SLZ) for the aircraft landing.&#xD;
Several research activities have addressed robust filtering algorithms for the airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Although most of these filtering algorithms are accurate and robust, they are limited to post-processing since they rely on computationally expensive algorithms and require high execution time that is not suitable for real-time applications.&#xD;
The aim of this research is to design and implement an efficient algorithm that can filter LiDAR point cloud, generate DSM, slope map, roughness map and operate in real-time. The algorithm is suitable for real-time implementation on limited resources embedded-processors without the need for a supercomputer. It is also capable of using all the generated maps in identifying SLZs suitable for the aircraft landing.&#xD;
The method suggested in this research identifies the best SLZ for the aircraft based on processing the 3D LiDAR point cloud collected from a LiDAR mounted on the aircraft. The&#xD;
iii&#xD;
proposed method filters these data, then constructs a DSM of the terrain with high accuracy. It also generates a slope map, roughness map and binary map, which are used to determine the best SLZ for this aircraft. The SLZ decision is made according to the permissible slope and roughness values in which the aircraft can land safely. Moreover, the proposed method filters SLZ to include only those that have enough space for the aircraft landing.&#xD;
The proposed method was successfully implemented in C++ in real-time and was examined on a professional software flight simulation. With comparison to the reference data, we were able to demonstrate the capability of the developed method to identify SLZs for helicopters assisting pilots to decide on the safest landing area. The proposed method was also able to distinguish, in real-time, the roofs of the buildings (areas of low slope) from the edges of the same buildings (areas of high slope).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Roasting of gold-bearing arsenopyrite (FeAsS) ore at mines around Yellowknife resulted in the release of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) via airborne emissions. Previous studies highlighted a persistent elevated arsenic (As) in local lake sediments and surface waters 50 years after the bulk of these emissions were released. The objectives of this research are to: 1) characterize regional concentrations of As in Yellowknife area soils; 2) identify factors that explain regional patterns of distribution; and 3) distinguish between natural and anthropogenic As sources in undisturbed soils. &#xD;
Total element analyses were completed for 125 Public Health Layer (PHL) (top 5 cm of cored soil samples), 43 grab samples and 37 samples taken from greater depths in cores, or down core (DC) samples. Total As concentrations ranged from 1.5 to 4900 mg/kg in PHL samples, 12 to 930 mg/kg in grab samples, and 1.6 to 1200 mg/kg in DC samples. The most significant factors on As concentrations in PHL samples include the distance and direction from former mine roasters, soil depth, and terrain unit.&#xD;
Fifty samples were selected for scanning electron microscopy and automated mineralogy (SEM/AM) to identify the solid species of As present within soil units. Anthropogenic sources of As are characterized by the presence of As2O3 and distinctive As-bearing Fe-oxides derived from roaster stack emissions. The most common As-bearing phases identified in soils throughout the study area included: As-bearing Fe-oxides/Fe-oxide mixes (present in 98% of samples), organic Fe-oxide mixes with As (98% of samples), As2O3 (82%), and As-bearing Mn-oxides (60% of samples). &#xD;
Findings from this thesis suggest that previously estimated background levels for As ranging from 0 to 300 mg/kg are too high; median total As-concentrations decrease from 130 mg/kg to 22.5 mg/kg and finally 8.1 mg/kg for samples collected at distances of 0 – 10 km, 10 – 20 km and 20 – 30 km from the Giant roaster. Additional sampling initiatives need to target soils at further distances to determine an appropriate total As background concentration that can be used to help guide future risk assessment recommendations for the Yellowknife area.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>From 1650 onward, the city of Montréal became a crossroads that connected colonial French, Indigenous, and African worlds. A study of the geo-cultural landscapes of Montréal presents an opportunity to analyze the commercial, social, and familial networks of diverse peoples in a space defined by mobility, fluidity, and growing stability. The purpose of this research project is to illustrate how French households in Montréal between 1650 and 1750, which included Indigenous and African descent slaves and other labourers who are generally not considered as a part of family formation, contributes to our understanding of the interconnected nature of the French colonial world. There are different ways to explore the commercial, social, and familial connections that shaped Montréal into a crossroads. This project explores spatial, demographic, and household composition as three interrelated dimensions of Montréal’s networks. I utilize the idea of concentric circles of connection, moving from a macro- to a micro-historical level of analysis. I begin by considering Montréal’s geographic position in North America; next I examine the physical layout of the built environment in Montréal and follow with an analysis of Montréal’s demographic development. The thesis concludes with the reconstruction of the commercial, social, and familial networks that developed in Montréal society and within individual households. I use four different examples of household units to provide a deeper understanding of the types of interaction that contributed to the interconnected colonial world of French Canada. These include a consideration of the households of Governor Charles LeMoyne de Longueuil; prominent Montréal merchant Ignace Gamelin Jr.; decorated soldier Luc de La Corne St. Luc; and nun Marie-Marguerite Dufrost de Lajemmerais. These four families can be understood as microcosms of some of the broader fluid and highly mobile commercial, social, intimate, and familial interactions that characterized Montréal and the French colonial world.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines how an embodied aesthetic of classical ballet comes into being through modernities’ discourses and material realities of nation, state, colonialism, heterosexuality and their constitutive logics. Accordingly, ballet bodies are produced within a Marxist mode of production and circulate through a movement linguistic system that is phallologocentric. To consider how to move beyond such a system, an evaluation and expansion upon Susan Leigh Foster’s oft-cited work “The Ballerina’s Phallic Pointe” examines the holds modernities’ take over ballet bodies through their production and highlights potentialities for alternative futures. The thesis turns to autobiographical and biographical works of professional ballerinas to express the affected material realities of ballet’s mode of productions’ acts on material bodies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The foreign body response is an inflammatory response to implanted materials and poses significant challenges for biomaterials-based medical applications, often leading to the degradation or fibrous encapsulation of an implanted device. The host response is largely dictated by the proteins that adsorb to the biomaterial surface, including damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are released by cells upon necrosis or when under considerable amounts of stress. The immune response to implanted materials is carried out primarily by macrophages, which recognize DAMPs and other surface-adsorbed proteins with toll-like receptors (TLRs), initiating an inflammatory response. Macrophages play key roles in inflammatory and wound healing responses due to their ability to transition from a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype to a pro-resolution M2-like phenotype. This thesis explores the use of a model of biomaterial-induced macrophage inflammatory response, and the ability of two molecules to modulate this response. &#xD;
	A human macrophage-like cell line was treated with T6167923, a MyD88 signal transduction inhibitor. MyD88 is a critical component in the TLR pathway, which plays a significant role in inflammation and has been implicated in biomaterial-induced macrophage activation. Unfortunately, the inhibitor consistently precipitated in cell culture media, at all concentrations and with all dilution methods attempted. The presence of the particles may have encouraged pro-inflammatory activation of the cells via phagocytosis. However, some conditions did result in reduced activation with inhibitor treatment, suggesting further work with this molecule is warranted.&#xD;
	The second investigated molecule was Maresin 1 (MaR1), an endogenous pro-resolving mediator that contributes to the active transition from the inflammatory phase of wound healing towards resolution. The effect of MaR1 on macrophage activation was studied in two macrophage-like cell lines and primary macrophages, and produced conflicting results. However, the inconsistency was attributed to the sensitivity of MaR1 to degradation. This could not only produce some confounding results, but also raised significant technical challenges in handling MaR1. Nonetheless, fresh, undegraded MaR1 did reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in TLR2-activated dTHP1-XBlue macrophages.&#xD;
	Although both molecules posed significant technical challenges, their effects should be investigated further. Drug delivery systems should be explored to overcome these challenges and allow for direct delivery to cells.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 1558, Scottish Reformer John Knox published The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women, to which English-Catholic aristocrat Henry Howard responded in 1590 with his as-of-yet-still-unpublished manuscript “A Dutifull Defence of the Lawfull Regiment of Women”. Though Knox and Howard respond to the same phenomenon – the role of women in the traditionally-male authority of the English throne – they held oppositional views of English queenship. Their vastly differing historical contexts transcended their works and resulted in their conflicting arguments. Knox’s opposition to female rule, rooted in his Presbyterianism, denied regal and spiritual authority to queens regnant because he refused to recognise the legitimacy of a woman in political and religious power. Howard, meanwhile, negotiated for mercy from Elizabeth I and hoped for tolerance from her for his Catholicism. He also legitimised female rule because, as a Catholic, Howard did not recognise the English monarch’s supremacy over the Church of England. He thus negated Knox’s concerns about female spiritual authority. Through analysis of the arguments in Knox’s The First Blast and Howard’s “A Dutifull Defence”, contextualisation of both works in early modern Catholic and Protestant resistance theories, and analysis specifically of the environment in which Howard wrote, I argue that Knox and Howard have opposing viewpoints on female monarchy not because of their opinions on sex but because of their religious beliefs. Though Knox and Howard wrote on the subject of female rule in early modern England, both are implicitly influenced by their environments which transcended their present moments and deeply affected how they each responded to queens occupying England’s regal space.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation evaluates the concept of user-friendliness not only as a preeminent philosophy of software design, but as an integral element of the metaphysics of software and the very conceptualization of both cybernetics and digital computers as such. My analysis traces the reductive nature of user-friendly design and its politics of mimetically simulated conviviality and consequent instrumental occlusion to the earliest rhetorical arguments in favour of digital computation as a reliably universal means to model stochastic phenomena. It traces the implicitly reductive tendencies of cybernetic theory as an ontology and epistemology from the earliest intellectual history of digital computation through to its negotiation of early commercial markets and he effect that consumer and corporate demands have had on the valorization and formalization of increasingly user-friendly software designs. Especially attuned to the linkages between technology, culture, and intellectual history, this dissertation also demonstrates the conclusive links between this particular axiology of computer design and the rise in invasive, oppressive practices such as endemic mass and targeted surveillance via cybernetic technologies—a state of affairs which is mediated, aided, and abetted by the values of user-friendly design and the vicissitudes they beget.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The underrepresentation of women in certain disciplines in post-secondary engineering education and in the workforce, has been a prevailing issue. Researchers have analyzed this phenomenon over the years and various initiatives that encourage women to pursue and persist in engineering, however, the positive impact of outreach programs on women’s perceptions of engineering is not fully understood. The purpose of this research is to explore the experiences of former female high school and university participants in Queen’s Summer Engineering Academy (QSEA) in order to determine how to promote equitable participation of males and females in engineering programs. &#xD;
This research is guided by Gender Schema Theory which is used as a lens for understanding how young women perceive an educational path in engineering. Through stratified sampling, 27 former female participants of QSEA were recruited and ranged from ages fourteen to twenty. Participants completed a three-part questionnaire designed to explore their experiences in the program and gain insights about their perceptions of professional women in engineering. For data analysis, descriptive statistics and an inductive analysis was completed. &#xD;
According to the results, three themes emerged from the study: 1) QSEA provides impetus to interested females to pursue an engineering degree; 2) participants developed a positive perception of the roles of females in engineering; 3) participants suggested desired resources to understand the female engineering experience. Sub-themes reveal that: (a) participants were interested in engineering prior to participating in QSEA, (b) QSEA informed student knowledge of engineering and motivated participants to pursue engineering, (c) participants learned of possibilities for success in an alternative field (d) there is a need for increased female representation in QSEA instructors and participants, and (e) more opportunities and resources are required to explore the topic of experiences of women in engineering. According to the findings of this research and limitations of the study, future recommendations are made for future work in this area.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This is a historiographical examination of Natalie Zemon Davis and her contribution to historical writing over the course of her academic career. I examine Davis’ body of work from her first published article as a graduate student in 1955 to her latest publication in 2019. Accompanying the examination of Davis’ trajectory as a scholar, this thesis will also include many moments of her personal life: her Jewish upbringing, marrying young, the seizure of her passport during the ‘Red Scare,’ political and social activism, and motherhood. These moments in Davis’ personal life influenced the scope and the subjects of her writing, and this correlation will be evident as this thesis moves throughout each decade of her life. In addition to her academic and private life, I place Davis within a broader context of the trends and transitions within the discipline of history itself, with a primary focus on the rise of social, women’s, cultural, and global history. This thesis closely follows the journey of how Davis began as a social historian of the printing industry, and of sixteenth-century Lyon, to an interdisciplinary scholar who is currently investigating Jewish slave ownership on the plantations of colonial Suriname.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Consumers often react badly to marketers’ attempts to persuade them, demonstrating mostly negative attitudes towards salespeople, advertisements, and brands. Prior work typically attributes these reactions to inferences of persuasion motives (variously labelled ulterior motives, manipulative intent, and skepticism etc.). However, persuasion motives alone may not fully capture the reasons underlying consumers’ negative reactions to persuasion attempts. &#xD;
This dissertation explores the possibility that one of the reasons consumers react badly to persuasion is because being the target of a persuasion attempt can convey threatening social information. Thus, persuasion attempts convey low social worth, or beliefs that the agent has a low opinion of the consumer. This work examines this novel explanation and outcome of perceived persuasion, suggesting that even innocuous tactics, such as providing a recommendation, can lower consumers’ social worth and undermine consumers’ reactions towards firms and salespeople.  &#xD;
Consistent with prior work, this dissertation suggests that perceiving a communication as persuasion is likely to activate consumers’ persuasion knowledge. However, this dissertation examines a series of nuanced inferences whereby consumers believe that the agent is attempting to induce the consumer to do something that serves the agent’s interests over those of the consumer, which conveys to consumers that the agent has a low opinion of them.  &#xD;
This dissertation provides evidence from eight studies to support the hypothesized social framework for consumers’ negative reactions to persuasion, and it provides theoretical and managerial implications for this new social process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is centered around the theme of special values of L-functions and other infinite series, which are often expected to be transcendental numbers. More specifically, we focus on the following two questions in various scenarios: a) expressing the values in terms of certain special functions, b) determining their arithmetic nature (i.e., whether they are rational or irrational, algebraic or transcendental).&#xD;
Motivated by the conjectures of S. Chowla and P. Erdos, we first study the L-series L(s,f) attached to a periodic arithmetical function f. Utilizing tools from transcendental number theory, we investigate the non-vanishing and the arithmetic nature of the values L(1,f) and L'(1,f). We introduce a probabilistic viewpoint towards the study of the values L(k,f) for any integer k greater than or equal to 1, especially in the case when f is an Erdos function.&#xD;
On a related note, we explore the irrationality of the values of Dedekind zeta-functions at positive integers using elementary means. We also initiate the study of the sum over lattice points, of a rational function. This opens new doors for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vegetation changes (i.e., areas of ‘greening’ and ‘browning’) have been observed in areas of the circumpolar Arctic due to changing Arctic climate. However, these changes have largely been reported based on coarse spatial resolution satellite data collected since the 1980’s. This study examines a shorter time series (2004-2018) of high spatial resolution satellite data (i.e., IKONOS and Worldview-2,3) to determine if changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be detected over a shorter time period at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) located on Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada. Image data were first corrected to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and normalized for the time series analysis using the pseudo-invariant feature (PIF) method to minimize differences in sensor calibration, illumination, sun angle and atmospheric conditions. Local climate data were used to calculate growing degree days (base 5 °C, GDD(5)) and growing season length (GSL). These climate data were combined with percent vegetation cover (PVC) measurements to contextualize trends observed in the time series. NDVI values of different vegetation types (i.e., wet sedge, mesic tundra and polar semi-desert) and within active layer detachments (ALDs) were analyzed. NDVI showed similar patterns over time within the different vegetation types and across the ALDs. It was determined that there was no significant change in NDVI nor in GDD(5) over time. However, there were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) relationships between the GDD(5) and NDVI for all vegetation types. ‘Upscaled’ 30 m data presented a very similar trend as the 2 m data analysis at the landscape and plot (1 ha) level, but was not suited to tracking change within the ALDs. Combining field measurements and high spatial resolution remote sensing data helps link observed trends in spectral vegetation indices with processes on the ground. It is anticipated that as longer time series of high spatial resolution remote sensing data and field measures become available, it will become more feasible to examine (and model) changes in biophysical variables associated with warming temperatures. The methods reported here address the challenges of integrating high spatial resolution satellite data from different satellite sensors in a time series analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Home heating is the primary energy end-use in Ontario homes. Consequently, it is also the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector, particularly because most homes in Ontario use fossil fuels to generate heat. The objective of this thesis is to investigate whether the air-source heat pump is a viable technology to allow the electrification of home heating in Ontario. At stake is considerable potential for energy conservation, reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and cost savings on home heating bills.&#xD;
Chapter two presents a new system-dynamics-based method for predicting homeowners’ future adoption of heat pumps. Exploring two facets of the development of heat pump technology–low temperature operating limit and increasing coefficient of performance–we predict the extent of future adoption, and find little change is likely by 2025. The main mechanism affecting adoption is the change in operating cost due to technological advancements; however, the method applied in this research accommodates future work that includes other driving forces of adoption.&#xD;
Chapter three examines the performance potentials for three different types of air-source heat pump: single-stage, variable-speed centrally ducted, and variable-speed ductless heat pumps. The last, and most expensive of these three types, realizes the greatest reductions in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and heating costs.&#xD;
Chapter four more closely examines the effects of several time-of-use pricing rate plans on heat pump use in cities in direct competition with natural gas forced-air heating. Homeowners could replace ageing central air conditioning units with single-stage heat pumps at an added cost of approximately $1000. Policymakers can choose rate plan price policies to significantly improve the economic feasibility of running a low-cost, low-performance heat pump, making widespread adoption more likely. Such policies could more than halve energy and greenhouse gas emissions, while saving homeowners hundreds of dollars per year.&#xD;
Heat pump technology can benefit Ontario homeowners, and society at large, by providing a cost savings to the former and a reduction of energy use and greenhouse emissions for the latter.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Preservice teachers are the future of education and at the pinnacle of contemporary pedagogical practices, which could potentially influence generations of children. Investigating the relationships among preservice teachers’ resilience, engagement, personality traits, and their practicum and coursework performance is critical as it provides rich data for how preservice teachers professionally develop and succeed at the onset of their careers. Resilience, the quality of bouncing back from adversity; engagement, linked to workplace success and burnout, as well as personality, a stable trait of human behavior, are informative and measurable constructs. Self-reported grades on campus and in practicum; as well as self-evaluation on teaching confidence and preparedness are performance metrics in relation to these three psychological constructs. This study administered a five-part 39-item questionnaire to two-cohorts of 139 preservice teachers, one cohort beginning, and the other finishing their teacher education program. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis, correlation and regression analysis were completed. The results of this study indicated that engagement and two personality traits of conscientiousness and extraversion were significantly correlated and predicted four measures of performance. Although resilience was extracted as a single factor according to the BRS (Smith et al., 2008), this variable maintained no correlation to any of the four performance measures and negatively predicted self-evaluation of preparedness for teaching. Engagement was also extracted in a single factor, different from previous models using the ETS (Klassen, Yerdelen, &amp; Durksen, 2013). Personality did not show any coherent factor structure in this study, and items were forced into respective personality factors according to previous work (Rammestedt &amp; John, 2007). This study has important implications for teacher education and for teacher career onset and longevity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Copper mediated polymerization is used to produce poly(methyl acrylate) with an average degree of polymerization of 10 (P(MA)10) and narrow distribution in both batch and continuous tubular reactors at ambient temperature. The resulting polymer solution could be stored for over a week while maintaining excellent activity as a macroinitiator for the further growth of poly(methyl&#xD;
acrylate) chains in both batch and semi-batch reactor systems. Low dispersities were maintained during the chain-extensions, conducted at ambient temperature without addition of further copper to the system. The polymerizations were conducted in propylene glycol methyl ether, a common industrial solvent, with low levels of ascorbic acid added as a reducing agent for chain extension;&#xD;
the best performance (&gt;90% conversion with excellent control) was achieved when a fraction of the ascorbic acid was added to the reactor at the start of reaction, with the rest fed in a semi-batch fashion along with monomer. Semi-batch chain extensions of P(MA)10 with butyl acrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA), and butyl methacrylate as well as the ability to synthesis tri-block polymer were also demonstrated, as was the synthesis and subsequent chain extension of (PEGMEA)10. The combination of the tubular reactor to produce macroinitiator&#xD;
and subsequent semi-batch chain extension is proposed as a versatile process to efficiently produce block copolymers at an industrial scale.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The disruption of soil microbial communities is thought to be a major contributor to the expansion of invasive plants. Previous research has focused on identifying how invasive plants change soil microbial diversity and composition. However, microbes with different functions vary in their response to environmental changes, which in turn can affect plant community composition and ecosystem function. Thus, it is important to recognize the different functional roles of genetically distinct microbe taxa to understand the impact of plant invasion on nutrient cycling and other ecosystem services. Alliaria petiolata is an invasive plant in North America from Eurasia that has the potential to negatively affect the beneficial mutualism between native plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) through the production of allelopathic compounds belowground. Despite mounting evidence for such an effect under controlled laboratory experiments, it is less clear if it persists under natural field conditions. Additionally, the potential effect of A. petiolata on non-mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria remains to be determined. Molecular tools have emerged that can both characterize the taxonomic diversity of soil microbiota and their functions to an unprecedented level of resolution. To investigate the effect of A. petiolata on the soil microbiome diversity and function I combined molecular and field data. I used high throughput sequencing of genomic DNA encoding for the ITS and 16S region of ribosomal RNA to determine impact of A. petiolata invasion on the structure of fungal and bacterial communities in field soils. Functions were assigned to the microbes that varied in their composition with invasion. I also measured root health of native plants co-occurring with A. petiolata to determine correlations between functional groups of soil microbial communities and plant health. Overall, my findings suggest that mycorrhizal suppression is not a particularly strong mechanism to explain the invasion success of A. petiolata. In fact, changes in AMF community composition do not persist under natural field conditions. Instead, my research provides evidence in favor of pathogen accumulation, with both changes in pathogen community composition and an increase in lesions associated with plants grown in A. petiolata invaded soils. Additionally, I showed that A. petiolata influences decomposer community composition, including ectomycorrhiza, and excludes nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Electromagnetic (EM) tracking is currently a feasible tracking modality to navigated surgical operations on delicate bone structures, but how accurate and consistent could the navigation be in the case of forearm fracture plating? Recent studies, on artificial models, that used tracked personalized guides showed accuracy that was comparable to optical tracking - the gold standard of surgical navigation in orthopedics.  This work explored whether electromagnetic tracking can fit a plate onto the human forearm with clinically acceptable accuracy and precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tracked personalized guides were used to navigate eleven human forearm cadavers, demonstrating the consistency, accuracy, and reliability of EM based surgical navigation. Preoperative plans were made by a board certified surgeon for placement of two 2.25mm cortical screws along the mid-shaft in eleven soft-embalmed cadaveric upper extremity specimens for volar mid-shaft radius plating. Each tracked guide was calibrated, with errors measured as fiducial localization error between the calibration holes and an EM tracked probe. A resident surgeon drilled the eleven specimens, according to the preoperative plans, using EM navigation technology, in an environment that was included typical surgical instruments. Solid aluminum rods were placed in the screw holes for imaging contrast. Postoperative CT scans were acquired and segmented to compare drilling trajectories, manifested by the placement of the rods, to the preoperative plans. Positional and angular target registration errors were calculated between actual and planned placement locations for each specimen.  Visual inspection of plating quality was done by fitting a plate onto the drilled cadavers.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work suggested that, in orthopedic surgical procedures where optical navigation systems cannot feasibly be used, EM navigation with precisely calibrated personalized guides may be an accurate and reliable alternative. EM navigation with personal guides shows promise towards surgical navigated fracture reduction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this project was to create a research-informed, responsive resource to help parents of Kindergarten to Grade 6 children incorporate mathematics learning into everyday family life. In Ontario, several publicly available resources discuss the important role parents play in their children’s mathematics education, and the value of mathematical discussions and activities in everyday family experiences. While the recommendation for family mathematics learning is common and widespread, a document analysis completed for this project indicated a lack of concrete examples of what these activities and learning opportunities might look like. The Math Around Us is a book containing over 100 prompts and activities which incorporate mathematics learning into the places and spaces families frequent. Organized alphabetically by 18 unique locations, activities are explained in straightforward language, require few or no materials, and minimal or no preparation. This resource may be a valuable tool for parents interested in fun and informal ways to bring mathematical learning opportunities for their children into the home and world around them.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Initially introduced to the clinical literature in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn, Mindfulness has continued to emerge as an empirically model of intervention used for addressing individual barriers ranging from psychological disorders, to a diverse set of chronic physical illnesses (Kabat-Zinn 1979, 1990, Walsh 1980, Shapiro 2009, Baer 2015). This method of intervention is presented as a viable directive in the face of unaffordable health-care costs all well as other issues of accessibility within the medical system. More recently, mindfulness-based smartphone apps have become a popular way for individuals to tap into this meditative tradition contributing to a multi-billion-dollar health and wellness enterprise. Despite the financial success and literature pointing to the quantitative efficacy of these apps, there is very little qualitative work which investigates precisely how these interventions are taken up and contextualized by the individual in everyday life. To develop a sociological critique of mindfulness is to ask what exactly is going on when we are to ‘direct’ our attention purposefully. Further, how can such a seemingly benign verbal cue to direct attention to something be so profound in the way that it shapes our subjective experiences? This project was designed to explore how mindfulness might be informing the ways in which individuals are constructing, understanding, and practicing self and selfhood in a contemporary neoliberal context - more specifically, I wanted to know how mindfulness may facilitate the emergence of a culture in which the therapeutic narratives of self- management have been placed at the core of personhood. To approach this task accordingly, this project situates the experiences of six users of the Headspace Mindfulness app within the sociological literature to better understand what sort of meaning-making is occurring through the use of mindfulness-based interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wings with sweep are ubiquitous for engineering applications, and are observed in biology for swimmers and fliers alike. In particular, delta wings have wide ranging applicability arising from their low speed maneuvering characteristics, and favourable properties approaching the speed of sound. This thesis examines experimentally the flow separation over low-sweep angle or 'non-slender' delta wings, specifically focusing on the coherent vortices characteristic of such geometries. First, stereo particle image velocimetry and surface pressure are used to reconstruct the flow the over a delta wing at steady-state. Vortex tilting is revealed to play an important role in lift generation at angles of attack near maximum lift. Coherent structures absent from the literature are measured and described. Second, time-resolved planar particle image velocity, forces/moments and pressure are used to measure the dynamic-stall process during a streamwise gust. Separated flow near the wing apex is shown to reattach during the gust, resulting in lift enhancement. Strong favourable pressure gradients drive the flow to promote reattachment, even after the gust has terminated. Combining the steady-state and gust studies, the sensitivity of non-slender delta wings to gusts is shown to be dependent on the initial steady-state flow field. The steady-state flow structure remains coherent below maximum lift by means of vortex tilting, but fully separates along the span above maximum lift, causing bifurcation in gust response.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This hermeneutic phenomenological study explored the role of disjuncture in influencing teacher identity and practice in higher education. I adopted Peter Jarvis’ (2006) concept of disjuncture, a state whereby individuals experience a sense of unknowing or questioning generated from within and often prompted by their interactions in the social world. I examined the phenomenon of disjuncture from the perspective of ten 3M National Teaching Fellows from across Canada. The Fellows participated in individual and group interviews. They were asked to reflect on the emotions, cognitions, and actions they experienced during moments of disjuncture and together we interpreted how their teaching and identities changed as a result. Each Fellow’s disjuncture experience was contextualized in a short biographical narrative. The purpose of the narratives was to offer background on who they are as a learner and a teacher and to serve as fixed examples of the phenomenon of disjuncture.&#xD;
	I analyzed the data using Jarvis’ theoretical learning framework, The Transformation of the Person through Learning, and focused on identifying the nature of Fellows’ learning from disjuncture. The nature of learning is described as the Fellows’ emotions, cognitions, actions during disjuncture and how their teaching and teacher identities changed as a result. The data are presented through four hermeneutic windows, which provide structure to describe these essential dimensions of learning from disjuncture. &#xD;
	The findings indicated that using a scaffolded guided reflection process involving conversational prompts about episodes of disjuncture evoked reflection on and identification of shifts in both practice and teacher identity. The Fellows in this study described learning about students, learning about teaching, and learning about themselves as teachers. This study resulted in a modified definition of disjuncture called pedagogical disjuncture which better reflects the teacher and teaching experience. As a result of this study, I have integrated the findings into a discussion of the features of new pedagogy of disjuncture for teacher development that has both theoretical and practical applications in higher education. The study concludes with suggestions for future research that deepens our understanding of teacher development from learning perspective of teaching. Such research would ideally explore the centrality of learning in teachers’ experiences of teaching and teacher identity development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The physical environment of schools has undergone a number of changes in recent years. Along with the increasing integration of digital technology in classrooms, schools today are being designed and constructed with fewer walls — opening classroom spaces with the intention of enhancing collaboration and student-centered teaching practice. This open-plan school design is predicated on a short-lived school design movement that emerged in the 1960s in North America. A multitude of challenges led to the eventual abandonment of this design. Today, optimistic school designers suggest technology and evolving teaching practices will allow for the success of open-plan schools. In addition, architects are including purpose-built specialty rooms (also known as flexible-use spaces, or sometimes makerspaces) that can be customized by the educators who use them.&#xD;
       The purpose of this study is to characterize the contextual nature of teaching and learning in one newly constructed open-plan school so that recommendations can be provided about next steps in developing uses for these flexible-use rooms. A case study approach was taken and field observations, interviews with teachers, and focus groups with students from a Grade 3–5 community and a Grade 6–8 community were collected in this open-plan school. The three central questions that guided this exploration were: (1) What is the nature of teaching and learning taking place in this open-plan school? (2) What pedagogy do teachers enact in this open-plan school? (3) What pedagogical challenges exist in this open-plan school?&#xD;
       The findings suggest the need for the careful consideration of teacher collaboration, student empowerment, the ongoing experimental nature of teaching practice, and the tensions that exist between progressive teaching practices and more traditional educational methods when designing uses for the flexible-use spaces that are being built into similar open-plan schools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have been commonly used for land&#xD;
vehicle positioning and navigation applications. A typical example of GNSS is the&#xD;
Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS provides accurate navigation solution in&#xD;
open sky. However, in some circumstances, such as urban areas, underpasses, tunnels,&#xD;
and in the presence of signal jamming, GPS signals cannot be easily tracked since they&#xD;
might be harshly attenuated or entirely blocked, potentially leading to loss of signal,&#xD;
thereby requiring re-acquisition of the signal for the corresponding satellite. To avoid&#xD;
the intensive computations necessary for the signal re-lock (i.e., signal re-acquisition&#xD;
stage) in a GPS receiver, a robust signal-tracking mechanism that can hold and/or&#xD;
rapidly re-lock on the signals and keep track of their dynamics is becoming necessary.&#xD;
Additionally, the signal tracking process is where measurements are generated; thus,&#xD;
it has a direct impact on the resultant navigation solution. This makes the choice of&#xD;
a successful tracking method a crucial task in GPS receiver design. The significance&#xD;
of research in this thesis is multi-fold. First, is the design and implementation of&#xD;
a robust vector-based tracking system which furthermore required the realization of&#xD;
a complete software-defined receiver (SDR). Second, the proposed tracking system&#xD;
architecture was augmented with a reduced inertial navigation system (RISS) to produce&#xD;
a new ultra-tight GPS/INS integrated system that further enhances a receivers tracking robustness and sensitivity in challenging scenarios. Third, this research also&#xD;
presents a more computationally efficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) data de-noising&#xD;
method. Last but not the least, this thesis also presents a novel GPS/INS&#xD;
trajectory data simulation podium that can generate simulation data sets for all levels&#xD;
of GPS/INS integration systems. This tool was successfully used to verify the operation&#xD;
and performance of the newly implemented ultra-tight GPS/INS integrated&#xD;
system. Results show a good performance of the implemented method(s) against&#xD;
a commercial receiver and a reference solution. The software receiver approach has&#xD;
been adopted as a platform for implementing the proposed algorithm(s); nevertheless,&#xD;
the proposed methodology can be applied in conventional hardware receivers, as well.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the last two decades, the use of social networking sites (SNS) has increased at an astounding rate. Research regarding street gangs’ use of social media generally suggests two assumptions: Firstly, street gang members have infiltrated SNS, and have transferred much of their gang culture from the real world to the virtual one—a process known as cyber-banging. Secondly, street gangs have begun using SNS to recruit potential members; a fear propagated by newspapers and police forces. While cyber-banging has be well documented, the same cannot be said about online recruitment. This study achieved two goals: firstly, using a similar keyword search to that which was utilised by Morselli &amp; Décary-Hétu (2013) this study empirically illustrates the prevalence of cyber-banging and recruitment on SNS. To accomplish this goal, this study sampled 23 Twitter users and 36 Facebook users flagged as street gang members across Canada, along with 10 YouTube rap videos created by gang members. Secondly, using a network analysis add-on to Microsoft Excel called NodeXL, this essay employed social network analysis to test whether centrality measures can extrapolate gang roles within a gang member’s Twitter network. Using content analysis, the results demonstrated that the most prominent type of cyber-banging is content that promotes gang ideologies. The results also conclude that none of the content on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube can be considered proactive recruitment techniques. Regarding the second goal, using a combination of degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality measures, results suggest many of the gang members are central in their network, but probably not gang leaders; while a look at the relationship between activity levels and number of followers on Twitter demonstrate four possible roles a SNS user has within his gang.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rotation measure (RM) synthesis maps of NGC 4631 by Mora-Partiarroyo et al. (2018) show remarkable sign reversals on kpc scales as the distance from the minor axis increases in the northern halo of the galaxy.  RM maps for edge-on galaxies observed in the CHANG-ES sample were searched through and show that regular reversals in the sign of the RM seen in galaxies appears to be a common phenomenon.  These sign reversals can be naturally explained by a regular halo magnetic field  that is alternating its azimuthal direction on kpc scales in the galaxy.  This is a brand new phenomenon that has never before been observed in a galactic halo.  Evidence of magnetic fields showing both axisymmetric and bisymmetric symmetry is found in the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
To explain this new phenomenon the dynamo equations are solved under the assumption of scale invariance and rotating logarithmic spiral solutions are searched for.  The model solutions are then compared to the observational RM map of NGC 4631 in order to draw conclusions on the type of field geometry likely found in the galactic halo.  Solutions for velocity fields that represent accretion onto the disk, outflow from the disk, and rotation-only in the disk are found that produce RM maps with reversing signs viewed edge-on.  Model RM maps are created for a variety of input parameters using a Faraday screen technique and are then scaled to match the amplitude of the observational maps.  Residual images are then made and compared with one another in order to determine the models that provide the best fit to the data.  Solutions for rotation-only, i.e. relative to a pattern uniform rotation,  did in general, not fit the observational map of NGC 4631 well.  Outflow models provided a reasonable fit to the magnetic field.  However, the best results for the region modelled in the northern halo are found using accretion models.  As there is abundant evidence for both winds and accretion in NGC 4631, this modelling technique has the potential to be able to distinguish between the dominant flows in galaxies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although the fundamentals of how humans perceive the world in 3D and the techniques used to implement 3D display devices have been discussed for over a century, humans still rely on 2D displays for interaction with almost every digital device. This implies that humans have been missing a significant amount of information when viewing content on conventional 2D displays. &#xD;
This work presents the Holotab system, an interactive light field 3D display - an approach to make a glasses-free 3D light field display using a conventional 2D display and a lenticular sheet. The Holotab system uses 3D content encoded as streams of colour and depth information, then rendered using the Relief Mapping algorithm to ensure adequate performance for real-time applications. &#xD;
An essential type of task in a virtual 3D environment is the ‘path traversing task’, which can be accomplished using a system where users leverage the kinematic chain to perform bimanual input. The users control the camera viewport using the Holotab, and to perform object manipulation using 3D printed tools in parallel. In this study, we found that the performance of our path traversing task depends on the width, the length, and the curvature of a path, regardless of the relative position between the Holotab and the tools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Data centers have become the backbone of the global economy. The electricity demand for data centers grew tremendously over the last ten years. U.S. data centers consumed 91 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2013 and are on track to consume 140 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually by 2020. AC – DC Rectifiers are the equipment to power the data centers. They convert the AC power from electric utilities into DC power with two power stages. The first stage is the PFC stage that converts the input 220V AC voltage into a 400V DC voltage. The second stage is the DC – DC stage that converts the 400V into 12V which is fed into the motherboard of the data center. Because of the huge electricity bill for the operating of data centers, very high efficiency AC – DC rectifiers are needed.&#xD;
Existing PFC AC – DC converters use MOSFETs as switching devices. Innovations in MOSFET switches over the last three decades have enabled a steady improvement in power supply design. However, the performance of the MOSFET has reached its theoretical limits. GaN switching technology offers significantly better performance than that of MOSFETs. It grants the opportunity to improve the power density and efficiency of power supplies.&#xD;
A Bridgeless Boost Totem-Pole PFC topology is selected and designed for maximum efficiency by utilizing GaN switches. Merits include: a custom wound inductor to aid in increasing overall efficiency, a detailed PCB layout for the GaN switches and their respective gate drivers, a high and low-side gate resistance analysis for the GaN switches to reduce the rise and fall time of the gate signals while mitigating the Miller Effect, current control of the synchronous MOSFETs to achieve ideal diode emulation, a soft-start function during the zero-crossings of the line voltage to reduce AC current spikes, a fast voltage control loop for better dynamic performance, and two heatsink designs to reduce GaN switch temperatures during high load operation. Mathematical analysis, simulation and hardware testing were done to verify the performance of the design. Start-up performance, dynamic step-load changes and steady-state performance via PF, THD and efficiency recordings over a range of loading conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Survivors of critical illness frequently exhibit acute (i.e., delirium) and chronic neurological complications. Intensive care unit prevalence of delirium is as high as 80% and has been associated with increased length of hospital stay, mortality, and long-term cognitive impairment. However, the underlying etiology of delirium, and long-term dysfunction, remains unknown but may be associated with cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
A key element of resuscitation during critical illness is guided at assessing proxies of perfusion to maintain adequate oxygen delivery (e.g., renal perfusion is assessed by measuring urine output and serum creatinine). However, there is currently no well-defined surrogate of cerebral perfusion used in routine clinical practice. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique to quantify regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) that has been used for decades in the cardiac operating theatre and resulted in targeted algorithms to optimize rSO2. However, these algorithms do not exist during critical illness. &#xD;
&#xD;
The primary objective of this thesis was to assess if low levels of rSO2 are associated with delirium. The subsequent chapters herein will demonstrate the feasibility of using NIRS to monitor rSO2 (e.g., did not interfere with patient care), which provided the infrastructure to conduct the CONFOCAL pilot that identified low rSO2 as an independent predictor of delirium. Additionally, the physiologic determinants of the rSO2 signal were assessed. This regression analysis accounted for a significant proportion of variance in the rSO2 signal (R2=.54), which was associated with age, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, hemoglobin, and heart rate. At 3- and 12-months, participants were primarily impaired in visuospatial/executive function, immediate, and delayed memory. Therefore, these findings support the hypothesis that low rSO2 is associated with delirium and suggest that optimizing rSO2 may offer promising avenues for future critical care practices to prevent delirium. However, the determinants of long-term impairment will need to be assessed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The extreme conditions in between sliding surfaces promote chemical reactions known as tribochemical reactions. There are two types of tribochemical reaction in systems with lubricant inserted in between the surface layers. The first type is the reaction among the lubricant bulk molecules and the second are reactions between the lubricant molecule and the surfaces.  A class of tribochemical reactions which promote lubrication is known as functional lubrication.&#xD;
In this dissertation, a systematic study of tribochemical reactions of Me(C=S)X molecules (X is -H, -CH3, -Cl, -F, -CF3 and -NH2) in between the layers of MgO are explored using the FPMD.  The objective is to understand how various functional groups affect both types of tribochemical reactions. Each type of tribochemical reaction required separate simulation models to decrease computational expenses. &#xD;
The results of simulations in which systems of bulk Me(C=S)X molecules were compressed revealed that the first pressure-induced reaction was the dimerization through the formation of C-S bond between two monomer molecules. The pressures at which this reaction occurred was dependent on the functional group –X. The effect of the substituent on the dimerization pressure was established using the Energy Decomposition Analysis. Compression also resulted in oligomerization reaction through the formation of S-S bond. &#xD;
The tribochemical reactions between Me(C=S)X molecules and surfaces were studied by compressing Me(C=S)X molecules inserted in between two layers of MgO. The results of simulations indicated that Me(C=S)X molecules form C-O or S-O bonds with the surface. The formed C-O and S-O bonds destabilized the cubic structure of MgO through the dissociation of Mg-O bonds.&#xD;
Simulations of sliding surfaces were performed with Me(C=S)X inserted in between the MgO layers. The results of the simulations indicated that most tribochemical reactions of Me(C=S)X molecules inhibited sliding. Me(C=S)H and Me(C=S)Me molecules required additional larger scale simulation to determine their functional lubrication ability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Loneliness is understood as the perceived unmet desire for human attachment. In recent years, there has been a growing concern surrounding loneliness that has prompted many to consider ways to remedy the issue. Presently, there have been many developments in technology wherein there is a focus on creating human-like characteristics. Known as anthropomorphic technologies, their increasing capability of providing human-like functions, allow them to be suited to alleviate the issue of loneliness. This is a qualitative content analysis that considers whether or not these technologies are successful through various case studies. The case studies focus on social robots, dating sims, and virtual reality, and were chosen based on the likelihood of being able to replicate human attachment. Due to the nature of this study, there are several ethical and social implications surrounding the idea of the non-human that arise.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  Registered nurses (RN) working in intensive care units (ICU) care for some of the sickest patients with the highest acuity within hospital settings. Due to the nature of their work and proximity to patient trauma they are at risk for developing compassion fatigue. Compassion fatigue is defined as a secondary traumatic stress reaction which results from a deep involvement with a primarily traumatized person and is described as a work-related stress response in healthcare providers. Compassion fatigue negatively impacts nurses, patients, and organizations with significant implications for the nursing profession. Research focusing on the predictors of nurses’ compassion fatigue in ICUs is limited. &#xD;
Purpose: To test a theoretical model examining selected predictors (exposure to patient suffering, nurses’ age, nurses’ years of experience in ICU, managerial support) of compassion fatigue in RNs working in ICU. &#xD;
Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was conducted with a sample of 81 RNs working in an ICU in Southeastern Ontario. Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire including demographic characteristics, Satisfaction with my Manager Scale, and Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale. &#xD;
Results: Participants reported a moderate level of compassion fatigue with 48% reporting mild levels and 39% reporting high or severe levels. Testing of the theoretical model found 18% of the variance in participants’ compassion fatigue was explained by three predictors (exposure to patient suffering, nurses’ years of experience in ICU, managerial support). However, only managerial support was a significant predictor in the final model. &#xD;
Conclusion: The major contribution of this study is the broadening of our understanding of nurses’ compassion fatigue in ICU. The study findings suggest that nurses working in ICU value managerial support to help minimize compassion fatigue. This includes managers being visible, consulting with staff, providing praise and recognition, and where able, being flexible with work schedules. Improving managerial support in  ICU environments may help nurses remain empathetic and provide compassionate care.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Nursing students’ ability to self-regulate their learning is critical to their future as practicing nurses. Clinical teachers are key to this development. Pedagogical strategies to support self-regulated learning (SRL) in clinical education have not been well researched, especially, the importance of clinical teacher provided formative assessment and feedback.&#xD;
Objectives: &#xD;
1.	To develop a model of SRL and teaching for use in clinical practice and demonstrate its potential to enhance clinical teacher effectiveness and student SRL. &#xD;
2.	To assess the psychometric properties of  the modified Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) for use in nursing undergraduate clinical education. &#xD;
3.	To develop and use theory-based formative assessment and feedback processes to support  effective clinical teaching and nursing student SRL in clinical practice. &#xD;
Methods: Three interconnected research activities are reported. First, after reviewing existing SRL models, a SRL and teaching model for clinical education was developed. Second, MSLQ was modified to reflect self-regulated nursing students’ motivation and learning strategies in clinical practice education and then administered to third-year baccalaureate nursing students. Third, a formative assessment and feedback process developed and used with clinical teachers and third-year baccalaureate students in a clinical practicum course. &#xD;
Results: The Clinical Education Double Loop SRL and Teaching Model was developed. As predicated the modified MSLQ constructs of motivation and learning strategy did not support the use of the scales within clinical practice education. Further modifications could render the MSLQ useful in assessing self-efficacy for learning, performance, and task value.  Clinical teacher and nursing student workload and lack of administrative support resulted in poor uptake of the formative assessment and feedback process. Despite this the participants’ qualitative reports indicated the importance of formative feedback for nursing students in clinical practice education. &#xD;
Conclusion: The Clinical Education Double Loop SRL and Teaching Model illustrates the process of SRL for both nursing students and clinical teachers. The importance of formative assessment and feedback for the achievement of nurses’ learning outcomes are highlighted.  . However, innovation to change the process of formative assessment and feedback in clinical nursing education is challenging, and requires administrative support for a paradigm shift in nursing pedagogy. &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>From the 1960’s-1990’s, prisoners in both North America and abroad published interconnected journals through the Penal Press. Under this umbrella of publications, the women sentenced to the Kingston Prison for Women (P4W), the only federal penitentiary for female prisoners from 1934-2000, produced Tightwire: an enduring legacy of their lived experiences of incarceration. Through a discourse analysis of Tightwire, this thesis examines the capacity of prison writing to facilitate critical penal discourse and to establish intersectional relationships of solidarity through collaborative understandings of carceral power. &#xD;
Prison writing is discussed here using Mathiesen’s (1974) concept of the “Unfinished”, a contradictory and incomplete exemplar of political discourse. This term is used to describe the relationships among academics, activists, and prisoners prior to the 1970’s radical upheaval of Scandinavian prisons. Because of its ability to form these social connections and engage simultaneously with a multiplicity of potential solutions, the unbounded discourse found in prison writing represents an alternative to mainstream hegemonic crime rhetoric, while also averting state integration and cooptation.&#xD;
Disseminated through the Penal Press, Tightwire establishes strong connections with the women’s movement, between prisoners, and with Indigenous resistance to colonialism. By privileging diverse voices of dissent, Tightwire is representative what Day (2005) describes as the groundless solidarity characteristic of new social movements. This solidarity is formed through a collective, discursive understanding of power relationships that reify penal institutions as the sole remedy to crime and violence. The gendered nature of penality that further entrenches racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, and ableist norms that permit social divisions under neoliberal capitalist nation state governance will be discussed at length. &#xD;
Through the study of prison writing in general, and the profound solidarity evident in Tightwire specifically, it is possible to conceptualize of alternative responses to crime and violence. Prefigurative relationships of mutual support born of the discursive engagement in prison publications defy cultural assumptions about punitive responses to criminality; the networks of solidarity formed of the act and exchange of prison writing demonstrate the necessity of unconventional relationships for inciting changes in the political consciousness and public discourse on the cultural functions and implications of prisons.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Poor pain management may result from nurses’ lack of knowledge, or personal beliefs or attitudes, which may be partially attributed to their undergraduate education. Recent studies report that nursing students have inadequate knowledge regarding effective pain management, which may be related to inadequate preparation in nursing school. Improving pain knowledge is an important step for nursing students to optimize effective pain management practices during their education and when in clinical practice. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine nursing students’ knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy in assessing and managing pain before and after participating in a pain educational intervention.&#xD;
This study included a convenience sample of 21 undergraduate nursing students who were in the second year of the 4-year Baccalaureate program at Queen’s University. Consenting students completed the Knowledge, and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (KASRP) and Nurses’ Self-Efficacy questionnaires prior to and after a pain educational intervention. The intervention consisted of a required textbook reading, a didactic learning and a self-directed online case study. The interactive online case study was developed by CASN and included information on pain assessment, substance misuse risk assessment, prescribing opioids, opioids tapering, and follow up and safety monitoring.&#xD;
In this study, the students median score on the KASRP significantly improved after the pain education (Md = 26) compared to that before the intervention (Md = 24) (z = -2.66, p &lt; .001). The median score on the self-efficacy scale was significantly higher following the educational program (Md = 12) versus before (Md = 8) (z = -3.64, p &lt; .001). Students had difficulty answering questions related to pain pharmacology most often. Knowledge and the self-efficacy were not significantly correlated (P = .305, P = .359) before and after the intervention. &#xD;
This didactic and online intervention was associated with an improvement in students’ knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy regarding pain management. Further research is needed to test this intervention with a larger sample in other programs in Ontario and Canada. Additionally, this information may be useful for nurse leaders and educators when they are developing pain assessment and management education or when planning clinical opportunities for students to acquire appropriate pain knowledge and attitudes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This is a Research Project written for the Queen's Classics Department according to Pattern II of the Master's of Arts Program. -- This research essay is a comparative analysis of the Mycenaean palace-citadels of Mycenae and Ancient Pylos, examining the artefacts, architecture and layouts of certain buildings and contexts within both sites to determine how influential Mycenaean culture may have been over their occupants. Which will be examined by classifying certain elements from their remains according to a set of behavioural characteristics in-relation to Mycenaean culture: cultural behavioural adaptations, elements that are different between both sites, and cultural behaviours regularities, which include detailed characteristics that are consistent between both sites. &#xD;
	Mycenae and Ancient Pylos are among the most heavily examined and referenced sites in Mycenaean scholarship. Mycenae was the first palace to be excavated and has over the previous century occupied an “archetypal” role among Late Helladic sites, with a longer habitation period than most of its contemporaries. Ancient Pylos lacks some iconic characteristics shared between Midea, Mycenae and Tiryns, yet it does have the most intact palatial megaron ever found alongside crucial textual and archaeological evidence for the society, economy and beliefs of the Mycenaean people.&#xD;
	The parameters of this report will be confined solely to the LHIIIB period, as both sites contained multiple periods of occupation and to examine each one in-tern would be too large and complicated for a 50-page research paper. Additionally, only the remains inside the different hilltops of Mycenae and Ano Englianos will be addressed in this report, within the Cyclopean walls at Mycenae and the LHII ashlar walls at Ancient Pylos. This will include the relative layouts of the palaces, surrounding palace-complex ,and additional houses within the sites, examining their proximity and roles towards each other, followed by the contexts and functions of certain rooms, to identify the different activities, procedures, techniques and methods that were shared or diverse between both sites, such as security, economic, open spaces, cult-associations, etc.&#xD;
	Moving on to the methods of analysis for this report, it was initially meant to apply Cognitive Archaeology, since according to Marc Ambramluk, it can be possible to study certain behaviours and remains evidenced in the archaeological record to hypothesize the cognitive capabilities and intentions that were involved in their creation.  However, after examining the principals and analytical techniques of this paradigm in-depth, it proved to lack compatibility with the limits of this report or would result in too much speculation. Instead, a new approach related to Behavioural Archaeology was utilized for this study, distinguishing between certain behavioural characteristics present at both Mycenae and Ancient Pylos. &#xD;
	Cultural behaviours encompasses certain activities or traits that are prevalent throughout an entire culture, marked by their repetition and transmission across geographical and temporary spaces. Such behaviours were the results of human decisions and activities, and created certain products, artefacts, or contexts that can be studied by archaeologists. However, intricate and surprising characteristics exist in the differences and similarities between their layouts, artwork and the artefacts assemblages of both palaces. These remains can be classified either as cultural behavioural regularities, or cultural behavioural adaptations. Recognizing these different behaviours can allow archaeologists examine how encompassing or influential the cultural identities and characteristics of a particular civilization were.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bullying is often overlooked on school buses, despite the fact that many students experience bus rides at the beginning and end of each school day.  Given that bus drivers are often tasked as the lone adult supervisors of these children, bus drivers’ observations and experiences regarding bullying have the potential to be useful in bullying prevention.  This research gathered data from bus drivers about the kinds of bullying drivers witnessed on their bus and how frequently; what strategies drivers used to address bullying; how drivers were supported in addressing bullying; and how drivers perceived their own preparedness for addressing bullying on the bus.  Data were collected using a sequential mixed-methods approach.  During the first phase, an online survey with closed and open-ended questions was distributed to bus drivers within a region in Southern Ontario spanning several school jurisdictions; 22 responded.  The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, while thematic analysis was employed with the data from the open-ended questions.  Following the survey analysis, the second phase of the research entailed in-depth semi-structured interviews with ten bus drivers to explore their perceptions and experiences.  Findings indicated that 74% of the surveyed bus drivers experienced bullying, and drivers reported increased frequency and severity of bullying when school administration provided less support.  In addition, results offer descriptions of the nature of the bullying drivers observe on the bus, the strategies they use to address it, as well as drivers’ perceptions of their preparedness for, and how supported they feel in dealing with bullying.  Given the limited research in this area, the findings from this study make significant contributions to understanding bullying in school bus environments, as experienced by bus drivers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Video traffic is growing in dominance in today’s Internet, prompting new challenges in timely delivery of video content. This demand motivates the development of Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), as a de facto paradigm for streaming service. DASH attempts to maximize the video consumers' Quality of Experience (QoE) under varying network conditions. However, as an application-level solution, DASH is struggling to cope with both low-latency delivery and massive service requests. The emerging Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architecture, with its ubiquitous cache hierarchies, promises a scalable adaptive streaming service. However, current ICN caching capability is aimed at generic traffic, and lacks the optimization needed for video-specific applications. As the performance of existing caching schemes is discovered to decline as consumers dynamically select content encoded at different bitrates, DASH evidently clashes with caching hierarchies, which reinforces the need to explore novel caching schemes that can incorporate bitrate adaptation, as a controlling mechanism in DASH, to serve this dominating traffic.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this dissertation, catering to adaptive video traffic is accomplished by caching mechanisms that emphasize various QoE measurements, such as video quality, bitrate oscillation, and rebuffering. Specifically, 1) the delivered video quality is enhanced by building a traffic model to estimate access delay under varying encoded bitrates. This delay is further used to optimize cache placement that causes the highest video throughput. 2) Bitrate oscillations and playback rebuffering are reduced due to our findings where bitrates should be prioritized in cache hierarchies. This is manifested in the design of a cache partitioning mechanism that safeguards cache capacity for specific bitrates. 3) Building on the premises of cache partitioning, the underlying dependency between cache hierarchies and bitrate adaptation is addressed for caching decisions that rely on instant video statistics. That is, instead of focusing on currently popular bitrates, bitrate adaptation predicts preferable rates in the future, and guides cache decisions that optimize the long-term performance under dynamic video requests. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches in achieving significant improvements to QoE. These results suggest that cache hierarchies can better serve adaptive streaming when caching schemes capture, understand, and react to bitrate adaptation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is well-known that some deuterated isotopologues of interstellar molecules achieve a significantly higher deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio than the natural elemental abundance. CH3+ and its deuterated isotopologues are thought to be an important mediator of this process in warm interstellar regions and as such their detection is of interest. To assist in experimental observation, rovibrational calculations have been performed for all isotopologues of CH3+ up to J = 5. Rovibrational levels of CH2D+ and CD2H+ are computed for the first time. Vibrational states up to the 5000-6000 cm-1 range are assigned and their symmetry is determined. The J &lt; 6 levels for the ground,  ν1, and  ν5 states of CH2D+, and the ground state of CD2H+ compared to observed levels all have a root-mean-square-error (rmse) of less than 0.1 cm-1. The rmse increases to over 0.5 cm-1 for the  ν1 mode of CD2H+, thought to be due to a perturbation with another band. Though prior analysis proposes the  ν2 +ν 3 overtone as most likely for a perturbing Fermi resonance, these calculations suggest 3ν 3 as the more probable candidate.&#xD;
In addition, the progress on an additional project aimed at supplementing sum-of- products routines is outlined. Preliminary results for P2O look promising, and calculations are presently moving forward on a CH2O example to test the proposed idea.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the discursive construction of Indigenous identity under the conditions of colonization on Turtle Island. I investigate how the colonial discourse on Indianness discursively produced Indigenous subjectivity in the logics of race and culture. Using Michel Foucault’s genealogical method, I present a history of contemporary Indianness that saw the transformation of Indigenous communities and nations into Western colonial forms. I argue that, since the early encounters between European cultures and Indigenous nations, colonial impulses to consolidate territory and wealth in the ‘New World’ undertook the project of “othering” Indigenous peoples. From the days of the sixteenth century and lasting to this day, very technical details and knowledge about Indianness were discursively produced. This emergent discourse cast identity in a new form, expressing Indianness along cultural and racial dimensions, giving discursive life and political purchase to the colonial discourse on Indianness. Relying on the theory of Antonio Gramsci and the work of Edward Said, I analyze how the colonial discourse obtained cultural hegemony in Indian Country in the mid-twentieth century. &#xD;
&#xD;
Following the moment of colonial cultural hegemony, I examine how the colonial discourse shaped debates and discussions internal to Indian Country. In this analysis, I investigate the discursive construction of types of Indians, as well as questions of where the racial and cultural boundaries between the colonizer and the colonized would lie. As I show, the discursive imaginings of real, authentic Indianness along racial and cultural lines were introduced in some Indigenous communities to produce divisions and distinctions within Indian subjectivity.  I use Foucault’s theoretical understanding of the link between discourse and power to explain how in some cases Indian Country has transformed into a disciplinary society. I discuss Foucault’s notion of biopolitics. I apply this theoretical concept to the racial organization of First Nations and other Indigenous communities, examining Indian Band membership codes to underscore the spread of biopolitics in Indian Country. This analysis is complemented by an inquiry into the proliferation of disciplinary institutions and practices in some communities of Indian Country. I demonstrate how Indigenous people were drawn into networks of power to normalize and produce authentic Indianness in accordance with the discursive tenets of traditionalism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the development of the natural condition of co-operation into a large, apolitical movement and the effects of reshaping working-class people into co-operators. Semi- structured interviews, content analysis, and a limited autoethnography through a community- based action research paradigm, as well as a genealogical method, are used. A working-class analysis is applied throughout. &#xD;
In Ontario, residents of housing co-operatives are not considered tenants, following a history of legislation, legal precedents, and lobbying efforts by the co-op housing federations. This fact is manifested through the use of language, the shaping of co-op resident subjectivities, legal protections for residents, and the shunning of traditional tenant organizing direct action tactics to fight evictions and harassment. &#xD;
Six residents from five large-scale housing co-ops in Ontario participated in this research. Their experiences are compared and contrasted to the experiences of eight residents from seven housing co-ops in the Milton-Parc neighbourhood of Montreal. All 12 housing co-ops were created through state funding programs according to co-op corporation legislation. Residents of the Ontario co-ops expressed having few options when facing issues with their board of directors and staff. Residents are held responsible for the self-management of their housing project yet are encouraged to hire management staff. The Milton-Parc co-ops are small to medium-scale, they formed as a result of years of community organizing to save their neighbourhood from demolition, tenant participation is mandatory, there are no hired staff, and evictions are a lot less common. This research determines the landlord–tenant relationship is reproduced in all housing co-ops but is reshaped in order to circumvent class conflict. As such, traditional tenant organizing direct action tactics should be employed against co-op boards of directors and staff.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Popular contemporary views of Adam Smith paint the eighteenth-century intellectual as a staunch proponent of commercial society. However, an examination of Smith’s lesser-known works, and his cultural and intellectual influences, reveals a more complex picture of his attitude with respect to these concepts. This paper explores how Smith’s critique of commercial society was rooted in assumptions about the deleterious effects of the luxuries that proliferated within it. This paper will also take a look at how Smith’s assumptions about luxury were in line with eighteenth-century understandings of its harmful effects. Moreover, this paper interrogates Smith’s understanding of the concept of commercial society and traces a history of conceptualizations of luxury in Europe from the classical era to the eighteenth century. It will be argued that Smith grappled with Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s critique of this social form and conceded many of Rousseau’s points about its harmful effects, without fully adhering to Rousseau’s primitivist idealism. Ultimately, this thesis argues that Smith’s moral philosophy was inseparable from his political economy and that his thinking concerning commercial society was deeply impacted by David Hume, Bernard Mandeville, and Rousseau. It will be seen that although Smith was in many ways critical of commercial society, he came to see this social form as ‘better’ than previous forms of social organization, at the last. His perspective with respect to this social form was, therefore, rather nuanced</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ontario Ministry of Education has implemented numerous changes to elementary mathematics programs over the last four years. These modifications called for mathematics lead teachers in every elementary school, curricular changes, and an hour of mathematics learning time every day for every student in Grades 1 to 8. At one point, the proposed changes to the curriculum included a focus on skills that would better prepare students for the professional world, such as problem solving and communication. The Ministry of Education has long supported both problem solving and communication as integral processes in the teaching and learning of mathematics, however, not much is known about Ontario elementary pre-service teachers’ perceptions of problem solving and communication. Elementary pre-service teachers are an important group as they are developing their educational beliefs and practices through their teacher education programs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore elementary pre-service teachers’ perceptions of the relationship between communication and mathematical problem- solving learning contexts in the ongoing improvement efforts in mathematics education in Ontario.&#xD;
Using a social constructivist conceptual framework, this qualitative case study utilized focus groups and one-on-one interviews with 15 elementary pre-service teachers in order to explore their perceptions of problem solving and use of communication in mathematics education. The data were collected in December of 2018 and were subsequently analyzed using a constant comparison method, which consists of creating open codes, building these codes into categories, and then finding emerging themes.&#xD;
The analysis of the focus groups and interviews portrayed the elementary pre-service teachers’ perceptions and use of communication in mathematics education as well as their perceptions of mathematical problem solving in learning contexts. Furthermore, analysis of the focus group and interview data described how participants were thinking about mathematical problem solving and the nature of their communication in mathematical problem-solving learning contexts. An implication of this research is the improvement of our understanding of elementary pre-service teachers’ perceptions in teacher preparation programs. A recommendation for future research is to conduct a similar study with intermediate-senior mathematics pre-service teachers or elementary pre-service teachers in other teacher education programs in Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The swift social, political, and religious changes that encompassed England’s Civil Wars, and later the Puritan-dominated Commonwealth, during the seventeenth-century led to a surge of moralist literature, published during a period with little to no press censorship. Against a backdrop of social upheaval and failing moral reformation, commentators increasingly perceived personal appearance as a source of moral failing throughout England. While the campaign of moral reformation at the time can most strongly be attributed to Puritan influences, on the interconnected questions of hair, dress, and cosmetics, political and religious fault-lines appear relatively few. While writers waged a propaganda war against one another through the press, when it came to the topic of appearance, their proscriptions appear have been largely similar. Though significant differences did still appear on a handful of key issues, it becomes apparent that few writers, regardless of how permissive or restrictive their ideologies may otherwise have been, were able to stomach the perceived, rising tide of subversive practices in self-presentation. Though these subversive practices could be leveraged as political insults in attempts to associate opposition with illicit fashion, this was not exclusive to any one side, nor did these insults necessarily reflect their intended target’s actual outlook. Fashion was a site of significant cultural tension and appeared as one battleground in the ongoing culture war of the time, but it was one in which moralists, pamphleteers, and other writers shared a familiar fear: that the age they were living in had become licentious, permissive, and morally backwards.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The mammalian oviductal secretory cells synthesize and secrete a major glycoprotein known as the oviduct-specific glycoprotein (OVGP1) which is in abundance around the time of fertilization. In vitro studies carried out in various mammalian species have shown that native OVGP1 interacts with gametes and early embryos; this interaction can enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm, increase cleavage rate of early embryos, and prevent polyspermy. However, functional and mechanistic studies of OVGP1 are hampered due to the difficulty in isolating and purifying OVGP1 from oviductal fluid. In the present study, we successfully produced and purified a secretory form of recombinant hamster OVGP1 (rHamOVGP1) and recombinant human OVGP1 (rHuOVGP1) from stably transfected HEK293 cells. Results from this study showed that both rHamOVGP1 and rHuOVGP1 can bind to their homologous sperm in both the head and tail regions. Both recombinant proteins can enhance sperm capacitation through the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins. In hamsters, tyrosine phosphorylated (pY) proteins were located in the equatorial segment, mid-piece, and principal piece. One of the major hamster sperm pY proteins is likely to be AKAP83. In human sperm, pY proteins were located predominantly in the fibrous sheath of the principal piece. One of the identified major pY proteins was AKAP3. AKAP proteins play a role in regulating sperm capacitation and motility. Therefore, recombinant OVGP1s are capable of further enhancing sperm capacitation likely through the increase of the signaling events that lead to increased sperm motility. In addition, the presence of recombinant OVGP1s in the capacitating medium was able to further potentiate the sperm to undergo acrosome reaction. Furthermore, the present study showed that pre-treatment of the zona pellucida and/or sperm with recombinant OVGP1s can also increase the number of sperm bound to the zona pellucida of oocytes. Cryopreserved human sperm samples were also used in this study and found to benefit from the presence of rHuOVGP1 which resulted in increasing the sperm fertilizing capacity. It is envisaged that supplementing the conditioned medium used in assisted reproductive technology with rHuOVGP1 could be beneficial for enhancing the sperm fertilizing competence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The increasing atmospheric aerosols from anthropogenic activities in North China are anticipated to change the proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation in global solar radiation. These solar radiation variations can further influence the photosynthesis of the sunlit and shaded leaves, thereby affecting the terrestrial productivity. The goal of this research was to investigate the impact of aerosols on surface solar radiation and gross primary productivity (GPP) over cropland and grassland ecosystems in North China. Results suggest a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increasing proportion of small-size anthropogenic aerosols from 2000 to 2016 and a significant (p &lt; 0.01) increasing tendency of diffuse solar radiation but a significant (p &lt; 0.01) decreasing tendency of direct solar radiation over the period of 1959-2016 in North China. Aerosols have contributed around 63% to the variations of diffuse solar radiation during 2000-2016. Besides, new empirical methods perform well in estimating direct solar radiation at monthly and daily level. By considering aerosols using the remote sensing-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), the estimation accuracy of diffuse solar radiation is significantly improved. The comparison of GPP under two aerosol scenarios suggests that the presence of aerosols has reduced GPP of the sunlit leaves due to the declined direct solar radiation but enhanced that of the shaded leaves on account of the increased diffuse solar radiation above and below the canopy over both ecosystems. The aerosol-effect on GPP is more significant (p &lt; 0.05) over cropland ecosystem given the more complex canopy structure during the peak period of the growing season. Besides, an AOD value of 0.3-0.6 with a diffuse fraction (the fraction of diffuse solar radiation in global solar radiation) around 30-40% can increase total GPP over cropland ecosystem. &#xD;
This study highlights the significant impact of aerosols on surface solar radiation and gross primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystem over the highly-polluted region. The new empirical methods have improved the estimation accuracy of diffuse solar radiation at monthly and daily level. Meanwhile, the BEPS improved by the new empirical method can better model the terrestrial GPP over polluted regions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Anthropogenic climate change is resulting in a variety of consequences for ecosystems and biodiversity. Collectively these changes are negatively impacting species survival and are increasing rates of extinction. Species can, however, adjust to environmental changes through range shifts, phenotypic plasticity, or genetic adaptation. To ensure successful species conservation in the face of climate change, it is now crucial that a species’ capacity for such change, as well as existing evolutionary differences among populations, are incorporated into species’ management plans. This is particularly important for species dependent on Arctic conditions because climate change will disproportionately affect these regions. Here, I evaluate the spatial genetic structure of a highly mobile Arctic breeding sea duck, the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) by analyzing double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) data from 320 ducks originating from 24 breeding populations spread across North America. I identify two evolutionarily significant units that show a clear west-east divide, which is suggestive of two distinct glacial refugia. I also identify five to six genetically distinct management units and detect five potentially adaptive units within North America. I also identify a pattern of isolation-by-distance across my entire study area and within the Eastern evolutionary significant unit. However, a similar pattern was not evident within the Western evolutionary significant unit. Taken together, my results reveal biologically important population genetic structure that must be considered for the successful long-term management of the eider. My thesis contributes to the growing body of literature aimed at better understanding the broad spectrum of genetic differentiation observed in avian populations that inhabit the Arctic, which will help better manage their conservation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Safe exploration and remote visualization for dangerous and unknown environments have been of a growing demand for several applications. Exploration of dangerous environments can be life threating if it directly involves a human being. Several approaches have been proposed and developed to allow human operators to explore unknown environments in a safe and efficient manner. 3D reconstruction utilizing vision systems is commonly used for object and environment reconstruction and visualization. Different single or multi-sensor vision systems can be utilized for object and environment 3D reconstruction. Single vision sensor systems are the most prone to failure due to environmental factors, that can cause reconstruction failure or degradation. The nature of the reconstructed scene also contributes to the success of the reconstruction process. On one side, Image-based reconstruction is widely utilized for 3D reconstruction which depends on RGB image footage. Despite the high accessibility of the technology and its relatively less expensive cost, it suffers from different failure scenarios. Low illumination and low textured scenes&#xD;
are among the factors that can lead to reconstruction failure. On the other side, point cloud-based reconstruction is another approach that can be utilized using range sensors such as LiDARs. This method is relativity less accessible and more expensive. However, it offers robust performance in different scenarios. Similar to the image-based approach, point cloud-based methods have their limitations that mostly appear in highly reflective environments. This thesis presents a&#xD;
multiplatform 3D reconstruction method operating from unmanned ground vehicles to increase system robustness and to introduce a safer reconstruction in unknown environments. The proposed system integrates low-cost RGB imaging camera with a 3D LiDAR for enhanced reconstruction. A novel toolchain is developed to reduce the processing time of the reconstruction operation. The robustness of the proposed method was examined over several test scenarios, which involves both indoor and outdoor reconstruction. The proposed methods have increased the reconstruction system robustness and reduced the computational complexity, resulting in increasing the overall system reliability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Persons with cognitive disabilities and nonhuman animals are denied the right to make personal choices because it is claimed that they are not autonomous, for autonomy requires the capacity to revise one’s preferences and to have second-order desires. In this thesis, I argue first that this account of autonomy (that I call ‘rational autonomy’) does not provide a satisfying foundation to the right to make personal choices and to the interest in liberty, even for the paradigmatic cases of humans deemed rational agents; second, I propose and develop a new conception, named ‘inclusive autonomy’, that is intended to do justice to rational agents, persons with cognitive abilities, and nonhuman animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
This enquiry involves multiple steps. First, I criticize the way rational autonomy intends to support a right to make personal choices, by arguing it is empirically inaccurate, that it could be perfectionist or elitist if it is deemed as a requirement rather than a value to promote, and that it generally fails to explain why choices that have not been rationally revised cannot be protected by the right in question. Second, I argue that persons with cognitive disabilities and nonhuman animals also possess an interest in liberty, and especially an objective interest in non-domination, and for the same reasons as rational agents. Third, after assessing a few notable alternatives to rational autonomy, I identify four desiderata for a satisfying conception: the balance between the right to take risks and paternalism, the antidomination requirement, the anti-ableist requirement, and the social support requirement. Inclusive autonomy, defined as the ability to form subjectively defined goods, is equipped to address these desiderata if it is further supplied by an account of preference formation and a theory of paternalism. For these reasons, I explain how the structuring of opportunities and the interest in non-domination can help individuals to develop authentic preferences, even when they are unable to revise their desires; and I discuss three provisos—the competence threshold, the social support principle, and the limited intervention requirement—that impose conditions for paternalistic interventions while enabling agents to enjoy autonomy to the greatest extent possible.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Being able to quantify the reliability of a water distribution system (WDS) is particularly important for decision makers as it allows to take objective decisions for the benefit of the population served by the system. The reliability of WDSs is an abstract concept that usually refers to the ability of the network to supply the water demanded by the consumers under different circumstances or conditions. However, setting explicit criteria to measure a system’s reliability has proven to be a challenging problem for researchers given the complexity and non-linearity of WDSs. To this point, no widely accepted measure methodology for reliability has been introduced in WDSs. Two main classes of reliability quantification methodologies can be identified in recent literature: 1) Stochastic Reliability Measures which quantify reliability based on probabilistic concepts and methods, and 2) Reliability Surrogate Measures which use easy to compute indexes, based on intuitive judgment, and that are expected to correlate with reliability.&#xD;
This thesis develops two estimators of stochastic reliability (MRE and HRE – Mechanical and Hydraulic Reliability Estimators), that also work as reliability surrogate measures, getting important features from both types of reliability measures. To test their applicability, a framework to evaluate the reliability of realistic WDSs using pressure-driven analysis under extended period simulation is also developed. The framework includes the use of a method to produce synthetic networks, and its further application to complete five case studies based on real systems from Colombia. Then a method to perform pressure-driven analysis, under extended period simulation, using the proven network solver EPANET 2.0, is introduced. Additionally, given that an efficient optimization procedure was required to deal with the large case studies, a method named NSGA-II+OPUS was developed and tested.&#xD;
Based on the results of a comparative and correlation analysis, it can be concluded that the proposed estimators are both easy to compute and implement in an optimization routine, and consistently representative of the reliability of the systems. Moreover, thanks to the new pressure-driven analysis method, the computation of stochastic reliability is accessible by an extensive evaluation of different functionalities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine wound healing of acute and chronic wounds by comparing two five-layer polyurethane foam dressings. &#xD;
Objectives: 1) Compare the changes in surface area for wounds treated with two different five-layer polyurethane foam dressings. 2) Compare the characteristics of wounds treated with two different types of five-layer polyurethane foam dressings. &#xD;
Methods: A non-inferiority, pragmatic, open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted to explore the hypothesis that one five-layer foam dressing (Optifoam® Adhesive) is no less effective than another five-layer foam dressing (Mepilex® Border). Changes in wound surface area and in wound characteristics were assessed weekly for up to four weeks by calculating the decrease in wound surface area and completing a wound assessment tool. &#xD;
Results: An initial sample size of 50 was calculated. Over an eight-month period, 18 participants were recruited from three different sites. Wounds in the Optifoam® group had a statistically significant faster decrease in wound surface area than wounds in the Mepilex® group: 0.96 cm2 per day compared to 0.26 cm2 per day (p = 0.004). The mean BWAT score for participants in the Mepilex® group was 24.1 (SD 6.6) and 24.5 (SD 6.1) in the Optifoam® group. This difference was within the non-inferiority limit that was set a priori. There were 18 participants enrolled in the study, only 5 participants completed all four weeks of the study. Due to the recruitment and retention issues, feasibility issues of conducting this research were also addressed. &#xD;
Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, Optifoam® is not inferior to Mepilex® Border. More research is needed with adequate sample size to support these results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the bio-political governance of pregnancy in Turkey with a focus on the current Family Medicine Model (FMM), which has a specific mandate to monitor pregnant women to increase their access to prenatal medical care, thereby decreasing national maternal and infant mortality rates. This mandate is fortified through official performance-based payment and warning-point schemas, which have economic incentives and disincentives to pressure medical professionals employed in the family health clinics to fulfill their pregnancy-monitoring responsibilities. I specifically examine the practices of the medical professionals who work under these performance regulations and the experiences of the pregnant patients who are in contact with the family health clinics and their further implications. Because of the inherent limitations in a solely discursive approach, which focuses on understanding the discourses and rationales of bio-political governance, I employ a feminist discursive-materialist approach, which combines the foucauldian productive-discursive notion of governance with a feminist materialist approach, thereby developing a critical relationship between the discursive and materialist aspects of political governance.  In addition to providing an understanding of the rationales and discourses that mediate the pregnancy governance through the Family Medicine Model’s pregnancy-monitoring mandate, I explore the materialist ramifications of this mandate for Turkish women in the axes of gender and class relations. I undertake this exploration at two different but related analytical axes: the state’s apparatus of the bio-political governance (by drawing on official regulation of the FMM and the practices and strategies used by medical professionals to comply with the regulation) and the techniques of self-governance (by drawing on the experiences of pregnant women in regarding health self-governance and the FMM’s pregnancy-monitoring mandate). The main finding of this dissertation is that the FMM’s pregnancy-monitoring mandate works both as a productive and a repressive apparatus of bio-political power with empowering and disempowering ramifications for Turkish women.  While this mandate increases some women’s access to prenatal medical care, it also perpetuates a gendered regime of surveillance in which women’s sexual and reproductive activities are under communal and state monitoring with critical implications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study compares the three-dimensional version of a previously proposed large-scale particle tracking velocimetry (LS-PTV) measurement system with a simpler, less computationally expensive, two-dimensional version for use in in-situ measurements.&#xD;
The LS-PTV (3D) system was used as a baseline for measuring wind flow over a flat roof in a 3m x 3m x 1.5m volume.&#xD;
The LS-PTV (2D) system covered a 1.5m x 3m plane within the same volume.&#xD;
A 3D ultrasonic anemometer was used outside of the measurement volume as a means to validate the LS-PTV measurements.&#xD;
An analytical model of the bubbles used as tracer particles for the LS-PTV measurements determined that the bubbles were able to resolve fluid length-scales 0.25m or larger, which was within the size of the measurement volume.&#xD;
Despite being more susceptible to errors due to incomplete background image subtraction, which was responsible for noise in the tracking algorithm, the LS-PTV (2D) system was able to track approximately 80% more bubbles and at a lower spatial uncertainty than the LS-PTV (3D) system.&#xD;
The LS-PTV (2D) system was unable to measure an exact projection of the LS-PTV (3D) results, which was a result of the LS-PTV systems tracking different bubbles within the same flow field.&#xD;
Both LS-PTV systems were found to measure the same velocities and Reynolds stresses within the field, and the missing vertical component from the LS-PTV (2D) measurements was deemed negligible.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) structures has been inherently limited by the lack of adequate sensing technologies, which can capture both the global and localized behaviour of these complex composite systems. The inability to properly assess these structures, and understand their behaviour under static and dynamic loads, can result in costly rehabilitation or replacement of existing structures and potentially unnecessary conservativeness in future designs. To improve on traditional assessment methods, this thesis investigates the application of a new fibre optic sensing system, which is capable of accurately measuring dynamic and distributed strains throughout the length of a fibre optic cable.&#xD;
&#xD;
An experimental campaign was conducted, which included the design, construction and testing of 4 slender and 4 deep RC beams. The purpose of these tests was to evaluate the durability and accuracy of dynamic distributed fibre optic sensors (DDFOS) under dynamic loading, as well as to utilize the DDFOS results to develop a better understanding of the behaviour of RC beams under both cyclic and ultimate loads. The results showed that the fibre optic sensors could withstand the repeated loading as well as ultimate loads while accurately measuring distributed strains along the steel reinforcement within the RC specimens. This data provided key insights into the change of load carrying mechanism (from beam action to arch action) as well as the failure mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
Two case studies were also conducted on existing RC beams within a building. The studies included the in-situ dynamic loading of the beams while monitoring them with both DDFOS technology and tradition discrete sensors. Jumping tests were carried out to provide dynamic loading on each beam. The detailed DDFOS data was assessed by comparing the results to the traditional sensors, and was used to determine critical performance metrics of the RC beams including: maximum strains, support conditions, and cracking behaviour. The data was further used to provide dynamic estimations of the changing distributed deflections and crack widths due to the application of the dynamic loads.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Aft-fuselage mounted twin-engine style aircraft dominate the business jet industry. This aircraft provides a decreased transmission path for structure-borne engine vibrations when compared to wing-mounted aircraft found predominantly in the commercial aircraft industry. Despite the widespread use of aft-fuselage mounted twin-engine aircraft, the literature investigating the vibroacoustic properties of this aircraft is sparse. This work aims to generate a thorough understanding of the structure-borne interior cabin noise for an aft-fuselage mounted twin-engine aircraft such that future aircraft design can mitigate cabin noise. Modifications to key fuselage components were performed, decreasing the modal density in the engine excitation frequency range. A novel model updating technique was introduced to the literature, allowing for refinement of both the experimental and computational data sets. The coordinate orthogonality check method was implemented to eliminate erroneous degrees of freedom from the experimental data set. A multi-objective model updating optimization technique using the pseudo-orthogonality check and the natural frequency difference between the computational model and the refined experimental model as objective functions was used to converge on the most accurate representation of the physical system. A novel substructuring technique was introduced into the literature, verifying the correlation between local and global fuselage modes, allowing for fuselage components to be analyzed in isolation with confidence the results will remain consistent when the component is assembled as part of a complete fuselage. A complete vibroacoustic analysis of the fuselage was performed, investigating the modal parameters, harmonic response to engine excitation, and the interior cabin sound pressure level. Two aircraft designs were considered: a single and a double bulkhead aft-fuselage mounted twin-engine aircraft. A new method of pressurization was introduced that decreased the peak displacement values of the pressurized bulkhead by a factor of two. Finally, the first successful topology optimization of a pre-stiffened aircraft bulkhead was performed, with the refined design reducing stiffener mass and eliminating all natural frequencies within 5% of the critical frequency plus a safety factor of two.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abusive user-posted content has become a serious issue for many different forms of online communication, especially communication on social media platforms. While the effects of abusive content on society and governments are still being determined, we know that comments containing abusive language can damage lives and put targets of abuse at risk. To address this, we have developed a model-driven approach to abusive language detection. Our approach is based on motivators that are likely to lead to someone posting abusive content. Using the motivators as intermediate constructs of abusive language we develop several models based on othering, subjectivity, moods, and emotions. This model-driven approach first considers the processes that lead to a person posting an abusive comment and constructs a predictor based on each of the models. Each individual predictor is combined into a stacked predictor that is able to detect abusive language with an accuracy of 95% and an F1-score of 91. In addition to a strong abusive language detection technique, we explore how each intermediate construct contributes to our predictor and its role in abusive language.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Transportation industry typically rely on conventional fossil energy resources such as petroleum. This&#xD;
source of energy, however, is neither renewable nor emission-free. Nowadays transportation sectors are&#xD;
replacing their conventional internal combustion vehicles by Electric Vehicles (EVs). Much research efforts&#xD;
have been devoted to improve EVs and EV infrastructure. EV battery and thus the on-board EV battery&#xD;
charger are among the most important parts of an EV.&#xD;
There are specific requirements for EV chargers in terms of weight, safety, reliability, cost and&#xD;
efficiency. Meeting power quality standards imposed by grid and operation with wide range of DC voltage&#xD;
and current are among the other requirements.&#xD;
In addition, EV battery chargers can be used for ancillary services and also feed the power back to the&#xD;
grid in peak hours and operate like a distributed energy storage for grid. This requires bi-directional power&#xD;
flow through the charger.&#xD;
One problem associated with single-phase on-board EV battery chargers, is the low frequency power&#xD;
ripple that reflected in the DC-side. This double frequency ripple causes extra heat and reduces the life span&#xD;
of the battery. Another issue is the reliability reduction due to the use of unreliable electrolytic capacitors.&#xD;
This thesis proposes a family of on-board Single-stage bidirectional battery chargers to handle a wide&#xD;
range of active and reactive power control. Single-stage power conversion is chosen due to lower&#xD;
component count, better efficiency and higher power density. All power converter topologies proposed in&#xD;
this thesis are operated under zero voltage switching (ZVS). In proposed converter topologies electrolytic&#xD;
capacitors are removed, while the battery current maintained DC and free from low frequency ripple.&#xD;
The innovative resonant control schemes enable the proposed topologies to successfully perform&#xD;
complicated tasks of optimization, power transfer, cancellation of low frequency current ripple on the&#xD;
battery-side and maintaining ZVS for all the switching instants. The proposed dynamic controller uses a&#xD;
novel variable duty-cycle and variable phase-shift control to achieve the functionalities of the resonant circuit controller. A 1kW experimental setup with AC voltage of 230V and DC voltage of 200V-400V is developed to verify the viability of the proposed battery charging systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In teleost fish, the microbiome plays a variety of roles in host physiology and adaptability to different environments. Anadromous fish (migrating to sea after maturation and returning to freshwater to spawn) are reported to experience turnover of their bacterial communities when transitioning between marine and freshwater environments. Microbiomes of Arctic salmonids are poorly studied, and cold-water environments may support colonization by different microbes. Additionally, anadromous Arctic salmonids perform seasonal migrations, escaping super-cooled seawater in winter. Therefore, it is of interest to determine if these fish experience repeated seasonal recolonizations. This thesis attempts to further understanding of Arctic salmonid microbiomes in two investigations.&#xD;
	In the first investigation, anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from the Kitikmeot region, Nunavut, were sampled and bacterial communities from the intestine characterized using 16S rRNA gene fragment analysis. Bacterial communities were compared across seasonal habitats within the char’s migration route. Communities showed differences between brackish and freshwater habitats, and between different temporal stages of freshwater residence. Brackish communities were broadly consistent with taxa seen in other anadromous salmonids, but were rich in psychrophiles at the genus level, including a putative symbiote, Photobacterium iliopiscarium occurring in &gt;90% of fish from brackish waters. Freshwater communities were more variable and less consistent taxonomically with other salmonids, possibly reflecting char’s winter fasting behaviour. These results suggest that climate change could affect relationships between Arctic char and their symbiotes. &#xD;
	In the second investigation, intestinal communities of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) were compared to char, with which they were sympatric and behaving anadromously. Lake whitefish appeared to experience similar community shifts with salinity, but community composition was significantly different from char, and at freshwater sites appeared to be more affected by geography. Lake whitefish communities were generally more diverse than in char and appeared to be more represented by groups known to contain opportunistic pathogens. Additionally, community diversity was more affected by feeding than in char. Together, the results suggested that lake whitefish in this environment, which is at their northern limit, exercise less selection on their intestinal communities than char, and this could reflect their on-going evolutionary adaptation to high Arctic microbes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, many industries – from transportation and accommodation to finance and automobiles – have been disrupted by platform businesses that ostensibly remove middlemen from market transactions. Much of this work can be traced to Silicon Valley-based firms that employ technology to connect consumers to one another or directly to companies, cutting out – or minimizing the role of – intermediaries in the process. Driven by an ideology that disdains hierarchy and favours direct connections, these market entrants have disrupted taken-for-granted practices in disparate industries that had long been home to intermediated market arrangements – arrangements which were themselves historically inscribed with ideology – ushering in an “era of disintermediation” (Houle 2011, p. 141). In some markets, this has provoked impassioned engagement from different actors in support of, or opposition to, the market entrant’s challenge. However, despite the spread of such disruptions, we still know relatively little about their dynamics, or the work done by different actors in responding to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
Drawing on Wright and Zammuto’s (2013) multi-level conceptualization of field change and Bourdieu’s (1977) notion of doxa, I explore the ongoing disruption occurring in the field of automobile distribution spurred by the entry of Tesla Motors, a company that employs a direct-to-consumer model in a market long characterized by intermediated channels. Utilizing archival, interview, and netnographic data, I develop an account of the ideologically-driven institutional work conducted by different actors as they endeavor to bring about or prevent field-level change in the wake of this disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
I find marketers and consumers engaging in three novel forms of institutional work; in developing these findings, I also extend theorization around marketplace moralism and market-based social movements. In addition, I trace the development of this work over time to create an account of doxic market disruption. In discussing my findings, I outline implications for studies of market dynamics, marketing channels, institutional work, and cultural branding.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Corruption is seen as major hindrance to development, and anti-corruption measures form a significant part of international development strategies. In 2013, the United Kingdom (UK)’s Department of International Development (DFID) suspended all general budgetary support to Malawi following the exposure of government corruption in the “Cashgate” scandal. This MA thesis examines the role accountability for corruption – as part of the good governance rhetoric – plays in the post-Washington Consensus (PWC) approach to development and asks what the UK’s suspension of aid to Malawi can tell us about the conceptualisation and application of accountability for corruption in contemporary aid relations. By undertaking an historical analysis of the development of the PWC’s focus on good governance and of the nature of accountability and then surveying contemporary documents addressing the UK-Malawi aid relationship, this research demonstrates that corruption serves a central role in the PWC as explaining why countries fail to develop and that a fundamental element of accountability within the good governance framework is that it is retroactive – that is, accountability mechanisms are triggered after wrongdoing. Cashgate and DFID’s response is then compared to the understanding of accountability for corruption DFID demonstrated in its documents and to the 2009 UK parliamentary expenses scandal. The MA thesis concludes that there are two significant inconsistencies in the theory and practical application of accountability for corruption: an internal inconsistency in that an application of the retroactive element of accountability contradicts the PWC’s use of corruption as the explanation for failed development; and an external inconsistency in that the retroactive element was adopted in the UK parliamentary expenses scandal but not in Cashgate. This contributes to the literature on the inherent shortcomings of the PWC’s approach to development and the impossible governance standards to which aid-recipient countries are held that donors do not themselves attain, and poses questions for how accountability should be applied in order to achieve true social justice, equality and prosperity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“From the East and West Indies to the Mother Country: The House of Daljinder Kaur and Out of Left Field” is a PhD research-creation project consisting of two outdoor installations and a written component. It takes as a departure point diasporic movements to Britain from the Punjab and Trinidad in the late 1940s through to the 1960s.&#xD;
The House of Daljinder Kaur is a schematic representation of a house with a pitched roof, five windows and a door. The windows and doorway were filled with an array of many varieties of daffodils. Over the course of the summer, the bed was gradually subsumed by chili pepper plants and marigolds – “exotic” species that “polluted” the Englishness of the daffodils. The second installation, Out of Left Field, is a cricket pitch on a slope: a metaphor for an immigrant's difficulty in practicing his métier in a new homeland. Both works speak to the desire (from the migrants’ point of view) to be accepted by their former colonisers as genuine subjects with the same rights and respect as accorded to native born Britons.&#xD;
The parallel discourse which accompanies the installations is built on a narrative scaffolding of two seminal moments in the history of immigration to Britain: the arrival of the SS Empire Windrush in 1948 and the influx of Punjabi Sikhs in the 50s. These groups came to ease the country’s Post WWII labour shortage and to provide remittances for their relatives back home. Through a series of interlinked texts, I examine the immigrant experience in that epoch from an autobiographical perspective, focussing on how place and memory play a role in the genesis of my current and previous artistic works. I also include imaginative portions that bring real characters together with invented personas to blur the boundaries between the real and the fictive. These pieces are contextualised in two essays: one that explores how several artists have worked with fictional characters, and the other that centres on the importance of geographical location as an intrinsic element in the concept and reception of site-specific work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this work, we describe a novel PROCAM sensor which uses steganographic techniques to embed imperceptible patterns in structured light, allowing a projector to function both as a versatile display device and a sensor for augmented reality applications. The purpose of this technology is to enable a new generation of intelligent projectors with the capacity for self-calibration, responsive user-interaction and the ability communicate with peer devices. Our approach analyses input frames by transformation into the frequency domain where each frame is encoded with an imperceptible pattern. The encoded input frame is then returned to the spatial domain where it is projected and in turn recaptured by the PROCAM pair. We decode by filtering the image in the frequency domain and extracting the transformed encoded pattern which allows the estimation of the transformation incurred by projection or the extraction encoded data. It is hoped that the methodology described herein will enable future work in PROCAM AR calibration, stenographic communication, and environment sensing AR systems with the capacity responsive user-interfaces, be that through behaviour recognition or other forms of interaction. Our results show that the proposed system is capable of embedding patterns into input frames with only minimal alteration to the input image, and pattern extraction can be achieved reliably with minimal noise.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research program explored the role of mode of delivery in postpartum sexuality. The first study was an online survey of nulliparous individuals’ perceptions of how childbirth impacts sexuality (Chapter 2). The results indicated that approximately one in five nulliparous individuals perceive vaginal birth to be harmful to their future sexuality. The second and third studies (Chapters 3 and 4) took place in the Sexual Health Research Laboratory and empirically tested the hypothesis that the physiological impact of vaginal birth on the genitopelvic region is harmful to one’s future sex life using a mixed-methodology approach. These laboratory-based studies used self-report, sexual psychophysiological, and psychophysical methodologies to examine differences in self-reported sexual function, genital response, and genitopelvic sensitivity across three groups of women recruited from the local community: 1) women who were within two years of their first delivery and had a vaginal birth; 2) women who were within two years of their first delivery and had a C-section; and 3) an age-matched group of nulliparous women. The sexual psychophysiology study presented in Chapter 3 evaluated women’s sexual response genitally (using the laser Doppler imager) and subjectively (using continuous as well as discrete self-reported change scores of arousal ratings) while watching erotic audio-visual stimuli. Findings suggested that genital response may be impaired following a vaginal birth; however, subjective ratings of sexual arousal did not differ as a function of mode of delivery.  The study described in Chapter 4 assessed sensitivity of genitopelvic regions innervated by the pudendal nerve using quantitative sensory testing (QST) to measure sensory thresholds. Results from Chapter 4 do not provide support for the hypothesis that vaginal birth is associated with decreased genitopelvic sensitivity. Taken together, the findings from the current research program suggest that there is a sizeable minority of North American nulliparous individuals who subscribe to the belief that vaginal birth will be harmful to their future sex life; however, this belief was not substantiated by the empirical studies reported in Chapters 3 and 4. The disconnect has relevant implications to the conversation regarding the rising rates of C-sections worldwide.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The geometric design of an axial-flow pit-turbine is essential as flow separation will decrease turbine efficiency. In this thesis, steady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations were conducted with a two-equation closure model and validated with experimental results. The research focuses on evaluating the performance of a k-omega Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model with wall functions in separated flows. RANS simulations were carried out in OpenFOAM using an unstructured grid for both lab and full-scale models of the pit-turbine. By testing a lab-scale model, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was performed to provide insights into the flow behaviour in regions of separation. It was observed that the pressure results from the lab and full-scale RANS models were in agreement with experimental data except in regions of an adverse pressure gradient. The k-omega SST model is sensitive to wall-functions and therefore flow properties near the wall are incorrectly calculated in regions of flow separation. At sharp streamline curvatures, the pressure drop is overpredicted for both the lab and full-scale models. However, at very large Reynolds numbers for the full-scale turbine, the turbulence model underpredicts and delays flow separation at a larger radius of curvature when compared to experiments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Field modulation with coherent detection leverages the use of optical channel bandwidth and allows mitigating transmission impairments by exploiting the two quadrature components of the optical carrier and providing a linear electrical-to-optical (EO) and optical-to-electrical (OE) conversion. In addition, polarization multiplexing represents an effective means to double the information rate of single-polarization systems. The advent of high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) engines and high-speed data converters has enabled the reliable transmission of bit rate in excess of 400 Gbit/s at achievable symbol rate using spectrally efficient dual-polarization (DP) M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-MQAM) and forward error correction (FEC) schemes. The evolution of such systems towards higher capacity depends on designing signaling schemes which increase the information rate in the presence of linear and nonlinear impairments. QAM constellation shaping has emerged as a practical approach for tailoring modulation formats to be more power efficient and more tolerant to fiber nonlinearities. &#xD;
 &#xD;
 The major contribution of this thesis is to extensively analyze the role of constellation shaping in boosting the transmission capacity of modern coherent systems. This includes describing a simplified approach to estimate the system performance of arbitrary modulation formats following nonlinear transmission. The approach employs well-established models for intra- and inter- nonlinear effects and hence requires less computational effort compared to the more accurate split-step Fourier simulation. &#xD;
 Additionally, I proposed a novel framework for optimized constellation design. The framework uses genetic algorithms to optimize multidimensional QAM constellation subset selection and has the potential to provide a methodical alternative to existing non-trivial constellation design approaches. Using this approach, I could obtain optimized 4D and 8D constellations.  Finally, I thoroughly investigated the system performance of probabilistically shaped (PS) and uniform DP-64QAM constellations in the presence of polarization-dependent loss (PDL). An accurate simulation model was employed to evaluate the fluctuations of the bit-wise (BW) achievable information rate (AIR) due to PDL. Moreover, extensive laboratory experiments were conducted to demonstrate the statistical behaviour of the BW AIR. A single-span loop setup with partially automated equipment allowed accurate emulation of distributed link PDL as well as capturing a  sufficient number of PDL instances.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the factors that maintain and constrain biodiversity and species coexistence is a major goal in ecology. Closely related species that use similar resources often differ in their seasonal patterns of activity, consistent with resource partitioning that is thought to facilitate coexistence. The factors that limit the distributions of these species across seasons, however, are unknown for the majority of species. In my second chapter, we conducted a large-scale survey of a diverse carrion beetle community in southeastern Ontario, Canada from April to October, and found evidence consistent with resource partitioning in Nicrophorus habitat generalists, but limited evidence for seasonal differences in abundance among habitat specialists. In my third chapter, we test one hypothesis that may explain seasonal differences in activity between two burying beetle species (Nicrophorus sayi, N. orbicollis) that co-occur, require carrion for food and reproduction, and differ in their seasonal patterns of activity. Specifically, we tested predictions of the competitive ability – cold tolerance trade-off hypothesis whereby adaptations to cold temperatures compromise competitive ability under warmer conditions, leading to the partitioning of resources along seasonal gradients. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found evidence that the late-season N. orbicollis is less able to function at the cold temperatures that characterize early spring, when the early-season N. sayi is most active. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, we found that the late-season N. orbicollis was not competitively dominant to the early-season N. sayi under warm conditions, but instead the larger beetle always won, regardless of species. Our survey data suggest that N. orbicollis is usually the larger species when competing for the same carrion later in the season, mostly because of its high abundance during this time. The larger size of N. orbicollis thus presents an intense competitive pressure that should limit N. sayi breeding later in the season. Overall, my thesis research provides evidence for seasonal partitioning of resources and the factors that constrain the seasonal distributions of two species. My work further suggests that seasonal partitioning of resources may contribute to maintaining local diversity within a diverse community of carrion beetles.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A novel approach to perform electrolysis in stages is developed for reducing the share&#xD;
of electric work in the process and replacing the same with thermal energy. The&#xD;
study is divided into two parts, the first part is a theoretical study of electrolysis in&#xD;
stages and the second part is a computational fluid dynamics study of the same. In&#xD;
the first part the thermodynamics of single stage electrolysis is studied in detail by&#xD;
performing parametric studies of varying steam utilization and inlet steam concentration.&#xD;
Subsequently, a formulation for electrolysis in stages is developed in order&#xD;
to calculate the utilization of each stage, keeping the inlet steam temperature and&#xD;
electrolyte temperature for each stage constant. The utilization of each stage is calculated&#xD;
such that overall utilization of the process is as desired. Electric and thermal&#xD;
energy requirements of the process are determined and are compared with the case of&#xD;
single stage electrolysis. The electric energy required for the process of 5 stages is 25.4&#xD;
kWh (per kilogram of H2) which is substantially lower than the 50-65 kWh/kg used&#xD;
by commercial electrolysers today. Electric energy savings of up to 1.2 kWh/kg are&#xD;
predicted for a case with 5 stages as compared to single stage. These savings increase&#xD;
with an increase in the number of stages and the required inlet steam temperature&#xD;
is also reduced. The assumptions of this study are no Ohmic losses and constant&#xD;
temperature electrolysis. In the second part, a detailed CFD study of staged electrolysis&#xD;
is undertaken. The variation of temperature within the electrolyte is considered&#xD;
along with Ohmic losses. The electric energy requirement for a 5 stage process was&#xD;
found to be 25.5 kWh/kg. The electric energy savings in the CFD study are calculated&#xD;
to be 5.7 kWh/kg for a case with 5 stages as compared to a single stage.&#xD;
The higher energy savings are due to higher average electrolyte temperatures in the&#xD;
CFD study as compared to theoretical value. Similar to the first study the electrical&#xD;
energy savings increase as the number of stages increases.&#xD;
Finally, a hypothesis for the case with an infinite number of stages is developed&#xD;
in order to determine the absolute minimum work requirement for process in stages.&#xD;
By taking this as benchmark the effectiveness of the staging process is determined as a ratio of the electric energy requirement in infinite stages to that in a given number&#xD;
of stages. The study can be further enhanced by performing optimization to generate&#xD;
minimum work for any given number of stages.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Current targeted prostate biopsy methods often rely on commercial systems to support the procedure. These systems tend to lack the export of analysis results for secondary analysis studies used in research. Transperineal in-bore MRI-guided prostate biopsy (tpMRgBx) is one such targeted biopsy approach that lacks a commercial system to support the procedure. This work aims to investigate the use of open-source tools in creating an open-source platform that can support the tpMRgBx procedure while allowing access to the data necessary for analysis but also for comparison (to other targeted biopsy approaches).&#xD;
An open-source platform, SliceTracker, was presented with support for all steps of the tpMRgBx research workflow. Evaluation metrics were defined for a retrospective and prospective study of patients who underwent tpMRgBx. Retrospective evaluation studied registration accuracy, effect of the segmentation approach, and re-identification time of biopsy targets. Prospective evaluation focused on total procedure time as well as biopsy target re-identification accuracy.&#xD;
Results from the 73 retrospective and 10 prospective tpMRgBx cases showed success in the use of SliceTracker for supporting tpMRgBx. Mean Landmark Registration Error (LRE) for retrospective evaluation was 1.88 ± 2.63 mm and was not sensitive to the approach for prostate gland segmentation. For the prospective data, a target re-identification time of 4.60 ± 2.40 min and biopsy targeting error of 2.4 ± 0.98 mm was observed. &#xD;
The proposed platform SliceTracker was successfully integrated into the clinical research procedure at the institution in this study, supporting hundreds of cases to date. It is extensible and supports uniform collection of research data. This work represents a stride towards facilitating comparison between targeted prostate biopsy methods and the goal of improving prostate cancer care. It also provides a platform that is better suited to support translation of the tpMRgBx procedure to other sites.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Modifying surfaces with self assembled monolayers (SAMs) is a simple and effective way to create functional materials. Traditionally compounds containing a thiol head group are used to generate SAMs on gold surfaces. However, a recent discovery by the Crudden lab demonstrated increased bond strength and surface stability of n heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to a gold substrate. Here in we report the synthesis and modification of gold surfaces with NHCs containing unique functionality. Chemical synthesis was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques and SAM formation was analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). N,N’-Ditolyl-4,5(R,R)-diphenylimidazolium tetrafluroborate (19) is a known molecule with chiral functionality about the backbone and successfully formed a SAM on gold with a calculated carbon to nitrogen ratio of 29:2 from XPS analysis results. Iodine (31), triflate (34), hydrogen bicarbonate (35), and tetrafluoroborate (37) salts of N,N’-Diisopropyl[2,3-d]imidazoliumnaphthalene were synthesized in order to investigate the π-stacking of the naphthalene backbone when assembled on a gold surface. Unfortunately, from XPS analysis a full monolayer was never achieved. Finally, N,N’-Diisopropylnaphtho[2,3-d]imidazolium-4,9-dione salts: iodine (48), triflate (50), and tetrafluoroborate (49), were synthesized in an attempt to electrochemically probe the redox active quinone moiety once a SAM had formed on a gold surface. Compound 49 formed a monolayer on the gold surface with a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 16:2 from the XPS analysis results and compound 50 has a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 36:2. The electrochemistry experiments were performed using a monolayer of 50 on a gold electrode. The cyclic voltammogram revealed very minor features characteristic of the quinone moiety which indicates low molecular consistent with XPS results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Canada undertook a major reform of the laws surrounding rape beginning in 1983. As a result of this reform, rape was re-conceptualized as ‘sexual assault’, and laws surrounding consent and earlier sexual history were introduced in 1992. These changes were greatly influenced by feminist groups in the hope that victims of sexual violence would be more likely to come forward. However, sexual assault continues to be underreported in Canada and there is substantial attrition from the number of reported cases to the number of charged and convicted cases. Such attrition raises questions about other areas in which sexual assault legal reforms have not lived up to their promise. Media reports and some scholarly literature suggests inappropriate actions are or are likely occurring within the Canadian Criminal Justice System (CCJS) at the hands of judges; however, the present study indicates that such behaviours are infrequent. Through a cross-sectional exploratory study design with a content analysis of judge rulings, this study explores the impact of judge and victim gender on sexual assault trial outcomes. Further, the present study explores whether popular rape myths still embed themselves within the CCJS, despite legislative efforts to eliminate such myths.  Using the CanLII database, adult sexual assault cases within Canada between 2000 and 2018 with either a written verdict or sentencing decision (N=106) were identified and coded on a variety of variables. Results indicate that the gender of both the judge and the victim is not associated with trial outcomes, judges are not likely to use common rape myths—albeit it does occur from time to time, are likely to follow the CCC, and judges are more likely to use language that resembles the violent connotations of sexual assault rather than sexualizing the assault. These results may be cause for cautious optimism for policy-makers, researchers, and feminist advocates alike.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hydrogen bonding interactions are of paramount importance in many chemical and biological processes. Although the physicochemical parameters to identify hydrogen bonds (HBs) have been established in the literature, direct measurement of HB energies in solution has remained a significant challenge. In this thesis, we report a new 17O NMR method for directly measuring the energetics of intramolecular HBs in solution. The new method is based on determination of the rotational barrier of a carboxylate group in which one of the two oxygen atoms is involved in an intramolecular HB. We have applied this new approach to a variety of carboxylate monoanions that are known to have the shortest, thus the strongest, intramolecular HBs and obtained the HB energetic values between 7.0 ± 0.5 and 10.9 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1 in various protic and aprotic solvents as well as in protic solvents containing various amounts of water. We have also measured the energetics of breaking the elongated O−H covalent bonds in picolinic acid N-oxide (PANO), phenylmaleate, and citraconate in DMF, which were found to be 10.7 ± 0.5, 9.5 ± 0.5, and 10.2 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. Since an elongated covalent O−H bond should be stronger than any H···O HB, the experimentally measured energetics of the elongated O−H covalent bond in PANO, 10.7 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1, may represent the upper limit of the HB energetics in solution. To supplement the experimental 17O NMR approach, we have combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the integral equation formalism polarized continuum model (IEFPCM) to determine the carboxylate rotational barrier and the corresponding HB energetics. The new experimental results reported in this thesis have significantly advanced our understanding of HB energetics. If one uses the common classification of strong HBs (12–24 kcal mol-1), our results immediately suggest that strong HBs do not exist in solution. Our findings have also put into question whether any HB in the transition state of enzymatic reactions can actually provide 10-20 kcal mol-1 for catalysis as proposed by Gerlt and Gassman.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Quantum dots (QDs) integrated in nanophotonic environments provide an excellent platform for quantum information technologies and engineerable light-matter interactions. One application is a solid-state single photon source (SPS), where a QD in an optical cavity can be used to emit antibunched photons. This setup can provide photons on-demand if excited with a pulse, which renders the problem of modelling the QD SPS a genuinely time-dependent problem in quantum optics. Furthermore, the QD-cavity system interacts with its environment via electron-phonon scattering with the surrounding lattice as well as coupling to the photonic background, which causes decoherence and necessitates an open quantum system framework. In this thesis, we study pulse-driven QDs coupled to photonic environments and phonon reservoirs using an open system quantum optics approach, with a focus on elements unique to the time-dependent dynamics.&#xD;
After introducing the necessary theoretical background, first we present an analysis of the impact of electron-phonon scattering on a proposal for a QD-cavity system which uses adiabatic passage to generate triggered single photons of orthogonal polarization to the excitation fields. Next, we provide an analysis of the resonance fluorescence spectrum of two-level systems (including QDs) driven by a pulse, with particular emphasis on where spectral asymmetries can arise. Last, we study resonantly excited QD-cavity SPSs with attention given to how the excitation pulse can affect the quantum dynamics and SPS figures-of-merit. We show that the excitation process can degrade the figures-of-merit to a degree comparable to the electron-phonon interaction. We also find that a dynamical decoupling effect between the QD and its environment plays a large role in suppressing multi-photon emission, and we demonstrate how this effect can be modelled by using a time-dependent and time-convolutionless quantum master equation which incorporates non-Markovian effects associated with the pulse. These findings have implications on both the theoretical understanding of pulsed QD light-matter interactions, as well as on how SPSs can be optimized.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>While poverty is often measured and understood as a comparison of income or lack of material goods, literature reveals the importance in understanding intangible elements of one’s well-being, such as happiness, self-esteem and social inclusion. However, considering the negative perceptions and stigma commonly attributed to poverty and other marginalized populations, such elements of well-being can be extremely difficult to attain (Chase &amp; Walker, 2012; Porr &amp; Olson, 2012). This often results in social isolation and exclusion from society, stemming from negative emotions of embarrassment, guilt and shame (Chase &amp; Walker, 2012). The lack of emotional and material support creates further challenges for those experiencing poverty, such as navigating social services, obtaining information and receiving positive motivation (Collins, 2005; Chase &amp; Walker, 2012). Given these challenges, it is important that poverty is understood through different lenses, not solely in regard to monetary factors. &#xD;
&#xD;
This study focuses on the relationship between poverty and social inclusion in the context of a small municipality. Specifically, this research explores poverty stigmatization in the Municipality of Port Hope and how the non-profit organization, Green Wood Coalition, tackles poverty stigma in a small town and incorporates social inclusion in their program modelling. In order to address the research question and objectives of this research, a qualitative mixed-methods research approach was employed. This approach included: a literature review to establish gaps in the literature and understand the main themes of this research; semi-structure interviews and a focus group to gain a deeper understanding of key informants’ perspectives of social stigmatization and poverty in small towns; and a single exploratory case study of Green Wood Coalition (GWC) that applies themes established from the literature to real life practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
Understanding how intangible elements of life can affect one’s well-being is important from a policy and an urban planning perspective. Orthodox physical planning tends to primarily consider physical space and the built environment, rather than the people within it (Davidoff, 1965). Over the years of planning history, there have been well-intentioned planning movements that attempted to combat social inequity and urban dysfunction; however these movements and theories often resulted in further social inequity. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, City Beautiful started to take shape (Reece, 2018). This movement attempted to overcome social ills throughout the urban core through way of physical determinism. If done effectively, it was believed that ordered design and aesthetically pleasing environments could tame the social disorder of cities. Although well-intentioned, this movement was largely undemocratic and thus resulted in inequitable outcomes (Reece, 2018). Those who were already experiencing financial difficulty was not relieved of their burdens, but rather pushed further to the margins (Reece, 2018). It is time “traditional planning” routinely incorporated social activism in conjunction with physical determinism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study seeks to explain the failure of the Kurdish Opening in Turkey. I theorize that an important, hitherto largely ignored, factor in explaining this failure is the state’s policy of territorial control, which has existed in parallel to the reform processes and peace talks. More specifically, I argue that territorial control is a key factor in explaining why minority policy reform failed to achieve its goals and hence, violence returned. For this analysis, I develop a typology of territorial control, which juxtaposes the lived experiences of people living alongside five forms of territorial control, identified as: expulsion and expropriation, securitization, border control, administrative control (right-sizing and gerrymandering) and nationalizing the landscape. My observation and documentation of the mechanisms and experiences of territorial control and the peace process are based on semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation during extensive fieldwork in conflict-ridden borderlands. This study reveals that the successes and failures of state strategy toward a minority population cannot be understood without an analysis of both state policies and people’s experiences. This study achieves a unique perspective that incorporates people’s perceptions and sentiments with theoretical and analytical premises.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In response to splintering streetscapes and in order to remain relevant amidst “smart cities” and “urban big data”, Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) have moved away from clipboards and ledgers, to become early adopters of smarter urban technologies. Initially, BIAs began using social media metrics, pedestrian counters, closed-circuit television and i-beacons to collect data, demonstrate return on investment, and engage in their own corporate storytelling. Increasingly today, BIAs use geospatial applications and platforms to better monitor, manage and control the city and its assets. While much smaller in scope and aim than smart city ventures, these forms of entrepreneurial and platform urbanism are presented as ways of updating and automating BIA practices, making their mandates manageable, and promoting accountability across stakeholders. With seemingly mundane aims, how are these accountability relations enacted on the ground, and what do they do? My dissertation combines extensive document collection, conference ethnography, along with interviews and work-shadowing data in order to trace the mobility and use of geospatial applications and platforms by BIAs in Toronto and Vancouver. Focused on how BIAs created and manage value, and make their mandates doable, I illustrate how these technologies render, (ac)count for, police and govern urban spaces and populations. Cases of the actually existing smart city or ordinary smart city I contend these valuation devices, help transform matters of concern into matters of fact. I argue that these technologies not only make the spaces and materials of the city countable, but by extension, they also hold the users and uses of space to account. Data and the surrounding tellable stories promote relations of visibility and accountability that articulate and delegate work, stabilize knowledge claims and promote ontological politics that strengthens the authority of BIAs over the urban landscape.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The fine-scale physical response of soils to thaw, ice content and soil water conditions in the High Arctic are poorly understood. This thesis introduces the topic and identifies knowledge gaps in the literature and secondly, addresses these gaps through the investigation of the spatiotemporal relationship between ground surface vertical displacement (GSVD) and active layer water level conditions during the summer thaw season at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory, Nunavut. GSVD and water level were monitored simultaneously at five measurement stations consisting of a new inclinometer system (accuracy ±0.15 mm) and a shallow subsurface well logged with pressure transducers. Diel cyclicity in both GSVD (± 0.5 mm) and water level (± 0.2 m) was present at two of the stations and synoptic scale variability characterized the others. The records indicate a close association between GSVD and water level at multiple short-term time scales. Active layer soil physics appear to be controlled by soil water content on both synoptic and diel timescales. Ground ice thaw appeared to be the primary source of water within the diel systems, while synoptic variability was associated with rainfall events. The diel systems were inferred to be primarily driven by large-scale (&gt;258 m2) upslope contributing areas which facilitated diel water level and GSVD fluctuations due to the amplification of thaw-derived water accumulation downslope. These results improve our knowledge of the physical response of High Arctic soils to changes in soil water conditions and active layer thaw, critical for future landscape stability monitoring and geohazard prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

However, further progress is limited by a lack of understanding of the biological processes that drive this disease. This understanding will be crucial for developing effective targeted therapies. The oncogenic transcription factor TCF3-PBX1 is expressed in 5% of ALL cases consequent to a somatic chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 1 and 19. It is broadly accepted that TCF3-PBX1 acts as a transcriptional activator resulting in dysregulated proliferation, survival and/or differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Studies have implicated the histone acetyltransferase p300 as an important player in mediating these transcriptional effects. However, the particular binding sites of TCF3-PBX1 and the genes affected have not been identified. We hypothesized that TCF3-PBX1 binds to B-lymphopoietic cis-regulatory regions, such as enhancers and promoters, via the PBX1 homeodomain and affects gene transcription by recruiting p300 in a manner that leads to leukemogenesis. Through the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), this project identified over 3500 genomic regions where TCF3-PBX1 binds in a t(1;19)-bearing, ALL-derived cell line that expresses endogenous TCF3-PBX1. Most binding sites have characteristics associated with cis-regulatory elements, such as particular histone modifications, and are commonly occupied by B-lymphopoietic transcription factors and PBX family members. TCF3-PBX1 additionally recruits p300 to novel sites, which plays a role in increasing the expression of nearby genes. One hundred and sixty-three genes had nearby TCF3-PBX1 binding sites and were differentially expressed (determined using RNA-sequencing) upon short-hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of TCF3-PBX1 in two cell lines, suggesting that they are direct transcriptional targets of TCF3-PBX1. Fifty-eight of these genes were additionally found to be differentially expressed between primary, patient-derived ALL samples that likely do, versus do not, harbor the t(1;19) translocation. Together, these results support our hypothesis described above and address the need to identify the transcriptional targets of the TCF3-PBX1 fusion oncoprotein. These target genes and their associated cellular pathways will inform future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TCF3-PBX1 disturbs lymphoid development in ALL and will contribute to the eventual development of novel treatments that target these mechanisms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent behaviour that serves many functions, but is associated with increased distress, impairment, and risk of death by suicide (Andover, Morris, Wren, &amp; Bruzzese, 2012; Burke, Hamilton, Cohen, Stange, &amp; Alloy, 2016). The overall goal of the current project was to make meaningful theoretical and applied contributions for our current understanding and treatment of NSSI. The present research first investigated potential causal mechanisms by which parental invalidation, a potential familial risk factor for NSSI, may lead to engagement in this maladaptive behaviour. Results of Study 1 supported the existence of two serial mediation mechanisms whereby childhood emotional invalidation by parents leads to increased engagement in NSSI: (a) through increased difficulties in emotion regulation and negative urgency impulsivity, and (b) through increased self-criticism and depressive symptoms. Study 2 aimed to validate the retrospective, self-report measure of parental invalidation used in Study 1 (the Invalidating Childhood Environment Scale) by examining its test-retest reliability, and concurrently gathering retrospective sibling-report data. Results supported the reliability and validity of this measure, and thus its use in the current and future research. The goal of Study 3 was to investigate the effectiveness of two interventions designed to help individuals resist their self-critical thoughts, and thereby interrupt the second NSSI mechanism identified in Study 1. It was hypothesized that these interventions would lead to reduced NSSI engagement and associated depressive symptoms. The interventions were not found to be effective in this case, as individuals in both the control and intervention conditions showed significant reductions in both NSSI engagement and depressive symptoms across the study interval. Theoretical implications, practical applications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Real-time, accurate sensing promoted by analytical sensors is extremely important for advances in drug discovery, disease diagnosis and for studying biological systems. In particular, label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sensing, promoted by metallic nanostructures which can couple incident light with free electrons in the metal layer, have been widely used commercially. However, current commercial SPR systems suffer from high cost, low-throughput and have a high footprint making them unusable for point-of care applications. In this dissertation, a new SPR biosensor based on plasmonic crossed surface relief gratings (CSRGs) is demonstrated. Miniaturized optical biosensing platforms based on CSRGs and nanohole arrays (NHAs) are employed for sensing of molecular interactions in a quantitative manner. The CSRGs- and NHAs- based SPR devices measure the transmission of the normally incident light with the help of a collinear optical setup consisting of off-the-shelf electronics and optical components. The devices allow for the nanomolar detection limit of molecules in analyte-analyte binding kinetic assays and allow for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological matrices, in clinically relevant concentrations. Additionally, newly developed nanofabrication method involving template-stripping of CSRGs enable the production of large-area metallic nanogratings in an inexpensive and high-throughput fashion, allowing for chemical sensing of contaminant via surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The work presented in this dissertation can give rise to novel miniaturized and portable sensing and biosensing platform with improved performance and multi-disciplinary applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this report we study the modelling of simple mechanical systems evolving on trivial principal bundles, specifically \emph{locomotion} systems with nonholonomic constraints. &#xD;
&#xD;
We show how we can model motion via group actions on configuration manifolds and assess the relationship between the constraints (and constrained variables) and the variables that physically induce motion on the vehicle by studying principal bundles.&#xD;
	&#xD;
With knowledge of the controllability (using the Lie algebra rank condition) of this formulation of a constrained simple mechanical system, we proceed to outlining a methodology to design a universal control algorithm for constrained mechanical systems using the method of virtual surfaces (or potential functions).&#xD;
&#xD;
Lastly, we design a set of virtual surfaces to make a rolling disk (arguably the simplest practical nonholonomic system) stabilise to a point, track a path, and avoid a sequence of obstacles in the plane.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Levels of corruption in Lebanon are at an all-time high. According to the Transparency International Index, Lebanon ranks 143rd out of 180 in level of corruption (with 180 being the worst). The citizens are also disenchanted with the high levels of political corruption. A survey by Transparency International found that 67% of individuals though that “most” or “all” individuals working in the public sector are corrupt. Clearly, corruption is a pervasive problem in Lebanon. This thesis is about political corruption and how it undermines the structure of government, the rule of law, and the socio-cultural landscape in the Republic of Lebanon. Detailed research on how the rule of law is undermined by corruption is lacking, particularly in the literature about Lebanon. &#xD;
Through nine in-depth interviews with members of the political elite, as well as high-ranking legal and government-related figures, I aim to understand how corruption undermines the societal institutions such as government and law in Lebanon and how, in turn, this impacts citizen interaction with these institutions. The results can be divided into two sections. The first result section addresses how the political elites use their position to engage in corruption and weaken the institution of government. This chapter also addresses how corruption influences citizens’ relationships with government. There are six key themes in this chapter: political self-interest, nepotism, clientelism, sectarianism, transparency, and distrust of government. The second result section analyses how the legal system is manipulated by the political elites to engage in corrupt behaviours, and how this manipulation renders legal institutions weak and inefficient. This chapter addresses how corruption undermines the rule of law, particularly in the eyes of the population. Finally, the thesis ends with a discussion of how all these themes intersect across politics and law.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: There is variance in a healthy population, but it is poorly characterized and understood. Variations can come from common factors like demographics, experience of early life stress (ELS), physiological factors and personality dimensions. Characterizing the heterogeneity in a non-clinical sample is important to (1) understand what “normal” is; (2) better understand the differences between healthy and pathology and; (3) identify biomarkers of vulnerability and resilience.&#xD;
Methods: 253 healthy controls from three CAN-BIND cohorts were assessed. Demographic data, sleep quality, personality dimensions and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) were collected and analyzed.&#xD;
Results: Those who experienced ELS had significantly different sleep duration, quality and efficiency compared to those who did not experience ELS. Those who experienced emotional neglect were more likely to score higher on the neurotic dimension. Lastly, females are more likely to be neurotic and agreeable compared to males. Our meta-analysis found that rs-FC of the default mode network (DMN) follows an inverse U-shape where it is strongest in adulthood and weakest in children and elderly. Cognitive function is positively correlated with DMN rs-FC. Females exhibit stronger intra-network connectivity compared to males. In the CAN-BIND cohorts, we found that there are sex and age differences with seeds in all six resting-state networks of interest. All five personality dimensions exhibited sex differences in rs-FC with seeds in the DMN, fronto-parietal, salience, meso-paralimbic networks. The presence of ELS impacted rs-FC in all personality dimensions and measures of sleep quality with seeds in all six of the resting-state networks. Lastly, children born from gestations complicated from preeclampsia exhibit altered rs-FC with the bilateral amygdalae and medial prefrontal cortex – offering evidence that in utero ELS also impact neural correlates.&#xD;
Conclusion: The impact of our results is as follows: (1) there is natural variance in a “normal” population; (2) to parse out true clinical findings, researchers must control for our results and cannot assume that healthy controls are homogeneous and; (3) identification of vulnerability and resilient biomarkers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The last decade has witnessed a growing demand for precise positioning in many applications such as autonomous car navigation and precision agriculture. Precise positioning can be obtained from the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) through either differential techniques or precise point positioning (PPP). PPP is currently favored over differential GNSS because it provides a global solution without the need for local reference stations. Nevertheless, PPP must address the error sources that are canceled in differential GNSS, and hence, it requires a longer time to converge. Therefore, employing PPP for land vehicles would be challenging due to frequent signal degradation and blockage. Integrating PPP with an inertial navigation system (INS) can solve the solution continuity issue; however, the INS solution drifts over time which can result in losing the desired accuracy. The implementation of a reliable PPP/INS system that can preserve the required accuracy is not a trivial task, especially with financial and computational cost constraints.&#xD;
In this work, two PPP/INS systems were developed. The first system integrates the single-frequency (SF) PPP measurements from a low-cost GNSS receiver with low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors. The purpose of this system is to provide a reliable, low-cost navigation solution for land vehicles with sub-meter level accuracy. The system was evaluated through two road tests where it could maintain sub-meter position accuracy with short GNSS outages and reliable performance with long-term outages. The second system integrates the dual- frequency (DF) PPP with the Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS) for car lane-level navigation. The high-precision needed in lane-level positioning can be achieved by integrating DF-PPP with high-end INS. Since high-end INS are expensive, this work proposed the use of RISS instead of the traditional INS. RISS uses only one gyroscope and two accelerometers which can contribute to saving more than half the cost of a high-end INS. The proposed DF-PPP/RISS system was tested through three road tests that included highway driving under several overpasses, and the system was able to maintain horizontal position errors less than 50 cm. The developed PPP/INS systems are expected to play an essential role in the different applications of land vehicle navigation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>MALDI imaging mass spectrometry is an attractive technique for the discovery of disease biomarkers from surgically removed tissue sections.  It can provide spatial resolution and relative abundance of a wide range of biomolecules across the tissue surface.  While the technology has advanced considerably in the past decade it suffers from several drawbacks including a limited percentage of biomolecules that can be imaged, complex sample handing steps lead to loss of/or distortion of analytes, and the significant amount of time between sample harvest and analysis.  To address the shortcomings of cumbersome sample preparation associated with tissue analysis, not limited to sectioning of the tissue, embedding samples, and storage we explore the development of patterned surfaces able to obtain a chemical profile of tissue via direct contact imprinting. This can yield spatial chemical information about imprinted tissue histopathology without the need for embedding, sectioning, or storage. Multiple patterned surfaces have been explored, including: C-18 and poly-lysine functionalized, laser micromachined surface energy traps (SETs), micro-biopsy needle arrays and micro-solvent extraction arrays. Micro-solvent extraction arrays have been shown to successfully image tissue surrogates and preliminary results show the ability to extract prognostic tissue material and provide accurate molecular mapping of tissue samples. Solvent micro-extraction arrays are fabricated using oleophobic coatings with SETs, also known as micro-patches, arrayed by plasma etching allowing for droplets of analytes to be confined in spatially resolved patches. Based on these findings, surface stamping and MALDI analysis can be implemented as a powerful tool for determining spatial distribution of biomarkers in vivo. This may greatly reduce analysis time and the loss/distortion of potential biomarkers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Peace River region of Alberta, Canada is a highly active landslide area characterized by creeping landslides in weak lacustrine clays and silts.  Much of the infrastructure for the region is built upon historical landslides and marginally stable slopes.  Case studies of two landslides being selectively stabilized by pile walls in the Peace River region were conducted to investigate the relationship between the continued deformation of the downslope landslide material and the structural response of the pile walls.  Two remote camera configurations were implemented, a photogrammetry technique at the first site and a two-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) technique at the second site, to investigate the ability to use image based monitoring as a method of measuring large scale deformations downslope of these pile walls.  The first study investigates a site that initially consisted of a cantilevered spaced pile wall that no longer sufficiently stabilized the landslide feature impacting a highway.  A new, significantly larger tied-back tangent pile wall was constructed to address the ongoing landslide activity.  Two years of post-construction monitoring have indicated excellent performance of the wall, and negligible deformations of landslide material.  Due to the limited landslide movement, it was not possible to verify the photogrammetry monitoring technique.  The second study examines a different landslide feature impacting a highway that was selectively stabilized with a pile wall.  Three years of monitoring at this site indicates pile wall deformations up to 30 mm, and increases in ground anchor tie-back load of approximately 10%.  Downslope landslide movements were measured with a high temporal resolution two-dimensional DIC technique using remote camera images.  Deformation measurements ranging from 300 mm at a distance of 25 m downslope of the wall up to 1600 mm at a distance of 50 m downslope of the wall were recorded.  Continued long term monitoring of these of selective stabilization walls will be important in assessing the service life of current pile walls and guiding efficient design of future pile walls.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A primary objective of optical system design is to satisfy the ever-increasing capacity demand for communication services. Fulfilling this target by increasing the cardinality of modulation formats is at the expense of a reduced system tolerance to transmission impairments with the capacity ultimately limited by Kerr fiber nonlinearities. The research presented in this thesis focuses on exploring solutions to fulfill the demand for increased capacity and studying advanced techniques for modelling and characterizing systems, predicting performance, and estimating critical parameters.&#xD;
The thesis investigates the quantification of the impact of fiber nonlinearities on the spectral broadening denoted as the spectral edge power (SEP) (‎Chapter 2). The implications of intra- and inter-channel nonlinearities for 224 Gb/s single-channel and 256 Gb/s 9-channel dual polarization 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (DP 16-QAM) systems are quantified in terms of SEP. The experimental results demonstrate that the launch power that minimizes the bit error ratio and SEP coincides.&#xD;
The research utilizes spectral and power efficient multi-dimensional modulation formats, which provide the capability to fine-tune the spectral efficiency (‎Chapter 3). The performance of the four-dimensional set-partitioning (SP) 128-QAM is experimentally investigated. The results demonstrate improvements of 5.3% and 8.2% in the information rates for the 256 Gb/s SP 128-QAM compared to the DP 16-QAM at the same bit rate and for transmission over 2100 km and 2700 km, respectively.&#xD;
The thesis studies the estimation of the nonlinear signal-to-noise ratio (SNRnl) using artificial neural networks (‎Chapter 4). The accuracy of the estimation procedure is verified for a 34.5 Gbaud DP 16-QAM signal with a maximum normalized root-mean-square error of 0.37% for estimating SNRnl in simulation, and less than 0.25 dB deviation from the true SNRnl for estimates obtained with varying fiber length and launch power in experiments.&#xD;
The research explores the identification of the shaping distribution of rate-adaptive transmission systems using the estimates of SNRnl and taking advantage of the unique properties of nonlinear interference noise (‎Chapter 5). The identification results exhibit success rates of higher than 96% and 79% for two groups of five shaping distributions corresponding to bit rate granularities of 25 Gb/s and 12.5 Gb/s, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis documents the 2018 removals of the John A. Macdonald statue in Victoria, British Columbia and the Edward Cornwallis statue in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Writings on memory by Maurice Halbwachs and Pierre Nora form the central theoretical basis of the thesis. These authors have examined memory as a group-based phenomenon, as well as the connection between collective memory and physical objects such as statues. They have also addressed the issue of presentism, how our interpretation of the past is shaped by present concerns. The destruction of cultural sites in times of social change, which results in the vulnerability of memory tied to these sites, is also explored. Portraits are examined as a category of art that is especially vulnerable to targeted destruction. The Balkan Conflicts of the 1990s, the end of communism in Eastern Europe, and the Spanish colonization of the Americas provide examples of cultural destruction where collective memory has been targeted, contested or lost. &#xD;
	This thesis argues that the Macdonald and Cornwallis statue removals are connected to a shift in Canadian collective memories towards acknowledging the perspectives of Indigenous peoples. Macdonald and Cornwallis traditionally have been remembered favourably as founders of Canada and Halifax, respectively. In contrast, many Indigenous people view Macdonald primarily as an architect of residential schools, and see Cornwallis in the context of his scalping proclamations against the Mi’kmaq during his governorship of Nova Scotia. The historical basis for the conflicting memories of each man, and the history of each statue’s commission, raising, and more recent removal are examined. Further insight into the Canadian public’s perspectives regarding the commemoration of these figures, and the removal of their statues, is provided by a review of public opinion polling.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the concept of key competencies is highlighted as the emphasis and guideline: the pursuit of education should be combined with knowledge, skills, emotional attitude, cultural awareness, and morality, etc., students’ affective domain in Chinese English literacy education starts to gain increasing attention.&#xD;
Research on first language (L1) reading reveals that reading attitude influences reading skills (Morgan &amp; Fuchs, 2007) and strongly affects reading proficiency (McKenna &amp; Kear, 1990). However, most of the current views of reading attitude are shaped by the research on L1 learners, leaving the field of  Second Language (L2) reading attitude an unexplored area (Kim, 2016; Lee &amp; Schallert, 2014). Hence, the present study investigated English language learners’ English reading attitude and its relation to English reading proficiency within the context of Chinese senior high schools. &#xD;
Three hundred and ninety-eight Chinese 11th grade students from three senior high schools in Guangzhou completed an English reading attitude questionnaire. Scores from their English reading comprehension test were collected to indicate their English reading proficiency. Data was quantitatively analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, correlation, multiple regression, and t-test. &#xD;
Results showed that while students had strong beliefs concerning the values and usefulness from English reading, they also had strong negative emotions towards English reading. Of the six factors displayed to measure L2 reading attitude in this study, Negative Affect and Self-assessment significantly contributed to L2 reading proficiency (p &lt; .05). With regard to the differences in how students perceive English reading between high-achievers and low-achievers, significant differences were found in Cognitive Attitude, Negative Affect, Conative Attitude and Self-assessment. Several contributing factors were confirmed to predict English reading attitude, including Reading Frequency, Teachers’ Encouragement, Parents’ Encouragement, and Gender. More specifically, how often students read English books for pleasure was a strong predictor of L2 reading attitude.&#xD;
 This study adds to the rapidly expanding field of the affective components of L2 reading development in China, and contributes to existing knowledge of L2 reading attitude and its relation to L2 reading proficiency by addressing the research gap with high school participants in mainland Chinese educational context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ischemic stroke is one of the most prevalent, devastating and therapeutically challenging medical conditions. Following brain ischemia, failure of the Na+/K+ ATPase is linked with a massive cationic influx through an unidentified channel that drives spreading depolarization (SD). With focal stroke, SD can devastate neurons in the ischemic core as well as recur and expand the affected area for hours and even days after the initial incident. Despite the critical role of SD in ischemic brain pathophysiology, the link between Na+/K+ ATPase failure and the opening of the channel that drives SD onset is unclear.&#xD;
This study proposes that an SD activator (SDa) is released by metabolically stressed gray matter and drives SD genesis. We hypothesize that an unidentified SDa can be identified, is likely not glutamate and may originate from microglia. The role of glutamate in inducing SD was evaluated to determine if glutamate could be the SDa. Oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced SD in live brain slices was shown to persist treatment with glutamate receptor antagonists kynurenate and MK-801, although a delay in SD onset was observed. Glutamate application to live brain slices also showed that it did not initiate SD, but in some slices, glutamate promoted a slower localized signal spread surrounding the weight securing the slice. Microglia were also investigated as a source of the SDa; however, blockade of the channel KCa3.1 with TRAM-34, as well as blockade of M1 microglial activation with minocycline did not significantly affect SD initiation. Finally, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was utilized to characterize superfusate from brain slices that had undergone SD, while matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) was used to analyze SD-related compounds in fresh frozen brain slices. Size exclusion HPLC identified a ~2 kDa peak that was associated with SD and may contain an SDa. MALDI-IMS analysis of brain slices exposed to OGD revealed three compounds (m/z 593, m/z 610 and m/z 620) that are associated with SD genesis and propagation. Further characterization may yield a novel therapeutic target to mitigate neural damage during acute brain ischemia.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Syntactic priming refers to the phenomenon in which people tend to produce a sentence structure that they have previously encountered. Syntactic priming research, taken as a useful tool for probing into bilingual syntactic representations and processes, has become a focus of psycholinguistics since the 21st century. However, there is insufficient research on second language learners who speak distant languages and there are no peer-reviewed studies comparing English-English syntactic priming with Chinese-English priming. Also, only a few syntactic priming studies target the high-school population. To address these gaps, this study investigated within-language (English-English) and between-languages (Chinese-English) syntactic priming on high school students. The primary aims are to understand Chinese high school English learners’ bilingual representation, and shed light on syntactic priming research in terms of how different factors influence the occurrence of priming effects. Additionally, this study provides implications for second language acquisition from the perspective of psycholinguistics. Specifically, this study examines whether priming occurs on the high-school population and how it is affected by priming languages and language proficiency. The research design adopted a typical paradigm for syntactic priming research — the Sentence Completion Task (Pickering &amp; Branigan, 1998). Sixty high school students participated in the experiment. Half of the students were considered low English proficient and half were considered high. Participants were asked to complete a sentence completion task and a questionnaire about their background information. The data analysis involved mixed ANOVA and t-tests. &#xD;
The results indicated that the types of priming structures, L2 proficiency, and priming languages interactively influenced the magnitude of syntactic priming effects. Both double objects and prepositional objects showed priming effects. Overall, the effects in the high proficiency group were larger than those in the low proficiency group; the within-language effects were also larger than the between-languages ones. &#xD;
    The results indicated that the low proficiency participants remained at the stage of item-specific representation in L2; L2 representation of the high proficiency participants has become abstract but still separate from L1. The findings provide some evidence in support of the developmental view of the syntactic representation. Findings also have implications for theory and practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Since news about Day Zero in Cape Town captured public attention, water scarcity in South Africa has become a widely known problem. However, the country has been impacted by similar issues for decades. This is especially true for the Sekhukhune District Municipality, where the prominence of mining and poor water governance have negatively impacted waterscapes, limiting the availability and quality of water for local communities. In this study, political ecology is applied as a framework to observe the power dynamics among water governance stakeholders. Methods used include document analysis, semi-structured interviews and field observations.&#xD;
This research explores the evolution and implementation of water policies in South Africa before assessing the role of stakeholders in Sekhukhune’s water governance structures. It continues by discussing bulk water infrastructure and the provision of water services to local communities where the significant influence of mining companies is uncovered. Indeed, through major investments to infrastructure projects, mining companies secure continued access to water resources for their operations. Despite this, it becomes clear that many local communities, from those living next to large infrastructure projects to those living near mining operations, have not benefited from these investments and are currently contesting the lack of water services.&#xD;
This study also addresses how host communities around mining operations have been directly impacted by relocations, migrations and the loss of livelihoods, and the link this has had to the availability and quality of water. There have been significant obstacles for communities who have attempted to express their grievances in various ways. Specifically, there is some evidence to suggest there is collusion or corruption between government representatives, traditional leaders and mining companies that negatively affects communities.&#xD;
Ultimately, it is evident that the role of communities as stakeholders in water governance structures is undervalued. Despite this, some interesting success stories are highlighted that demonstrate how communities have developed synergies and strategies of their own to apply pressure, resulting in notable shifts in power structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Designers go through much trial and error and troubleshooting with stubborn materials and conceptual structures just to get to a working prototype. Eventually, these efforts converge around uncovering successful use-cases and positive narratives aimed at rousing investment and culminate in the creation of an ecosystem supporting other complimentary devices. From the micro-shaping efforts of the R&amp;D lab, to the macro-shaping forces of technology summits, expos, and conferences where these narratives are fashioned, user-and-device are caught in between and co-configured. Over time, designs and documentation are continually adjusted with varying user needs and requirements, exerting upward pressure on design efforts, fueling the insight that no clear distinction between using and designing a technology can be made. A recent technology has the potential to make this reciprocal relation more unambiguous than ever before. Wearable technologies are devices that use sensors to measure and record different kinds of user actions – and how people are using (and not using) the device is crucial for its ongoing development and the next iteration.&#xD;
With a combination of ethnography, (post)phenomenology, SCOT and ANT, this dissertation explores three moments shaping what wearables are/are for: a problem-solving episode in the development of a wearable device, the building of wearable constituencies, and the work of distilling both those efforts into a stable, communicable and marketable message. In doing so, I aim to bring renewed attention to what has been called “the double movement of ontological design” – the idea that we design our world and the world designs us back. I introduce what I call the duality of design to reflect these ever-present co-constitutive forces. The term also calls for reflexive attention to the role of the observer-participant in this relation, and along the way, I uncover a pattern common to all the constitutive activities being described, what I term quiring. Adding reflexive and ethnomethodological components to analyzing the building of sociotechnical frames offers important opportunities for reconceptualizing our relationship with the technologies we use, design and study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) are a composite system which may be able to meet the demands of both new and existing infrastructures. Due to its constituents’ environmental impact, natural alternatives are becoming increasingly popular; however, their longevity still needs to be assessed prior to its use in civil infrastructure. In this thesis, the long-term performance and durability of natural fibres (flax) and resins (epoxidized pine oil (EPO) and furfuryl alcohol (FA)) were investigated, using 729 tension coupons and 36 structural insulated panels (SIP). Four phenomena were studied: wet-dry cycling, freeze-thaw cycling, cold temperature testing and mechanical fatigue testing. Flax-FRP (FFRP) exposed to 12 wet-dry cycles experienced maximum reductions of 12% and 19% in tensile strength and modulus, respectively, due to delamination at the fibre-resin interface. FFRP exposed to 300 freeze-thaw cycles experienced maximum reductions of 8% and 10% in tensile strength and modulus, respectively, due to delamination at the fibre-resin interface and damage within the fibres. In both cases, conventional epoxy and EPO underwent hydrolysis, and exhibited a decreased and increased glass transition temperature, respectively. To mitigate damage, flax was treated to reduce moisture absorption and improve fibre-resin bond, although similar deterioration was observed post-conditioning. Conversely, conventional glass-FRP showed no deterioration. Furthermore, FFRP tested at cold temperatures resulted in a 20% increase in stiffness, specifically the slope of the second linear phase of its bi-linear stress-strain response. FFRP-skinned SIPs tested at cold temperatures showed a 28% increase in capacity under flexural load; however, there was no impact on the load-deflection response within serviceability limits. Finally, FA-based carbon-FRP (CFRP) was tested in tension-tension fatigue. Based on a 2,000,000 fatigue life, the ASTM model predicted an allowable stress amplitude of 59% and the Whitworth model predicted a modulus retention of 65%. Conventional epoxy-CFRP had a predicted modulus retention of 80%. Through this study, it is clear that FFRP with a higher FVF will be more resilient against cyclic environmental exposure than those with fibre treatment; and, its performance will improve in cold climates. Furthermore, FA-CFRP’s fatigue performance is worst than epoxy-CFRP; however, this trade-off may be beneficial for its chemical resistance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Humans are largely visual animals and require that images of objects of interest must be held steadily on the fovea, a region on the retina that allows for high visual acuity. In order to maintain gaze on objects in the environments, humans must move their eyes to keep the object centered on the fovea using saccades, rapid eye movements that redirect the line of sight to a peripheral target, and smooth pursuit, which allow for tracking of low-velocity objects moving within the environment. When objects are fast or unpredictable, the brain coordinates the execution of both pursuit and saccades to catch-up to the target. Deciding to trigger a catch-up saccade during pursuit influences the quality of visual input. This unconscious decision is a trade-off between tolerating being off target when no saccade is triggered or a transient loss of vision during the saccade as the eye moves rapidly. Although catch-up saccades have been extensively investigated, it remains unclear how the trigger decision is made by the brain. de Brouwer et al (2002) demonstrated that catch-up saccades were less likely to occur when the expected time to contact a target using pursuit alone is between 40 and 180ms into the future, referred to as the smooth zone. More recently, we proposed a model (Coutinho et al., 2018) that relies on a probabilistic estimation of predicted future position error (PEpred). Informed by model predictions, we hypothesized that saccade trigger time length and variability will increase when pre-saccadic predicted errors are small or visual uncertainty is high (using a blurred target). Data collected from human participants performing a double step-ramp task showed that large pre-saccadic PEpred (&gt;10deg) produced fast reacting saccades regardless of the level of uncertainty while saccade trigger times preceded by small PEpred (&lt;10deg) were significantly modulated by high uncertainty. The data supports our hypothesized role of PEpred in deciding when to trigger a catch-up saccade during smooth pursuit and indicates a common predictive decision process that governs motor coordination of eye movements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the history of the Stratford Festival, a theatre festival founded in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, in 1953, at local, national, and transnational levels.  Through the case study of the festival, this dissertation investigates the intersection of and negotiation between culture and commerce in postwar Canada.  This dissertation analyzes nationalism and tourism as concurrent and symbiotic processes in order to understand how identity and economics are negotiated in Canadian cultural industries.  Echoing Vera Zolberg’s expression on the appeal of American museums, this dissertation argues that historically the Stratford Festival has attempted to function as “an elite experience for everyone.”  The theatre’s negotiation of a mass culture of nationalism, on the one hand, and its elite cultural status on the other, has been integral to the festival’s commercial success and attraction of tourists since its founding.  In studying the Stratford Festival in this context of local, national, and transnational influences and tensions, this dissertation contributes to an understanding of Canadian cultural nationalism and tourism, and engages with an emerging literature that addresses the nature of Canadian culture and the resilience of Britishness as a factor in Canadian identity.  This work challenges the cultural categorization of the festival by positioning it as both an elite institution and one striving for mass appeal, and thus complicates hierarchies of culture.  This dissertation is structured around thematic explorations of the theatre’s history: its founding, nationalist controversies over hiring British talent, the performance of Stratford as a tourist destination, public and private funding of the festival, and its national and international touring activities beyond Stratford.  Ultimately this dissertation argues that the Stratford Festival’s success comes from balancing its seemingly divergent identities, but its difficulties also emerged as it operated within the liminal space between classical/commercial, national/transnational, and Canadian/Britishness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of non-communicable disease and pre-mature death worldwide. Waist circumference (WC) is a measure of abdominal adiposity that is strongly related to both CVD and all-cause mortality. However, WC is not routinely measured in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
Predicting which individuals will develop disease is a fundamental aspect to modern healthcare. To date, there is limited research examining whether adding WC to current risk prediction models will improve how well the model identifies individuals at risk for future disease. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate whether the addition of WC improves CVD and all-cause mortality risk prediction compared to current models.&#xD;
&#xD;
We analyzed data from 34,377 men and 9,477 women who completed a baseline examination at the Cooper Clinic (Dallas, TX) during 1977 – 2003 and enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS). Participants were followed until mortality or December 31st, 2003. WC was measured at the level of the umbilicus and other health risk factors including blood pressure, blood lipids, smoking, and diabetes were collected using standardized methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our primary finding was that the addition of WC does not improve risk prediction for fatal CVD, non-fatal CVD and all-cause mortality. This observation remained consistent across several statistical strategies to assess model performance. However, WC was significantly associated with the outcomes beyond common clinical risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
The findings of this thesis demonstrate that although WC is significantly associated with pre-mature death, adding WC to established risk prediction models does not improve how well the model is able to identify which individuals are at increased risk for future disease.</dcterms:abstract>
