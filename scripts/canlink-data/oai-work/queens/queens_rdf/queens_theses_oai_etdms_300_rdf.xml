      <dcterms:abstract>Bythotrephes longimanus, a predatory exotic cladoceran, has spread rapidly to numerous lakes through the Laurentian Great Lakes region of Ontario and North America.  Post-invaded lakes are known to have reduced zooplankton species richness, biomass and altered community structure. Bythotrephes may also affect the diet and trophic position of macroinvertebrate predators and prey species for fish (e.g., Mysis relicta).  However, the effects of this species in altering higher trophic levels remain largely unexamined.  Using a combined approach of stable isotope (d13C and d15N) and THg analysis, the trophic position of Bythotrephes in two invaded lakes was investigated.  Based on d15N values, Bythotrephes shared a similar trophic position to native macroinvertebrate predators (9 and 7‰ for Peninsula and Harp lakes, respectively).  Using a mixing model and stomach content analysis we show that, despite low and patchy lake abundance, Bythotrephes may be a key prey item to fish and has approximate dietary contributions similar to native prey items, such as zooplankton, Chaoborus and Mysis.  In both lakes, Hg conformed to predicted biomagnification trends as indicated by 15N.  When Bythotrephes invades lakes with native macroinvertebrate predators, it inserts itself into the same trophic position and does not have major effects on food web length.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mathematical modeling helps researchers to understand the transport and kinetic  phenomena within fuel cells and their effects on fuel cell performance that may not be evident from experimental work.  In this thesis, a 2-D steady-state cathode model of a proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is developed. The kinetics of the cathode half-reaction were investigated, specifically the reaction order with respect to oxygen concentration.  It is unknown whether this reaction order is one or one half. First- and half-order reaction models were simulated and their influence on the predicted fuel cell performance was examined.  At low overpotentials near 0.3 V, the half-order model predicted smaller current densities (approximately half that of the first-order model).  At higher overpotentials above 0.5 V, the predicted current density of the half-order model is slightly higher than that of the first-order model.  The effect of oxygen concentration at the channel/porous transport layer boundary was also simulated and it was shown the predicted current density of the first-order model experienced a larger decrease (~10-15% difference at low overpotentials) than the half-order model.&#xD;
Several other phenomena in the cathode model were also examined.  The kinetic parameters (exchange current density and cathode transfer coefficient) were adjusted to assume a single Tafel slope, rather than a double Tafel slope, resulting in a significant improvement in the predicted fuel cell performance.  Anisotropic electronic conductivities and mass diffusivities were added to cathode model so that the anisotropic structure of the porous transport layer was taken into account.  As expected, the simulations showed improved performance at low current densities due to a higher electronic conductivity in the in-plane direction and decreased performance at high current densities due to smaller diffusivities.  Additionally, the concentration overpotential was accounted for in the model; however it had little influence on the simulation results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this thesis was to examine the complex relationship that exists between lone motherhood and sex work. Utilizing the idea of particularlism, I argue that it is important to understand the environmental context of mothers and the variety and uniqueness of women’s experiences in order for the state to respond with directed policies for lone parents. In order to discover whether or not sex workers who are single mothers have unique needs and experiences, I conducted 15 semi structured interviews with independent escort workers from Toronto and Edmonton. &#xD;
The interviewees reported leading a double life characterized by shame, fear, stigmatization and discrimination. It was discovered that the double life which many women live is not only stressful, but is also a serious impediment to their ability to effectively parent. I argue that it is the current legal status of sex work which poses barriers to these women in achieving financial stability, equal rights, social comfort, access to quality services, and child support; all of which are points that are integral to effective parenting.  As such, I assert that decriminalization and the recognition of sex work as work, grants these women access to the support that other working mothers may have, but also directs attention to the societal stigma and discrimination that moralizes and punishes sex workers. Ultimately, I contend that when sex workers are granted equal rights and access to supportive institutions they are capable of effective parenting. &#xD;
Beyond decriminalization, I make a series of recommendations based on the needs expressed throughout the interviews. The implementation of these recommendations could be hastened by decriminalization and a strong sex workers union. They include: flexible child care, altered service delivery, a non judgmental legal system and sensitivity training.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multiplayer games have to support activities which have differing usability requirements. The usability of the system is directly influenced by the choice of consistency maintenance algorithm. These algorithms must accommodate usability requirements while ensuring shared data is accurately replicated. We demonstrate that consistency maintenance in games can be organized around the AMP properties which state that separate nodes can maintain their instances of shared data using different algorithms (asymmetry), multiple consistency maintenance algorithms can be used within an application (multiplicity), and that consistency maintenance algorithms should be created as modular components (plug-replaceability). The motivation for AMP is outlined with a review of examples from commercial 3D games and related research. Consistency maintenance algorithms are shown to exist in a usability trade-off space. A set of usability metrics is introduced and used to experimentally explore this space. Our results imply that no single algorithm is suitable for every in-game situation. The thesis concludes with an informal evaluation of the AMP based on our experience using the Fiaa.NET as an AMP framework. We found that AMP had several weaknesses, but that these were outweighed by the benefits for the developer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Planning device deployment is a fundamental issue in implementing wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. This design practice determines types, numbers and locations of devices in order to build a powerful and effective system using devices of limited energy supply and constrained capacities. The deployment plan decides the limits of many intrinsic properties of a WSN, such as coverage, connectivity, cost, and lifetime. In this thesis, we address the device deployment planning issues related to large-scale WSN systems. &#xD;
&#xD;
We consider a typical deployment planning scenario in a heterogeneous two-tier WSN composed of sensor nodes and relay nodes. Sensor nodes form the lower tier of the network and are responsible for providing satisfactory sensing coverage to the application. Relay nodes form the upper tier of the network and they are responsible for forwarding data from sensor nodes to the base station. As so, relay nodes should provide reliable connectivity to sensor nodes for an extended period of time. We therefore address the sensor node deployment in terms of the sensing coverage and relay node deployment in terms of the communication connectivity and system lifetime. &#xD;
&#xD;
For sensor node deployment, we propose a coverage-guaranteed sensor node deployment design technique. Using this technique, the sensing coverage is complete even if sensor nodes are randomly dispersed within a bounded range from its target locations according to a given grid pattern. In order to curb the increased cost due to extra sensor nodes that are used in the coverage-guaranteed deployment, while still maintaining a high-quality sensing coverage, we further study the probabilistic properties of the grid-based sensor node deployment in the presence of deployment errors. &#xD;
&#xD;
For relay node deployment, we propose to extend the system lifetime by distributing relay nodes according to a density function, which is optimized in response to the energy consumption rate, so that the energy is dissipated at an approximately same rate across the network. We further craft the deployment density function to reconcile the needs of balanced energy consumption and strong sensor node connectivity. &#xD;
&#xD;
The techniques proposed in this thesis fill the blank of available literature and can serve as guidelines for WSN designers, solution providers and system integrators of WSN applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been shown to be a versatile three-dimensional imaging tool in diagnostic medicine, combining micrometre-scale resolutions with fast acquisition times. This imaging modality uses the interference between light backscattered from a sample and light that has traversed a known reference path delay to determine the scattering profile over penetration depths of up to several millimetres in tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
A novel OCT system is presented that uses nonlinear optics to process the backscattered light in the optical domain prior to standard Fourier-domain OCT acquisition and processing. The nonlinear optical effects experienced between short light pulses are strongly intensity-dependent, occurring only significantly when the pulses are temporally and spatially overlapped. These conditions allow for the creation of a user-controlled time gate that restricts the light backscattered from the sample to a narrow (~100 micrometres) depth field of view prior to detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
When strong and weak scattering interfaces exist across the sample depth range, the signal-to-noise ratio of the weaker scattering sites can be limited by the finite detector dynamic range in Fourier-domain OCT systems. By aligning the time gate temporal delay to the backscatter from the weak interfaces of interest, a user can completely remove the strong backscattered light and enhance imaging contrast. The nonlinear effect used in the current time-gated OCT design is sum-frequency generation, which provides an additional advantage of imaging at near infrared (1280 nm) wavelengths, used for long penetration depths in tissue, while detection is performed in the visible (504 nm) with silicon-based camera technology. With the reduced depth field of view, the number of sampling points required per depth scan is also proportionately reduced, permitting faster acquisition rates for the time-gated region of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
A complete description of the time-gated OCT system design is presented, along with proof-of-concept images demonstrating contrast enhancement and operation in a highly scattering biological medium. Based on its successful initial performance, future development of this system is expected for its eventual use in many OCT imaging applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I have discovered that evaluation like my first passion, drama, challenges participants on a cognitive and personal level. In both evaluation and theatre, stories are told for the purpose of stimulating interest, reflection, and insights into the complexity of human behaviour. In the world of program evaluation judgements about program merit, worth, or significance are generated through an evaluator’s interactions with theory, stakeholders and colleagues. Program insights are thus tied to the quality and complexity of these interactions.&#xD;
	This thesis tells the story of my transition from drama teacher-to-graduate student-to-evaluator-researcher. It begins with my motivations for this transition; includes my learning about internal, participatory and collaborative evaluation. Finally, this thesis speculates on how inquiry and experiences, such as the ones documented here, might inform the learning of other novice evaluators. It accomplishes this latter goal by making explicit the complexities of a participatory and collaborative evaluation process and the considerations and deliberations that I faced in attempting to enact this approach.&#xD;
	This thesis reflects the fact that I have always used stories as a way to understand and make meaning, Presented in the structure of a play, this narrative purposefully examines the values, challenges, and possibilities for learning that arose in my collaboration with other evaluation colleagues. Over the five acts I reveal my growing understanding of evaluation theory and practice and how this was shaping my understanding of who I was becoming. The final Act explores the notion that professional learning and identity is not a fixed or exclusive concept.&#xD;
	This thesis suggests that learning from experience is valuable in contributing to the growth of novices. In learning to do evaluation it is not enough to focus on models of practice or theoretical principles. Becoming an evaluator also requires attention to personal and interpersonal orientations and the monitoring of an evolving personal stance. In presenting this thesis I argue that the elements of my story have transferable qualities and that these elements can trigger conversation and insights beneficial to other novices or those charged with the induction of novices. The intended consequence is a richer understanding of evaluation as a human enterprise.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>PAWP, postacrosomal sheath WW domain binding protein, is a novel sperm protein identified as a candidate sperm borne, oocyte-activating factor (SOAF). PAWP induces both early and later egg activation events including meiotic resumption, pronuclear formation and egg cleavage. Based on the fact that calcium increase is universally accepted as the sole requirement for egg activation, we hypothesized that PAWP is an upstream regulator of the calcium signaling pathway during fertilization.  Intracellular calcium increase was detected by two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy following microinjection of recombinant PAWP into Xenopus oocytes, bolstering our hypothesis and suggesting the involvement of a novel PAWP-mediated signaling pathway during fertilization. The N-terminal of PAWP shares a high homology to WW domain binding protein while the C-terminal half contains a functional PPXY motif, which allows it to interact with group I WW domain proteins. These structural considerations together with published data indicating that PPXY synthetic peptide derived from PAWP inhibits ICSI-induced fertilization led to the hypothesis that PAWP triggers egg activation by binding to a group I WW domain protein in the oocyte. By far-Western analysis of oocyte cytoplasmic fraction, PAWP was found to bind to a 52 kDa protein. The competitive inhibition studies with PPXY synthetic peptide, WW domain constructs, and their point mutants demonstrated that the interaction between PAWP and its binding partner is specifically via the PPXY-WW domain module. The 52 kDa protein band crossreacted with antibodies against group I WW domain protein YAP in Western blot assay, indicating that this 52 kDa PAWP binding partner is either YAP or a YAP-related protein. In addition, the far-Western competitive inhibition studies with recombinant GST fusion protein YAP and another WW domain-containing protein, TAZ, demonstrated that the binding of PAWP to its binding partner was significantly reduced by TAZ, providing evidence that TAZ could be the 52 kDa protein candidate. Mass spectrometry was employed to identify this PAWP binding partner candidate. However, due to the low abundance of the candidate protein and the complexity of the sample, several strategies are still needed to enrich this protein. This study correlates PAWP induced meiotic resumption and calcium efflux at fertilization and uncovers a 52 kDa candidate WW domain protein in the oocyte cytoplasm that most likely interacts with PAWP to trigger egg activation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Why do some people tend to begin new goals or activities with a high level of commitment and determination, only to drop substantially in their involvement within a short time? The purpose of the present research was to identify stable individual differences that influence the tendency to manifest this pattern of behaviour (i.e., starting strong then dropping off), which is subsequently termed “all-or-nothing behaviour”. In Study 1, participants completed questionnaire items that were expected to tap all-or-nothing behaviour. Common factor analysis was performed to examine the factor structure of the data, and revealed three independent constructs that were labelled “high standards”, “sensitivity to failure”, and “lack of perseverance”.  The purpose of Study 2 was to assess the temporal stability of these constructs. Participants completed measures of the constructs at two times separated by 20 weeks. High correlations between scores at Time 1 and Time 2 revealed that the constructs are stable over time. The purpose of Study 3 was to examine the distinctiveness of the target constructs from existing individual difference measures, and to examine their association with theoretically similar and dissimilar constructs. Participants completed measures of the target constructs along with several other individual differences, and correlations among the measures were computed. Moderate to high correlations were found between the target constructs and theoretically related constructs, but they were not were not so high such that they appeared to represent the same underlying dimension. Further, relatively low correlations were found between the target constructs and theoretically unrelated constructs. The purpose of Studies 4 and 5 was to investigate the influence of the target constructs on all-or-nothing behaviour in the domains of group fitness attendance (Study 4) and campus club involvement (Study 5). In both Studies 4 and 5, participants completed measures of the constructs that were believed to relate to an all-or-nothing behavioural pattern, and their adherence to the target behaviours was assessed. I hypothesized a three-way interaction among the target constructs such that the presence of all three would be necessary to predict all-or-nothing behaviour. Results from both Studies 4 and 5 were &#xD;
consistent with this hypothesis such that individuals who were high in each of the three constructs were more likely to exhibit the all-or-nothing pattern of behaviour than were other individuals. Theoretical implications for understanding processes involved in behaviour change, and practical implications for interventions targeting at-risk individuals, are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The role of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in cardiovascular and neuroendocrine regulation has been well documented. Much remains unknown however about the integration of synaptic signals within this nucleus and the neuronal subtypes and chemical messengers governing these processes. Angiotensin II (ANG) has been demonstrated to act as a neurotransmitter in PVN where it exerts considerable influence on neuronal excitability. The studies within this thesis were undertaken to delineate the actions of ANG on the membrane properties of PVN neurons and its effect on synaptic transmission within this nucleus. &#xD;
We report that ANG activates a nitric oxide mediated negative feedback loop in the PVN. The magnitude of the depolarizing response to ANG appears to be dependant on this GABAergic inhibitory input demonstrating there exists within PVN an intrinsic negative feedback loop which modulates neuronal excitability in response to peptidergic excitation. We also demonstrate that the depolarizing response to ANG in magnocellular neurons is in part dependent upon increases in glutamatergic excitatory synaptic input. These data in combination highlight the multiple levels of synaptic integration controlling the output of magnocellular neurons in PVN.&#xD;
	PVN also contains significant populations of neurosecretory parvocellular neurons which exercise considerable influence over the adenohypophysis and therefore neuroendocrine regulation. ANG caused an AT1 receptor mediated depolarization of these neurosecretory neurons. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed that ANG activated a non-selective cationic current and reduced a sustained potassium current characteristic of IK. These studies identify multiple post-synaptic modulatory sites through which ANG can influence the excitability of neurosecretory parvocellular PVN neurons.  &#xD;
	The findings in this thesis provide the framework for a cellular model of action of ANG within PVN to regulate the activity of this nucleus not only through direct cellular mediated ion channel interactions but also through modulation of synaptic input within the magnocellular system of PVN.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research evaluated the application of post consumer glass as a cementing agent in underground mine backfills. The underlying theory indicates that glass is pozzolanic and, when used in finely divided form, reacts as an activator to generate binding products, thus contributing to the development of backfill strength. The objective of the research was to evaluate the strength performance of backfills when Normal Portland Cement (NPC) is replaced with various percentages of post consumer glass.&#xD;
&#xD;
The research evaluated the performance of backfills prepared using tailings from three candidate mines, namely Stobie, David Bell and Kidd Creek. Each backfill was prepared using unique recipes, and the strength and other properties were evaluated at cure times of 7, 14, 28, 56, 112 and 224 days. Laboratory work involved visual, physical and chemical material characterization followed by strength evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results of strength assessment reveal that glass, when incorporated as part of the binder in backfill development is reactive, and can contribute to the strength of backfill. Further analysis of the results also indicated that the reactivity of glass may be affected by the incorporation of slag within the recipe, the availability of lime and the level of hydration of the binders.&#xD;
&#xD;
The research concluded that, at 15 % glass replacement of NPC, backfill prepared with David Bell tailings, NPC and glass can achieve improved or equivalent strength performance compared to backfill prepared with David Bell tailings and NPC. NPC and slag outperformed backfills prepared with NPC, slag and glass at all replacement levels, using tailings from Kidd Creek and Inco-Stobie. However, future work should be designed to maximize the effect of specific pozzolan (for example glass) and material properties (aggregates) on backfill strength performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Carvone is a flavor and fragrance compound that is prominent in nature and is found in the essential oils of many plants.  Carvone exists as two enantiomers, (R)-(-)-carvone which has a spearmint aroma and (S)-(+)-carvone which has a caraway aroma and can be used in a variety of applications: as a common food additive, as an antimicrobial/antifungal agent and as a potato sprout inhibitor.  Carvone is currently produced by the extraction of essential oils from plants where the yield and quality of the extracted oil depends largely on successful agricultural production of dill, spearmint and caraway plants.  Biotechnological production can offer a constant supply of carvone that is independent of several agricultural limitations.&#xD;
In this study, it was confirmed that the substrate and product of the microbial biotransformation of trans-carveol to (R)-(-)-carvone by Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14 can be inhibitory to the cells at high concentrations.  As such, a two phase partitioning bioreactor was employed where the function of the second phase (immiscible organic solvent or solid polymer beads) was to partition the inhibitory substrate into the aqueous phase at a rate governed by the metabolic demand of the cells and uptake the inhibitory product as it accumulated in the aqueous phase.  Rational selection strategies were employed when determining the appropriate organic solvent and solid polymer to be used as the second phase.  The performance of the reactor was evaluated based on volumetric productivity, length of biotransformation and total volume of substrate added to the reactor.  The most successful reactor configuration was one in which styrene/butadiene copolymer beads were used as a second phase in the reactor and the fermentation medium was continuously circulated through an external extraction column packed with Hytrel® 8206 polymer beads.  The volumetric productivity, length of biotransformation and total volume of substrate added to this reactor were 99 mg/L.h, 48.75 h and 35 mL, respectively whereas in the single phase benchmark reactor the performance indicators were only 31 mg/L.h, 15.25 h and 5 mL, respectively.  These results clearly show the advantage of employing a partitioning bioreactor configuration for the biotechnological production of high value chemical species that exhibit cytotoxicity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is characterized by basal tone and appropriately timed neurogenic relaxation. The physiological mechanisms underlying these crucial LES functions remain poorly understood. The current studies were designed to characterize the electrophysiological properties and neural regulation of LES circular smooth muscle (CSM), and to determine whether interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) play a role in neurotransmission. Conventional intracellular recordings were performed in CD1, nNOS knock-out, eNOS knock-out and W/Wv mutant mice. Mouse LES consists of “sling” and “clasp” smooth muscle, which were studied separately in CD1 mice. In subsequent studies of mutant mice and respective controls, only the clasp muscle was examined, Immunohistochemical c-Kit staining of ICC was performed in wild-type and W/Wv mutant mice that were first characterized electrophysiologically.&#xD;
 &#xD;
The smooth muscle of the LES clasp and sling displayed unitary membrane potentials with a resting membrane potential (RMP) of ~ -43 mV. Spontaneous nifedipine-sensitive action potentials superimposed on the unitary potentials were usually recorded in the LES clasp, but not sling muscle. A monophasic inhibitory junction potential (IJP) was recorded in sling CSM, whereas a biphasic IJP consisting of an initial IJP, followed by long-lasting slow IJP (LSIJP) was recorded in clasp. Further pharmacological studies using  control and various knockout mice suggest that: 1. the CSM of the mouse LES is innervated by cholinergic, nitrergic and purinergic nerves; 2. the LSIJP is mediated entirely by nitrergic nerves, whereas purinergic and nitrergic nerves produce the monophasic IJP in the LES sling and initial phase of biphasic IJP in the LES clasp; 3. Ca2+/CaM-kinase II is involved in the regulation of the nitrergic IJPs; 4. TREK-1 K+ channels are not involved in the nitrergic IJP; 5. purinergic and cholinergic neurotransmission is intact in LES CSM of W/Wv mutant mice, whereas nitrergic neurotransmission is impaired in about half of the animals. In animals in which nitrergic neurotransmission was intact, ICC-IM were markedly deficient immunohistologically, suggesting that ICC are not required for nitrergic neurotransmission; 6. impaired nitrergic neurotransmission in W/Wv mutant mice is associated with dysfunction of a Ca2+-dependent signaling cascade primed by spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The SNO+ experiment has begun research and development to engineer replacing the heavy water in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory with liquid scintillator in order to study low energy solar neutrinos, double beta decay, and many other exciting physics topics. Experimentation and simulation have been combined to evaluate the purification of the liquid scintillator, linear alkylbenzene, for the SNO+ pro ject. Four radiopurification methods were tested: water and acid extraction, adsorption and distillation. The combination of adsorption and distillation yielded the best results with a reduction factor of 10000. Optical purification tests showed that double distillation and the combination of adsorption and distillation provided the best method of removing optical impurities from the liquid scintillator. Simulation studies showed that it is necessary to minimize internal radioisotopes: 210 Bi, 210 Pb, uranium chain, thorium chain, and 40 K in order to achieve desired uncertainty levels in the measurement &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Living/controlled radical polymerization (L/CRP) techniques in aqueous based systems were studied. The main focus of this research was adapting an ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization) to a microemulsion polymerization in order to form nano-size particles with low concentration of surfactant. &#xD;
In conventional microemulsion polymerization, the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was successfully employed with a low weight ratio of surfactant/monomer of 1:10 to produce polymer particles with mean diameters less than 40 nm. Poor control resulted when this microemulsion polymerization was used with reverse ATRP, but using acetone as a phase transfer agent improved the results. &#xD;
The AGET (activators generated by electron transfer) initiation technique was also employed in microemulsion ATRP. In this “two-step” procedure, a reducing agent, ascorbic acid, was used to reduce the higher oxidation state catalyst in situ during the first stage to initiate a microemulsion polymerization. Monomer was then continuously fed to the microemulsion ATRP to form the final polymer latex. In an effort to improve this microemulsion polymerization, factors such as the catalyst concentration, temperature, and surfactant concentration were studied. Two monomers, butyl acrylate (BA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA) were investigated. When BA was used, linear first-order kinetic plots and relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn~1.5) were observed. The final latex had a particle size ~20 nm. When BMA was employed, very fast reaction rates were obtained, leading to poorly controlled polymerizations with quite high polydispersity (Mw/Mn~2). The two-step AGET ATRP procedure in microemulsion provides options for synthesizing polymer nano-particles with low concentration surfactant in aqueous dispersed media.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The increasing popularity of Instant Messaging (IM) among adolescents in North America (Kids' Take On Media, 2003; Lenhart, Ranie &amp; Lewis, 2001; Tagliamonte &amp; Denis, 2006) is prompting two educational debates. One debate contests whether IM is more like speech or writing (e.g. Tagliamonte &amp; Dennis, 2003). The second debate disputes whether IM has a positive or negative effect on school writing (e.g. O’Connor, 2005). This thesis addresses these debates from a New Literacies Studies (NLS) stance. It reports on a qualitative study of the perspectives and literacy practices of high school students. The purpose is to examine how IM shapes student writing and perception of literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
The study focuses on the communication that transpired between five experienced IM users—one researcher and four adolescent participants—during a six-week IM writing group. Findings indicate the participants regard IM as a space for written slang; a space where speech and writing merge. Sensitive to context, the participants note that they can switch language registers to accommodate their audience, but they think confusion between registers may be a possibility. They demonstrate an attitude of “linguistic whateverism” (as described by Baron, 2002) when writing in the context of IM to increase efficiency, but they do not use as many acronyms as expected. The “whatever” attitude is linked to mistakes in writing, but it also exposes them to a sense of freedom and enjoyment. &#xD;
&#xD;
In general, IM provides these students with a new purpose for language, which they perceive as disconnected from school literacy.  The findings suggests that IM language is a hybrid of speech and writing, and connecting IM with school writing (both literally and figuratively) may help teachers be more effective in making school writing processes more relevant to students’ lives. While making this connection, it is important for teachers to emphasize the plurality of literacies and the importance of revising and editing “finished” writing.  In conclusion, this thesis considers new opportunities and concerns for writing pedagogy and new prospects for language research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis deals with the effects of host-guest complexation, based on cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n], n = 6, 7 and 8) host molecule, on the chemical, electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of the included guests. Both CB[6] and CB[7] form 1:1 complexes with [CH3bpy(CH2)6bpyCH]4+3, encapsulating the central hexamethylene chain. With its relatively larger cavity, a second CB[7] host will include one of the viologen units, forcing, through steric and electronic repulsions, the first CB[7] to abandon the inclusion of the central chain and move to the other viologen unit, thus forming a [3]pseudorotaxane. The inclusion of the two enantiomers of protonated N-benzyl-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine in the achiral CB[7] results in a five-fold increase in the molar optical rotation of {BNEAH•CB[7]}+ and significant changes in the longer wavelength band in the circular dichroism spectra, attributed to a restricted rotation of the naphthyl group about the chiral center upon inclusion of the benzyl portion of the guest in the CB[7] cavity.&#xD;
  The effects of host-guest complexation of the (trimethylammonio)- methylferrocene(+/2+) couple (FcTMA+/2+) by CB[7] on the kinetics of its electron self-exchange and electron transfer reactions were investigated. The slow exchange of the ferrocene guest, allows for the simultaneous monitoring of the 1H NMR line-broadening for both the FcTMA++ and {FcTMA•CB[7]} species in the presence of the paramagnetic FcTMA2+; The electron self-exchange rate constant increases moderately upon inclusion of both reduced and oxidized species, while the rate constants for the oxidation of ferrocenes by the bis(2,6-pyridinedicarboxylato)cobaltate(III) ion (which does not bind to CB[7]), were significantly reduced a result of reduced thermodynamic driving forces and steric hindrance to close approach of the oxidant to the encapsulated ferrocenes. This work was extended to investigations of the inclusion of bis(ferrocene) guests, demonstrating that a sufficiently long linker is required to accommodate a CB[7] host on each ferrocene unit. The formation of stable host-guest complexes of the bent titanocene, TiCp2+(H22O)2, with both CB[7] and CB[8] were characterized in aqueous solution. The CB[8] formed a more stable complex than CB[7], contrary to the order observed with ferrocene guests, attributable to the larger radius of the bent titanocene guest.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives: This study aimed to compare the sit-to-stand (STS) transfer in normal elderly subjects and people with Parkinson’s disease, using kinematic and kinetic analysis. Design: A cross-sectional cohort study using a control group and a group of individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition that is characterized by hypokinesia, akinesia, tremor, rigidity and postural instability. In individuals with PD, falling is a common risk and occurs most frequently during walking or other locomotor activities that involve a shift in the centre of mass, an example being the daily STS transfer. This study aimed to help the clinician gain a better understanding of the biomechanical analysis of the STS transfer in individuals with PD. Methods: Fourteen subjects with PD and fourteen age matched healthy individuals performed the STS transfer at their self-selected speed from a height-standardized seat in a laboratory setting. Analysis was based on ground reaction forces, joint angles calculated from two-dimensional kinematic data, and time to complete the task. Results: Subjects with PD took longer than control subjects to complete the STS. Also, there were differences in the ground reaction forces between individuals with PD and their age-matched controls. Conclusion: In line with other findings about movement in PD, the individuals with PD were slower, exerted less force and used different strategies than age-matched controls.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Workload adaptation is a performance management process in which an autonomic database management system (DBMS) efficiently makes use of its resources by filtering or controlling the workload presented to it in order to meet its Service Level Objectives (SLOs). It is a challenge to adapt multiple workloads with complex resource requirements towards their performance goals while taking their business importance into account. This thesis studies approaches and techniques for workload adaptation. &#xD;
	&#xD;
First we build a general framework for workload adaptation in autonomic DBMSs, which is composed of two processes, namely workload detection and workload control. The processes are in turn made up of four functional components - workload characterization, performance modeling, workload control, and system monitoring. &#xD;
&#xD;
We then implement a query scheduler that performs workload adaptation in a DBMS, as the test bed to prove the effectiveness of the framework. The query scheduler manages multiple classes of queries to meet their performance goals by allocating DBMS resources through admission control in the presence of workload fluctuation. The resource allocation plan is derived by maximizing the objective function that encapsulates the performance goals of all classes and their importance to the business. First-principle performance models are used to predict the performance under the new resource allocation plan. Experiments with IBM® DB2® are conducted to show the effectiveness of the framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
The effectiveness of the workload adaptation depends on the accuracy of the performance prediction. Finally we introduce a tracking filter (Kalman filter) to improve the accuracy of the performance prediction. Experimental results show that the approach is able to reduce the number of unpredicted SLO violations and prediction errors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study explored the educational benefits of institutional efforts to internationalize education as perceived and experienced by domestic and international undergraduate students at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The intent of the study was to (1) understand the ways in which students reported benefiting from the range of programs and activities associated with Internationalization-at-Home initiatives, and (2) ascertain which of the three dominant internationalization frameworks (Global Competency, Academic Capitalism, and Academic Colonialism) likely inform the institutional practices experienced by these students.  &#xD;
	Using a social-constructivist approach, this qualitative study employed an inter-related set of data collection instruments and processes including a web-based survey, focus group interview, and document analysis. Senior undergraduate students from the faculties of Arts and Science, Applied Science and School of Business, participated in the study which was carried out in 2007. &#xD;
	Four themes emerged from the analysis of data generated by the web-based survey and the focus group interview. Expressed as benefits to either the students and/or to the institution itself, these themes include: (1) a broadened knowledge and understanding of other nations, cultures, and global issues; (2) networking and the development of social and emotional skills; (3) the generation of revenue; and (4) contributing to the reproduction of Western knowledge. Overall, these themes collectively speak to the institution’s internationalization goals, and a measure of commitment to more than one internationalization goal, with less than a half of the student participants reporting that developing global competence was the main benefit derived.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Williams Brothers Mine is located in Mariposa County, California. Surface waters from the site drain into the south fork of the Merced River and the San Joaquin River Basin. The mine was developed in the 1980s and mined intermittently until 1996. In 1998, concerns of acidic drainage at the site arose. Effluent sampling by Engineering Remediation Resources Group (ERRG) found acid mine drainage (AMD) characterized by a pH of 3.9, sulphate concentrations of 100 mg/L and low metal concentrations of 0.074, 4.60, 1.23, 0.047 and 0.133 mg/L for Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn, respectively. The aim of this research was to evaluate passive treatment system alternatives for the mitigation of the AMD to meet water quality objectives for the San Joaquin River Basin.&#xD;
&#xD;
A bench-scale study was undertaken which consisted of 3 systems treating synthetic AMD: (1) a peat biofilter to remove dissolved metals followed by an anoxic limestone drain (ALD) to increase alkalinity and pH; (2) a sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) bioreactor followed by an ALD, in which SRB reduce sulphate to sulfides, generating alkalinity and decreasing metal concentrations via metal sulfide precipitation; and (3) a SRB bioreactor. &#xD;
&#xD;
Synthetic AMD was produced to represent AMD characteristics observed at the site. The peat-ALD system effluent pH was 6.9 and concentrations of Fe and Cu decreased to below water quality objectives with concentrations of 0.008 and 0.06, respectively. The SRB-ALD and SRB system effluents met water quality objectives for pH and Cu, Ni and Zn metal concentrations. The effluent pH for both systems was 6.5. The SRB-ALD system reduced Cu, Ni and Zn to concentrations of 0.004, 0.016 and 0.025 mg/L, respectively. The SRB system reduced metal concentrations for Cu, Ni and Zn 0.006, 0.010 and 0.027 mg/L, respectively. &#xD;
&#xD;
Based on the bench-scale study, the pilot-scale system consisted of a combined passive treatment system containing a peat biofilter, SRB bioreactor and a limestone drain. Pilot-scale testing commenced on May 23rd, 2007.  To date, some metal attenuation has been observed, with average effluent concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn equal to &lt;0.005, 0.92, 0.45, &lt;0.005 and 0.049 mg/L, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Compilation involves transforming a high level language source program into an equivalent assembly or machine language program. Programming language implementation can therefore be viewed as a source to source transformation from the original high level source code to the corresponding low level assembly language source code. This thesis presents an experiment in implementing an entire programming language system using declarative source transformation. To this end a complete compiler/interpreter is implemented using TXL, a source transformation system. The TXL-based PT Pascal compiler/interpreter is implemented in phases similar to those in a traditional compiler. In the lexical and syntactic analysis phase any lexical and syntactic errors present are detected when the source program is parsed according to the TXL grammar specified. The semantic analysis phase is then run in which semantic checks are performed on the source program and error messages are generated when semantic errors are detected. The source program is also annotated with type information. The typed intermediate code produced by the semantic analysis phase can be directly executed in the execution phase.  Alternatively, the intermediate typed source can be transformed into a bytecode instruction sequence by running the code generation phase. This bytecode instruction sequence is then executed by a TXL implementation of an abstract stack machine in the code simulation phase. The TXL-based PT Pascal compiler/interpreter is compared against the traditional S/SL implementation of the PT Pascal compiler. The declarative style of TXL makes the rules and functions in the TXL-based PT Pascal compiler/interpreter easier to understand and the number of lines of code in the TXL implementation is less than in the S/SL implementation. The TXL implementation is however slower and less scalable. The implementation of the TXL-based PT Pascal compiler/interpreter and the advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed in greater detail in this thesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With rapid progress in microelectronics technology, high-performance Integrated Circuits (ICs) bring huge challenge to design the power supplies. Fast loop response is required to handle the high transient current of devices. Power solution size is demanded to reduce due to the size reduction of integrated circuits. The best way to meet these harsh requirements is to increase switching frequency of power supplies. Along with the benefits of increasing switching frequency, the power supplies will suffer from high switching loss and high gate charge loss as these losses are frequency dependant losses. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis investigates the best topology to minimize the switching loss. The Series-Parallel Resonant Converter (SPRC) with current-doubler is mainly analyzed for high frequency low voltage high current application. The advantages and disadvantages of SPRC with current-doubler are presented. A new adaptive synchronous rectifiers timing control scheme is also proposed. The proposed timing control scheme demonstrates it can minimize body diode conduction loss of synchronous rectifiers and therefore improve the efficiency of the converter.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis also proposes two families of new resonant gate drive circuits. The circuits recover a portion of gate drive energy that is total lost in conventional gate drive circuit. In addition to reducing gate charge loss, it also reduces the switching losses of the power switches. Detail operation principle, loss analysis and design guideline of the proposed drive circuits are provided. Simulation and experimental results are also presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My project here is to look at how uncovering those unconscious and phantasmatic identifications in the social field can lead to the possibility of altering subjectivity or, at the very least, tracing how subjects are formed through structure and how they are psychically linked to ideological structure. This thesis suggests that subjection is never total or complete and that when viewed from an awry or skewed perspective, particular discourses and modes of subjection are revealed to be neither permanent, true nor necessary—we can always open up new spaces of subjectivity and discourse and through the practice of ‘tracing’ structure we can discern how we are determined and at which points structure constrains or enables us. My work is an effort to supplement theories of discourse analysis/ideology critique with psychoanalytic concepts, and more specifically, the psychoanalytic category of fantasy to discuss the ways in which discourses are provided with coherence and how subjects are tethered/binded to discursive fields. In my discussion of the non-discursive, I will be drawing from the Freudian concept of unheimlich, or the uncanny, to discuss the ways in which discursive fields become disrupted by repressed or “foreign” elements. I contend that the subject always exceeds structure, and for this reason, there is always room for resistance within discursive fields.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, a new approach for single-stage power factor correction converters is proposed to increase their power ratings to be in the multiple kilowatts levels. The proposed techniques are based on the utilization of modified three-level resonant converter topologies. These topologies provide low component stresses, high frequency operation, zero voltage switching, applicability under a wide range of input and output conditions as well as added control flexibility. The proposed control algorithms are based on a combination of variable frequency and asymmetrical pulse width modulation control or variable frequency and phase shift modulation control. In either case, the variable frequency control is used to tightly regulate the output voltage, whereas, pulse width or phase shift modulation is used to regulate the dc-bus voltage as well as the input power factor. New converter topologies, their operation and steady state and dynamic analyses are presented in details. &#xD;
A modelling approach based on average multiple frequency methods is also proposed. This approach leads to the development of a full order state space model with the two control variables explicitly separated allowing a better controller design. The model can be used either at high level of detail expressing the non-linearities of the system or it can readily be simplified to a linear decoupled model for approximate solutions. &#xD;
Finally, a discrete time controller for the proposed converters, which is suitable for FPGA implementation, is presented. Analytical, simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the proposed concepts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A method for the determination of platinum group elements (PGEs) in natural tree samples was developed.  An alumina column in-line with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) achieves the separation of interferents as well as pre-concentration of the analytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
The application of this proposed method on tree top samples displayed an effective separation of Ru, Rh, Re, Pd, Ir and Pt from the interferents, Ni, Cu and Zn for quantitative analysis of the analytes.  The concentration data was compared to ICP-HRMS data and while it was difficult to determine whether the concentrations were in agreement or not, as both methods have a large degree of error.  However, both methods displayed elevated concentrations of PGEs in areas over geological conductors in Rock Lake, Manitoba.&#xD;
&#xD;
This proposed method offers distinct advantages over previous on-line methods, as it is extended to include multiple PGEs as well as reduces sample consumption to a more suitable volume for natural samples.  While the detection limit is higher than previous methods due to the lowered sample volume, it is still lower than the detection limits reported in commercial laboratories.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Non-invasive estimates of bone quality are of great interest as they could potentially improve the diagnosis and treatments for bone disorders, such as osteoporosis, and could aid in preoperative planning of surgical interventions, improving patient outcomes in orthopaedic trauma.&#xD;
Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) is currently being investigated as a method of estimating structural bone mineral content (sBMC) and, thus, bone quality. However, the reported correlations between QCT and sBMC have been variable and the relationships reported between sBMC and the apparent elastic modulus (E*) of bone have been even more variable.&#xD;
A series of investigations are presented, relating QCT, sBMC, apparent density and the E* of bone. These studies were performed with the ultimate objective of determining the appropriateness of QCT as a predictor of the E* of bone and whether the E* of bone could be predicted from information regarding the sBMC and apparent density.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A respected marine biologist at the University of Jena, Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) was the most visible proponent of Darwin’s theory of evolution in Germany around the turn of the twentieth century.  Alongside his natural-scientific research activities, he attempted to popularise a philosophy that he dubbed ‘Monism’ – which consisted essentially of mid-nineteenth-century mechanistic materialism permeated with elements derived from early-nineteenth-century German Romantic pantheism – and to use this outlook as the basis for a worldwide anticlerical movement.  His popular science books were an outstanding success, selling hundreds of thousands of copies throughout the world, but his organisation attracted far fewer adherents.  By examining Haeckel’s popular science writings and contemporary reactions to them, especially among lesser-known contemporaries who have received relatively little attention in previous studies, this thesis explores the subjective appeal of Haeckel’s monistic philosophy.  Specifically, it investigates the way in which he employed metaphors and visual images to communicate scientific and philosophical concepts, and in so doing seemed to provide his readers with what they had feared lost along with the decline of orthodox religious belief: a feeling of greater purpose, a foundation for ethical behaviour, an appreciation of beauty in the world, and a stable sense of identity.  The imagery and metaphors that he employed were open to multiple interpretations, and others saw in them an expression of the destructive modern forces that threatened to bring about social collapse.  Paradoxically, the same devices that accounted for Haeckel’s appeal as a popular science writer contributed to the incoherence and fragmentation of his Monism movement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many studies of the Archaic Greek kore focus exclusively on stylistic considerations in an attempt to date these statues more and more accurately. Other studies propose various meanings for the kore. Each of these approaches can be extremely subjective, with the result that the large body of extant literature about the kore tends to be repetitive and argumentative in nature, and, with several exceptions, does not advance the understanding of the kore to any&#xD;
appreciable degree past where it had developed by the 1980s. I use a different, more empirical methodology to study a small group of korai, found in the 1880s near the&#xD;
Erechtheion on the Athenian Akropolis.&#xD;
Symmetry analysis of the patterns painted onto these korai at the time of their creation reveals both consistency of pattern use through the period of seventy years between c560 BCE and c490 BCE, as well as some anomalous patterns. I tabulate the various patterns, as well as their frequency of occurrence, and briefly speculate that there is a correlation between the pattern consistencies and anomalies and events in the known historical record, such as the&#xD;
mid-6th century rule by the Peisistratids and the democratic reforms of Kleisthenes. I also propose other directions in which the study of the kore could be taken using symmetry analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The chemical fate of organophosphorus pesticides is influenced by several factors, one being the chemistry of their aquatic environment. Dissolved metal ions have been shown in several instances to promote the hydrolysis of organophosphorus pesticides, with various reasons forwarded as to the intimate mechanism of metal ion promoted hydrolysis. Several postulates have suggested metal ion co-ordination of Lewis sites to be an important factor in promoting the reaction. In view of this, the study herein reports on the promoted hydrolysis of diazinon at various pH’s in the presence of several metal ions including Hg2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Ag+.&#xD;
&#xD;
The observed 1H and 31P NMR data indicated complexation of Cu2+ and Ag+ with diazinon through the formation of a six-membered ring (chelate), via co-ordination at both nitrogen and sulfur Lewis base sites. In contrast, NMR results with Hg2+ indicated Hg2+ ion promoted hydrolysis of diazinon through co-ordination at sulfur alone, possibly through stronger binding to the altered transition state than the reactant state. Another possibility would entail lowering of the pKa of H2O on metal complexation, thus facilitating nucleophilic attack. &#xD;
&#xD;
Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) substantiated the proposed metal ion complexation. In the case of Cu2+ and Ag+, complexation between diazinon and metal ions was observed at given m/z ratios, while subsequent MS/MS analysis of the complexed ions revealed co-ordination at both S and N sites by Cu2+ and Ag+. No complexation between diazinon and Hg2+ was observed in ESI-MS; however Hg2+ was shown to complex the hydrolytic product O,O diethyl phosphorothioic acid, presumably through sulfur. &#xD;
&#xD;
Hydrolysis of diazinon was studied at several pH’s at 22oC in the presence of Hg2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Ag+, by following spectrophotometrically the appearance of 2-isopropyl-6-methylpyrimidin-4-ol. Kinetic data showed Hg2+, Cu2+ and Ag+ to be extremely effective in neutral-to-mildly acidic conditions, with a reduced effect in the presence of Cd2+. Smaller rate enhancements were also observed at slightly lower pH of 4.0. Possible factors include; 1) Competing acid hydrolysis involving protonation at one heterocyclic N of diazinon (N-3). 2) The dominant nature of the HgCl2 species at pH 4.0. 3) Metal speciation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Thrombin-activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) is a 60 kDa plasma protein that can be activated to the enzyme, TAFIa, by thrombin, plasmin or trypsin.  TAFIa is a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme that attenuates fibrinolysis.  Thrombomodulin (TM) is a cofactor which increases the overall efficiency of thrombin-mediated TAFI activation by 1250-fold.  Thus, the thrombin-TM complex is believed to be the physiological TAFI activator.&#xD;
The minimal structure of TM required for efficient TAFI activation contains the EGF-like domains 3 through 6.  New structure models have postulated that the C-loop of TM EGF-like domain 3 has a negatively charged molecular surface that could interact with several positively charged surface patches on TAFI.&#xD;
In this study, we constructed recombinant TAFI variants to assess whether the selected positively charged residues on TAFI complement the negative electrostatic potential of the TM EGF-like domain 3, thereby promoting the TAFI-TM interaction in the formation of the ternary thrombin/TM/TAFI complex.&#xD;
  TAFI has exclusive triple lysine residues on its activation peptide.  When they are substituted by alanine residues (K42/43/44A), compared to the wild-type, the catalytic efficiencies for TAFI activation by thrombin in the presence and absence of TM decreased by factors of 9 and 3.5, respectively.  Other derivatives of TAFI with alanine point mutations at positions K133, K211, K212, and R220, which together represent one positively charged surface patch of TAFI, showed decreased catalytic efficiencies for TAFI activation by thrombin-TM complex from 2.4 to 2.9-fold.  A second positive surface patch includes residues K240 and R275.  Alanine mutations of these two residues caused decreased catalytic efficiencies by 1.7 and 2.1-fold, respectively.  Together, our data show that no single mutation completely eliminates TM dependence in TAFI activation by thrombin, but each mutated residue contributes in the formation of the ternary thrombin/TM/TAFI complex.  In addition, all TAFIa derivatives had half lives (8.1 ± 0.6 min) comparable to that of wild-type TAFIa (8.4 ± 0.3 min) at 37 ºC, suggesting that these residues are not involved in TAFIa inactivation by conformational instability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous work has shown that thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) was unable to prolong lysis of purified clots in the presence of Lys-plasminogen (Lys-Pg), indicating a possible mechanism for fibrinolysis to circumvent prolongation mediated by activated TAFI (TAFIa).  Therefore, the effects of TAFIa on Lys-Pg activation and Lys-plasmin (Lys-Pn) inhibition by antiplasmin (AP) were quantitatively investigated using a fluorescently labeled recombinant Pg mutant which does not produce active Pn.  High molecular weight fibrin degradation products (HMW-FDPs), a soluble fibrin surrogate that models Pn modified fibrin, treated with TAFIa decreased the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 5IAF-Glu-Pg cleavage by 417-fold and of 5IAF-Lys-Pg cleavage by 55-fold.  A previously devised intact clot system was used to measure the apparent second order rate constant (k2) for Pn inhibition by AP over time.  While TAFIa was able to abolish the protection associated with Pn modified fibrin in clots formed with Glu-Pg, it was not able to abolish the protection in clots formed with Lys-Pg.  However, TAFIa was still able to prolong the lysis of clots formed with Lys-Pg.&#xD;
TAFIa prolongs clot lysis by removing the positive feedback loop for Pn generation.  The effect of TAFIa modification of the HMW-FDPs on the rate of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) was investigated using a previously devised end point assay.  HMW-FDPs decreased the k2 for tPA inhibition rate by 3-fold.  Thus, HMW-FDPs protect tPA from PAI-1.  TAFIa treatment of the HMW-FDPs resulted in no change in protection.  Vitronectin also did not appreciably affect tPA inhibition by PAI-1.  Pg, in conjunction with HMW-FDPs, decreased the k2 for tPA inhibition by 30-fold.  Hence, Pg, when bound to HMW-FDPs, protects tPA by an additional 10-fold.  TAFIa treatment of the HMW-FDPs completely removed this additional protection provided by Pg.  In conclusion, an additional mechanism was identified whereby TAFIa can prolong clot lysis by increasing the rate of tPA inhibition by PAI-1 by eliminating the protective effects of Pn-modified fibrin and Pg.  Because TAFIa can suppress Lys-Pg activation but cannot attenuate Lys-Pn inhibition by AP, the Glu- to Lys-Pg/Pn conversion is able to act as a fibrinolytic switch to ultimately lyse the clot.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Our understanding of tree growth and development has increased substantially in the last few decades and is expected to increase much more as we fully exploit newly developed genomic tools. A major milestone in tree genomics was the sequencing of the entire genome of Populus trichocarpa, and the realization that we understand the function of very few of the 45,000 predicted genes in this genome. To advance our knowledge of gene function in Populus, we have created the largest population of mutant poplars to date which will enable us to link altered phenotypes with genes that are responsible. This thesis describes this mutant population, provides preliminary results on the complexity of mutants identified and examines one distinct mutant called shriveled leaf. These results clearly demonstrate the power of this population for gene function analysis and reveal that this population will be a valuable genomic resource for tree biotechnology for many years to come.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this project, three separate experiments were conducted to assess heavy metal removal from metal aqueous solutions and synthetic landfill leachate by adsorption using low-cost natural adsorbents. &#xD;
Fundamental batch investigations indicated that the 4.0-4.75 mm crushed mollusk shells and the Sphagnum peat moss were the best adsorbents for cadmium and nickel removal, respectively. Peat moss was also found to have the highest adsorption capacities for manganese and cobalt adsorption. &#xD;
The adsorption capacities of the peat moss and crushed mollusk shells used as natural adsorbents for the adsorption of cadmium and nickel from binary aqueous solutions in fixed-bed columns under continuous flow conditions were investigated. The life expectancy of each adsorbent in the fixed-bed columns was also assessed for different hydraulic loading rates. The flow rate of 1.5 mL/min (surface loading of 27.52 cm3/cm2•day) and bed depth of 15 cm were identified as the better operational conditions from the column testing. The results indicated that 47.9% and 42.7% cadmium and nickel removal efficiencies could obtained under these operational conditions, respectively. &#xD;
Finally, the peat moss and the crushed mollusk shells were packed in bench-scale down-flow fixed-bed columns to evaluate their adsorption capacities as natural low-cost adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from aerated and non-aerated synthetic landfill leachate. The flow rate applied in this operation was 1.5 mL/min (surface loading of 27.52 cm3/cm2•day). Peat was found to have the best adsorption capacities in columns treating aerated synthetic leachate for cadmium (78.6%) and nickel (83.8%) removal efficiencies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An experimental and numerical study of air-air bent exhaust ejectors was carried out. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of a bend on the performance of exhaust ejectors. The ejectors consisted of nozzles, mixing tubes and in some cases entraining diffusers. As part of this study the effect of swirl in the primary flow and the temperature ratio of the primary to the secondary flow were also investigated.&#xD;
The study included testing of round and oblong sectioned ejectors with and without entraining diffusers. The experimental testing was performed on two different wind tunnels capable of blowing air at a maximum mass flow rate of 2.2 kg/s at ambient and elevated temperatures. Flow measurements were made upstream of the nozzle, at the nozzle exit and at the exit of the ejector. Pumping, pressure rise and total efficiency of the ejector were studied with respect to the bend angle, swirl angle and the primary to secondary flow temperature ratio. A commercial CFD code was used to evaluate the effectiveness of commercial CFD using limited resources for designing of such devices.&#xD;
The pumping ratio and pressure rise decrease with the increase in the degree of bend. Swirl up to a certain angle has a useful effect on the performance of a bent ejector. The entraining diffuser enhances the performance of a bent ejector. The CFD models based on commercial solver were able to predict the flow structures and the variation of the performance parameters with the bend and swirl angle. However, generally the CFD models were not able to predict the exact values of the performance parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of the study was to explore social integration of people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in the workplace and to identify the characteristics of positive workplace culture for them.  An in-depth qualitative case study was conducted at two worksites to explore the process of social integration.  Sources of information included company documents, on site observations, and interviews that were conducted for the following purposes:&#xD;
1.	to describe employees with IDs’ perceptions and needs of social integration and their experiences of social relationships in work settings;&#xD;
2.	to explore co-workers’ perceptions of and relationships with employees with ID; and&#xD;
3.	to identify what characteristics of workplace culture contributed to or detracted from social integration for people with ID.&#xD;
One workplace was an educational organization where four workers with ID were employed, the other a restaurant franchise where one worker with ID was employed.  The participants with ID from both worksites believed people with and without disabilities should work together and felt they were included in their workplaces.  The co-workers interviewed had positive opinions of fellow employees with ID.  Several characteristics of workplace culture had an impact on social integration for employees with ID, including a job structure that promotes social interactions, work pace within the work setting, group or individual employment, culture of acceptance within the work setting, and a supportive managerial approach.&#xD;
The results of the current study have provided strategies to enhance social integration for employees with ID, and highlighted a number of potentially beneficial workplace conditions that merit additional study.  Service providers can act as advocates to help create a work environment that emphasizes acceptance and respect for workers in this population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Intracellular Ca2+ is influenced by extracellular Ca2+ influx and release from internal stores.  Depending on the initial influx, a range of responses can result.  To better understand the processes surrounding Ca2+ handling, I examined intracellular Ca2+ following receptor-operated or voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in bag cell neurons of the marine mollusc, Aplysia californica.  Following a brief synaptic input, these neuroendocrine cells undergo a 30 min period of firing, known as the afterdischarge, triggering secretion of neuropeptides that initiate egg-laying.  I hypothesize that Ca2+ influx occurs via receptor-mediated activation of a non-selective cation channel and activity-dependent elevation of Ca2+ produces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores.  To test this, cultured bag cell neurons were injected with Ca2+ indicator, fura-PE3, and subjected to simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology.  &#xD;
Pharmacological activation of a non-selective cation channel that drives the afterdischarge, produced inward current and, as assessed by Mn2+-quench of fura, Ca2+ entry.  This receptor-operated Ca2+ influx pathway may contribute to plasticity or secretion.  Voltage-gated Ca2+ influx was investigated using trains of action potentials delivered at 5 Hz, 10 s (mimicking the synaptic input that initiates the afterdischarge) or 5 Hz, 1 min (mimicking the fast phase of the afterdischarge).  While both trains transiently elevated intracellular Ca2+, only the 5 Hz, 1 min stimulus produced a Ca2+ rise that markedly outlasted the initial influx, consistent with Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR).  Thus, robust Ca2+ influx is required to trigger bag cell neuron CICR.  &#xD;
Depletion of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum store, with Ca2+-ATPase blocker, cyclopiazonic acid, or collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, with protonophore, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, significantly attenuated CICR.  Furthermore, application of tetraphenylphosphonium, a blocker of mitochondrial Ca2+ release, also reduced CICR.  Dual depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria did not reduce CICR further than depletion of mitochondria alone.  Thus, in departure from the traditional mechanism of CICR, bag cell neuron CICR relies ultimately on mitochondrial Ca2+ release.  Finally, intracellular Ca2+ changes during, and after, a stimulus mimicking the full afterdischarge were enhanced by PKC activation.  Activity-dependent induction of CICR in bag cell neurons has the potential to influence secretion, membrane currents, or gene expression.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis begins with the introduction of solvents and their classification. The two solvent system studied here are switchable polarity solvents (SPS). A switchable polarity solvent is a liquid where its polarity can change between two forms by a trigger. These two solvent systems have several similar characteristics. First, they both require CO2 as the switching agent, which can be switched back by its removal with heat or N2. The first project is the continuation of previous work with using an amidine and alcohol mixtures as a switchable polarity solvent. The second project was the development of a new switchable polarity solvent that is based on the reaction of a secondary amine with CO2. Both solvent systems are fully characterized by many analytical techniques and examples of applications in chemical reaction and separation are outlined.&#xD;
The final project involves using these solvent systems, among others, in the separation of soybean oil. The aim was to use SPS technology to extract soybean oil from the bean flakes, and then separate the oil from the extracting solvent.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Asphaltenes are the most polar fraction of petroleum that can precipitate due to changes in pressure, temperature and composition which may be encountered during petroleum production and transportation. The precipitated asphaltenes can subsequently deposit on the surfaces of production/transportation pipelines and clog the pipeline partially or completely. Why asphaltenes deposit on a metal surface remains a poorly understood topic. This thesis investigates asphaltene-metal interactions through physical and chemical characterization of the adsorption behaviour of asphaltenes on metal surfaces.&#xD;
A relatively novel technique called quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was employed to study the kinetics of asphaltene adsorption and the data analyzed to estimate the adsorption isotherm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique was employed to determine the functional groups in bulk asphaltene and adsorbed asphaltene. The asphaltene adsorption experiments on metal surfaces were carried out in toluene medium at dilute concentration ranging 10-1500 ppm. A mathematical model was developed to analyze the XPS data, which was subsequently assessed to estimate the fractional coverage and thickness of adsorbed asphaltene.  The isotherms generated from QCM and XPS experiments were compared and analyzed to estimate the free energy. &#xD;
Three different asphaltene samples were investigated – one sample was derived from Cold Lake bitumen and two others were supplied by DBR-Oilphase (a Schlumberger company) and termed as MD and HO2 asphaltenes. Most extensive experimentations and analyses were carried out for Cold Lake asphaltenes. The same procedure was applied for the other asphaltene samples. The kinetic analyses of Cold Lake and MD asphaltenes indicated that the adsorption process is diffusion controlled at initial times but follows a first-order kinetic rate law at longer times. MD asphaltenes exhibited higher equilibrium adsorbed amounts than Cold Lake asphaltenes. The XPS spectral analysis for MD and Cold Lake asphaltene revealed presence of carboxylic, thiophenic, thiol, pyridinic and pyrrolic type species. All adsorption isotherms could be described by follows Langmuir (type-I) isotherm. The estimated thickness of adsorbed asphaltene varied between 8 and 12 nm.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Service-based software can be exploited by potentially untrustworthy service requestors while providing services. Given that, it is&#xD;
important to identify, analyze the trust relationships between service providers and requestors, and incorporate them into the&#xD;
service-based software. Treating trust as a nonfunctional requirement (NFR) during software development and monitoring allows&#xD;
clarifying these relationships and measuring the trustworthiness of service requestors. This analysis is facilitated by incorporating&#xD;
trust scenarios and trust models into the software. A trust scenario describes a trust relationship between interested parties based on a specific context. A trust model provides trust equations to measure the trustworthiness of service requestors based on the analysis of service-based interactions. Although much research has been devoted to monitor service quality, to date, no approach has been proposed&#xD;
to develop and automatically monitor service providing software from trust perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we propose a trust-aware service-based software development framework which utilizes our proposed Unified Modeling&#xD;
Language (UML) extension called UMLtrust (UML for trust scenarios)to specify the trust scenarios of a service provider and&#xD;
incorporates our developed trust model called CAT (Context-Aware Trust) into the software to calculate the trustworthiness of service&#xD;
requestors. The trust scenarios are converted to trust rules to monitor service-based interactions. A service requestor is penalized for the violation of a trust rule and rewarded when no rule is violated. The trustworthiness of the requestor is then calculated (using the equations of CAT) based on the current request, outcomes of previous requests, and recommendations from other service providers. A trust-based service granting algorithm is presented to decide whether a service requestor should be granted the requested service. A trust monitoring architecture is presented which is&#xD;
assumed to reside in each service provider. The monitor uses trust rules from UMLtrust specifications and trust equations from CAT to analyze service-based interactions. The incorporation of the monitor into a provider makes it trust-aware. A trust monitoring algorithm is provided to analyze interactions and make decisions at run-time. A prototype of a file sharing service-based grid is implemented to evaluate the applicability of our framework that confirms the effectiveness of the framework.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis I propose a new approach to the study of the “childlike” in five works from the first half of the 20th century: Les Enfants terribles (1929) by Jean Cocteau, “Un diamant gros comme le Ritz” (1922) by F. Scott Fitzgerald, La Métamorphose (1915) by Franz Kafka, Le Petit Prince (1943) by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and L’Arrache-coeur (1953) by Boris Vian. Distinct from both childhood narratives and narratives for children, these texts nevertheless exhibit a childlike quality that can best be described as an in-between state of ambiguity.&#xD;
    In the first section of the thesis, I look at the “between” identity of the children. There are children who fly and who are extraterrestrials. There are others who have adult jobs and who even marry. In fact, I call these ambiguous characters, “les enfantins”.  In the second section of the thesis, I show that the language is “between”. In 1951, child psychologist Jean Piaget published “La Formation du symbole chez l’enfant”, a work in which he studies the tendency of young children to take one object for another. I show how this type of almost magical thinking that Piaget calls “symbolic thought” appears in the “récit”. In the final section of my thesis, I study areas in the story where the reader finds himself in a “between” position, unable to establish whether what he is reading is occurring or whether it belongs to the imaginary symbolic thought of the child. Here I focus on the readers’ hesitation, contrasting it with the hesitation that Tzvetan Todorov explores in the genre of the fantastic.    &#xD;
    While this thesis is a close reading of five specific works, it incites several theoretical questions that can be applied more widely to studies concerning the “literary child”: what constitutes a child character in a work, what effect does a child character have on the language of the text, and how does a child character affect the way a text is read?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>New analytical techniques have been developed for the determination of selenium concentrations in sulphide minerals to assess the utility of the Se/S concentration ratios in tracing fluids associated with ore deposit formation. This has been accomplished via a new hydride generation (HG) sample introduction method for the determination of selenium contents in sulphide minerals, development of solid calibration standards by a sol-gel process, and the establishment of protocols for the measurement of selenium/sulphur ratios in sulphides using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS).&#xD;
The low concentrations of selenium in sulphides require the use of hydride generation, which also requires the removal of metals to be effective. A process for the determination of selenium in sulphide minerals (~ 50 mg sample weight) wherein metals are removed by precipitation under alkaline conditions, followed by further removal by chelating resin, was developed. Determinations by HG-ICPMS on reference materials showed quantitative recoveries (100±5 %). Precision is 10 % relative standard deviation and the detection limit is 4 µg g-1 in a sulphide mineral.&#xD;
A sol-gel method for the fabrication of multi-element calibration standards, suitable for laser ablation, was developed. The addition of selenium and sulphur to a normal sol-gel method does not introduce detectable heterogeneity. Xerogel heterogeneity is less than that of the NIST glass standards. Calculated sulphur contents in the NIST glass SRMs are comparable to published data. Xerogels are potentially useful as standards in studies of glasses, minerals, and other materials.&#xD;
The development of a laser ablation technique allowed measurement of Se/S ratios in sulphide minerals. Sulphide minerals were sampled from volcanic hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) (Flin Flon area, Canada), high-sulphidation epithermal (Pierina, Peru), and iron oxide copper gold (IOCG) (Mantoverde, Chile) deposits. Thermodynamic data, mineral assemblages, and isotopic compositions are used to define depositional conditions and Se/S ratios of ore generating fluids. Although the elements can fractionate from each other, high Se/S ratios and low δ34S values generally reflect magmatic fluids, typical of VHMS and epithermal deposits, whereas the opposite is true for basinal or evaporitic sources, such as recorded by sulphides at the Mantoverde deposits. The Se/S ratios aid in the identification of ore generating fluid sources and can indicate mixing of fluids.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The contemporary Western city is a space of capitalism, realized on a personal level through the lived realities of work and consumption. Elevation of these twin activities is contributing to ongoing social and environmental problems, both within the city and the larger interconnected world. As an alternative, play represents a way to de-emphasize the importance of work and consumption and their pervasive monetary components. Uncommodified, non-commercial play can open up more urban space and time for use value, above the exchange value that capitalism so efficiently emphasizes. Henri Lefebvre’s ideas about the ongoing production of social space, explicated in his spatial triad, alongside his ideas surrounding a resurgent and possibly revolutionary festival are used to explain how play can unsettle current capitalist norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
Urban exploration, an activity that sees people venture into all parts of the city, particularly those where one is not meant to go, is used as a form of play in support of this argument. This pastime interacts with the city in multiple spatial and temporal ways, helping to counteract some of the negative aspects of modern life. By entering various areas with unique perspectives, urban explorers recast working, consuming and forgotten spaces into sites of play and fun. Urban space itself becomes less alienated, more dynamic, and the possibilities within it evermore exciting. Exploration also reveals the uneven nature of contemporary urban space. By revealing certain problems urban exploration might act as a first step towards countering them, in turn encouraging different urban spaces and a diversified more livable city full of opportunities for use, self-expression and growth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multi-phase Buck is widely used in Voltage Regulator Modules design because of its low cost and simplicity. But this topology also has a lot of drawbacks. One of the most fundamental drawback is that it has narrow duty cycles when it operates at high switching frequency with low output voltage (for example 1V). Narrow duty cycles yield high switching loss which limits the switching frequency of Buck; making it difficult to design a Buck based VRM that can achieve high efficiency at a high switching frequency.&#xD;
In this thesis three new non-isolated full bridge topologies will be introduced to solve the aforementioned problems of Buck. One is a new non-isolated full bridge topology, this new topology use a transformer to extend the duty cycle and it capable to achieve zero voltage switching. Experimental results demonstrate that it has significant advantages over multi-phase Buck.&#xD;
In some applications when huge output current is required, several converters are paralleled to supply the current that is not an optimal solution. Two two-phase non-isolated full bridge topologies are proposed to solve this problem. They double the output power of one-phase non-isolated full bridge, and achieve higher efficiency with fewer switches compared with parallel two non-isolated full bridge converters.&#xD;
Non-isolated VRM usually is used for personal computers, VRM for servers is called power pod, and usually isolation is required for power pod due to safety considerations. Server usually require much more power than personal computers, their power consumption is around several KW. To provide the power for the server a few power modules will need to be paralleled, this kind solution is expensive and make current sharing complex. In this thesis two new two-phase isolated full bridge topologies are proposed. They are capable to operate at soft switching mode. And they double the output power compared with conventional full bridge converter. Compared with parallel two full bridge converters, they can achieve higher efficiency with fewer switches.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Oviductin is an oviduct-specific and high-molecular-weight glycoprotein that has been suggested to play important roles in the early events of reproduction. The present study was undertaken to localize the oviductin binding sites in the uterine epithelial cells of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) both in situ and in vitro, and to detect a hamster oviductin homologue in the female rat reproductive tract. Immunohistochemical localization of oviductin in the hamster uterus revealed certain uterine epithelial cells reactive to the monoclonal anti-hamster oviductin antibody. In order to study the interaction between hamster oviductin and the endometrium in vitro, a method for culturing primary hamster uterine epithelial cells has been established and optimized. Study with confocal microscopy of the cell culture system showed a labeling pattern similar to what was observed using immunohistochemistry. Pre-embedding immunolabeling of cultured uterine epithelial cells also showed gold particles associated with the plasma membrane and microvilli. These results demonstrated that hamster oviductin can bind to the plasma membrane of certain hamster uterine epithelial cells, suggesting the presence of a putative oviductin receptor on the uterine epithelial cell surface. In the second part of the present study, using the monoclonal anti-hamster oviductin antibody that cross-reacts with the rat tissue, we have been able to detect an oviduct-specific glycoprotein, with a molecular weight of 180~300kDa, in the female rat reproductive tract. Immunohistochemical labeling of the female rat reproductive tract revealed a strong immunolabeling in the non-ciliated oviductal epithelial cells and a faint immunoreaction on the cell surface of some uterine epithelial cells. Ultrastructurally, immunogold labeling was restricted to the secretory granules, Golgi apparatus, and microvilli of the non-ciliated secretory cells of the oviduct. In the uterus, immunogold labeling was observed on the cell surface of some uterine epithelial cells. Furthermore, electron micrographs of ovulated oocytes showed an intense immunolabeling for rat oviductin within the perivitelline space surrounding the ovulated oocytes. The findings of the present study demonstrated that oviductin is present in the rat oviduct and uterus, and it appears that, in the rat, oviductin is secreted by the non-ciliated secretory cells of the oviduct.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The power density of a switching converter is dependent on the size of the power circuit components.  Converters are operated in the hundreds of kHz to achieve high power density since the size of the converter reactive components decrease as frequency increases.  Most present day low power (&lt;200W) DC-DC converters operate at switching frequencies up to 500kHz.  Some research has been conducted on converters that can operate above 500kHz up to 4MHz.  In the near future, most DC-DC switching converters for communications and computers will operate at switching frequencies of 1-10MHz in order to achieve greater power density and improved transient response.  To meet the next generation requirements of these applications, four new ideas are proposed in this thesis. &#xD;
&#xD;
The first contribution is a new current source gate drive circuit for power MOSFETs.  The circuit provides a nearly constant gate current to reduce switching transition times and therefore switching loss in power MOSFETs.  In addition, it can recover a portion of the gate energy normally dissipated in a conventional driver.  Demonstrated loss reduction of 24.8% at 10V/5A load are presented in comparison to a conventional voltage source driver for a boost converter switching at 1MHz.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second contribution is a new high efficiency 1MHz synchronous buck voltage regulator using an improved current source driver.  The proposed circuit achieves short rise and fall times to reduce switching loss in the buck HS MOSFET.  It also recovers a portion of the SR gate energy, enabling a loss reduction of 24% at 1.3V/30A load in comparison to a conventional driver.  &#xD;
&#xD;
In the third contribution, a new switching loss model is proposed for synchronous buck voltage regulators.  The model uses simple closed form equations to calculate the rise and fall times and piecewise linear approximations of the HS MOSFET voltage and current waveforms to allow quick and accurate calculation of switching loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
The final contribution is a new variable frequency digital control method for resonant converters, which is suitable for future applications switching at 10MHz.  The proposed method uses frequency dithering to reduce the clock frequency demands of the digital controller.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines contemporary art projects that are installed in unconventional sites&#xD;
in urban neighbourhoods. Using the conceptual framework of the neighbourhood&#xD;
imaginary, I propose that these local art practices utilize neighbourhood spaces to engage&#xD;
with nation, identity and citizenship practices within the contemporary discourse of&#xD;
globalization. The three art projects I investigate address different aspects of&#xD;
neighbourhood. Cuban artist René Francisco Rodriguez’s (René Francisco) project, El&#xD;
Patio de Nin, foregrounds the citizen in an urban neighbourhood. His project merges&#xD;
creativity and pedagogy with social service, and blurs the boundaries between art and life&#xD;
in order to comment on social conditions and citizenship practices. The Legacy of Joseph&#xD;
Wagenbach (2006), by Toronto artist Iris Häussler, uses a home in an urban&#xD;
neighbourhood as a physical space in which to create an imaginary life to explore aspects&#xD;
of community, human behaviour and social values. The Swamp Ward Window, a&#xD;
Kingston-based curatorial project, takes advantage of the intimacy of the private home&#xD;
and the immediacy of the street to present artworks that explore the interface between&#xD;
public and private and everyday life in the community.&#xD;
Cornelius Castoriadis argues that the social imaginary emerges when the subconscious,&#xD;
the symbolic and action interact, not merely to reflect the outside world, but to create new&#xD;
meanings from which social change is possible. In my analysis, the neighbourhood&#xD;
imaginary resonates with the social imaginary, functioning as a conceptual laboratory for&#xD;
artists to experiment with the different meanings associated with neighbourhood,&#xD;
community and citizenship. I propose that a reengagement with the local, as part of a&#xD;
iii&#xD;
global discourse, provides an opportunity to examine art projects that manifest in&#xD;
neighbourhoods. And, while taking place in different socio-political circumstances, the&#xD;
shared condition of locality, I argue, provides a window through which the three projects&#xD;
envision linkages between aesthetic practices and public life. Finally, in order to&#xD;
critically consider local artistic practices in relation to globalization and the&#xD;
commodification of culture, this thesis engages those discourses of globalization that see&#xD;
culture as integral in new global economies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) materials have emerged as an innovative tool within the civil engineering community for the strengthening and rehabilitation of existing reinforced concrete structures. Research has taken place over the past decade that has demonstrated the benefits of FRPs, and it is evident that there is a need for their usage given the status of the deteriorated North American civil infrastructure. However, in order to increase confidence in the application of these materials in Canada, further information is required to fully understand their behaviour in cold climates. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis expands on the previous research that has taken place at Queen’s University, investigating the freeze-thaw behaviour of FRP strengthened reinforced concrete. The research program herein studies the combined effects of freeze-thaw cycling and sustained loading on the flexural performance of 45 small-scale beams strengthened with glass FRP sheets, carbon FRP sheets, or carbon FRP plates. In an attempt to attain failure of the beams due to FRP rupture, the anchorage of the beams was increased and a theoretical model was produced to select the beam design for this failure mode. The model also predicted the performance of the strengthened beams in order to determine appropriate sustained loading levels. After being subjected to 300 freeze-thaw cycles and almost 3 months of sustained loads, the beams were tested to failure. It was found that the beams subjected to combined loads encountered virtually no losses in average ultimate strength. However, the greater inconsistency of the results for these beams relative to the control beams implies that lower guaranteed strengths should be used for design in situations where these conditions are present.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>People mentally represent information, objects, and events in a variety of ways.  The purpose of the present program of research was to investigate how culture affects the way people represent temporal information.  I hypothesized that increased temporal distance would lead Canadians to think more abstractly, and that this shift toward abstraction would be smaller, or non-existent, among Chinese.  To test this hypothesis, I ran three studies with 490 participants in Canada and China (237 Canadian participants and 253 Chinese participants).  In Study 1, Canadians preferred to describe actions more abstractly in the distant future than near future, and Chinese did not show this shift.  In Study 2, Canadians generated fewer categories in the distant future than in the near future, whereas Chinese did not differ across time.  In Study 3, Canadians recalled information about a target event either within two days after the event occurred or approximately two weeks later.  Consistent with my hypotheses, Canadians’ coded responses shifted toward abstraction with increased temporal distance, and Chinese did not show such a shift. A meta-analysis based on all three studies revealed that Canadians mentally represent distal events and objects more abstractly and in a less detailed way than proximal events and objects, and that Chinese showed no time effect.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives: To investigate differences between hip abductor muscle strength, hip and knee adduction moments and knee joint alignment in people with moderate/severe and mild medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA), and people without OA, and identify variables explaining variance in knee adduction moment in participants with OA. Background: It has been suggested that weakness of hip abductor muscles may lead to displacement of the centre of mass of body away from the stance limb during gait, resulting in increased knee adduction moment, a predictor of disease progression. Methods: Participants with medial compartment knee OA were divided into moderate/severe (n=23) and mild OA groups (n=15) based on radiographic grading. Control subjects were recruited to match participants in the moderate/severe group for age and gender (n=23). Hip abductor and adductor muscle isometric strength was measured using the Biodex dynamometer. Gait speed and hip and knee peak adduction moments and percentage of the stance phase where these occurred were obtained using a three dimensional motion analysis system and two force platforms. Knee alignment and severity of OA were measured from radiographs. Statistics: Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine group differences. Stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify the variables which contribute to variation in knee adduction moment. Results: Moderate/severe OA group participants had higher body mass index (BMI) than the mild OA and control group (p=0.01) and greater varus alignment compared to the control group (p&lt;0.01). There was no difference between the mean hip abductor and adductor muscle strength and hip and knee adduction moments among the three groups. Peak hip (p=0.02) and knee adduction moments (p&lt;0.05) occurred later in stance phase of gait in the moderate/severe OA group as compared to control group. Knee joint alignment (26%), hip abductor muscle isometric strength (20%), gait speed (16%) and hip adduction moment (11%) explained 73% of variance in the knee adduction moment in the participants with OA. Conclusion: Findings from this study do not support the theory that weakness of the hip abductor muscles contributes to higher knee adduction moments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The aims of this work were two-fold.&#xD;
	&#xD;
The first part of this thesis involves the synthesis of the Brookhart’s diimine catalyst [Pd(N-N)Me(Et2O)]+ (1) (N-N = (2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3)-N=CH2CH2=N-(2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3)) and an investigation of its insertion behaviour with the polar monomer acrylonitrile (AN), as well as its copolymerization behaviour with ethylene. Acrylonitrile displaces the ethyl ether ligand of Brookhart’s cationic complex [Pd(N-N)Me(Et2O)]+ (1) to form the N-bonded species [Pd(N-N)Me(AN)]+ (2) which exists as two equilibrating rotamers (2a and 2b). On heating, [Pd(N-N)Me(AN)]+ which appears to undergo 2,1-insertion, presumably via an unobserved 2 isomer, to give the new complex, [Pd(N-N)(CH(CN)CH2CH3)(AN)]+ (3) which apparently undergoes subsequent -hydrogen elimination to give a hydride which then reacts further with AN to give a cyanoethyl complex (5). Although [Pd(N-N)Me(AN)]+ does behave as a typical Brookhart ethylene polymerization catalyst, it does not catalyze AN polymerization and added AN suppresses ethylene polymerization. [Pd(N-N)Me(AN)]+ does not copolymerize ethylene and acrylonitrile.&#xD;
	The second part of this thesis involves utilizing the early metal catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 (Ind = C9H7) /methylaluminoxane (MAO) to copolymerize propylene or ethylene and the compounds CH2=CH(CH2)7CH2OR {R = Me, (A); PhCH2, (B); Ph3C, (C); Me3Si, (D); Ph3Si, (E)}, all ethers of 9-decen-1-ol. The results showed new copolymer materials of up to 2.0 mol % of incorporated polar monomer into polypropylene and 1.2 mol % for polyethylene. All materials were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy. It was found that the increasing bulkiness of protecting groups did not increase the amount of polar monomer within the copolymers obtained. As a control, propylene-1-hexene copolymerization results were found to be comparable to those results of the polar monomer copolymerization results (up to 2.9 mol % of 1-hexene incorporated).&#xD;
	Furthermore, 1H NMR monitoring reactions of the homopolymerization of these vinyl and silyl ethers (A - E) were investigated with the zwitterionic compound G [Cp2ZrMe][MeB(C6F5)3] (Cp = C5H5). It was found that the protecting groups were effective in protecting the functional group from poisoning the catalyst. &#xD;
Finally, the "aging" of MAO by heating, removing trimethylaluminum (TMA) or adding water content all proved to contribute adversely in copolymerization results, whereas adding oxygen content proved to have little effect.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Lower Parmeener Supergroup consists of 500 to 900 metres of marine and terrigenous sedimentary rocks, deposited in the high-latitude Tasmania Basin during the late Carboniferous to middle Permian, at the end of the late Paleozoic ice age.  Two bioclastic carbonate units, the Darlington and Berriedale limestones, are of particular interest due to their formation in this polar, cold-water environment.  Both limestones contain ice-rafted debris scattered throughout, signifying numerous icebergs, and are under- and over-lain by glendonitic siltstone indicating near-freezing seawater.  Despite the unusual environment, seawater in the Permian Tasmania Basin was, with the exception of an anomalously high 13C value, isotopically and chemically similar to modern seawater.&#xD;
&#xD;
These limestones consist of a high-abundance, low-diversity heterozoan assemblage, dominated by large, robust brachiopods, bryozoans, and Eurydesma bivalves.  Sponge spicules and crinoids are locally important constituents.  The carbonates are interpreted to have been deposited in mid-shelf environments during sea-level highstands, where the faunal communities were beyond the depths of grounding icebergs, and sufficiently outboard from terrigenous sediment influx and brackish water.  Growth and preservation of biogenic carbonates were promoted by up-welling of nutrient-rich water, which sustained high levels of primary productivity in the water column and phosphate concentrations in the sediment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Lower Parmeener Supergroup carbonates were exposed to a complex series of diagenetic processes, commencing on the seafloor and continuing during rapid burial.  Limestone composition was further modified by diagenetic fluids associated with the intrusion of Mesozoic igneous rocks.  Alteration in the marine paleoenvironment was both destructive and constructive; although dissolution took place there was also coeval precipitation of fibrous calcite cement, phosphate, and glauconite.  These processes are interpreted to have been promoted by mixing of marine waters and enabled by microbial degradation of organic matter.  In contrast, meteoric diagenesis was insignificant, being confined to minor dissolution and localized cementation, although mechanical compaction was ubiquitous.  Chemical compaction was instigated at burial to depths of approximately 150 m, and promoted extensive precipitation of ferroan calcite.  Diagenesis may well have ended here, except for the subsequent intrusion of massive Mesozoic diabases and associated injection of silicifying fluids into the limestones.  Finally, fractures associated with Cretaceous uplift were filled with late-stage non-ferroan calcite cement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, increased focus has been placed on the role of intrauterine infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of fetal brain injury leading to neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy. At present, the mechanisms by which inflammatory processes during pregnancy cause this effect on the fetus are poorly understood.  Our previous work has indicated an association between experimentally-induced intrauterine infection, increased proinflammatory cytokines, and increased white matter injury in the guinea pig fetus.  In order to further elucidate the pathways by which inflammation in the maternal system or the fetal membranes leads to fetal impairment, a number of studies investigating aspects of the disease process have been performed.  These studies represent a body of work encompassing novel research and results in a number of human and animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Using a guinea pig model of inflammation, increased amniotic fluid proinflammatory cytokines and fetal brain injury were found after a maternal inflammatory response was initiated using endotoxin.  In order to more closely monitor the fetal response to chorioamnionitis, a model using the chronically catheterized fetal ovine was carried out.  This study demonstrated the adverse effects on fetal white matter after intrauterine exposure to bacterial inoculation, though the physiological parameters of the fetus were relatively stable throughout the experimental protocol, even when challenged with intermittent hypoxic episodes. &#xD;
&#xD;
The placenta is an important mediator between mother and fetus during gestation, though its role in the inflammatory process is largely undefined.  Studies on the placental role in the inflammatory process were undertaken, and the limited ability of proinflammatory cytokines and endotoxin to cross the placenta are detailed herein. &#xD;
&#xD;
Neurodevelopmental disorders can be monitored in animal models in order to determine effective disease models for characterization of injury and use in therapeutic strategies.  Our characterizations of postnatal behaviour in the guinea pig model using motility monitoring and spatial memory testing have shown small but significant differences in pups exposed to inflammatory processes in utero. &#xD;
&#xD;
The data presented herein contributes a breadth of knowledge to the ongoing elucidation of the pathways by which fetal brain injury occurs.  Determining the pathway of damage will lead to discovery of diagnostic criteria, while determining the vulnerabilities of the developing fetus is essential in formulating therapeutic options.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis superconducting correlations on both a one-dimensional chain and a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice are analyzed using the t-J model Hamiltonian. Both systems use periodic boundary conditions and different electron fillings, and both are solved numerically using the Lanczos algorithm. In order to search for superconducting correlations in the ground state the pair-pair correlation and susceptibility functions are defined. In one dimension the correlation function, at lower electronic fillings, displayed appreciable, non-zero values for all pair-pair separations. In general, the one-dimensional results were consistent with the literature. However, the honeycomb results did not show such strong superconducting correlations, as the correlation function remained close to zero for most separation distances.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Maladaptive decision-making that typifies drug addiction could reflect alterations in cognitive and emotional processing when these individuals are faced with choices. Even if this is true, it is not clear whether these deficits are a cause or a consequence of chronic drug use. The following experiments were designed to determine the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on affective processing in healthy individuals, as measured through a variety of behaviours. In the first experiment, acute alcohol intoxication did not impair performance on a task that recruits the orbitofrontal cortex, a key area for decision-making. In the second experiment examining preference formation, there was a clear dissociation between alcohol’s effect on implicit and explicit memory: acute intoxication impaired explicit memory, while leaving implicit learning intact. In a subsequent experiment, both alcohol and placebo groups showed altered physiological and subjective responses to a psychosocial stressor. Although acute alcohol intoxication did not affect risk-taking, an individual variable (tension-reactivity) moderated performance on this laboratory task. This experiment also revealed a relationship between stress-reactivity and subsequent risk-taking, one explanation being that high levels of cortisol increased individual sensitivity to task outcomes. Finally, an analysis of the accumulated information on drinking rates, impulsivity, and drug use suggests that female drinking rates may be approaching the levels reported by males. There were also significant differences in sensitivity to alcohol’s effects when participants were intoxicated in the lab. Heavy drinkers showed a greater sensitivity to the pleasurable effects of alcohol despite feeling less intoxicated and desiring more alcohol than other individuals. These combined effects could put heavy drinkers at greater risk for alcohol-related problems. Taken as a whole, these studies suggest that individual factors play a stronger role in moderating affective processing than do the direct pharmacological effects of alcohol.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During the last decade, Japanese cuisine has become firmly rooted in Canada. The once unusual sounding dishes such as sushi, tempura, and edamame are now familiar to most Canadians. Indeed, Japanese restaurants make up a substantial portion of Toronto’s diverse foodscape, yet little is known about how this culinary culture is understood, how the constructed image is created, and the identities that are produced through its production and consumption. This dissertation aims to unpack the constructed identities of the cosmopolitan and the “Oriental Other” contained within Japanese culinary circuits in Toronto, while also examining the connections, constructions, and negotiations concealed within the Japanese restaurants’ cultural landscape. It seeks to highlight the processes of racialization, Whiteness, and the articulation of difference that are interconnected and interdependent on the production and consumption of Japanese food in Toronto’s restaurants. Through this process, cultural differences are mapped out, allowing Japanese cuisine to become an accessible and readily available place to search for cosmopolitan identity making and the performance of Otherness. To this aim, in-depth interviews were conducted with residents of Toronto and chefs of Japanese ethnic origin. Both groups emphasize the relations between food providers and consumers, authenticity strategies, and their imaginative geographies of Japanese culinary culture but had remarkably different interpretations on how these constructions are practiced, articulated, and ultimately understood.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An estimated 5-10% of breast cancers are hereditary in nature and are due to the presence of a mutation in a breast cancer predisposition gene; approximately half of these cases possess a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Many BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations result in a truncated protein and hence are unequivocally disease-causing. However another class of mutations, the Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS), are more problematic as the effect of these mutations on protein function is unclear. The inability to classify these mutations as disease causing generates significant problems in risk evaluation, counseling and preventive care. Accordingly we sought to determine whether carriers of either a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation could be identified from non-carriers based on the gene expression patterns of non-cancerous cells. &#xD;
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines established from BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers and normal individuals were obtained through the NIH Breast Cancer Family Registries. Cell lines were mock-irradiated or treated with ionizing radiation (2 Gy). Following a recovery period of 6 hours total RNA was extracted and whole genome gene expression profiling was carried out. Molecular classifiers comparing the baseline expression profiles and the radiation-dependent expression profiles of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers to control individuals were created using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) coupled with a recursive feature removal (RFR) algorithm. &#xD;
Our results suggest that cell populations derived from BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers display unique expression phenotypes from those of control individuals in both the basal and radiation-induced cases. In the task of classification using baseline expression, the BRCA1-classifier correctly classified 15/18 test samples using feature selection based on the training set only, while feature selection using the entire dataset (AD) improved classification to 16/18 samples. The BRCA2-baseline classifier correctly classified 13/17 and 14/17 (AD) samples, respectively. In the task of radiation-dependent classification, the BRCA1-IR classifier correctly classified 12/18 and 16/18 (AD) test samples respectively while the BRCA2-IR classifier correctly classified 13/17 and 16/17 (AD) test samples respectively. These results suggest the possibility of development of this assay into a novel hereditary breast cancer screening diagnostic able to accurately identify the presence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations via a functional assay thereby improving patient outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis three circuits are presented that demonstrate the creation and manipulation of various phases over a large bandwidth.  Many systems demand the interoperability of various circuit blocks over a large frequency range in order to minimize costs.  In addition, the use of low resistivity silicon facilitates a further reduction in costs.  The circuits presented in this thesis demonstrate both these key concepts by using the conventional CMOS process in addition to operating over large bandwidths which is ideal for inclusion in any number of standard wireless systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
A new novel balun is proposed that achieves wideband performance through the use of an external compensating capacitor to counter the effects of parasitic capacitances that reduce its effective bandwidth.  An input stage common gate amplifier is then used to improve the return loss and provide additional gain.  The fabricated active balun using the proposed circuit shows that the device performs with a 7.5 GHz bandwidth.  In addition an excellent 16 dB return loss, -5.8 dBm compression point and 12 mW power consumption are also reported. &#xD;
&#xD;
Following this, an inductorless quadrature oscillator is proposed using an artificial resonator composed of conventional OTA circuits in order to increase the tuning range.  The measured tuning range was found to be 100 MHz.  This circuit demonstrates the ability to use a synthetic resonator circuit as a method of achieving wide tuning.  The measured phase noise of -97.7 dBc/Hz is on par with other inductorless oscillators found in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally a wideband feedback quadrature generator is presented.  Existing circuits do not provide a wide frequency of operation and in addition are highly susceptible to variances in component values used.  The result is that the fabricated system will not operate at its intended operating frequency.  In order to mitigate this problem a RC-CR network was used in conjunction with two variable gain amplifiers that uses a feedback network to actively compensate the amplitude imbalance over a large frequency range.  This new design first is of its kind and the resulting circuit is measured to have over a 4 GHz bandwidth while maintaining a +/- 1 dB amplitude balance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates one of the staples of academic literature on combat motivation, S.LA. Marshall's “ratio of fire,” through the examination of previously untouched primary-source documentation from the Second World War. This evidence, a series of Battle Experience Questionnaires filled out by combat infantry officers of the Canadian Army in 1944 and 1945, details a wide range of tactical issues experienced by soldiers in battle. The interpretation and implications of this data for the “ratio of fire” theory is discussed, as the questionnaires make detailed inquiry into weapon use, infantry&#xD;
co-operation with other arms, and general combat effectiveness. The thesis concludes&#xD;
that this documentary evidence strongly supports the idea that, at the least, Marshall's “ratio of fire” statements are inapplicable to the Canadian experience of the Second World War, and that the body of literature based upon Marshall's conclusions deserves a critical re-examination.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Humour and Irony are identity markers that have long since been associated with Sub-Saharan francophone literary works. Intimately linked to Africa throughout the years, humour and irony have evolved hand to hand with socio-political situation of the continent and fulfill several functions: denouncing through laughter, varying sorts of injustices, playing down the tragic nature of a given situation and subverting individual or collective values. However, and perhaps more importantly, humour and irony belong the category of what Roland Barthes calls "verbal expedients" which allow a writer to avoid common and inadequat usage of language. In this way, we show by using the theorical frameworks of Bergson, Schopenhauer, Jankelevitch, Escarpit and Genette among many others just how humour and irony create a particular vision, one that shows the multiple ways in which we can perceive the world around us. They make possible the representation of what is undeniably real and bring out polysemous meannings(s) in that which may at first appear incongruous. &#xD;
Given the numerous interpretations that humour and irony offer for a given situation, theses devices thus constitute strategies that build different esthetics within the novel as a literary genre. The latter becomes a sort of semantic playgroung where the specific forms of humour and irony develop: parody, derision, sarcasm,the grotesque and the farce. It is in this way that a veritable "poetics oflaughter" becomes apparent within the novels that we have examined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Flameless combustion in a 48 kW pilot scale furnace fired with natural gas is studied&#xD;
experimentally and computationally. The burner geometry involved a tunnel furnace with two separate feed streams --- one for a high momentum air jet and the other for a low momentum fuel jet. This burner configuration, called a Strong-Jet/Weak-Jet (SJWJ) burner, together with the jetto-&#xD;
jet interactions generate the flameless combustion mode with relatively uniform furnace gas temperature distributions and low NOX emissions. Experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions for turbulent reactive mixing in order to obtain local temperature and gas concentrations. The experimental findings were used to test the performance of CFD numerical models for turbulence, mixing and chemical reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
For the SJWJ furnace operated in flameless combustion mode, 32 different flow cases were&#xD;
examined to assess the effects of the three main parameters (fuel/air momentum flux ratio, fuel/air nozzle separation distance and fuel injection angle) on the furnace wall temperature profile. Three specific flow configurations were selected for detailed near-field temperature&#xD;
measurements. The gas temperature distribution inside the combustion chamber was found to be relatively uniform, a characteristic of flameless combustion. Four flow configurations were studied to examine the effect of the fuel jet injection angle (0 degrees or 10 degrees) and fuel/air&#xD;
momentum flux ratio (0.0300 and 0.0426) on the mixing, combustion performance and NOX&#xD;
emissions. Gas compositions were measured in the flue gas and within the furnace at selected locations to estimate the concentrations of CO2 CO, CH4, O2, NO and NOX. The NOX concentrations in the flue gas were quite low, ranging from 7 - 13 ppm, another characteristic of flameless combustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
The combusting flow CFD calculations were carried out using the k-ε turbulence model and the eddy-dissipation model for methane-air-2-step reactions to predict the temperature and concentration field. The numerical results for gas temperature and compositions of CH4, O2 and CO2 generally showed good agreement with the experimental data. The predicted CO concentration profiles followed expected trends but the experimental data were generally underpredicted. The NOX concentrations were estimated through post-processing and these results were significantly underpredicted.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis reports on a qualitative study of student interactions in one grade seven mathematics classroom as the students worked through a series of tasks exploring multiple uses of variables.  Student tasks were planned out by me, as the teacher and the researcher, and they were executed in my classroom, where I had worked to create a constructivist classroom environment.  This study posed two research questions: (1) In what ways do student interactions during group activities promote the development of individual and collective understanding of the concept of variable? and (2) In what ways do student interactions during whole-class discussions promote the development of individual and collective understanding of the concept of variable?&#xD;
	I used research methods in which I was a participant.  Data was collected in the form of audio taped discussions for the participants (working in three groups of four). Audio files of class discussions were accumulated and stored for later review.  Written student work and reflections were collected for all class members at the time of the study. From these data sources, the relevant data set emerged.  &#xD;
Analysis came in the form of thick description of eight episodes of importance in which the multiple data sources came together to highlight how student interactions in the form of negotiations may have promoted a shift in understanding of variable. The data showed the complex nature of student interactions along with the potential benefits to student learning.  The data showing these benefits were outlined as three patterns of negotiations.  These were:  negotiations with other students, negotiations with self, and negotiations with the teacher.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examined the personal and professional experiences of Canadian professional female popular musicians. The researcher gathered data in two phases. In phase one, 85 female musicians completed a 105-question on-line survey. In phase two, the researcher interviewed four musicians to expand and elucidate survey data. In keeping with a critical feminist approach, the researcher’s voice is prominent in the report. The study reveals a complex combination of personal and professional circumstances that both compel and impel women to become musicians, and then to cleave to or to abandon careers in the music industry. Families, peers, role models, and teachers all have some effect on personal and professional choices that musicians make. Gender stereotyping and sexual harassment prevail in both music education and the music industry, making these contested sites for women musicians. However, respondents’ identity as “musician” is a powerful force, in both personal and professional realms, making both education and industry also sites of triumph. Important findings include: respondents’ reflections on what makes for a successful pop musician; data revealed no essential biographical precursors for success in pop music; respondents’ opinions about the importance of music lessons are divided; and, along with credible technical music skills, musicians need to develop strong personal, social, and business skills.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Analytical and numerical modelling studies were conducted to assess the performance of thermal conductive heating (TCH) systems for the purpose of contaminated site remediation.  Modelling was conducted in a fractured bedrock environment containing a system of parallel, equally-spaced horizontal fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
A semi-analytical solution to the two-dimensional heat conduction equation was developed and used to study temperature distributions between two thermal wells.  A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the relative importance of hydrogeological parameters (hydraulic gradient, fracture aperture, fracture spacing) and rock material properties (density, thermal conductivity, heat capacity).  Hydrogeological parameters were far more important than rock material properties in determining treatment zone temperature distributions.  Knowledge of the bulk groundwater influx may be sufficient to predict the temperature within the treatment zone for low to moderate values of influx.&#xD;
&#xD;
To further the analysis, numerical modelling was employed.  A three-dimensional domain was constructed, representing a symmetrical portion of a heater well cluster.  Simulations were run for different combinations of bulk permeability, fracture spacing, matrix permeability, and matrix porosity.  Flow concentration in fractures had a significant effect on treatment zone temperature distributions when bulk permeability was high.  For low values of bulk permeability, the minimum treatment zone temperature changed by less then 7% when modelling the fractured medium as an equivalent homogeneous porous medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Fracture spacing significantly influenced the time needed reach complete steam saturation, even in cases where it did not affect temperature distributions.  A pressure rise may occur in the matrix as water expands thermally, elevating the boiling point of water.  The magnitude of the pressure rise is affected by the distance to the nearest fracture, as well as the matrix permeability and porosity.  For a given bulk permeability, the time needed to reach complete steam saturation will be lengthened by an increase in fracture spacing, an increase in matrix porosity, or a decrease in matrix permeability.  Of these parameters, the matrix permeability is the most significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
The time needed to reach complete steam saturation in the matrix cannot be predicted if the fracture spacing, matrix permeability, and porosity are not known.  Further, a clear temperature plateau is not observed during boiling in the matrix, posing a difficulty in monitoring thermal treatment, where temperature measurements may be the only information available.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There has been a longstanding fascination with motorcycling culture in popular mainstream North American media, but this culture has only recently become the focus of rigorous, contextualized academic research. While smaller research projects have studied specific aspects of motorcycling culture, few academic researchers have investigated the exclusionary discourses that underpin motorcycling culture and none have done so in a methodical manner. Using a series of columns published over a thirty-five year period in the popular Canadian motorcycle magazine, Cycle Canada, I have analyzed the discourses through which motorcycling culture comes to have meaning to its participants and I have elucidated the socio-historical understandings of masculinity that are present in North American motorcycling culture.&#xD;
This thesis provides a historical sociological analysis of motorcycling discourse through a feminist lens. I view gender as a relation that must constantly be (re)negotiated amongst socially constituted subjects and I pay particular attention to how technological discourse is made socially durable and sustainable by the interface of material (motorcycles) and organic (human) beings. &#xD;
Longitudinal analysis of Cycle Canada illustrates the presence of heteronormative discourses that constrain readers' choices of gender identification and sexual orientation to traditional notions of masculinity. In an effort to create solidarity with their readers, the magazine editors cater to the perceived interests of an idealized male audience by performing these masculine identities. Though motorcycling culture in Canada is increasingly diverse, Cycle Canada has only begun to reflect this diversity in the past two years of publication. Explicating the social, political, economic, technological and historical context which gave rise to particular masculine identities in motorcycling culture allows us to focus on the positive agency involved in the performance of masculine identities, while still recognizing that there remains room to include other figurations of identity beyond traditional concepts of heteronormativity and homosociality.</dcterms:abstract>

The purpose of the research was to investigate: (a) How do teachers and peers mediate the participation of students with LD in collaborative, guided inquiry science activities, (b) What learning processes do students with LD participate in during collaborative, guided inquiry science activities, and (c) What components of social competence support and constrain the participation of students with LD during collaborative, guided inquiry science activities?&#xD;
The findings of the study suggest five key ideas for research and teaching in collaborative, guided inquiry science in inclusive classrooms. First, using a variety of collaborative learning formats (whole-class, small-group, and pairs) creates more opportunities for the successful participation of diverse students with LD. Second, creating an inclusive community where students feel accepted and valued may enhance the academic and social success of students with LD. Third, careful selection of partners for students with LD is important for a positive learning experience. Students with LD should be partnered with academically successful, socially competent peers; also, this study suggested that students with LD experience more success working collaboratively in pairs rather than in small groups. Fourth, a variety of strategies are needed to promote active participation and positive social interactions for students with and without LD during collaborative, guided inquiry learning. Fifth, adopting a general approach to teaching collaborative inquiry that crosses curriculum borders may enhance success of inclusive teaching practices.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Near surface mounted (NSM) FRP reinforcement has recently emerged as a promising alternative technology for strengthening concrete structures in both flexure and shear, as opposed to externally bonded FRP strengthening systems.  Available research to date has focused primarily on overall member behaviour and/or the various parameters that affect the bond performance of either rectangular NSM strips or round NSM bars.  No research has apparently focused on the effect of low or high temperature exposure on NSM FRP performance.  It has been suggested by numerous researchers that NSM FRP reinforcement may outperform externally bonded FRP strengthening systems at elevated temperatures, but this assertion has yet to be supported by test results.  An extensive review of NSM FRP technology is presented.  The results of an experimental program conducted on twenty-three (23) concrete NSM FRP strengthened slab strips are presented to investigate their high (up to 200˚C) and low (-26˚C) temperature flexural performance.  The effect of using one of two different adhesive systems (epoxy and cement-based) and two different NSM groove widths (6.4 mm and 3.2 mm) is also studied.  An innovative photo imaging instrumentation technique is validated against traditional instrumentation techniques for the first time in NSM flexural testing.  A numerical layer model is presented and compared against test results. It is demonstrated that low temperature exposure has no measurable negative effects on the flexural performance of the slab strips tested.  From high temperature exposures, it is shown that the cementitious adhesive outperforms the epoxy adhesive system, allowing the strengthening system to remain structurally effective for more than 5 hours at 100°C under sustained loads.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The long-term goal of this study is to improve the ability of designers and prosthetists to match the mechanical characteristics of prosthetic feet to patient specific parameters, including, needs, abilities and biomechanical characteristics. While patient measures of performance are well developed, there is a need to develop a practical method by which non-linear and time-dependent mechanical properties of the prosthetic component can be measured. In this study, testing methodologies were developed that separately evaluated the elastic and time-dependent properties. Three styles of feet were tested to span the range of designs of interest: a standard solid ankle cushioned heel (SACH) foot, two energy return feet for active users and a new prosthetic foot designed to provide partial energy return.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first testing regime involved mechanically characterizing prostheses under conditions similar to gait. The heels and toes of four sample feet were loaded to peak forces based on their design mass at a series of angles and forces that the prosthetic system would go through during the gait cycle, based on the waveform in ISO 22675. Tangential stiffnesses of the samples were determined using numerical differentiation. The force-displacement responses of prosthetic feet reflect increasing stiffnesses with increasing loads and a decreasing pylon angle. Key features reflecting foot design are: the relative stiffness of the heel and toe and the displacement gap at midstance. Stable feet tend to exhibit lower heel stiffnesses and higher toe stiffnesses, whereas dynamics energy return (DER) feet tend to exhibit higher heel stiffnesses and lower toe stiffnesses. The differences in heel and toe loading at midstance suggest that DER feet can aid in the transition from heel to toe, providing a smooth rollover whereas SACH feet provide greater stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
A second testing regime examined the time-dependent properties of the heel and toe. A three-parameter reduced relaxation response of the form   was able to capture the force-relaxation characteristics with RMS differences ranging from 0.0006 to 0.0119. In this model, A is the initial decay, B is the decay coefficient, a linear decay term, and τ is a time constant. While the model is practical for comparing various prostheses at a single load level, a fully non-linear model is required to model the time-dependent response at all loading levels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research examines loyalty marketing as an empirical case study of consumer surveillance. Focusing on the Canadian context, the research investigates the relationship between the personal information economy and loyalty marketing through several interrelated perspectives. These are marketing and business literature, theoretical frameworks of surveillance, the branding of consumers and corporations, consumer ambivalence towards surveillance and privacy issues, and the mutual shaping of consumers and these programs. These interrelated yet distinctive perspectives provide different means to understand loyalty programs as information portals in the increasingly monitored, measured and marketed lives of consumers. They are a means of surveillance through which corporations systematically collect consumption data in order to influence, manage, entitle, or control consumers (Lyon 2001). &#xD;
The research is based on interviews with loyalty program executives, international survey results, and focus groups to both describe the relationship between corporate information processing and consumers as well as the current and potential social effects and issues embedded in this relationship. Loyalty programs are seen as an important means for conceptualizing contemporary marketing practices, the use of personal information, and personal identity in an information oriented society. They are a complex manifestation of a ‘knowing capitalism’ (Thrift 2005) that has implications far beyond the accumulation of points and the ‘reward yourself’ appeal of participation by contributing to a cultural consumption circuit that perpetuates and reinforces already existing socio-economic differences.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation studies interlocking representations of travel and drugs in contemporary American, British, and Canadian novels, exploring how those thematics alternately destabilize and assuage subjectivity, genre, and the perception of space.  Following a prefatory chapter, Chapters Two and Three serve as a two-part introduction.  The first part articulates a theoretical lens I designate by enclosing the word “tripping,” a colloquialism for a drug experience, in quotation marks.  Through this lens, I examine travel and drugs in contemporary fiction indebted to sixties counterculture.  In Chapter Three, I examine the work of William S. Burroughs and Aldous Huxley, contextualizing their mid-twentieth-century travel and drugs as foundational to later twentieth-century “tripping.”&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter Four treats Huxley’s novel, Island, as a revision of the foundations I outline in the previous chapter; his instantiation and critique of utopia via “tripping” help conceptualize the psychedelic experience as protective spatial movement – physical mobility instead of psychedelic fungibility – in the service of preserving a stable sense of self.  Chapter Five discusses Alex Garland’s The Beach, in which drugs reveals the limitations of utopian thought by underscoring the paradoxical notion of immobility hidden within the supposed freedom of mobility.  In these novels, Huxley and Garland depict travel as a key to the process of rendering psychedelic intoxication knowable in familiar terms.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Chapters Six and Seven, in exploring Hunter S. Thompson and Robert Sedlack, shift toward defamiliarizing conventional modes of travel using some of the radical possibilities of drug intoxication.  Chapter Six examines Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a text which, instead of attempting to understand inassimilable drug experiences by spatializing the drugged mind, explores mind-alteration as a way of understanding the postmodern space of Las Vegas that emerges following the demise of the counterculture.  Chapter Seven constructs a reading of Sedlack’s The African Safari Papers, examining ways its representation of self-conscious tourism, inflected by intoxication and Thompson-inspired excess, deploys the figures of the shaman and of animals to complicate conventional understandings of tourism.  Thompson and Sedlack explore how the subjectivities of domestic and global tourists are reshaped by, rather than resist, the radical alterity introduced by the drug experience.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Allatostatins (ASTs) are neuropeptides that inhibit the biosynthesis and release of juvenile hormone from the corpora allata (CA) of various insects including the cockroach Diploptera punctata. We hypothesized that a similar allatostatin receptor would exist in the cockroach D. punctata that may regulate the numerous physiological effects that this family of peptides exerts on a range of target tissues. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies successful in isolating other insect allatostatin receptor sequences utilized primers designed to known mammalian somatostatin receptors and Drosophila allatostatin receptor (AlstR). Once an internal PCR fragment was proven to be consistent with the sequence of an allatostatin receptor (AstR) then the sequence was completed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The putative allatostatin-like receptor sequence encoding 425 amino acid residues was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from corpora allata of D. punctata. &#xD;
&#xD;
We show that dsRNA targeting the allatostatin receptor gene of D. punctata injected into freshly moulted adult cockroaches produced a long-lasting reduction in the mRNA levels in midgut tissues. The effect lasted up to 6 days. Following dsRNA injection, the juvenile hormone (JH) titers in the corpora allata were clearly raised suggest that the putative inhibition of receptor RNA expression may increase JH production. &#xD;
&#xD;
The receptor is expressed in brains, corpora allata, abdominal ganglion, midguts, ovaries, and testes. We have examined these same tissues with regard to changes in expression levels of Dippu-AstR. JH biosynthesis peaks on day 5 post-emergence in mated females. In mated females, Dippu-AstR mRNA is expressed at the highest levels on day 6 post-emergence in brain and corpora allata and day 2 post-emergence in midgut. Dippu-AstR is likely responsible for the decline in JH biosynthesis after day 5 post-emergence. Virgin females midgut and CA Dippu-AstR mRNA expression dramatically elevated on days 6 and 7, respectively. Expression of Dippu-AstR was similar in the abdominal ganglia of mated or virgin females. Ovarian Dippu-AstR expression declines to low levels by day 4. Testes also express peaks of Dippu-AstR expression on days 4 and 7. A role for Dippu-AST in testes is yet unknown.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Traditionally, optimization of drill and blast practices have taken place with sole respect to minimizing mine unit cost (as opposed to the operation as a whole), whilst maintaining fragmentation at a level that is considered “acceptable” to mine operations.  Judgments as to “acceptable” are largely based on qualitative measures and the consequences of varying blast practices on subsequent downstream processes are secondary.  The objective of this work was to evaluate both the technical and economic consequences of blast practices on comminution processes at the Kemess South Project.  Computer modeling indicates that without changes to crusher operating parameters, there does not appear to be much room for improving the performance of the comminution circuit.  This indicates that current blasting at the mine is at or near optimal for the mill’s current configuration.&#xD;
Experiments to attempt to detect the effect of blasting on the crushability and grindability of rock were carried out on several different samples, including a copper-gold porphyry ore from Kemess Mine, taconite from Minnesota, granodiorite from the Kingston area, and limestone from the Kingston area. The main focus of this study was the Kemess ore.  Examining rock samples from blasted and un-blasted ore, the samples that were blasted showed a significant increase in the density of very small cracks within individual fragments, which would indicate that they should break more easily during crushing and grinding.  Drop-weight impact tests investigating the grindability of these samples suggested that there was improved performance with blasting effort, although the difference between some samples was not statistically significant. Preliminary testing of the taconite and the limestone indicated that crushability and grindability may be improved by blasting.&#xD;
Using mineral processing simulation software, the second part of the study investigated the effects of changing the ore size distribution that is fed to the Kemess Primary crusher.  It was concluded that the Kemess Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) mill throughput could be increased by increasing fragmentation and making adjustments to the primary crusher closed side set to take advantage of the increased fragmentation.  These changes were calculated to be economically advantageous.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This is a case study of the challenges and complexities of initiating a professional learning community of teachers.  Situated in a school in the British West Indies, this study draws on the experiences of seven teachers initiating a professional learning community (PLC) over a 12-week term in 2007.  Individual interviews, group meetings, journal entries, and exit comments were analyzed to construct five main themes: Initiating a PLC, Features of a PLC, Challenges of a PLC, Benefits of a PLC, and the Future of the PLC.&#xD;
These teachers recognized the need for this community because of challenges and problems they faced.  Many features reported in the literature on PLCs were present in this nascent PLC of teachers.  The teachers created their own shared vision and provided evidence of collective learning in the weekly meetings.  Participants developed trust and shared many personal practices and experiences of teaching.  &#xD;
Challenges to initiating a professional learning community included finding time to meet, a weak school culture, and barriers associated with immigration status.  Despite the challenges, there were many perceived benefits, including saving time through subject integration, personalizing professional development, and increasing socialization to reduce teachers' sense of professional isolation.  The teachers also displayed changes in attitudes towards teaching and how they approached teaching their classes.  Classes became more student-centred as teachers tried to meet the diverse needs of their students.  The promise of increased collaboration and membership at the conclusion of data collection failed to materialize when a new leader did not come forward.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis I describe a research study to further our understanding of the role of the evaluator as a facilitator of evaluative inquiry within organizations. I assumed dual roles as both the evaluator and the evaluation-use researcher to examine the effect of my behaviour on the evaluation of a dynamic organization. My approach as the evaluator was influenced by a decade of experience as a practising evaluator and by the insights I gained from my readings of organizational theory and three evaluation theories responsive, participatory, and developmental. &#xD;
&#xD;
My study of the nature, quality, and consequences of the evaluator/stakeholder interactions while participating in the process was anchored by approaches from the fields of educational research and organizational theory informed by complexity science. Using data generated from modifying the traditional case study method, including reflective journal entries related to my decision-making process, I generated critical episodes as a way of understanding the circumstances surrounding shifts in my behaviour. My iterative analysis of the critical episodes and the insights gained from them enabled me to track the transformations of the six personal evaluation principles that guided my evaluator approach and led to the creation of a seventh principle. The cross-case analysis revealed the evaluation process as a non-linear progression whereby the evaluator and the individual stakeholders engaged in establishing trust, fostering collaborations, and promoting learning. 	&#xD;
&#xD;
This study contributes three implications for evaluation practice including providing empirical data on what it means for an evaluator and individual stakeholder to develop close engagement through evaluative inquiry, bringing to the forefront the value of systematic and purposeful reflection as a means of enhancing the quality of this engagement, and pointing to the importance for evaluators continually integrating past experiences and new theoretical frameworks with understandings gleaned from close engagement. Finally, I posit a new approach documenting the complexity of the influence of the evaluator on shaping organizational and program development within the dynamic context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The experimental analysis of an autothermal gasoline reformer for use in an auxiliary power unit was undertaken. The development of these auxiliary power units has the potential to create positive economical and environmental benefits. It will provide the necessary energy and heating while utilizing a fuel with a well established infrastructure. Autothermal reforming is a process in which both oxygen and steam are&#xD;
combined with a hydrocarbon fuel over a catalyst bed in order to produce a hydrogen rich gas stream. This process utilizes an exothermic partial oxidation reaction to promote the hydrogen efficient, endothermic steam reforming reaction. The main goals of this study were to design and test the operating conditions of a new autothermal reformer and to determine an operational envelope for the reactor. Furthermore, the data collected was used to validate a numerical model of the reactor that would assist in the development of future compact autothermal reformers.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
A compact autothermal reformer has been designed with the capability to produce&#xD;
detailed wall and centerline temperature profiles during operation. During the&#xD;
experimental phase of this project, a strong relationship between the main input variables&#xD;
(the oxygen to carbon and steam to carbon ratios) and the performance characteristics of the reactor was found. For the range of experimental conditions tested, the highest molar percent of hydrogen in the reformate for a gas hourly space velocity of 20,000h-1 was found at an oxygen to carbon ratio of 1.0 and a steam to carbon ratio of 2.0. Performance characteristics used for the reactor were the lower heating value, the percent hydrogen yield and fuel conversion, and were found to have maximum values of 46.0%, 47.6% and 67.7% respectively. Carbon deposition on the catalyst bed was found to be significant under certain operating conditions, but had a very small effect on the final conditions of the ATR. The computational fluid dynamics model was shown to have fairly accurate predictions for the temperature profiles as well as the reformate compositions when compared to the experimental data. A number of recommendations have been made to the experimental and numerical studies. It is likely that if employed in future testing,&#xD;
they would improve the overall performance of the compact autothermal reformer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research explores the use of haiku poetry to connect with persons with dementia. The happenings during two one-hour sessions provide the main focus for this study. These sessions were part of an ongoing spiritual care program on the secure dementia unit of a long-term care facility. The sessions were co-facilitated by the chaplain who leads the ongoing program, and by myself as both guest poet and researcher. Haiku were used as prompts to reminiscence. Words and phrases from the stories that were spoken during the session became the building blocks for creating collaborative haiku within the group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
“Inferences all over” was spoken by a person with severe dementia and became a part of one of the collaborative haiku. This comment is remarkable for its association to poetry where the words on the page often only hint indirectly at a deeper meaning, and for its association to spirituality where the stories we tell often only hint at our deeper truth. The ambiguity around what is evident and what is implied paradoxically invites connection. The first chapter of this thesis, Beginning, describes the format of a haiku session where building connection is the primary intention. It also explores issues around the creative arts.&#xD;
&#xD;
“Inferences all over” also speaks to the hermeneutic phenomenological approach of this thesis, where the stories speak for themselves. These stories appear in the second chapter entitled During, along with insights gleaned from interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
“Inferences all over” well describes the third chapter, After, where I reflect on my experiences as a participant in this research, and where I detail some of the ripples of this study into the dementia care, haiku, and educational communities. &#xD;
&#xD;
“Their capacity to delight” in the thesis title was spoken by the chaplain who developed the spiritual care program. Her belief in the possibility of connection with persons with dementia forms the bedrock of the program—where hospitality invites connection and validation affirms their responses. This capacity has implications for all teaching—formal as well as informal—as it invites learning as an experience to enjoy rather than endure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The technological complexity of the ICU is often focused on saving lives however, it is frequently a place to support the dying. Because of the serious nature of critical illness, patients are unable to communicate their wishes, values and views.  Family members are often called upon to communicate the critically ill patients’ wishes and many report feeling burdened with the task. The distress described may lead to difficulty mobilizing coping mechanisms and may affect their ability to make appropriate decisions for their family member’s care.  Hence, an in depth understanding of the surrogate’s experience is critical to plan effective interventions and provide anticipatory guidance to support the process of making decisions around end of life care.&#xD;
Objective The purpose of the study is to describe the surrogate decision makers’ appraisals of the demands of decision making for a critically ill adult intensive care unit patient and the coping strategies employed by them during this experience.&#xD;
Method A descriptive study design using a qualitative interviewing approach extracted perceived stressors and coping strategies using systematic, focused thematic analysis guided by Folkman and Lazarus’ Stress and Coping Paradigm.&#xD;
Findings Respondents appraisals identified the following perceived stressors: doubt of self efficacy, unknowns, impingement of real life, and problematic relay of information.  The surrogates’ perception of their ability to manage the decision making process required their awareness of the decision making role and magnitude of illness, their need to form partnerships, time to reflect on prior discussions and experience, and their appraisal of the patients’ suffering.  Participants described emotion and problem based coping strategies they employed during the task.  To emotionally justify their decisions, surrogates’ referred to their understanding of patient wishes and sought solace and comfort from the health care staff.  In addition, surrogates used strategies to solve problems encountered including dealing with others, employing strategies to decrease their uncertainty and mobilizing time to process the events unfolding.&#xD;
Conclusions End of life decisions in the intensive care are complex and demanding. A better understanding of the process may guide health care professionals in developing focused interventions to assist surrogates through a painful process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research explores the identity reconstruction of graduate students in additional language (AL) contexts. It addresses not only the issue of language proficiency in self-representation, but also more complicated factors that influence self-positioning and perceived social positioning in an additional culture, as well as ways of establishing the self in academic writing. The research is grounded in language learning theories in second language education and identity theories in linguistics, sociology, and cultural studies. Eleven graduate students participated in the study, among whom five were international students at a Chinese university and six were Chinese students at a Canadian university. Data were drawn from a questionnaire, writing samples, interviews, and email correspondence. Commonalities and divergences were found between groups and within groups. I developed a framework of writer identity for AL graduate students prior to the study and modified it in the discussion. Based on the data, I elaborated on the connections of personal identity and writer identity, and conceptualized for AL speakers a mediated space incorporating home culture and host culture but going beyond the overlap of the two, as well as a mediated self that is achieved through negotiation with the available options in their respective social context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A detector with a target mass of 7 kg of liquid argon was designed, constructed and operated at Queen’s University. This detector is a scaled model for the DEAP project toward a tonne-scale argon detector to search for the WIMP candidate of the so far undetected, dark matter of the universe. The primary intent of the scaled detector was to measure the achievable level to reject background events by use of pulse shape discrimination, being based upon the scintillation timing properties of liquid argon. After refining the apparatus and components, the detector was in operation from the 20th of August until the 16th of October 2007 before being moved to its current location in SNOLAB. During this time, a population of 31 million well-tagged gamma events were collected, of which 15.8 million were in the energy range of interest for calibration. This population was sufficient to demonstrate the discrimination of background events by pulse shape discrimination at the level of 6.3 × 10-8. An analytical model was constructed, based on the scintillation processes and detector response, and has been sufficiently investigated to make predictions of further achievable discrimination.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced mode of high-&#xD;
precision radiation therapy that utilizes computer-controlled x-ray accelerators to&#xD;
deliver precise radiation doses to malignant tumors. The radiation dose is designed to&#xD;
conform to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of a tumor by modulating the intensity&#xD;
of the radiation beam to focus a higher radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing&#xD;
radiation exposure to surrounding normal tissue. One form of IMRT is known as&#xD;
tomotherapy. Tomotherapy achieves dose conformity to a tumor by modulating the&#xD;
intensity of a fan beam of radiation as the source revolves about a patient.&#xD;
Current available tomotherapy machines use x-ray linear accelerators (linacs)&#xD;
as a source of radiation. However, since linacs are technologically complex, the world-&#xD;
wide use of linac-based tomotherapy is limited. This thesis involves an investigation&#xD;
of Cobalt 60 (Co-60) based tomotherapy. The inherent simplicity of Co-60 has the&#xD;
potential to extend the availability of this technique to clinics throughout the world.&#xD;
The goal of this thesis is to generate two-dimensional (2-D) Co-60 tomotherapy con-&#xD;
formal dose distributions with a computer program and experimentally validate them&#xD;
on ¯lm using a ¯rst generation bench-top tomotherapy apparatus.&#xD;
The bench-top apparatus consists of a rotation-translation stage that can&#xD;
mimic a 2-D tomotherapy delivery by translating the phantom across a thin, "pencil-&#xD;
like" photon beam from various beam orientations. In this thesis, several random and&#xD;
clinical patterns are planned using an in-house inverse treatment planning system and&#xD;
are delivered on ¯lm using the tomotherapy technique. The delivered dose plans are&#xD;
compared with the simulated plans using the gamma dose comparison method. The&#xD;
results show a reasonably good agreement between the plans and the measurements,&#xD;
suggesting that Co-60 tomotherapy is indeed capable of providing state-of-the-art&#xD;
conformal dose delivery.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Acrylic free radical polymerization at high temperature proceeds via a complex set of mechanisms, with many rate coefficients poorly known and difficult to determine experimentally.  This problem is compounded by the large number of monomers used in industry to produce coatings and other materials.  Thus, there is a strong incentive to develop a methodology to estimate rate coefficients for these systems.  This study explores the application of computational chemistry to estimate radical addition rate coefficients for the copolymerization of acrylates, methacrylates and styrene.&#xD;
  &#xD;
The software package Gaussian is used to calculate heats of reaction (ΔHr) values for monomer additions to monomeric and dimeric radicals, using minimum energy structures identified and characterized for the reactants and products.  The Evans-Polanyi relationship is applied to estimate reactivity ratios from the relative differences in ΔHr.  The validity of this methodology is tested through a comparison of calculated monomer and radical reactivity ratios for acrylate, methacrylate, vinyl acetate, ethene and styrene systems to available experimental data for copolymerization systems. The methodology is found to work for some systems while there is computational breakdown in others due to steric crowding and/or breakdown of the Evans-Polanyi relationship.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>At the time of the Ghana’s independence in March 1957, a democratic system of government was instituted, but the process of political development was derailed and often interrupted by frequent coups. This is evident in the interchange of military and civilian regimes in the last fifty-one years. While in the post-independence era, the development of democracy, the party system and democratic institutions in Ghana has taken many twists and turns due to the persistent military interventions in politics, as part of the third-wave of democratization, in 1992, under Ghana’s Fourth Republic, a new democratic system was re-introduced in the country under the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government.  The opening of political spaces for the political parties and civil society organizations in the last two decades has witnessed the resurgence of political parties of different sizes and ideological orientation under various political traditions, which has led to the strengthening of Ghana’s party system.  &#xD;
This, in turn, has immensely facilitated the country’s democratic development, which was evidenced in the 2000 power alternation that led to the election of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) to power. Since the emergence of the third-wave of democratization, there have been numerous theoretical approaches by democratic transition and consolidation theorists on the role of political parties in the nurturing and consolidation of democracy in the third-wave countries. This study examines the internal organization of parties and their role in Ghana’s democratic transition and consolidation. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, it can be concluded that while the political parties have been the bedrock for Ghana’s democratic transition and consolidation processes, there are a number of key issues such as internal party democracy and candidate selection processes that needed to be resolved by the political parties in order to strengthen Ghana’s democratic consolidation process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Small proline-rich protein-2 (SPRR2) functions as a determinant of flexibility and permeability in the mature cornified envelope of the skin. SPRR2 is strongly upregulated by the commensal flora and may mediate signaling to differentiated epithelia of the small intestine and colon. Yet, SPRR2 function in the GI tract is largely unexplored. Using the Caco-2 model of intestinal epithelial differentiation along the crypt-villus axis, we hypothesized that SPRR2 would be preferentially expressed in post-confluent differentiated Caco-2 cells and examined SPRR2 regulation by the protein kinase A pathway (PKA) and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). &#xD;
Differentiation-dependent SPRR2 expression was examined in cytoskeletal-, membrane-, and nuclear-enriched fractions by immunoblotting and confocal immunofluorescence. We studied the effect of SCFAs, known inducers of differentiation, on SPRR2 expression in pre-confluent undifferentiated Caco-2 cells and explored potential mechanisms involved in this induction using MAP kinase inhibitors. SPRR2 expression was also compared between HIEC crypt cells and 16 to 20 week primary fetal villus cells as well as in different segments in mouse small intestine and colon. We determined if SPRR2 is increased by gram negative bacteria such as S. typhimurium. &#xD;
SPRR2 expression increased in a differentiation-dependent manner in Caco-2 cells and was present in human fetal epithelial villus cells but absent in HIEC crypt cells. Differentiation-induced SPRR2 was down-regulated by 8-Br-cAMP as well as by forskolin/IBMX co-treatment. SPRR2 was predominantly cytoplasmic and did not accumulate in Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions. SPRR2 was present in the membrane- and nuclear-enriched fractions and demonstrated co-localization with F-actin at the apical actin ring. No induction was seen with the specific HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, while SCFAs and the HDAC inhibitor SBHA all induced SPRR2. SCFA responses were inhibited by MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580 and U0126, thus suggesting that the SCFA effect may be mediated by orphan G-protein receptors GPR41 and GPR43. S. typhimurium induced SPRR2 in undifferentiated cells. &#xD;
We conclude that SPRR2 protein expression is associated with differentiated epithelia and is regulated by PKA signaling and by by-products of the bowel flora. This is the first report to establish an in vitro model to study the physiology and regulation of SPRR2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Long-term mine plans are based on forecast future metal prices. By the time the development is put in place, the forecasts may have been proved wrong and the production plan might not meet the company's financial objectives. At that point, the common reaction to this situation is to create a new revised long-term plan and spend more capital, only to find out at a later time that the metal prices have changed again. This results in an inefficient use of capital with low returns to the investors.&#xD;
&#xD;
The objective of this thesis is to develop a methodology to determine the cut-off grade and production rate of a narrow-vein underground mine such that the long-term strategic plan is robust.  As a requirement to do so, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the resources, revenues, capital and operating costs as a function of the design parameters.  Also, the operational limits of the mine must be determined so that the solution is practical.  Afterwards, annual metal prices are randomly generated with a Monte Carlo process on stochastic metal price models, and the combination of production rate and cut-off grade yielding the highest net present value is identified and recorded. This process is repeated many times, and the probabilities of the solutions occurring at any given design combination are calculated.  The results are plotted on a bubble graph, where the size of a bubble is directly proportional to the probability a solution occurs at that point.  Finally, the combination with the largest bubble is the solution, as this point has the highest probability of yielding the highest net present value in most circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
The model was first tested on an actual gold-copper orebody where very detailed resource and cost information was available.  The methodology was applied with success and the solution reflected the important impact of the copper milling and roasting process on revenues.  Other tests were then done on a hypothetical gold orebody and the results showed a great degree of sensitivity to the average grade of the deposit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reward-related learning occurs when previously neutral stimuli acquires an enhanced ability to elicit approach and other responses. Studies in the past have shown that dopamine receptor-mediated 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent intracellular signalling is important for reward-related learning. Until recently, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was the only known signalling molecule that was activated by cAMP. However, it has been discovered that another enzyme, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), is also activated by cAMP. Thus, it is possible that cAMP mediates reward-related learning by an Epac-dependent signalling pathway. The present study used a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to investigate whether Epac is involved in the acquisition of reward-related learning. Bilateral injections of amphetamine (20 µg/0.5μl/side) into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been shown in previous studies to reliably produce a CPP. Thus, amphetamine (20 µg) and Sp-adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylamanine (Sp-cAMPS) (0.1, 1.0, 10, 15, 20 µg), an agent that activates both PKA and Epac, or amphetamine (20 µg) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2’-O-methyladenosine-3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT) (0.73, 1.27, 1.45, 2.89, 5.78, 11.56 µg), an agent that selectively activates Epac, were co-injected into NAc to determine their effects on the acquisition of CPP. Results showed that 8-pCPT (1.45 µg), but not lower or higher doses, inhibited CPP. Sp-cAMPS (0.1, 15, 20 µg) also inhibited CPP, replicating the results of previous studies. The results implicate Epac in the acquisition of reward-related learning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) with synchrotron radiation was used to characterize nano-sized voids in different nominally pure aluminum (Al) alloys produced by quenching.  The scattering signal from nano-voids is shown to be predictable from SAXS theory, and the information related to the void population confirm past experiments and reveal new details about quench-void formation in Al.  Specifically, voids were produced in 99.97 at.% to 99.9994 at.% Al alloys by infrared heating to 450 – 625 °C followed by controlled rapid quenching at 10^3 to 10^5 °C/s.  For changing processing conditions, the size of voids varied between 5 to 11 nm, and the density of voids varied by over an order of magnitude.  Results from SAXS were consistent with TEM observations performed on the same specimens, indicating that synchrotron SAXS can be reliably used to characterize nano-voids produced in quenched Al.  Factors determined to affect voids were consistent with previous studies, except that the present nano-voids dissolved after only 3 min. at 145 °C, indicating that quenched nano-voids are less stable than previously determined.  SAXS also showed that void size is sensitive to quench temperature and quench rate.  The activation energies for void nucleation and growth were determined to be 0.75 ± 0.10 and 0.19 ± 0.03 eV/at., respectively, confirming that hydrogen and di-vacancies take part in nucleation and growth during quenching.  It was concluded that the non-linear tail of the quench curve plays a crucial role in void formation, and that voids form when long range diffusion is inhibited.  This information can be utilized to design new Al alloys that limit incipient void formation, which is detrimental to properties such as formability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background and Purpose: Self-efficacy plays a major role in determining physical function during the earlier stages of the knee osteoarthritis (OA) and it may be a significant factor in the maintenance of physical function across the span of OA severity. This study examined the contribution of self-efficacy to objective and subjective measures of physical function at both maximal and sub-maximal levels.  The relationship between self-efficacy and quality of life was also examined. &#xD;
Participants: Twenty community-dwelling adults with knee OA (age 69±14 years) were recruited for this study. &#xD;
Methods: Subjective maximal and sub-maximal performance were determined using the Maximal Activity Score (MAS) and Adjusted Activity Score (AAS) respectively of the Human Activity Profile. The objective measure of sub-maximal physical function was the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) while the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) was the maximal measure. Quality of life was determined using the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) and self-efficacy was measured using the Arthritis Self-Efficacy (ASE) scale. Disease severity was determined using the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed using each of 6MWT, ISWT, AAS and MAS as the dependent variable, and the WOMAC and ASE as independent variables.&#xD;
Results: Self-efficacy explained 44% of the variance in the 6MWT but only 16% in the ISWT. Self-efficacy explained approximately 30% of the variance in both the MAS and AAS. A moderate relationship was observed between self-efficacy and the Physical Component Score (PCS) (r=0.51) of health-related quality of life, but no relationship was observed with the Mental Component Score (MCS).  &#xD;
Discussion and Conclusion: In mild to moderate knee OA, sub-maximal physical function was substantively influenced by an individual’s belief in his/her ability to perform a given task, but not so when the intensity of the activity approached maximal levels. This differential relationship between sub-maximal and maximal performance was not present using subjective reports of performance.  These findings indicate that therapy utilizing training at sub-maximal levels in mild to moderate knee OA should focus on strategies for enhancing self-efficacy; whereas with training at relatively high intensities, less focus should be given to enhancing self-efficacy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The upper extremity is often left with permanent disability following stroke and therapeutic techniques used at present have had limited success. This prospective clinical trial evaluated the effectiveness of mental practice (MP) through motor imagery (MI) a therapy technique to enhance upper extremity motor recovery after stroke. MI ability, upper extremity hand function, finger strength, and motor cortical output were examined in 18 stroke subjects (mean 67.5 years). Subjects were randomly allocated to the MP treatment group or the control group which received cognitive therapy. Both groups received their respective treatment daily for 30 minutes for a 3 week period. Assessments were performed prior to treatment, post treatment and at 3 months post treatment. Imagery ability was measured using the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ) and mental chronometric testing. Hand function was assessed with the box and block test (BBT) and finger strength with maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). To determine the effect of MI on neural excitability, focal transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the primary motor cortex while participants were at rest and while they imagined themselves performing abduction of the index finger. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles. Data were analyzed using multifactor and repeated measures ANOVAs with the significance level set to p &lt; 0.05.  Results showed no significant difference between groups on any of the outcome measures (p &gt; 0.05) although all subjects improved their hand function over the study period (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, motor threshold was found to decrease over time (p &lt; 0.001) in all subjects demonstrating improvement in cortical motor excitability and output. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited during MI were significantly larger compared to those evoked at rest (p &lt; 0.022). MEP amplitudes from FDI, the muscle targeted with MP, showed a significant interaction effect between time and group (p = 0.021) which reflected an increase in MEPs in the MP group over time whereas a decline occurred in the cognitive group. These findings indicate that MI enhances motor cortical output in stroke and that MP using MI appears to increase corticospinal output to the target FDI muscle. No differential effects of MP and cognitive therapy interventions were evident in terms of hand function and finger muscle strength.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Scientific software, by which we mean application software that has a large computational component, models physical phenomena and provides data for decision support. This can be software that calculates loads on bridges, provides predictions for weather systems, images bone structures for surgical procedures, models subsystems at nuclear generating stations, or processes images from ground-based telescopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is no consensus on what the best practices for the development of scientific software are. We carried out a study at two Canadian universities in which we interviewed scientists and engineers who develop or use scientific software to identify characteristics of current development and usage. Through qualitative analysis, I identified key characteristics of scientific&#xD;
software development and usage and observed correlations between these characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
The results are a collection of observations about how scientific software is documented and designed; the nature of the scientific software lifecycle; the selection of development languages; approaches to testing, especially validation testing; and sources of risk. I also examine concerns scientists have with commercial software they use to determine what quality factors are of interest to them and also which seem to require special trade-offs. I find that scientific software development and use differs fundamentally from development in most other domains.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The immensity of the social and (natural) environmental impacts that technologies have in today’s global context challenges the existing engineering education curricula. Observational research inspired the notion that the current engineering curricula is inadequately preparing engineers for their increasingly international roles. Observa- tional research was conducted in Morocco, Indonesia and Sri Lanka which highlighted the potential impact of engineering in addressing issues of marginalization. Perspectives from engineering industry and academia were also studied. This re- search conﬁrmed that the future landscape of engineering will require engineering education to focus more signiﬁcantly on non-technical skills and on providing inte- grated and interdisciplinary programs with an international focus. These studies also indicated that there is a need for engineers to both consider the circumstances of low-income communities and to reexamine the philosophies and pedagogy of current engineering programs. The perspectives of students was researched through forums and an engineering course. Five separate forums in April and May, 2006 were presented to engineering students at Queen’s University discuss and debate the idea of curricular reform. A module and pro ject that was based on a more holistic and socially conscious approach to engineering was incorporated into a ﬁrst year engineering course at Queen’s Uni- versity called APSC 190: Professional Engineering Skills. Both the forum and course used observational research methods and questionnaires to determine that Queen’s students were very interested a program with greater focus on social and environmen- tal issues in a global context. Humanitarian Engineering is a proposed program for Queen’s University’s Faculty of Applied Science. This program intends to address the evolving expectations of engineering education in order to respond to the demands of industry, academia, students and society. Humanitarian Engineering is proposed to be a Master’s program and a four-year undergraduate option that is taken collaboratively with the existing engineering disciplines, e.g. Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, etc. It will be built on the philosophies of humility, appreciation and cooperation and will best suit the needs of society if taught through the methodologies of participatory action research (PAR) and biomimicry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A series of recent studies using Drosophila melanogaster suggest that while males may benefit from having access to many partners, female fitness is reduced by extended cohabitation and sexual interaction with males. Yet, even if repeated sexual interactions are harmful to females, limited male exposure will ultimately be detrimental due to sperm-depletion and infertility. Females are therefore expected to balance mating opportunities and sperm storage capacity to maximize lifetime reproductive success. I introduced extended mating deprivation as a selective pressure to experimentally evolve lines of D. melanogaster for characters related to mating and postcopulatory sexual selection. Evolution of the mate-deprived lines over several dozen generations demonstrated that restricted sexual access was indeed a potent selective pressure. I consistently found that when males were removed for an extended time period, female fitness declined substantially, suggesting that mate-deprivation over nine days was harmful. Under these conditions, selected-line males responded to mate-reduced conditions and demonstrated a 13% increase in reproductive success compared to controls. Experimental females had a 15% increase in fertility compared to controls. I investigated a series of developmental characteristics that may have been altered by the selection regime, and while there was some evidence of evolved change, these results were not consistent. Although the data at hand do not substantiate a detailed characterization, both sexes in the experimental populations demonstrated increased fitness after extended mate-deprivation, thus evolutionary change appears to have occurred via selection on one or both relevant male ejaculate characteristics: sperm number and survival, and factors affecting female late-life fertility.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There exists a need for a biocompatible polymer system of appropriate degradation properties for use in the production of tissue-engineered cartilage replacement implants.  The implant consists of a layer of cartilage grown using autogenous chondrocyte cells on a porous calcium phosphate base for anchoring in situ.  This implant would serve to improve the current treatments for wear and age-related degradation of articular cartilage.&#xD;
Pilot dissolution studies of the biodegradable polymers Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA), Polycaprolactone (PCL), and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), provided strong evidence supporting the use of PVA and PEG, not PCL, in film preparation.  Results indicate that the dissolution of PVA rapidly exceeds that required for this application while the dissolution of PCL is not fast enough.  The results of a literature review indicate that PEG dissolves faster than PCL, but not PVA.  Consequently, a co-polymer hydrogel film of PVA and PEG, to fully degrade in 10 hours, was prepared to serve as a support for the in vitro seeding of cartilage-producing chondrocyte cells onto the artificial bone scaffold base.&#xD;
In preparing the film, the concentration of the PVA and PEG stock solutions, the composition of PVA and PEG (by mass % ratio) in the film, and the thickness of the film were defined to be the design variables.  The degradation properties of the film are hypothesized to be influenced by the design variables, such that the degradation rates can be engineered by manipulating these parameters.  A full factorial DOE was applied to determine the significance of the design variables and their interaction on the degradation rate.  To determine degradation rate, in vitro dissolution studies of the hydrogel film were conducted in Earle’s balanced salt solution at 37oC.  Upon optimizing the degradation rate, it was theoretically determined that an optimized film of 50wt% PVA, 50wt% PEG, and thickness of 3mm dissolves by 88.19 % in 10 hours.  Validation testing indicated that the optimized film was prematurely perforated at approximately 22 minutes of immersion in EBS at room temperature suggesting failure by bulk dissolution, which was later confirmed through investigation and identification of a heterogeneous, multi-phase microstructure under transmitting light microscope.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The General Purpose Frigate was the centrepiece of the Royal Canadian Navy’s fleet planning for over three years, and its cancellation by the newly elected Liberal government in October 1963 set off a divisive and chaotic yearlong debate over what should be built in its place.  After exploring numerous options, such as aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines, the navy came to the conclusion that its best option was to pursue a guided missile destroyer program that was similar to the General Purpose Frigate.  What happened next has confounded a number of modern naval historians.  Just as the navy was about to acquire its long sought after guided missile destroyers, a decision was made to build four smaller specialized anti-submarine vessels that would repeat the less sophisticated Annapolis class instead.&#xD;
Although a number of theories have been put forward to explain this decision, the one common factor among these hypotheses is the notion that an egocentric and dominant defence minister named Paul Hellyer forced the Repeat Annapolis upon a reluctant navy that unanimously despised the concept.   According to these interpretations, both the Repeat Annapolis and General Purpose Frigate were reflective of a larger debate over whether the navy should have the capability to participate in more versatile operations, such as containing limited wars in the Third World, or maintaining a specialised antisubmarine fleet.  Conventional wisdom, therefore, suggest that Hellyer’s selection of the repeat Annapolis was indicative of a minister who gave the navy little choice but to specialize in anti-submarine warfare.  This dissertation, however, challenges this premise by arguing that the navy was far from united over its force structure - a term used to describe the process through which the navy selects the types of ships it requires to fulfil its current and future roles.  Instead, it will show how the birth of the Repeat Annapolis was actually the product of conflicting opinions and struggles from within the navy itself.  Understanding the self-inflicted damage resulting from these conflicts is crucial, particularly since the force structure that emerged from this chaotic period (1957 - 1965) would influence the composition of the Canadian navy for the next forty years.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Suspended sediment delivery dynamics in two watersheds at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada were studied to characterize the hydroclimate conditions in which laminated sediments formed.  Process work over three years determined snow-water equivalence was the primary factor that controlled sediment yield in both catchments.  Cool springs (2003, 2004) enhanced runoff potential and intensity because channelized meltwater was delayed as it tunneled through the snowpack and reached the river channel (sediment supply) within 1-2 days.  In warm springs (2005), meltwater channelized on the snowpack and did not immediately reach the river bed (7-10 days).  Sediment transport was reduced because flow competence was lower and sediment supplies limited.&#xD;
Sediment deposition in the West Lake depended on surface runoff intensity.  Short-lived, intense episodes of turbid inflow generated underflow activity which delivered the majority of seasonal sediment.  In 2005, runoff was less intense and few underflows were detected compared to the cooler, underflow dominated 2004 runoff season.  As well, grain-size analysis of trapped sediment indicated that deposition rates and maximum grain-size were decoupled, indicative of varied sediment supplies and delivery within the fluvial system.  These decoupled conditions have important implications for paleohydrological interpretations from downstream sedimentary records.&#xD;
Two similar 600-year varve records were constructed from the lakes at Cape Bounty.  Although these series were highly correlated throughout, time-dependent correlation analysis identified divergence in the early 19th century.  Because the varve records were from adjacent watersheds and subject to the same hydroclimatic conditions, the divergence suggests watershed-level changes, such as increased local active layer detachments.  The varve record from West Lake was highly correlated with lagged autumn snowfall and spring temperature.  Similar relationships between these variables and East Lake were not as strong or significant.  &#xD;
Long-term climatic interpretations should be carefully assessed.  A single record from either of these lakes might lead to autumn snowfall and/or spring-melt intensity reconstructions, given the process work and weather record correlations.  The recent divergence reveals potential changes likely to occur as warming increases variability within the Arctic System.  Multidisciplinary monitoring and observations should continue in order to quantify future variability and evaluate the impact on these systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A range of strategies exist for the production of polyolefin block copolymers with well-defined morphologies for the compatibilization of immiscible blends; however, high sensitivity to impurities and use of expensive transition-metal catalysts limit their economic viability. An alternative method is the solvent-free coupling of dislike polymers using peroxides and multifunctional coagents. This technique, however, does not distinguish between a blend of gelled homopolymers and the intended copolymer. The use of a solution-based approach, like the one described in this report, for the radical-mediated coupling of polyolefins with dislike polymers allows for the full&#xD;
characterization of the copolymer without the formation of gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
A one- and two-step synthesis for the coupling of two homopolymers in solution is&#xD;
demonstrated using triallyl trimesate. The one-step approach produced a copolymer in low yields due to the differences in reactivity between the homopolymers. The&#xD;
two-step synthesis consisted of the solvent-free grafting of the coagent to the less&#xD;
reactive polymer, followed by coupling in solution with the other polymer. Though&#xD;
this technique demonstrated improved yields over that of the one-step approach, the overall yields were limited due to the dilution effects of the high solvent levels&#xD;
needed for comiscibility. The coupling of polyethylene with poly(ethylene oxide) had&#xD;
a maximum graft yield of 9.5%, whereas the coupling between polypropylene and a&#xD;
thermoplastic polyolefin elastomer was negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was found that the grafting of allylic ester coagents to polyethylene results in an&#xD;
uneven graft distribution. Given enough peroxide and coagent, the material will&#xD;
reach its gel point where there is a small, high molecular weight population with a&#xD;
disproportionately high graft content, while the remaining chains contained a modest concentration of bound coagent. Furthermore, a survey of the effectiveness of several common coagents in the radical-mediated crosslinking of polyethylene was investigated where it was found that allylic coagents had a greater contribution to the&#xD;
crosslink density of the resin than vinyl coagents.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The jarosite group of minerals is part of the alunite supergroup, which consists of&#xD;
more than 40 different mineral species that have the general formula AB3(TO4)2(OH,&#xD;
H2O)6. There is extensive solid-solution in the A, B and T sites within the alunite&#xD;
supergroup. Jarosite group minerals are common in acid mine waste and there is&#xD;
evidence of jarosite existing on Mars. Members of the jarosite - natrojarosite –&#xD;
hydronium jarosite (K,Na, H3O)Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6 solid-solution series were synthesized&#xD;
and investigated by Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data. The synthesized&#xD;
samples have full iron occupancy, where in many previous studies there was significant&#xD;
vacancies in the B site. Well-defined trends can be seen in the unit cell parameters, bond&#xD;
lengths A – O and Fe - O across the solid-solution series in the synthetic samples. Based&#xD;
on unit cell parameters many natural samples appear to have full iron occupancy and&#xD;
correlate well with the synthetic samples from this study. In addition, the infrared spectra&#xD;
of the samples were analyzed. The atomic structure of ammoniojarosite,&#xD;
(NH4)Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6, has been solved using single-crystal X-ray diffraction to wR&#xD;
3.64% and R 1.4%. The atomic coordinates of the hydrogen atoms of the NH4 group&#xD;
have been located and it was found that the ammonium group has two different&#xD;
orientations with equal probability. Samples in the ammoniojarosite – hydronium jarosite&#xD;
solid-solution series were synthesized and analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction and&#xD;
Rietveld refinement. It was found that an incomplete solid-solution series exists between&#xD;
jarosite and plumbojarosite, Pb[Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6]2, based on experimental and&#xD;
mineralogical data. At the studied synthesis conditions, lead solubility in jarosite is&#xD;
extremely limited with occupancy of 2% in the potassium site. Increased Pb in the&#xD;
iv&#xD;
starting solution resulted in no increased substitution of Pb into jarosite, but an increased&#xD;
substitution of H3O+. The stable isotope (H) geochemistry of hydronium jarosite,&#xD;
(H3O,K)Fe3(SO4)2(O,OH)6, and the effect that the presence of hydronium in the crystal&#xD;
structure has on exchange rates of stable isotope values of jarosite with hydronium&#xD;
substitution has been investigated in this study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High Arctic meromictic lakes are frequently used to generate detailed records of past environmental variability within their sedimentary profiles.  However, without detailed analyses of sedimentation influences over time, their paleoclimate records cannot be accurately interpreted.  This thesis presents a comprehensive examination of the sedimentology and paleoenvironmental records of meromictic Lake A, Ellesmere Island (83°00’N, 75°30’W), including detailed analysis of the sedimentary history, development and evaluation of several paleoclimate records.  The sedimentary record was primarily composed of clastic material but varying inputs of authigenic components from biological and chemical processes in the water column resulted in a complex history of lake sedimentation.  Under chemically stratified conditions during the past millennium, annual laminae (varves) formed and were used to develop a sedimentary chronology.  Sedimentary pellets were most likely formed by ice-rafting processes and were deposited during high melt years in this perennially ice-covered lake.  The pellet frequency record indicated that the twentieth century contained the most frequent reduced ice cover summers during the past millennium, although the 1500s and 1600s were also inferred warm periods.  Comparison with instrumental climate data indicated that varve thickness was primarily related to late summer and autumn snowfall in the previous year, which highlighted the importance of snow availability in spring rather than melt energy in sediment transfer to the lake in this non-glacial catchment.  The varve thickness and grain size records suggested increased flow competency and autumn snowfall particularly during the late-1000s to early-1100s and first half of the 1900s. Paleoenvironmental records from Lake A corresponded well with many regional proxy records and provided a long-term framework within which to examine observed environmental change along the northern Ellesmere Island coast during the past century.  Finally, these analyses would not have been possible without obtaining high quality sediment cores.  This research also investigated the effectiveness of a gel seal method for preserving the fragile sediment-water interface during transport and its results could be useful for other sediment core studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and similar polymers have proved to be of widespread&#xD;
interest for use in microfluidic and similar microanalytical devices. Surface modification&#xD;
of PDMS is required to extend the range of applications for devices made of this polymer,&#xD;
however. Here we report on the grafting of perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane via hydrolysis&#xD;
onto an oxidized PDMS substrate in order to form a fluorinated microchannel. Such a&#xD;
fluorinated device could be used for separating fluorous tagged proteins or peptides,&#xD;
similar to that which has been recently demonstrated in a capillary electrophoresis system,&#xD;
or in an open tubular capillary column. The modified polymer is characterized using&#xD;
chemical force titrations, contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron&#xD;
spectroscopy (XPS). We also report on a novel means of performing electroosmotic&#xD;
measurements on this material to determine the surface zeta potential. As might be&#xD;
expected, contact angle and chemical force titration measurements indicate the&#xD;
fluorinated surface to be highly hydrophobic. XPS indicates that fluorocarbon groups&#xD;
segregate to the surface of the polymer over a period of days following the initial surface&#xD;
modification, presumably driven by a lower surface free energy. One of the most&#xD;
interesting results is the zeta potential measurements, which show that significant surface&#xD;
charge can be maintained across a wide range of pH on this modified polymer, sufficient&#xD;
to promote electroosmotic flow in a microfluidic chip. Matrix-assisted time of flight&#xD;
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) measurements show that a fluorous-tagged&#xD;
peptide will selectively adsorb on the fluorinated PDMS in aqueous solution,&#xD;
demonstrating that the fluorinated polymer could be used in devices designed forenrichment or enhanced detection of fluorous-labeled proteins and peptides. However,&#xD;
the non-specific adsorption of other proteins may interfere with the test results. The&#xD;
adsorption of four different proteins (cytochrome-C, carbonic anhydrase, insulin and&#xD;
ubiquitin) onto the unmodified, oxidized and fluorinated PDMS surfaces respectively was&#xD;
studied here with MALDI-TOF MS measurements. The results showed us that when&#xD;
rinsed in water/methanol solutions of high methanol concentration, cytochrome-C&#xD;
strongly adheres to the fluorinated surface. Carbonic anhydrase shows the opposite trend.&#xD;
Retention of ubiquitin on the surface shows relatively little sensitivity to either the nature&#xD;
of the substrate or the solution composition. Finally, the results using insulin&#xD;
demonstrated that this protein adheres relatively strongly to the oxidized PDMS surface&#xD;
as compared to the fluorinated or unmodified PDMS and showed a relative independence&#xD;
on the composition of the washing solution. The influence of the hydrophilicity of the&#xD;
protein, the surface and solvents, stability and size of proteins are discussed in the context&#xD;
of these observations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Marcona district of littoral south-central Perú represents the largest concentration of iron oxide-copper-gold deposits in the Central Andes. Hydrothermal activity occurred episodically from 177 to 95 Ma and was controlled by NE-striking faults.&#xD;
	At Marcona, emplacement of massive magnetite orebodies with subordinate, overprinted magnetite-sulphide assemblages coincided with a 156-162 Ma episode of eruption of andesitic magma in the Jurassic arc, but mineralization is hosted largely by underlying, Lower Paleozoic metaclastic rocks. The magnetite orebodies exhibit smoothly curving, abrupt contacts, dike-like to tubular apophyses and intricate, amoeboid interfingering with dacite porphyry intrusions, interpreted as evidence for the commingling of hydrous Fe oxidic and silicic melts. An evolution from magnetite - biotite - calcic amphibole ± phlogopite assemblages, which are inferred to have crystallized from an Fe-oxide melt, to magnetite - phlogopite - calcic amphibole - sulphide assemblages coincided with quenching from above 700°C to below 450°C and with the exsolution of aqueous fluids with magmatic stable isotopic compositions. Subsequent, subeconomic chalcopyrite - pyrite - calcite ± pyrrhotite ± sphalerite assemblages were deposited from cooler fluids with similar δ34S, δ18O and δ13C values, but higher δD, which may record the involvement of both seawater and meteoric water. &#xD;
	The much younger (95-110 Ma), entirely hydrothermal, Mina Justa Cu (-Ag) deposit is hosted by Middle Jurassic andesites intruded, on a district scale, by small dioritic stocks at the faulted SW margin of an Aptian-Albian shallow-marine volcano-sedimentary basin. Intense albite-actinolite alteration (ca. 157 Ma) and K-Fe metasomatism (ca. 142 Ma) long preceded the deposition of magnetite-pyrite assemblages from 500-600°C fluids with a magmatic isotopic signature. In contrast, ensuing chalcopyrite - bornite - digenite - chalcocite - hematite - calcite mineralization was entirely the product of non - magmatic, probably evaporite-sourced, brines.&#xD;
Marcona and Mina Justa therefore represent contrasted ore deposit types and may bear minimal genetic relationships. The former shares similarities with other Kiruna-type magnetite (-apatite) deposits. In contrast, the latter is a hydrothermal system recording the incursion of fluids plausibly expelled from the adjacent Cañete basin. Non-magmatic fluids are inferred to be a prerequisite for economic Cu mineralization in the Cu-rich IOCG deposits in the Central Andes and elsewhere.</dcterms:abstract>
