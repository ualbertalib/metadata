      <dcterms:abstract>The current study examined anxiety and its observable correlates in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) across a broad range of levels of cognitive functioning that in the past have not been accurately explored. I sought to challenge the assumption that there is a positive linear relationship between anxiety and level of cognitive functioning by including individuals across a broad range of cognitive functioning in my analyses, and by developing a measure (The Somatic Anxiety Scale) appropriate for assessing anxiety symptoms in children with little to no communicative functioning. Sixty-seven parents of children with ASD aged 5 to 12 completed a battery of measures in an online study assessing their child’s anxiety, repetitive behaviours, sensory processing issues, and adaptive functioning. The Somatic Anxiety Scale was significantly correlated with an existing measure of anxiety designed for verbal children (when only highly verbal children were assessed), suggesting that it may provide a foundation to develop a measure of anxiety symptoms in non-verbal individuals. No clear predictive relationship was observed between level of cognitive functioning and anxiety. Both lower and higher-order repetitive behaviours predicted anxiety, although higher-order behaviours were more predictive. Finally, a cluster analysis indicated three patterns of anxious behaviour divided across three categorizations of level of functioning. I suggest that previous assumptions about the relationship between level of cognitive functioning and anxiety may be underestimating the complexity of the relationship and suggest future research to study this relationship further.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Green technologies have recently gained interest for many reasons. Economic factors in conjunction with an increased social desire to reduce our environmental impact on the Earth have created a desire for more environmentally friendly technologies, especially automotive technologies such as the electric car. While public interest in electric vehicles is growing, there are a number of challenges which must first be addressed before their widespread adoption is possible. Cost, longevity, and range are all important factors which need to be addressed for electric vehicles to compete directly with their gasoline counterparts. By more efficiently using the energy stored within the battery pack, some of these issues can be addressed.&#xD;
This study focuses on the thermal management systems for electric vehicles and the application of design optimization in the early design phase considering the pack in its entirety. A liquid cooling system is considered for a current generation electric vehicle, with time dependent heat generation rates within the battery cells based on vehicle operating conditions. Identifying the most efficient distribution of cooling within the battery pack to achieve uniform temperature is the objective of optimization.&#xD;
Simulations were performed on a complete battery pack model, featuring 288 battery cells and 144 cooling plates. Anisotropic material properties and non-uniform heat generation rates are included as well as energy demands based on a representative vehicle drive cycle. Results have shown that through design optimization, the standard deviation of temperature within the battery cells can be improved by as much as 80% when compared to a conventional design. The standard deviation of temperature saw improvement from an average of 0.2828 K for a conventional design to 0.05318 K after optimization.&#xD;
These results are specific to the given battery pack construction, battery cell, and cooling type. The method of modeling and analysis can be extended to many battery geometries and cooling technologies in the future. Application of design optimization to the problem of thermal&#xD;
iii&#xD;
management system design can yield significant improvements to battery pack thermal management, and thereby incrementally improve the efficiency of electrified vehicles.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In light of the current global prevalence of overweight and obesity, the associated health risks, and the continuing adoption of sedentary lifestyle, this thesis investigated some of the factors that contribute to exercise adherence, directly comparing high-intensity whole body interval training and continuous endurance training.  68 inactive university aged adults (Age: 21.4±3.4 yrs, BMI: 25.6±4.6 kg/m2, VO2peak 40.1±5.7 ml/kg/min) were randomized into one of three groups; a non-exercise control, whole body high intensity training, or continuous endurance training.  Aerobic capacity measurements, time to completion trials, muscular endurance, and core strength measures were taken at pre, post and follow up testing sessions.  Psychological questionnaires were also administered during exercise as well as throughout the study.  Following the intervention both exercise groups demonstrated equivalent improvements in aerobic performance, with only the interval group experiencing improved muscular and core endurance.  After the 2-month follow up testing sessions the interval group lost all aerobic and core adaptation, with endurance only experiencing a partial loss.  This finding indicates that the interval group did not adhere to exercise at a level that was high enough to preserve the adaptations associated with training.  This finding is further supported by the psychological factors measured throughout this study, including acute affect, enjoyment and intentions to engage in future exercise.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Growers Association (OGVG), and Queen’s University’s Solar Calorimetry Laboratory (SCL) are undertaking a joint project to evaluate the energy and crop-yield benefits of operating commercial greenhouses in isolation from the outdoor environment, i.e., eliminating natural or forced ventilation to the exterior. Implementing such a scheme requires “closing” the greenhouse envelope and the installation of an active air-conditioning system to control temperature and moisture levels that could be harmful to crop growth. To this end, a prototype air-conditioning system, centered around a liquid desiccant dehumidifier, was designed, constructed and instrumented such that its thermal and functional performance could be evaluated over extended periods. The prototype unit was installed in a “research” greenhouse located at the Agriculture Canada, Greenhouse and Processing Crops Research Center (GPCRC) located in Harrow, Ontario. Both the novel air-conditioning and monitoring systems were implemented during the course of the thesis and operated for two preliminary crop trials to characterize system performance and identify aspects needing further refinement. Data obtained over these two initial periods, indicated that, the latent and sensible cooling capacity of the novel desiccant system averaged: 2.25 kW and -0.25 kW, respectively, during the severe summer trial; and 1.25 kW and -0.1 kW, respectively, during the milder spring trial. Values obtained from the preliminary monitored data also indicate that the liquid desiccant unit operated at electrical and thermal coefficients of performance (COPs) between 0.74 and 3.1 and between 0.15 and 0.52, respectively. Finally, using the monitored data, a simple regression-based empirical model was formulated to describe the average performance of the liquid desiccant unit. This was attempted to illustrate how performance results could be generalized to assist in the future design of similar commercial-scale systems. The results of this part of the thesis indicated, however, that further test data is required to confidently characterize the unit’s performance. As well, it was concluded that addition instrumentation (specifically, the addition of a meter to measure the flowrate of the regenerator air-stream) would enhance the potential to develop a practical performance correlation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Xerox Research Centre of Canada has noted that elastomeric cleaning blades in laser printers have a relatively short life expectancy, as they experience high levels of friction and wear while wiping excess toner from commercial photoconducting drums. As such, there has been interest in examining the behaviour related to friction, wear and lubrication of components in laser printers. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to gain molecular-level insight into the mechanism of wear of the cleaning blade and the effectiveness of lubricants in reducing friction forces. The Dreiding force field was chosen to simulate representations of the photoconducting drum, cleaning blade and the lubricant. They were modeled in bulk and layered forms, and compressed and sheared to examine slip mechanisms and evaluate shear stresses and friction coefficients. It was found that the polycarbonate (PC) component was significantly stronger than either the polyurethane (PU) or octadecane (C18) components, and that the introduction of an interface and/or C18 lubricating material lowered the measured shear strengths to various degrees. The simulations indicated three different slip mechanisms depending on the nature of system. We have observed that shearing may induce structural changes within the PU component (such as ordering) even without a local slip event, which likely contributes to the eventual mechanical failure of the PU cleaning blade. From the models used in this study, it appears that more lubricating material is required than is currently used in practice in order to prevent wear of the PU cleaning blade. As well, the shear strengths and friction coefficients are not significantly reduced with the addition of lubricant for models containing PU. This is, of course, subject to the limitations of the simulations performed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the last decade, and particularly the last five years, state officials in Ghana’s capital city, Accra, have intensified their resolve to ‘modernize’ the city and make it a competitive destination for global investments. In the same period, exercises by city authorities to remove or at least suppress practices of ordinary residents in the informal sector have become more frequent and intensified. Groups such as street hawkers, market women, and slum dwellers have become the main target of periodic ‘decongestion exercises’. In this dissertation I investigate how the policies and practices associated with the ‘globalizing’ and ‘modernizing’ ambition of the state intersect with the interests of the majority of urban residents whose everyday social and economic practices are concentrated in the informal sector, a sector deemed to be deleterious to the desired image for the city. I argue that contemporary city-making in Ghana is driven mainly by a combination of economic, nationalist and individual interests. In examining how cultural and social locations such as gender and ethnicity mediate the relationship between the state and residents, I demonstrate how contemporary forms of neoliberal urban governance shape, and are being shaped by, the unique historical, cultural and developmental dynamics of African cities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Contrary to many major sporting leagues such as the NHL, NFL, NBA, and MLB, or the Olympic Games as a whole, the professional tennis industry has not been individually scrutinized in terms of governance, social control, and surveillance practices. This thesis presents an in-depth account of the major governing bodies of the professional tennis circuit with the aim of examining how they govern, control, constrain, and practice surveillance on tennis athletes and their bodies. Foucault’s major theoretical concepts of disciplinary power, governmentality, and bio-power are found relevant today and can be enhanced by Rose’s ethico-politics model and Haggerty and Ericson’s surveillant assemblage. However, it is also shown how Foucault, Rose, and Haggerty and Ericson’s different accounts of “modes of governing” perpetuate sociological predicaments of professional tennis players within late capitalism. These modes of surveillance are founded on a meritocracy based on the ATP and WTA rankings systems. A player’s ranking affects how he or she is governed, surveilled, controlled, and even punished. Despite ostensibly promoting tennis athletes’ health protection and wellbeing, the systems of surveillance, governance, and control rely on a biased and capitalistically-driven meritocracy that actually jeopardizes athletes’ health and contributes to social class divisions, socio-economic inequalities, gender discrimination, and media pressure. Through the use of top-players’ accounts, it is also shown how some players resist certain governing, controlling, and surveillance practices designed for their benefit, while others understand and accept the resultant constraints as part of their choice to be a professional tennis player.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The stereochemical course of the Pd–catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of α-substituted, enantioenriched allylic boronic esters with phenyl iodide has been examined.  The secondary boronic esters were prepared in both racemic and enantioenriched forms via  borylationof a lithiated carbenoid with a geometrically defined vinyl boronic ester.  The geometric purities were determined to be &gt;99% and the enantiomeric excesses of stereodefined secondary boronic esters were found to exceed 98:2.  In total, 8 allylic boronic esters were successfully cross-coupled, providing arylated products with high regioselectivities (&gt;90:10) and complete enantiospecificities (&gt;99%).  The cross-coupling of a sterically and electronically unbiased, deuterated substrate confirmed that fully equilibrated π-allylic intermediates are not involved.  Additionally, correlating the absolute configurations of the allylic boronic ester and the cross-coupling product allowed us to confirm that the transmetalation step of the reaction proceeded through a closed transition state via a syn-SE’ mechanism, which further suggests the importance of the distinct Pd-O-B bond linkage.&#xD;
	Further, the cross-coupling of vinyl iodides to secondary boronic esters was investigated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, political legitimacy as a concept distinct from full justice has received much attention.  Yet in addition to querying the specific conditions legitimacy requires, there is a more general question: What is legitimacy even about?  How ought we identify and conceptualize these conditions?    &#xD;
	According to the regnant justificatory liberal (JL) approach, legitimate legal coercion is based on reasons all reasonable persons can accept and JL is explicated in terms of a hypothetical procedure.  Alas, Part I explains why JL is inadequate.  First, I argue that it de-legitimizes all coercion.  Second, it undercuts the proposition that there are certain basic rights which must be protected for legitimacy.  Third, I suggest that JL structurally involves paternalism.  &#xD;
	Where should theorists turn?  My perhaps surprising proposal is that they turn to the Christian Reformed (CR) tradition of social thought.  As I take it, this tradition is composed of such figures as Augustine and Calvin, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Dooyeweerd, and, more recently, Francis Schaeffer.  It has long theorized such issues as church-state separation and permissible coercion, and is replete with conceptual resources.&#xD;
	Thus, Part II reconstructs an alternative legitimacy framework out of these resources.  The central CR insight is this: legitimacy is a function of preventing basic wrongs.  Legal coercion is only necessary "by reason of sin".  I develop this insight in terms of three ideas.  First, those wrongs which must prevented as conditions of legitimacy are objective wrongs, obtaining universally regardless of consent.  Second, they presuppose some view of basic teleology.  A teleological view is needed to elaborate contentful basic rights non-arbitrarily, but only a basic teleological view insofar as legitimacy is distinct from full justice.  Third, I suggest these wrongs are fruitfully understood as constituting an exogenous standard, one that is neither the product of actual nor hypothetical self-legislation.  	&#xD;
Part III brings JL and CR legitimacy into dialogue.  Understanding legitimacy in terms of objective, teleological, and exogenous wrongs, respectively, helps us avoid each of the unacceptable consequences of JL covered in Part I.  Legitimacy is better conceptualized in CR terms; preventing such wrongs is what legitimacy is about.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis expands on the model presented in Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka’s Zoopolis for how companion animals might be treated as co-citizens in a post-Animal Rights world.  I will attempt to clarify the distinct political obligations owed to companion animals throughout their lifetimes by individual caregivers and by the state. In particular, I argue that there is nothing in the genetic make-up of most companion animals that precludes them from being “autonomous agents” in adulthood, meaning that if allowed to develop their agency, most animals would be able to lead flourishing lives independent of human companions. I suggest that, for young companion animals, guardians have political obligations to develop the autonomous agency of their dependents, with help from the state. That said, for adult animals which develop autonomous agency, I argue that both a human caregiver and the animal have a right to sever their relationship with each other, just as we give adult children the right to leave their parents’ care and also give parents the “right to kick out” adult children who are capable of supporting themselves. However, while advocating for human caregivers’ rights to sever relationships with autonomous pets, I nonetheless maintain that the state will always retain obligations to its citizens to provide them with a basic level of welfare, and these obligations extend to companion animals as well. Thus, the thesis will consider ways that companion animals can flourish without human companionship. Questions I am concerned with are: Can companion animals lead worthwhile lives without human caregivers? What obligations do caregivers and states have to raise animal young? When and how can these obligations be terminated? And lastly, how might we restructure our public and political institutions to accommodate animals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave relationships with caregivers?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common condition leading to painful intercourse and is currently best understood within a biopsychosocial framework. Although the usefulness of non-medical treatment options for vulvar pain is recognized by many, there is limited research investigating the effectiveness of these treatments using a biopsychosocial approach to outcome measurement. Furthermore, there is little evidence to support the mechanisms by which these treatments lead to pain reduction. This study aimed to address these gaps by investigating two non-medical treatment options: individual cognitive-behavioural therapy (ICBT) and pelvic floor rehabilitation (PFR). Twenty women with PVD were randomly assigned to eight sessions of either ICBT or PFR. Participants were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up via gynecological examination, structured interviews and standardized questionnaires measuring pain, psychological, and sexual variables, quantitative sensory testing, and a pelvic floor muscle (PFM) evaluation. The primary outcome was change in intercourse pain intensity. Secondary outcomes included changes in other features of vestibular pain (e.g., frequency), cotton-swab test pain intensity, vestibular sensitivity, sexual functioning, PFM functioning, and pain cognitions. Changes in psychosexual and PFM functioning were investigated as predictors of treatment outcome. Results indicated no differences in the effectiveness of the treatment groups with respect to pain outcomes, with both groups demonstrating significant reductions in pain. Between-group differences were minimal in other areas, with some suggestion that participants in the ICBT group fared better with respect to sexual functioning, while participants in the PFR group demonstrated more improvements in PFM tone. Participants in both groups demonstrated meaningful improvements in pain cognitions, with the ICBT group demonstrating greater changes in rumination. The study was not able to detect significant predictors of treatment outcome. The results of the study suggest that both ICBT and PFR may lead to clinically meaningful improvements in pain, as well as in other areas of psychosexual functioning. Future treatment studies should consider incorporating general chronic pain clinical trial recommendations to allow for better comparison of outcomes with other studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The origin of fluorous interaction was explored and experimentally examined based on both HPLC and CEC data in this project. It was found that the selective fluorous interaction is a kind of reduced instantaneous or induced dipole interaction compared to the hydrophobic interaction. &#xD;
A series of FPPM preparation parameters were optimized. The optimized FPPM column can resolve the components in a manner that was otherwise not possible with its non-fluorous (hydrocarbon) counterpart. &#xD;
Following, the CEC separation of fluorous analytes on FPPM stationary phase based upon fluorous-fluorous interaction was realized for the first time. It was also found that, quantitatively, hydrophobic stationary phases have better methylene selectivity (〖 α〗_(-CH_2-)), while fluorous stationary phases have better perfluoromethylene selectivity (〖 α〗_(-CF_2-)). Thermodynamically, ∆G_(-CF_2- → -CF_2-)^° : ∆G_(-CH_2- → -CH_2-)^° (Gibbs free energy change of transferring a –CF2– unit to pure fluorous stationary phase versus Gibbs free energy change of transferring a –CH2– unit to pure hydrophobic stationary phase) is approximately equal to 8:1.  &#xD;
A new concept, hypothetical water percentage (HWP) based on the comparison of 〖 α〗_(-CH_2-) and〖 α〗_(-CF_2-) was proposed for the first time to quantitatively evaluate the hydrophobicity/fluorophilicity of a stationary phase. A stationary phase can be classified as fluorous stationary phase when the HWP is less than 0 (more negative indicates more fluorous), or as a hydrophobic stationary phase when the HWP is larger than 100. For the range between 0 and 100, the stationary phase can be treated as either fluorous or hydrophobic due to the similar values of〖 α〗_(-CH_2-) and〖 α〗_(-CF_2-).&#xD;
Fluorous tagged peptides and proteins (up to 5800 Da) were effectively separated from their non-fluorous counterparts on the FPPM stationary phase in capillary-based columns and detected both on-line with ESI-MS and off-line with MALDI-MS. Finally, the FPPM solid-phase extraction (SPE) stationary phase was transplanted from the capillary to a microchip format. This microchip exhibits the merits of both selective fluorous interaction and micro total analysis system (µTAS).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The amount of time that it takes to get a breast cancer diagnosis is very important to patients. The Ontario diagnostic assessment unit (DAU) is designed to improve the quality and timeliness of care during a breast cancer diagnosis. This study described and examined the association between the length of the diagnostic interval and DAU use in Ontario, Canada. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study among all breast cancer patients diagnosed between Jan 1st, 2011 and Dec 31st, 2011 in Ontario, Canada. DAU use and diagnostic intervals were described. The association between DAU use and the diagnostic interval was examined separately in a cohort of 2499 screen-detected patients and a cohort of 4381 symptomatic patients. Study data sources included administrative databases available at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO). The diagnostic interval was defined as the time from the index contact to the cancer diagnosis. DAU use was determined based on the payment record within the organized screening program as well as the hospital where patients were diagnosed. Multivariate median regressions were used to control for possible confounders. Results: On average, Ontario breast cancer patients waited 4.6 weeks to be diagnosed. Forty-eight percent were diagnosed in a DAU and 52% were diagnosed in the usual care route. In screen-detected patients, DAUs had a higher rate in meeting national timeliness targets compared to usual care (79.1% vs. 70.2%, p&lt;0.001). DAU use was significantly associated with an 8.3-day decrease in the time to diagnosis (95% CI: 6.5-10.2) after controlling for potential confounders. In symptomatic patients, DAUs also had a higher rate in achieving the Canadian timeliness targets compare to usual care (71.7% vs. 58.1%, p&lt;0.001). DAUs significantly reduced the time to diagnosis by 10 days (95% CI: 7.8-11.9) after controlling for possible confounders. Conclusions: We observed considerable variation in breast cancer diagnostic intervals and DAU use in Ontario. Use of Ontario DAUs was associated with improved diagnostic timeliness for breast cancer patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chronic pain is recognized for its intra- and interpersonal stress, with greater social support being associated with better patient outcomes.  Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS) are pain-associated conditions that are prevalent across genders and are strongly associated with diminished quality of life (QOL).  To date, no gender-based research has examined such supportive behaviours in UCPPS samples.  One model, the stress-buffering model of social support, suggests people with greater support within their proximal (e.g., marriage) and distal (e.g., physician) social environment may be protected from negative stressor impact (i.e., pain).  Due to their strong associations with poorer QoL, I hypothesized catastrophizing and perceived pain control as important intrapersonal cognitive variables to also consider in such relations between pain and patient QoL. In this dissertation, I examined several research questions using two self-report studies: 1) Are there gender differences in social support for people with UCPPS?; 2) Does social support moderate the relationship between pain and patient outcome variables and are there gender differences in this effect?; and 3) If social support moderates the relationship between pain and outcomes, is this effect further moderated by cognitive variables and/or gender? &#xD;
In Studies 1 and 2, women with IC/PBS endorsed higher levels of solicitous and distracting spouse responses to pain behaviour than did men with CP/CPPS.  Additionally, in Study 2 women reported greater support from friends than did men.  In regard to moderation effects in Study 1, distracting spouse responses buffered the relationships between patient pain and mental QoL, and between pain and disability.  However, spouse solicitousness had a detrimental effect on the relationship between patient pain and mental QoL but only at low levels of catastrophizing in the patient.  The genders did not differ in the effect of spouse responses to pain behaviour in Study 1, and Study 1 results with respect to the stress-buffering role of distracting spouse responses were not replicated in Study 2.  In Study 2, sources of social support from outside of the marriage also did not have a stress-buffering effect on the relationship between pain and patient outcome.  Of the models reviewed, no one current model for understanding the role of social support or catastrophizing in chronic pain was sufficient to account for the findings reported in these studies.  However, a dyadic emotion regulation perspective is suggested with implications for marital therapy with couples with chronic pain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is a drug and organic anion transporter of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. Previous studies showed that opposite charge substitutions of Arg1202 or Glu1204 in transmembrane helix (TM) 16 cause a &gt;80% reduction in MRP1 levels when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. These substitutions disrupt the folding and/or assembly of MRP1 which targets it for degradation. Attempts were made to enhance levels of the R1202D and E1204K misprocessing mutants by incubating transfected HEK cells at 30 ºC or 27 ºC. At both temperatures, cells expressed both fully glycosylated and underglycosylated mutants at levels 60–70% lower than wild-type MRP1in cells grown at 37 ºC. The subcellular localization patterns of the two mutants were similar to wild-type MRP1 at all three temperatures, with most of the transporter at the plasma membrane at 37 ºC, and in the endoplasmic reticulum at 30 ºC or 27 ºC. Thus, although poorly expressed, the R1202D and E1204K mutants retained the ability to traffic to the plasma membrane. Attempts were also made to enhance R1202D and E1204K levels by exposing transfected HEK cells to chemical chaperones. Dimethyl sulfoxide and glycerol increased E1204K levels by 20-30% but decreased or had no effect on R1202D and wild-type MRP1. 4-Phenylbutyric acid had little or no effect on either wild-type or mutant MRP1. Thus both mutants were relatively resistant to rescue by chemical chaperones. Finally, a “second-site rescue mutation” approach was taken, guided by an atomic homology model of MRP1. Mutations of Tyr1133 alone decreased MRP1 levels, like R1202D; however, although substituting TM15-Tyr1133 with Phe, His and Ala in R1202D was predicted to re-establish TM15-TM16 bonding interactions, levels of this mutant did not increase. E1204K levels were also not improved by substituting TM17-Val1248 with Asp or Glu although these substitutions were predicted to re-establish TM16-TM17 bonds disrupted in E1204K. These results suggest that the bonding interactions of Arg1202 and Glu1204 with other amino acids predicted by the MRP1 homology model used in this study are insufficient to predict the critical helix-helix interactions necessary for stable MRP1 expression in mammalian cells.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Osteoporosis is a bone degenerative disease characterized by reduced bone mass, quality and strength, along with changes in microarchitecture and increased incidence of fracture. The significant economic and social costs associated with osteoporotic fractures of the hip and spine have resulted in extensive research efforts directed towards developing an improved understanding of this disease, along with the relationships between osteoporotic bone degradation and fracture risk assessment.&#xD;
The current study investigates the failure behaviour of rat vertebral bodies collected from normal and osteoporotic donors based on the ovariectomized rat model (SHAM and OVX study groups, respectively), along with an additional control group intended to simulate postmenopausal patients with estrogen repletion (OVX+E study group). Simultaneous uniaxial compression testing and X-ray Micro-Computed Tomography (XμCT) were used to visualize and describe the failure behaviour of prepared vertebral body samples during mechanical testing, while providing standard measures of mechanical properties and bone geometry. In tandem with the incremental loading protocol required for simultaneous mechanical testing and XμCT imaging, a continuous loading protocol was also included. Three distinct failure behaviours were observed without bias in the three different study groups and two loading protocols. The primary and secondary failure modes involved fracture initiation in the direct vicinity of vascular apertures present in the dorsal surface of the cortical shell, with failure progression through the sample towards the ventral surface of the cortical shell (primary) or the cranial endplate (secondary). The tertiary failure mode involved localized rupture of the cranial endplate, likely resulting from end-effect related stress-concentrations. Diminished trabecular bone geometry (reduced BV/TV and Tb.N, along with increased Tb.Sp) was accompanied by reduced mechanical properties (reduced ultimate force and ultimate strength) in the OVX study group when compared with the SHAM and OVX+E study groups. Linear regression analyses revealed a shift in the determinants of failure initiation between the SHAM/OVX+E study groups and the OVX study group. In the SHAM and OVX+E study groups, ultimate force was best predicted by indices describing the vascular apertures present in the dorsal cortical shell. In the OVX study group, ultimate force was best predicted by indices describing trabecular bone geometry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Injuries to the meniscus are a common and important source of mobility issues in the knees of young active individuals, as well as elderly individuals. Conventional treatments for these injuries involve surgical resections of the damaged portions of tissue in order to relieve immediate clinical symptoms. However, with a decreased amount of meniscal tissue remaining, the load-bearing and load-distribution capacities remain compromised and inevitably lead to the development of osteoarthritis.1 In view of these deficiencies, tissue engineering has emerged as a promising alternative approach to meniscus repair. In this approach, biodegradable synthetic materials have been proposed as scaffolds to stimulate and support cell-mediated tissue remodeling. A wide range of synthetic materials have been developed to respond to the physical and chemical requirements of a scaffold, but many lack the necessary biological properties to respond to cellular stimuli. In addition, many of these materials are deficient in mechanical strength. The aim of this study was to develop a novel biomaterial that addresses these limitations. Poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) was selected as the main component of the scaffold due its highly suitable material properties. PTMC is a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer with excellent elastomeric properties and mechanical strength. It also offers the advantage of providing long-term mechanical support due to its low degradation rate. However, PTMC alone cannot stimulate tissue regeneration due to its bio-inert nature. In order to provide an ideal environment to support tissue repair, it must possess bioactive signals. PTMC was combined with a collagenase-sensitive peptide substrate to render the scaffold invasive by cells. The peptide also served to increase the slow degradation rate of PTMC by providing cleavage points throughout the network. The compressive strength of this material was significantly higher than previously used scaffold materials. Additionally, the material possessed enhanced toughness and elasticity, high equilibrium water content, and a tunable degradation profile. Unlike currently used scaffolding materials, this material satisfies all of the necessary requirements to function as an effective scaffold for meniscus regeneration.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dopamine (DA) drives incentive learning: learning which is elicited through rewarding stimuli. Irregularities in DA activity are associated with various psychological disorders. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), a molecule downstream of DA receptors, has been implicated in mediating dopaminergic behaviour, and unbalanced DA activity is associated with concomitant irregularities in GSK3β signaling. Inhibition of this molecule has been noted to attenuate behavioural sensitization, and decrease psychotomimetic behaviour in animals. Few studies have assessed the role of GSK3β in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, which evaluates the rewarding properties of substances and has been used to model psychosis. CPP can be examined through either acquisition or expression paradigms, which look at the active learning process vs. the recall of learned information respectively. We tested the hypothesis that selective inhibition of GSK3β with SB 216763 will differentially and dose-dependently affect the acquisition and expression of amphetamine (AMPH) CPP, as well as attenuate AMPH locomotor activity in acquisition. All drugs and vehicles were administered via intra-cranial microinfusions into the nucleus accumbens. AMPH was administered at a dose of 20.0 μg/0.5 μl/side. SB 216763 was tested at four doses (0.03, 0.30, 3.00, &amp; 5.00 μg/0.5 μl/side) in both acquisition and expression. We found administering SB 216763 at all doses to attenuate AMPH CPP and locomotor activity in acquisition. At doses 0.30, 3.00, &amp; 5.00 μg/0.5 μl/side, SB 216763 also blocked AMPH CPP at expression. These results lend support to GSK3β’s involvement in incentive learning and DA-mediated behaviours, and suggest its inhibition may differentially affect the acquisition and expression of AMPH CPP.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As much as the psychosocial nature of mental illness cannot be ignored, it is generally agreed that social ties play a beneficial role in the maintenance of psychological well-being. Small social networks, few close relationships, and low perceived adequacy of social support and quality of life have all been linked to depressive symptoms. Conversely, the challenges of establishing a causal relationship to social ties are generally greater for mental health than they are for other health outcomes. &#xD;
The purpose of the present study was to identify the association between social capital and overall psychological well-being among Canadian citizens aged 12 and older, by conducting a secondary analysis of microdata using the 2009/2010 cross-sectional Canadian Community Health Survey. &#xD;
The present study included a weighted sample of 124,188 individuals aged 12 years or older who participated in the Canadian Community Health Survey from 2009-2010. Ordinal regression was used to examine the association between self-perceived mental health and social capital in the context of community involvement and sense of belonging in the community.&#xD;
Respondents who felt a sense of belonging in their local community reported mental health superior to individuals who did not have a community-based sense of belonging. This association was explained by respondent’s age, sex, marital status and was mediated by voluntary organization membership and immigration status.&#xD;
Results provided evidence of a relationship between elements of social capital and mental health. Positive social relationships and civic engagement are relevant to positive mental health.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  School settings are one of the most crucial context for asthma management second only to a child’s home.  Today school administrators are faced with many challenges, not only are they responsible for students' learning needs but they also manage complex behavioural and health issues including asthma.  Most do not have standardized plans regarding asthma management.&#xD;
Objectives:  1) Systematically review the research literature related to asthma management within the school setting.  2) Determine current asthma management practices as reported by school administrators.  3) Explore experiences and barriers to asthma management practices with school administrators.&#xD;
Method:  Guided by the Knowledge to Action framework, the study was divided in three phases using a planned action approach and included an integrative synthesis of the evidence, an administrators’ survey, and an administrator’s meeting.&#xD;
Findings:&#xD;
Phase One:  Following a search using three databases, 67 articles were critiqued.  The literature illustrates that many countries have established “asthma friendly schools” legislation that includes process for identifying children with asthma, right to self-carry and administer medications, enhancing communication and cooperation between school staff, parents, and children with asthma, reducing triggers in school environment, and effective policies that make legislation a functioning reality within schools.&#xD;
Phase Two:  Ninety-seven surveys were distributed within two district school boards with 61 completed surveys returned (63% response rate).  Key findings included underestimation of the prevalence of asthma, no standardized process for identifying children with asthma, staff training deficiency for recognizing and responding to asthma exacerbations, lack of individual asthma action plans for children, absence of programs to support current legislation and best practice guidelines.  Communication was the most common barrier identified by school administrators.&#xD;
Phase Three:  Two principals in an administrator’s meeting validated the survey results.  Participants were not familiar with the concept of asthma friendly school, asthma prevalence rates, or free school asthma resources.  Asthma Action Plans were not universally understood as individualized written plans but rather a generalized first aide response plan.&#xD;
Conclusion:  There are knowledge and practices gaps placing children with asthma at risk for exacerbation and death within school setting.  Administrators want to partner to facilitate optimal asthma management within the school setting.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A series of laboratory accelerated immersion tests are used to examine the effects of different chemicals found in municipal solid waste leachate, geomembrane thickness, and incubation temperatures on the degradation of different high density polyethylene geomembranes. It was found that surfactant was the key leachate constituent affecting antioxidant depletion while salts accelerated degradation of the mechanical properties, especially stress crack resistance. Immersed in synthetic leachate, the time to nominal failure at 35oC was predicted to be 62% longer for the 2.5 mm, and 12% longer for the 2.0 mm, than for the 1.5 mm geomembrane tested. The antioxidant depletion in synthetic leachate and air at temperatures &gt; 85oC was consistent with what would be expected from Arrhenius modeling based on data from lower temperatures (≤ 85oC). However, the early depletion rates in water incubation decreased with the increase of the temperature above 100oC. It was also found that at temperatures above 100oC, there was significant change in the polymer morphology that affected the stress crack resistance at early incubation times prior to polymer degradation. &#xD;
Large-scale geosynthetic liner longevity simulators (GLLSs) which simulated field conditions were used to investigate the susceptibility of pre-aged high density polyethylene geomembranes to stress cracking and to evaluate the performance of geomembranes under a 150 mm sand protection layer. A pre-aged geomembrane with a 560 g/m2 geotextile protection layer experienced brittle rupture at local gravel indentations. The time to failure was correlated to the incubation temperatures. The use of a sand protection layer not only delayed antioxidant depletion compared to that with a traditional geotextile protection but also substantially reduced the long-term tensile strains in the geomembrane below the allowable strain limits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The tropospheric reactions of toluene, acting as a model VOC, are investigated using an electron bombardment-matrix isolation system coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.  Initial experiments to produce the hydroxyl radicals used to initiate the toluene reactions via electron bombardment of water-argon mixtures are performed. The effects of electron current, water concentration, and gas flow rate are investigated.&#xD;
	A more efficient method of initiating the toluene reactions, by directly creating benzyl radicals through electron bombardment of toluene is then investigated, and the effects of toluene concentration and electron current on the production of the benzyl radicals is quantified.  Benzyl radicals are successfully produced, and identified via FT-IR.  The next step is the formation of benzylperoxy radicals, via electron bombardment of toluene-oxygen-argon gas mixtures.  Experiments are performed using increasing concentrations of toluene and oxygen, in an attempt to observe the benzylperoxy radical.  Two new absorptions are observed in the infrared spectra and are tentatively identified as due to the peroxy group on the benzylperoxy radical.&#xD;
	Computational work is also performed to confirm that benzylperoxy radicals can in fact be produced from benzyl radicals and oxygen.  The vibrational frequencies of the benzylperoxy radical are also calculated, and used to confirm the possibility that the new absorptions seen in the infrared spectra could in fact be due to benzylperoxy radicals.&#xD;
	The overall results from this work demonstrate that it is likely to be possible to use electron bombardment-matrix isolation systems to investigate tropospheric reactions of volatile organics, and that further experiments could be enhanced by structural modifications to the system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I examine whether religiosity is positively associated with the valuation multiples investors assign to fair valued items that are prone to managerial bias. Using a sample of U.S. banking firms, I find that the value relevance of net assets that are hard to verify is higher for firms located in more religious areas than for those located in less religious areas. Moreover, I hypothesize and find that audit quality and firm information environment quality moderate the positive association between religiosity and value relevance. I perform several robustness checks. First, I rule out several alternative explanations to my results. Second, I address the concern that my results suffer from an omitted correlated variable problem. Third, I show that my results hold for firms located in Urban as well as Rural areas.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goals of this research are to develop and validate the use of distributed fibre optic sensors for use in strain monitoring of buried culverts, and to use full-scale experiments to evaluate the performance of both deteriorated steel and reinforced concrete culverts rehabilitated with grouted slipliners subjected to surface loading. Bench scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of fibre optic sensors against conventional strain sensors.  Then, fibre optic sensors were attached to a full-scale culvert that was tested in a buried state as a proof of concept.  Finally, fibre optic sensors were used in two large scale buried pipe tests to explore the performance of rehabilitated flexible and rigid culverts.  A deteriorated steel culvert was tested in a buried state under surface loading, then rehabilitated with a grouted high density polyethylene (HDPE) slipliner while still in a buried state and tested under surface loading at 0.9 m and 0.6 m burial depths.  The rehabilitated steel pipe was tested under service loading, and up to 1250 kN of applied load.  The results suggested that the grouted annulus stiffened the overall structure, and increased the capacity of the system to over 3 times the fully factored design load. A deteriorated reinforced concrete culvert was tested and rehabilitated in a similar fashion. The grout in the annulus penetrated the cracks at the crown, invert and joint of the concrete pipeline. The lined concrete pipe was tested to 1200 kN under single axle loading, and to 800 kN under single wheel loading. The results suggested that while the concrete pipe was stiffened by the grout, it remained the primary contributor to structural capacity, with the liner contributing little to the capacity. Repair reduced the diameter change by an average of 90%, with the capacity reaching approximately 3.3 and 4.2 times the design loads for single axle and single wheel pair loading, respectively. The maximum response was under single axle loading over the barrels of the concrete pipe. In no instance did the structures reach an ultimate limit state, and the tests were stopped after bearing failure of the soil occurred.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Computer assisted mosaic arthroplasty (CAMA) is a surgical technique that transplants cylindrical osteochondral grafts to repair damaged cartilage. An earlier in vivo study on sheep showed that short-term clinical outcomes are improved with the use of computer assistance, as compared to the conventional technique. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis reports on a study comparing three mosaic arthroplasty techniques -- one conventional and two computer assisted -- on human anatomy. This in vitro study used solid foam femur models modified to incorporate simulated cartilage defects. There were five participating surgeons ranging from a third year resident to a senior orthopedic surgeon. Each of the five participating surgeons performed a total of nine trials. There were three distinct sets of identical solid foam femur models with simulated cartilage defects. Three surgical techniques (conventional, opto-electronic, and patient-specific template) were performed on each.&#xD;
&#xD;
Several measures were made to compare surgical techniques: operative time; surface congruency; defect coverage; graft surface area either too high or too low; air volume below the grafts; and distance and angle of the grafts from the surgical plan. The patient-specific template and opto-electronic techniques resulted in improved surface congruency, defect surface coverage, graft surface within 0.50mm recessed and 0.25mm proud of the original surface, and&#xD;
below-graft air gap volume in comparison to the conventional technique. However, the conventional technique had a shorter operative time. The patient-specific template technique had less variance in surface congruency and shorter operative time than did the opto-electronic technique.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Compared to the much more common photonic crystals that are used to manipulate light, phononic crystals (PnCs) with inclusions in a lattice can be used to manipulate sound. While trying to propagate in a periodically structured media, acoustic waves may experience geometries in which propagation forward is totally forbidden. Furthermore, defects in the periodicity can be used to confine acoustic waves to follow complicated routes on a wavelength scale. Using advanced fabrication methods, we aim to implement these structures to control surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagation on the piezoelectric surface and eventually interact SAWs with quantum structures.&#xD;
To investigate the interaction of SAWs with periodic elastic structures, SAW interdigital transducers (IDTs) and PnC fabrication procedures were developed. GaAs is chosen as a piezoelectric substrate for SAWs propagation. Lift-off photolithography processes were used to fabricate IDTs with finger widths as low as 1.5 micron.&#xD;
PnCs are periodic structures of shallow air holes created in GaAs substrate by means of a wet-etching process. The PnCs are square lattices with lattice constants of 8 and 4 micron. To predict the behavior of a SAW when interacting with the PnC structures, an FDTD simulator was used to calculate the band structures and SAW wave displacement on the crystal surface. The bandgap (BG) predicted for the 8 micron crystal ranges from 180 MHz to 220 MHz. Simulations show a shift in the BG position for 4 micron crystals ranging from 391 to 439 MHz. &#xD;
Two main waveguide geometries were considered in this work: a simple line waveguide and a funneling entrance line waveguide. Simulations indicated an increase in acoustic power density for the funneling waveguides. Fabricated device evaluated with electrical measurements. In addition, a scanning Sagnac interferometer is used to map the energy density of the SAWs. The Sagnac interferometer is designed to measure the outward displacement of a surface due to the SAW. Interferometric measurements confirmed waveguiding in the modified funnel entrance waveguide embedded in the 4 micron PnC. However, they also revealed strong dissipation of the SAW in the waveguide due to the non-vertical sidewalls resulting from the wet-etch process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Polymer Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (PLECs) are solid state devices based on the in situ electrochemical doping of the luminescent polymer and the formation of a p-n junction where light is emitted upon the application of a bias current or voltage. PLECs answer the drawbacks of polymer light-emitting diodes as they do not require an ultra-thin active layer nor are they reliant on low work function cathode materials that are air unstable. However, because of the dynamic nature of the doping, they suffer from slow response times and poor stability over time. Frozen-junction PLECs offer a solution to these drawbacks, yet they are impractical due to their sub-ambient operation temperature requirement. Our work presented henceforth aims to achieve room temperature frozen-junction PLECS. In order to do that we removed the ion solvating/transporting polymer from the active layer, resulting in a luminescent polymer combined solely with a salt sandwiched between an ITO electrode and an aluminum electrode. The resulting device was not expected to operate like a PLEC due to the absence of an ion-solvating and ion-transporting medium. However, we discovered that the polymer/salt devices could be activated by applying a large voltage bias, resulting in much higher current and luminance. More important, the activated state is quasi static. Devices based on the well-known orange-emitting polymer MEH-PPV displayed a luminance storage half-life of 150 hours when activated by forward bias (ITO biased positively with respect to the aluminum) and 200 hours when activated by reverse bias. More remarkable yet, devices based on a green co-polymer displayed no notable decay in current density or luminance even after being stored for 1200 hours at room temperature! PL imaging under UV excitation demonstrates the presence of doping. These devices are described herein along with an explanation of their operating mechanisms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a work of political philosophy. It aims to set out an egalitarian understanding of the promotion of social capital. The first chapter of the thesis is an introduction to social capital, and contains a normative criticism of contemporary social capital policy-making. A typology of theoretical approaches to social capital policies are outlined in the second chapter, including neoliberal constitutionalism, civic republicanism, and egalitarian pluralism. Of these approaches, egalitarian pluralism seems best able to promote social capital while balancing the competing values of freedom and equality. The third chapter builds on the egalitarian pluralist approach and investigates a relational egalitarian strategy for the promotion of social capital.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) is a die-less sheet metal forming method.&#xD;
Because SPIF does not use custom tooling, this process allows for parts to be made&#xD;
at low cost and short lead times. In this thesis electric current is applied through the tool to alter the formability of samples formed with SPIF. The research goal of this&#xD;
work is to determine if formability is effected by resistive heating alone or if there is some formability change due to the current interacting with the material.&#xD;
An apparatus that allows electrical current to be applied through the tool during&#xD;
forming is designed and implemented. A method is also developed to allow the contact&#xD;
area between the tool and sheet to be estimated, with particular focus on developing a method that allows for experimental measurement.&#xD;
The effect of applied current on formability is estimated by evaluating the maximum wall angle that can be formed in a single pass, using a variety of tool sizes and current settings. Using the contact area model to estimate current density, a signicant increase in formability is found at a current density range that agrees with&#xD;
previously published literature on electrically assisted forming of the same material.&#xD;
The results show that across multiple tool sizes, a significant increase in formability is observed when applying a current density (A/mm2) larger than the current threshold&#xD;
density published in the literature.&#xD;
A study is also performed to test the performance of a set of novel tool shapes. By&#xD;
using parabolic tools, it was found that formability can be improved while maintaining&#xD;
low surface roughness.&#xD;
Finally, a series of case studies are presented documenting the production several&#xD;
parts for a variety of design groups and researchers at Queen's University. These case&#xD;
studies provide examples for the uses of SPIF, as well as document the methods used&#xD;
to produce these parts in greater detail than is present in the literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis argues that while there are various contending notions of how a government can improve its chances of success in a small war, few strategies will be effective without the application of a comprehensive program of population control measures. For this study, small wars are conflicts in which a government uses limited means to secure national objectives against an adversary who uses primarily the tactics of guerrilla warfare. Population control measures are defined as those restrictions imposed on movement, on choice of residence, and on the availability of food that protect the population from the insurgents while simultaneously denying the insurgents access to critical resources.&#xD;
This work examines the vital importance of population control measures in overcoming guerrilla forces lacking external sponsors in small wars during the period 1870 to 1960.   Five examples are used to determine their importance: the treatment of prairie Amerindians in the Canadian West (1870 – 1890); the guerrilla phase of the Philippine-American War (1898 – 1902); the guerrilla phase of the South African War (1899 – 1902); the Malayan Emergency (1948 – 1960); and the Kenyan Emergency (1952 – 1960). Within the broad strategies used to prosecute these campaigns, population control measures were a consistent feature and were instrumental in contributing to the termination of the conflicts.  Despite their importance, these measures are typically overlooked or only treated superficially when discussed by historians. Therefore, to understand more fully the outcome of small wars, greater attention needs to be applied to the study of these measures.&#xD;
In small wars the primary contest between the belligerents is for control of the people. For the government, the strategic value of population control measures is in how they separate the population from the guerrillas. This denies a wide range of critical resources to the guerrillas and additionally allows the government to both prosecute its campaign more effectively and protect the population better. Population control measures need to be a key component of a government’s strategy in a small war as their proper application may be the tipping-point between success and failure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The rate of data growth in many domains is straining our ability to manage and analyze it. Consequently, we see the emergence of computing systems that attempt to efficiently process data-intensive applications or I/O bound applications with large data. Cloud computing offers “infinite” resources on demand, and on a pay-as-you-go basis. As a result, it has gained interest for large-scale data processing. Given this supposedly infinite resource set, we need a provisioning process to determine appropriate resources for data processing or workload execution. We observe that the prevalent data processing architectures do not usually employ provisioning techniques available in a public cloud, and existing provisioning techniques have largely ignored data-intensive applications in public clouds.&#xD;
In this thesis, we take a step towards bridging the gap between existing data processing approaches and the provisioning techniques available in a public cloud, such that the monetary cost of executing data-intensive workloads is minimized. We formulate the problem of provisioning and include constructs to exploit a cloud’s elasticity to include any number of resources to host a multi-tenant database system prior to execution. The provisioning is modeled as a search problem, and we use standard search heuristics to solve it.&#xD;
We propose a novel framework for resource provisioning in a cloud environment. Our framework allows pluggable cost and performance models. We instantiate the framework by developing various search algorithms, cost and performance models to support the search for an effective resource configuration.&#xD;
We consider data-intensive workloads that consist of transactional, analytical or mixed workloads for evaluation, and access multiple database tenants. The workloads are based on standard TPC benchmarks. In addition, the user preferences on response time or throughput are expressed as constraints. Our propositions and their results are validated in a real public cloud, namely the Amazon cloud. The evaluation supports our claim that the framework is an effective tool for provisioning database workloads in a public cloud with minimal dollar cost.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prose style criticism of literary nonfiction has faded from scholarly popularity since a boom in the 1980s. Recent literary criticism of nonfiction has focused on context while neglecting aesthetics, or left the work of style analysis to composition or rhetoric scholars. I examine the work of Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, and two writers associated with the literary journal n+1, Keith Gessen and Elif Batuman, to demonstrate the way that prose style analysis is a meaningful critical approach that helps define changing nonfiction genres, including online genres. I read Didion's work across her oeuvre to demonstrate the way her prose style shifts subtly over time and between fiction and nonfiction, memoir and literary journalism. I trace the influence of David Foster Wallace's American postmodern forebears on his fictional and nonfictional prose styles, and follow that line of influence to the nonfiction writing of online genres. I conclude by discussing the way that young writers associated with the journal n+1 regard Wallace's influence on their work and the writing of their generation, and examine Gessen and Batuman's prose style on and offline to find the literary in some unlikely locations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The interaction between carbon dioxide (CO2) and N-compounds such as 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) has been extensively studied in the Jessop Lab. Carbon disulfide (CS2) is the sulfur congener of CO2, although it exhibits different reactivity with N-containing compounds. This thesis presents the search for zwitterionic CO2-switchable polarity solvents, new and general reactivity of CS2 with amidines and guanidines, and attempts at using CO2 as a carbonyl source in the synthesis of nitrogen containing compounds. &#xD;
In the second chapter, the reactions of CO2 with various diamines are described. Spectroscopic methods and X-ray crystallography determined the structure of a solid zwitterionic carbamate salt of CO2 and N,N’-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine. The polarity of the liquid zwitterionic carbamate salt formed with N,N,N’-trimethyl-1,3-propanediamine was measured using UV-Vis and the solvatochromic dye Nile red; its polarity was comparable to previous switchable polarity systems. The CO2 gravimetric uptake of the liquid zwitterionic carbamate salt was 28%, far greater than other solvents for the capture and release of CO2.&#xD;
In the third chapter, it was found that a variety of products can be accessed depending on the structure of the N-base (cyclic or acyclic) upon reaction of the base with CS2 at room temperature. The reaction of CS2 with cyclic amidines produced a cyclic trithioanhydride structure, forming a new C-C bond at a sp2-carbon beta to the imino nitrogen centre. When an amidine was acyclic it led to cleavage and formation of isothiocyanates in near quantitative yields. When a N-base had a N-H bond, CS2 can insert, forming a dimer in the presence of dichloromethane.&#xD;
In the fourth chapter, preliminary investigations are ascribed for synthesis of α-amino acids, amides, and ureas. Carboxylation of ketimines was detected, although the formed carboxylates from a variety of ketimines readily decomposed. Isomerization products of two ketimines were generated with DBU and CO2. Lewis acid catalysts were implemented towards the amidation of benzoylacetic acid and synthesis of ureas. Amidation of benzoylacetic acid did not occur in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts and CO2. Formation of a cyclic tetraalkylurea was afforded in low yields by the use of a diamine, CO2 and Lewis acid catalysts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vascular calcification (VC) is accelerated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Although the consequences of VC are associated with elevated pulse wave velocity (PWV) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the temporal impact on blood pressure changes is unknown. Mineral imbalance in CKD greatly contributes to the development of VC, and elevated serum phosphate is a major risk factor. Magnesium, which plays an important role in bone regulation, has been recently shown to be a modifier of VC, but whether magnesium inhibits calcification in CKD is unknown. &#xD;
 A modified adenine model of CKD was developed in rats, characterized by mineral imbalance and progressive VC. During the development of VC, pulse pressure increased, which was driven by a drop in diastolic blood pressure, rather than systolic hypertension. Continuous pressure recordings in conscious rats using radiotelemetry revealed a significant increase in systolic variability associated with development of VC. Regional VC was associated with regional changes in the hemodynamic profile of the CKD rats. For example, only thoracic aortic calcification was associated with elevated PWV and pulse pressure. In contrast, the presence of abdominal and thoracic calcification differentially affected proximal and distal arterial pressure wave forms. CKD animals exhibited LVH, which was further increased by the presence of VC.  In addition, fibroblast growth factor 23, which regulates renal excretion of phosphate, was elevated in CKD animals at every time point and was associated with LVH independently from VC. Development of VC was characterized in an in vitro organ model. Phosphate elevation in vitro caused VC in aortas. In vitro, magnesium supplementation inhibited initiation and progression of VC. CKD animals given a magnesium diet also demonstrated attenuated development of VC. In patients with stage 3-5 CKD (excluding dialysis), dietary phosphate was associated with the progression of coronary artery calcification even after adjusting for use of phosphate binders, total dietary energy and total dietary protein.  Given the serious negative outcomes associated with development of VC, these findings fill key gaps in knowledge regarding the detection, management, prevention and treatment of VC in CKD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Carbon nanotubes are intriguing materials and extensively studied for both their fundamental properties and extraordinary performance in various applications during the last 20 years. They are extremely small in diameter, light in weight, sensitive to the environment, strong, and chemically stable. They can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their species.  The semiconducting species can absorb and emit light in a wide range of wavelengths. These outstanding properties of carbon nanotubes promise abundant applications that may be revolutionary. &#xD;
&#xD;
The opto-electronic behaviour of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is extremely sensitive to its physical structure and ambient environment. Structural defects and surrounding environment are extrinsic influential factors that often obscure the understanding of the intrinsic behaviour.   Progress on SWCNT synthesis has been made continuously but not until the last 10 years, have single SWCNTs been isolated individually and from substrates so that their fluorescence can be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fundamental science of an optically generated exciton (an electron-hole pair) in an ideal semiconducting SWCNT is not fully understood despite many studies of exciton behaviour using various optical approaches. The major challenge is controlling SWCNT sample qualities.  SWCNT's fundamental properties, such as the absorption cross section, quantum efficiency, radiative and nonradiative lifetimes, remain under debate.  Knowing the intrinsic SWCNT properties is essential to understand exciton transport and relaxation mechanisms. &#xD;
&#xD;
To minimize the extrinsic effects, we have selected high-quality unprocessed SWCNTs for investigation. Collaboration with Dr. P. Finnie and Dr. J. Lefebvre at National Research Council Canada, allow us to access pristine SWCNTs individually. Since the emission from a single SWCNT is low, it requires unconventional methods to measure the PL dynamics. Suggested by the results, exciton transport in a semiconducting SWCNT is diffusional at room temperature, with high diffusivity (130 -350 cm^2/s) and long diffusion length (1 - 5 µm). At lower temperatures, we observed a more efficient exciton-exciton interaction that suggests the contribution from hot excitons or a longer existence of delocalized excitons. Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation and  long coherence time in a SWCNT are promising for making a single-photon source at near-infrared wavelength range and developing quantum computers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rainfall induced granular flow slides pose a significant risk in many areas of the world.  These failures, characterized by the sudden release of material in a fluid-like manner, are the result of static liquefaction occurring in these slopes.  The static liquefaction phenomenon has been linked to instability.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Instability behaviour is primarily studied under undrained triaxial conditions, and although many instability theories have therefore been defined in this stress space, these have been shown to also extend into plane strain conditions.   In order to further investigate this behaviour under these stress conditions, Wolinsky et al. (2013) developed a tilt-table soil box for use in a geotechnical centrifuge to analyze instability in infinite slope soil models.  This testing apparatus has been used to simulate instability in plane strain under both dry and saturated soil conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Stress-controlled experiments were performed on dry infinite slope soil models to investigate the effects of both void ratio and effective stress on instability behaviour.  By performing these tests dry, this test apparatus provides the ability to decouple the triggers of instability from the corresponding response in pore pressure and the consequences.  The results of this testing confirmed that the instability line angle is a function of both void ratio and effective stress.  As the void ratio decreases and effective stress in the soil model increases, the resulting instability line angle will increase.  This testing also demonstrated typical stress-dilatancy behaviour in these infinite slope models, characterized by contractive response in loose soils and dilative response in dense soil subject to increasing shear stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secondly, this testing apparatus was used to investigate the effects of seepage force on instability behaviour in granular slopes through the introduction of groundwater seepage in the form of a rising groundwater level.  Although the results illustrated shear and volumetric response to these increased pore water pressures, these were not significant enough to initiate instability and the resulting pore water response leading to failure.  It has been determined that this apparatus must be further adapted to dissipate the matric suctions developed above the water table during groundwater rise.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Assuming a set of variates are independent and normally distributed is commonplace in statistics.  In this thesis, we consider the consequences of these assumptions as they pertain to global sensitivity analysis.  We begin by illustrating how the notion of sensitivity becomes distorted in the presence of codependent model inputs.  This observation motivates us to develop a new methodology which accommodates for input codependencies. Our methodology can be summarized through three points:  First, a new form of sensitivity is presented which performs as well as the classical form but can be obtained at a fraction of the computational cost. Second, we define a measure which quantifies the extent of distortion caused by codependent inputs. The third point is regarding the modelling of said codependencies.  The multivariate normal distribution is a natural choice for modelling codependent inputs; however, our methodology uses a copula-based approach instead. Copulas are a contemporary strategy for constructing multivariate distributions whereby the marginal and joint behaviours are treated separately. As a result, a practitioner has more flexibility when modelling inputs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reflecting the masculine ethos of the larger comic book industry, superhero comics continue to be male-dominated spaces.  Within comic studies, superhero scholars problematically normalize this androcentrism by reiterating the genre’s masculinist rhetoric, repeatedly positioning superheroes as stoic figures of whiteness, nationhood, heteronormativity and able-bodied masculinity.  Although some intervention has been made to challenge these interpretations, scholars fail to acknowledge how transgender and/or transsexual readers evaluate comic heroes.  This thesis provides one such intervention into the field, specifically focusing on the last son of Krypton, Superman.  Drawing together the work of trans, queer, feminist, psychoanalytic, and monster theorists, my research attempts to “trans” Superman; thus, (re)reading the Man of Steel in a way that distinctly reflects the experiences of those who are denied access to the figure via their/our own gender “transgressions”.  By interpolating transsexuality into the Superman narrative, I rewrite the figure’s place within the genre’s cis-sexist, masculinist history and while doing so, (re)position him as a more suitable hero for the trans community.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The promotion of creative culture in the higher education classroom holds the potential to prepare students for their contemporary roles in an increasingly diverse and demanding modern world. A premise of this work is that education should strive to encourage creativity with process-oriented curricula that actively engage students in (a) tasks that are collaborative and novel, (b) the interpretation of new and meaningful experiences, and (c) the synthesis and critical evaluation of ideas at individual, collective, and global levels. This dissertation study identifies aspects of pedagogical design and teaching practice that enable the building of students’ creative capacities. These enhanced capacities, in turn, can lead to transformative experiences that inspire and shape participants’ personal and professional lives. &#xD;
I adopted a dual role as researcher and student to conduct an exploratory study in the context of a PhD level Education course, Contemporary Curriculum Theory. Findings from this exploratory study informed a multiple-case study that involved the observation of two graduate level courses, Professionals in Rural Practice and The Lived Experience of Disability, which together form the unit of analysis for the study. Data sources included: (a) a Learning Activities Survey, modified from King’s (2009) original work; (b) a Creativity Checklist, modified from Munro’s (n.d.) instrument; (c) field observations and field notes; and (d) individual interviews with students and instructors from each course. &#xD;
Data were analyzed by three creative drivers that enabled transformation: (a) multiple ways of knowing, (b) adult conversation, and (c) the storied self. Through this examination of university-level courses of varied disciplines, this research study addresses creativity as a catalyst for transforming the ways in which teachers and students experience knowledge-making in post-secondary education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This contribution explores the applicability of nickel-based metallic foams as active electrodes and as electrocatalyst support materials.  A comprehensive characterization of Ni and multi-component Ni-based foams is presented and includes the analysis of their structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties.  Several materials and surface science techniques as well as electrochemical methods are used to examine the structural characteristics, surface morphology, and surface-chemical composition of these materials.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is employed to analyze the surface and near-surface chemical composition.  The specific and electrochemically active surface areas (As, Aecsa) are determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV).  The foams exhibit structural robustness typical of bulk materials and they have large As, in the 200 – 600 cm2 g–1 range.  In addition, they are dual-porosity materials and possess both macro and meso pores.&#xD;
	Nickel foam electrodes are applied as electrocatalysts for the oxidation of isopropanol.  The process is studied under well-defined experimental conditions using cyclic voltammetry.  The outcome of these experiments demonstrates that isopropanol oxidation requires the presence of -NiOOH on the Ni foam electrode.  This surface oxide is generated at potentials near the potential of the isopropanol oxidation; however, the two processes do not occur exactly at the same potentials.  The Ni foam anodes sustain a current density of ca. 2.6 mA cm–2 throughout an electrolysis time of up to 600 minutes without significant loss of electrocatalytic activity.  Isopropanol is converted to acetone at a rate of ca. 5.6 mM per hour. &#xD;
	The applicability of Ni foams as support materials for Pt is investigated.  Platinum particles are deposited on Ni foam in low loading amounts via the chemical reduction of Pt2+ and Pt4+ originating from aqueous Pt salt solutions.  The resulting Pt / Ni foams are characterized using electrochemical, analytical, and materials analysis techniques, including SEM to examine the morphology of the deposited material, CV to evaluate the Aecsa of the deposited Pt, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to determine the mass of deposited Pt.  The Pt / Ni foams are applied as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, hydrogen reduction, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline electrolyte.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ionomers are valued for their exceptional physical properties, antimicrobial activity and superior adhesion to high surface energy solids and polymer blend components. Carboxylate, or sulfonate derivatives, of ethylene-rich thermoplastics are the most commercially available ionomers. Elastomeric ionomers bearing quaternary ammonium and phosphonium halide functionality have a literary standing in both scientific and patent-based publications. Currently cationic ionomers have shown great prominence in their inactivity to a wide range of bacteria and fungi. &#xD;
The specific focus of this research is in the derivatives of isobutylene-rich elastomers due to their exceptional impermeability, oxidative stability and vibration dampening characteristics. Imidazole-derived ionomers support a wider range of ionomer chemistry compared to ammonium and phosphonium analogues. N alkylation of nucleophiles including butyl imidazole, vinyl imidazole and 1,1’(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole) by brominated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) yield thermally stable imidazolium bromide salts capable of supporting free radical cures and/or siliceous filler dispersions through further chemical modifications. &#xD;
The versatility of imidazole chemistry extends to the synthesis of isobutylene rich thermoset ionomers. This derives material properties from both a network of covalent crosslinks and a network of ion pair aggregates. Un-crosslinked elastomers are prone to creep and stress relaxation, hence a need for thermoset ionomer chemistry. Ion pairs are poorly solvated by the low dielectric constant of the polymer backbone and favoured thermodynamically by way of self assembly of the ionic functionality. The aggregation of ion pairs establishes a non covalent network of polymer chains whose dynamic mechanical properties approach those of conventional covalent thermosets comprised of carbon-carbon and/or sulfide crosslinks. However, the lability of this ionic network leads to a poor response to static loads leaving the thermoformable ionomers unqualified for engineering applications. A direct route is a more desirable method in preparing thermoset ionomers comprised of covalent crosslink networks and ionic functionality.&#xD;
In all, these reactive imidazolium ionomers look promising in supporting new value added applications for isobutylene rich derivatives, which include yet are not limited to elastomer thermosets, emulsions, filler composites and clay nanocomposites.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Both EGFR and HER-2 regulate tumor cell proliferation and survival through the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK) pathway. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are implicated in regulating proliferative and survival signaling downstream of the MAPK pathway. Here I show that CDK inhibitors exhibit an order-of-magnitude greater cytotoxic potency than a suite of inhibitors targeting RTK and Ras-MAPK signaling in cell lines representative of clinically recognized breast cancer subtypes. Drug combination studies showed that the pan CDK inhibitor, Flavopiridol, synergistically potentiated cytotoxicity induced by the Raf inhibitor, Sorafenib.  In vivo mouse models of breast cancer treated with both drugs exhibited reduced primary tumor growth rates and metastatic tumor load in the lungs compared to treatment with either drug alone, and this correlated with greater reductions in Rb signaling and Mcl-1 expression in resected tumors. In addition, Mek inhibition with U0126 potentiated the cytotoxic efficacy of Sorafenib, showing added benefits of drug combination to reduce doses while achieving greater therapeutic efficacy in a mutant Ras/Raf triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In vivo mouse models showed targeted Raf (Sorafenib) and Mek (AZD6244) inhibition resulted in reduced primary tumor growth and metastatic tumor load in the lungs, with the combined targeted Raf and Mek treatment showing greater inhibition than targeting either Raf or Mek alone. Synergistic anti-tumorigenic effects of the Sorafenib-Flavopiridol and Sorafenib-U0126/AZD6244 combinations across breast cancer cells driven by EGFR/HER-2 or Ras-MAPK signaling suggest the broad applicability of these combinations to treat multiple breast cancer subtypes. These data highlight the significance of co-targeting Raf, Mek, and CDKs to effectively disrupt constitutive Ras-MAPK signaling that may give rise to resistance and metastasis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Complex-phase (CP) steels are employed in applications that require high-strength and good edge formability. These steels derive their strength from a fine-grained bainite-ferrite microstructure, and alloying to provide solid-solution and precipitation strengthening. CP steels are produced industrially through a process of controlled rolling and cooling to produce desirable microstructures.&#xD;
     Hole-expansion tests are typically used as a measure of edge formability for applications such as stretch-flanges. It has been shown that CP microstructures are susceptible to large fluctuations in hole-expansion performance with little change in processing or resulting tensile properties. The steel’s characteristics of damage evolution are critical to the hole-expansion performance.&#xD;
     This study investigates the role of microstructure in the development of damage in CP microstructural variants. Two variant pairs of different thicknesses were produced from the leading and trailing edge of industrially produced hot-rolled sheet. Each pair consisted of a variant with poor hole-expansion performance, and a variant with good hole-expansion performance. Each variant was tested via interrupted double-notched uniaxial tension testing to induce damage. Damage evolution in each variant was quantified by X-ray micro-computed tomography (XµCT), and supplementary optical micrography. The damage results were correlated with microstructural characteristics.&#xD;
     It was shown that poor hole-expansion variants failed by intergranular fracture. In these variants, void damage induced by hard martensite and retained austenite was not critical in producing failure. Purely void-damaged microstructures failed by ductile fracture, whereas cracked microstructures failed in a mixed brittle-ductile failure initiated by planar cracks. Microstructural banding of large elongated ferrite grains correlated with the existence of intergranular planar fractures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nickeliferous laterite ores are currently processed using complex energy intensive flowsheets. Limited mineral upgrading can be achieved by low-cost mineral processing as the nickel is not found as a separable mineral phase but finely disseminated throughout the host goethite mineral. Whole ore extraction processes are required which result in intrinsically higher capital and operating costs. Market pressure has provided incentives to develop alternative upgrading techniques that can produce a nickel concentrate and reduce the material input to downstream processing facilities.  Thermal upgrading through a selective reduction mechanism to produce a ferronickel concentrate has been studied extensively and has shown promising potential.  In this research, a two stage selective reduction of nickeliferous laterite ore was investigated at 600oC and 1000 – 1100oC with varying coal and sulphur additions. &#xD;
Experiments showed that the limonite ore could be selectively reduced using a coal additive to a ferronickel and wustite phase. A combination of XRD and bromine/methanol diagnostic leach tests confirmed the presence of metallic nickel and iron in the calcine.  Higher degrees of metallization corresponded with higher sulphur additions and growth zone temperatures. Sulphur was added to improve particle growth through the establishment of a Fe-O-S liquid phase, which was found to improve Ni recovery from 13.8% to 75.8% over the range of 0 – 4 wt% S. &#xD;
Ferronickel particles ranging in size from 20 – 60 microns were shown to be present but highly dispersed throughout the upgraded ore. Particle growth improved with higher growth zone temperatures and longer retention times. Magnetic separation of the calcine showed maximum upgrading of grades to 3 – 4 wt% nickel with recoveries ranging from 83.7 – 93.2%.  Partial oxidation of wustite particles to magnetite caused the particles to be magnetic and resulted in recovery of unwanted iron oxides. The presence of iron oxide fines was believed to allow for rapid oxidation of wustite phase and also produce slimes that hindered physical separation of the upgraded ore.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Compared to other structures, such as the amygdala, the lateral septum’s (LS) role in the regulation of anxiety and/or behavioural defense is relatively understudied. Thus, the overarching goal of this thesis was to further investigate its contribution to rats’ anxiety-related behaviours. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate, for the first time, that while the dorsal LS does not mediate rats’ appetitive motivation or anxiety in the novelty induced suppression of feeding (NISF) paradigm, it does modulate their defensive behaviours in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and shock probe burying tests (SPBT). In Chapter 3, we are the first to show that bilateral infusions of histamine, a neurochemical previously linked to anxiety, into the LS reduce rats’ anxiety-related behaviours in the EPM and NISF. In addition, we report a novel double dissociation between lateral septal H1 and H2, and H3 receptors in their regulation of rats’ defensive behaviours in those two paradigms. More specifically, the H1 and H2 receptors contribute to rats’ hyponeophagia in the NISF but not their open arm exploration in the EPM, while the H3 receptors modulate rats’ defensive behaviors in the EPM but not in the NISF. Finally, in Chapter 4, we report for the first time that infusions of histamine into the LS, which produce behavioural anxiolysis, increase rather than decrease the frequency of reticular-elicited hippocampal theta activity, a putative neurophysiological correlate of anxiolytic-drug action. Altogether, the data in this thesis increase our understanding of how the LS contributes to rats’ defensive behaviours and adds to the existing literature regarding the neurobiology of fear/anxiety. More importantly though, the data presented here could ultimately aid in the development of novel drugs to treat anxiety disorders in humans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fes was first discovered as a protein-tyrosine kinase-encoded by the v-fes retroviral oncogene. Retrovirally encoded Fes oncoproteins induced tumors in chickens and cats and cause tumors in transgenic mice; however, a role for Fes in human cancer has not been established. This thesis identifies tumor promoting roles of Fes through effects on stromal cells using genetic mouse models. First, in an orthotopic mouse mammary gland engraftment model, I found that loss of Fes in the host correlated with reductions in engrafted tumor growth rates, metastasis and circulating tumor cells, which may be partly due to reduced vascularity and fewer tumor-associated macrophages. We also showed Fes-deficient macrophages were less capable of promoting tumor cell invasion in co-culture experiments. Next, I observed delayed tumor onset in the absence of Fes in a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer driven by an activated HER2/Neu allele. This longer tumor latency correlated with hyperinflammatory status of Fes-deficient normal mammary glands. Taken together, these observations argue that Fes inhibition might provide therapeutic benefits in breast cancer, by attenuating tumor-associated angiogenesis and the metastasis-promoting functions of tumor-associated macrophages, or by delaying breast tumor onset in women with HER2 overexpression. &#xD;
Finally, we showed that mice engrafted with IL-4 producing tumor cells developed tumors with significantly reduced growth rates and a complete attenuation of lung metastasis, which correlated with increased numbers of macrophages and enhanced phagocytic capability of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. These observations suggest that IL-4 could be a good candidate for immunotherapy.</dcterms:abstract>

All phonological tasks involve executive functions (EF) reflected in an individual’s flexibility for manipulating different components of language. To account for the EF demands involved in phonological tasks of reading, EF was assessed using measures of inhibitory control and switching attention as both a control variable and predictor in each model of reading. Two research questions guided the study: 1) Do prosodic ability and EF make independent contributions to word reading, and reading comprehension ability when controlling for the other? 2) Do prosodic ability and EF make unique contributions to word reading, and reading comprehension ability when controlling for the other, in addition to controlling for vocabulary, fluid (nonverbal) intelligence, rapid automatized naming (RAN - Digits), and phonological short-term memory (PSTM)? &#xD;
Participants were one hundred and three native-English speaking adults (18 to 55 years of age) recruited from Eastern Ontario. A total of 8 regression models were tested. The analyses revealed unique contributions of prosodic ability in adult word reading achievement, and EF in silent reading comprehension. Prosody’s contribution to word reading above EF supports prosodic awareness as a phonological skill that can be used to explain individual differences in word reading, whereas EF’s contribution to reading comprehension supports its’ role in more complex reading tasks. Prosody and EF represent constructs that warrant future consideration in models of reading.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores the cultural and socioeconomic factors that influence adult role transitions in Ghana. Guided by a life course theoretical framework, and using a nationally representative survey (2003-2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys), I estimate accelerated failure-time (AFT) log-normal models that control for the potential effects of unobserved heterogeneity due to the possible omission of certain relevant covariates. The models reveal that when the most optimal hazard distribution function is specified in an event history model, the problem of unobserved heterogeneity becomes significantly reduced. Results from both non-parametric and parametric models suggest a convergence in marriage and parenthood timing among contemporary young women and young men in Ghana compared with their older cohort, highlighting the salience of sociocultural timing on individuals’ life course decisions. &#xD;
The study also utilizes qualitative data from 30 in-depth interviews conducted in Aburi in the Eastern Region of Ghana, during the summer of 2010. The qualitative approach complements the survey methods by uncovering the influential role of the religious institution, a growing sense of individualism, as well as an emerging consumerist culture on family formation decisions in Ghana. Overall, the findings from this study indicate that the spread of information technology in the rapidly globalizing world has had differential effects on two birth cohorts in Ghana.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In previous in vitro and in vivo studies, decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has demonstrated unique bioactivity, but little is known about the bioactive components preserved in the decellularized scaffold. With the goal of characterizing the bioactive components in the DAT, protein was extracted from DAT samples from 3 donors using 5 different buffers.  The resulting DAT extracts were found to have very low protein content so molecular weight fractioning centrifugation was used to concentrate the samples. Concentrated extracts were screened for the presence of the bioactive components adiponectin, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Dickkopf related protein 1 (DKK-1) using Western blotting. Positive signal for BMP-2 was found for one donor in Roger’s Sample Buffer and Urea Buffer, but all other proteins investigated with Western blotting went undetected for all extraction buffers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also used to determine the presence and distribution of bioactive components in the DAT samples. Sections of DAT were probed for the same bioactive components; adiponectin, VEGF-A, BMP-2 and DKK-1, with positive signals detected for adiponectin and VEGF-A. In order to develop an injectable, DAT-derived hydrogel for soft tissue regeneration, DATgels were fabricated from an enzymatically treated and homogenized DAT pre-gel suspension, which was neutralized to physiological pH and salt concentration. The highly-hydrated DATgels, containing up to 97% water, were found to degrade substantially over 14 days in simulated physiological fluid, with only a slight reduction in the overall scaffold size. Histology and SEM showed no major structural differences between the two formulations evaluated (40 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL), with both containing intact DAT features and small void spaces scattered heterogeneously throughout the scaffold. Preliminary in vitro cell work with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) showed that the 40 mg/mL formulation DATgel supported cell attachment and viability greater than 70% for all scaffolds up to 7 days after seeding. Further, migration into the scaffold was observed over time, indicating that the adhesive properties of the native ECM were retained through the processing steps required to fabricate the DATgels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis appropriate statistical methods to overcome two types of problems that occur during parameter estimation in chemical engineering systems are studied. The first problem is having too many parameters to estimate from limited available data, assuming that the model structure is correct, while the second problem involves estimating unmeasured disturbances, assuming that enough data are available for parameter estimation. In the first part of this thesis, a model is developed to predict rates of undesirable reactions during the finishing stage of nylon 66 production. This model has too many parameters to estimate (56 unknown parameters) and not having enough data to reliably estimating all of the parameters. Statistical techniques are used to determine that 43 of 56 parameters should be estimated. The proposed model matches the data well. In the second part of this thesis, techniques are proposed for estimating parameters in Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). SDEs are fundamental dynamic models that take into account process disturbances and model mismatch. Three new approximate maximum likelihood methods are developed for estimating parameters in SDE models. First, an Approximate Expectation Maximization (AEM) algorithm is developed for estimating model parameters and process disturbance intensities when measurement noise variance is known. Then, a Fully-Laplace Approximation Expectation Maximization (FLAEM) algorithm is proposed for simultaneous estimation of model parameters, process disturbance intensities and measurement noise variances in nonlinear SDEs. Finally, a Laplace Approximation Maximum Likelihood Estimation (LAMLE) algorithm is developed for estimating measurement noise variances along with model parameters and disturbance intensities in nonlinear SDEs. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is compared with a maximum-likelihood based method. For the CSTR examples studied, the proposed algorithms provide more accurate estimates for the parameters. Additionally, it is shown that the performance of LAMLE is superior to the performance of FLAEM. SDE models and associated parameter estimates obtained using the proposed techniques will help engineers who implement on-line state estimation and process monitoring schemes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents an experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study on a rectangular S-bend with straight and diffusing passages with passive effusion cooling.  Experimental tests were performed at both cold and hot flow conditions over a range of Reynolds numbers from 2.5e5 to 4.5e5.  Hot flow testing was conducted with the primary flow temperature up to 300 °C.&#xD;
Severe backpressure penalties occurred with full-surface passive effusion injection in cold flow tests.  Moderate penalties occurred with reduced surface coverage whereby the performance was affected by the S-bend secondary fields with injection at different locations.  High surface cooling effectiveness with full-coverage of cooling film was measured; the impacts from the S-bend secondary flow fields were measured to be minimal.&#xD;
The CFD study revealed the importance of using experimental flow boundary conditions for simulations.  Using the standard k-ε model with wall functions was confirmed as appropriate for simulating the S-bend flow with effusion cooling.&#xD;
A coarse-grid CFD methodology using a porous wall boundary condition to simulate the effects of effusion cooling was investigated.  From a design perspective, this model is preferable for quantifying the injection flow rate since the actual mass flow rate is not known.  Comparison to the alternative solution using uniform mass flow boundary conditions showed that both models incorrectly predicted the momentum.  The porous wall model, however, is promising for practical design applications of S-duct flow fields with effusion injections.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The effluent quality from mining &amp; processing operations is monitored to ensure that maximum allowable limits are not exceeded. Recently, copper concentration levels in the effluent discharge flows of a copper and nickel mining company in Ontario have indicated increasing trends. A chemical particular to the problem is use of diethylenetriamine (DETA) in the process.&#xD;
Adsorption tests were conducted to investigate the ability of various adsorbents to remove and retain copper complexed with DETA and triethylenetetramine (TETA) in solutions. The tests were divided into two sections: gangue adsorbents (silica and pyrrhotite) and high capacity adsorbents (natural bentonite, peat, zeolite Y and zeolite ZSM-5).&#xD;
Pyrrhotite as a sulphide gangue had a greater adsorption capacity than silica for the concentration range studied. At 1 ppm initial concentration, over 80% of copper chelate was removed by minus 400 mesh pyrrhotite compared to 72% of the same size silica. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models of adsorption are applicable. However, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm was found to more closely represent the experimental data with a maximum adsorption capacity of 129.9 μg/g for copper complexed with DETA on pyrrhotite.&#xD;
For the high capacity adsorbents, natural bentonite, zeolite Y and peat each worked well at removing the copper chelates. Zeolite Y had the highest capacity for copper chelates and a maximum adsorption capacity of 55.9 mg/g. Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherm models were studied with the Langmuir isotherm model more closely representing the experimental data.&#xD;
iii&#xD;
Studies were also conducted on the effect of temperature. This led to a thermodynamic analysis of adsorption and estimation of activation energies. The standard free energies estimated for adsorption of copper chelated on adsorbents studied were nearly always negative, typically varying from around -2 kJ/mol to -7 kJ/mol with increasing temperature. The activation energy was found to be highest for the natural bentonite system suggesting a strong adsorption (e.g. 40.5 kJ/mol for CuTETA). Desorption experiments on the peat indicated very poor reversal for the process, confirming that the adsorption of copper chelates on high capacity adsorption was indeed very strong. Settling experiments indicated copper chelates were highly effective as coagulants on bentonite.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The rising environmental and financial consequences of using fossil fuels as an energy source and energy carrier are a global concern. Described herein are two hydrogen-storing technologies, each of which was envisioned as a potential solution to said consequences: hydrogen-storing polymethylpyridylsiloxanes for use as an alternative energy carrier to fossil fuels; and thermally regenerative fuel cell systems to supplement or supplant vehicular alternators. A thermally regenerative fuel cell (TRFC) system is being developed to convert waste heat from an internal combustion engine (ICE) system into electricity that can be used to power auxiliary vehicular components. The TRFC system will comprise a dehydrogenation reactor and a fuel cell positioned relative to the ICE system such that the two components are held at 200 °C and 100 °C, respectively. 1-Phenyl-1-propanol has been identified as an optimal hydrogen storing liquid (XH2) that will selectively dehydrogenate over a heterogeneous catalyst to give a dehydrogenated liquid (propiophenone, X) and H2. The heterogeneous catalyst that currently provides the best selectivity (99.65%) for X at 200 °C is Pd/SiO2. A selectivity of ≥ 99.9% was desired to obtain the longest possible operational lifetime for the working fluids XH2/X. To increase the selectivity for X from 99.65% to ≥ 99.9%, size and shape specific Pd nanoparticles were synthesized. Pd nanocubes (20 nm) provided the best selectivity for X at 99.26%. It was concluded that a reproducible selectivity for X of ≥ 99.9% was not currently obtainable, and that a selectivity for X no greater than 99 % should be assumed when calculating the working fluids’ operational lifetime. Hydrogen-storing polymethylpyridylsiloxanes were proposed as energy carrier alternatives to fossil fuels. Polymethylpyridylsiloxanes were considered, in part, due to the expansive liquid ranges of siloxane polymers [-40 ˚C to 250 ˚C]; this would allow the polymethylpyridylsiloxanes to be stored and pumped into vehicles using existing refueling infrastructure. Polymethylpyridylsiloxanes, and analogs thereof, however, were not successfully synthesized and reversibly hydrogenated: either the desired product(s) could not be synthesized, isolated, and/or purified; or, hydrogenation resulted in product decomposition. It was concluded, therefore, that implementing polymethylpyridylsiloxanes as hydrogen-storing liquids is not viable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death of women in North America. Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Stat)3 and Stat5 are transcription factors involved in normal breast development, and are hyperactivated in 30-50% of breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Stat5 is required for breast epithelial cell differentiation and is over-expressed in breast cancers with a more differentiated phenotype. Constitutive over-expression of Stat3 in breast cancer, on the other hand, can drive expression of genes involved in survival, migration and angiogenesis. Our group has previously elucidated a novel activation mechanism of Stat3 by cadherin engagement in densely growing cells. We hypothesize that Stat5 and Stat3 are regulators of the balance between differentiation and transformation of breast epithelial cells: Stat3 activation is modulated by a cadherin/Rac1 pathway, and this may be necessary for differentiation. Stat5 on the other hand may play a role in differentiation independent of cell density. Therefore, Stat3 and Stat5 may turn out to be independent prognostic markers for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
We show here, through pharmacological inhibition experiments, that Stat3 is required for differentiation of HC11 breast epithelial cells, measured by β-casein expression. On the other hand, we also show that constitutively active Rac, a molecule downstream of cadherin in the Stat3 activation pathway, blocks the differentiation of breast epithelial cells. Stat5 is upregulated by hydrocortisone, insulin and prolactin, but is unaffected by density. Stat5 is also required for differentiation; moreover we show that expression of activated Stat5 in HC11 breast epithelial cells promotes a more differentiated phenotype. As an initial approach to biomarker development, we have optimized a quantitative analysis method to assess protein expression profiles of clinically relevant robust biomarkers using a 63 tumour breast cancer cohort. Automated quantitative analysis of protein expression in human breast cancer specimens, including target genes of Stat3 and Stat5, cyclin D1 and p21, are statistically similar to manual scoring, and correlate with clinico-pathological parameters. These data provide a vital link between benchwork and clinical studies, and could lead to possible future predictive biomarkers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Genomic integrity is preserved by checkpoints, which are signal transduction pathways that serve to delay cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage or replication stress. The heterotrimeric Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex is a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like clamp that is loaded onto DNA at structures resulting from damage, and is important for initiating and maintaining checkpoint signaling. Rad9 possesses a C-terminal tail unrelated to PCNA that is phosphorylated constitutively and in response to cell cycle position and DNA damage. Previous studies have identified tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) as a kinase that may modify Rad9.  This thesis establishes that Rad9 is indeed phosphorylated in a TLK-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo, and that T355 within the C-terminal tail is the primary targeted residue. Phosphorylation of Rad9 at T355 is quickly reduced upon exposure to ionizing radiation before returning to baseline later in the damage response. In addition, TLK1 and Rad9 were shown to interact constitutively, and this interaction is enhanced in chromatin-bound Rad9 at later stages of the damage response. Furthermore, this thesis demonstrates that TLK1 is required for progression through S-phase in normally cycling cells, and that depletion of TLK1 results in a prolonged G2/M arrest upon exposure to ionizing radiation, a phenotype that is mimicked by over-expression of a Rad9-T355A mutant. Given that TLK1 is transiently inactivated upon phosphorylation by Chk1 in response to DNA damage, this work proposes that TLK1 and Chk1 act in concert to modulate the phosphorylation status of Rad9, which in turn plays a role in regulating the DNA damage response.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2011, National Football League (NFL) quarterback Tim Tebow gripped America when the Denver Broncos reeled off a series of thrilling wins in an unlikely playoff run. Surrounding this stretch of Bronco wins was a media frenzy popularly known as “Tebow Mania”. The media explosion around Tebow can be attributed to his perplexing character and the political, cultural and social circumstances in 2011. This thesis is a critical media discourse analysis of Tebow’s sport star identity. I analyze the ways in which Tebow was described during the heights of his popularity during the 2011 NFL season. I argue that Tebow’s sport star identity naturalized ideologies of rightwing conservatism, (rightwing) conservative Christian fundamentalism and white masculinity into “common sense” notions of social life. To accomplish this, I follow cultural studies methodologies that trace Tebow’s rise to prominence within the context of The Tea Party Movement. I outline two dominant narratives that emerged during Tebow Mania to fabricate an American Dream, underdog story. While the first narrative of polarization criticizes and contemplates Tebow’s muscular Christianity, the counter-narrative repackages the polarization of Tebow by celebrating his white racial identity and conservative American values.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The development of forest-based biorefineries has the potential to both provide a source of sustainable, low carbon fuel and increase the value drawn from wood residues to help revitalize the forest sector.  There has been significant progress toward developing forest biorefining technologies, supported to some extent through government programs, though there are still several barriers to development.  Realization of commercial-scale facilities however, will likely be limited by logistical constraints associated with maintaining a consistent supply of woody feedstock and the high capital cost of constructing the facility. To address this issue, mill clusters with sufficient processing capacity were located and evaluated for their suitability to house a forest biorefinery.  Existing single-entity mill clusters in Canada were identified according to a set of criteria, and provide the basis for the analysis to determine feedstock supply costs and potential availability.  The optimal biorefinery sites within each cluster were identified using a transportation module developed for this study and evaluated according to other factors that would affect the suitability of the site for a large scale forest biorefinery, such as access to markets, other available feedstocks and energy sources.  There were four mill clusters identified in eastern Canada that have the potential to support a commercial forest biorefinery.  A facility that is centrally located within one of the identified clusters would expect to have a feedstock cost ranging from approximately $95 to $110 per odt.  A series of key informant interviews were carried out to further assess the cluster approach to forest biorefinery development.  Interviewees generally agreed that the identified locations could potentially support a commercial biorefinery and suggested there are currently significant volumes of underutilized wood in these regions.  Forest biorefinery development in the cluster regions, especially where there is mixed forest, should be further pursued.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zirconium and its alloys have been used extensively in both light and heavy water reactors where neutron irradiation is known to cause microstructural evolution, leading to degradation of mechanical properties and dimensional instabilities. Dimensional instabilities due to irradiation growth are particularly crucial for Zr alloy Excel which is the proposed candidate material for the conceptual CANDU-Super Critical Water Cooled Reactors (SCWR) pressure tube. This study employs the in-situ ion irradiation technique and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the irradiation induced microstructural evolution in Zr and Zr alloy Excel.&#xD;
The current study is presented as a manuscript format dissertation comprised of five manuscript chapters. Chapter 3 reports the formation of irradiation induced prismatic defects directly from cascade collapse in pure Zr at low dose (0.008 dpa) in a temperature range of 300oC-500oC. The morphology and yield of these defects are found to be temperature and dose dependent. In Chapter 4, irradiating Zircaloy-2 under similar conditions to pure Zr, reveals that nucleation rate of small prismatic loops increases, whereas their growth is suppressed which indicates that these defect clusters are not only temperature dependent but also impurity dependent.&#xD;
Chapters 5, 6 and 7 report the irradiation induced microstructural changes at various temperatures up to a dose of 10 dpa, in several microstructures of Zr alloy Excel, achieved by different solution treatments. The major focus of these experimental studies was the formation of &lt;c&gt;-component loops in α-phase; decomposition of β-phase; and irradiation induced microchemical changes. It was found that nucleation and growth of &lt;c&gt;-component loops is strongly dependent on irradiation temperature, parent microstructure, and presence of alloying elements. &lt;c&gt;-component loops nucleate above a threshold incubation dose which decreases with an increase of irradiation temperature. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping on irradiated microstructures revealed the formation of small Sn clusters in α-phase which have a significant effect on the morphology of &lt;c&gt;-component loops. Fe plays an important role in the nucleation of &lt;c&gt;-component loops, as it distributes itself during irradiation either from β-phase or from pre-existing secondary phase precipitates in α-phase. Furthermore irradiation induced decomposition of β-phase was observed in the form of ω-phase precipitation and irradiation induced clustering of alloying elements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although relationships are central to psychological health throughout the lifespan, not all children have caring adults in their lives that can provide nurturing and stable relationships.  Mentoring was established as a means of providing these essential adult relationships to at-risk children.  Although the history of formal mentoring traces back to the beginning of 20th century America, only recently have systematic investigations of mentoring programs been conducted.  Furthermore, a wide range of mentoring programs across North America have been implemented which has outpaced the research community’s ability to provide evidence-based practice guidelines.  The goal of this dissertation was to contribute to research and practice in the field of youth mentoring.  In the first study I evaluated the effects of participating in a school-based intergenerational mentoring program. Although I did not find benefits of program participation for mentors or mentees, I identified methodological limitations that are important for future studies to take into consideration and determined two key strengths of the program.  In the second study, I compared mentee, mentor, and mentoring coordinator perspectives on mentoring relationship quality and examined how two components of mentor-mentee interactions, relationship dimensions and mentor-mentee shared experiences, were associated with these different perspectives.  I developed an observational rating scale to examine a new framework of relationships dimensions, identified several elements that characterize high quality mentoring relationships, and provided suggestions for how to apply this knowledge to mentor training.  In the last study, I discussed the connection between research and practice in youth mentoring and identified strategies to promote collaborative interactions that empower individuals, build social relationships, and create synergy between researchers and practitioners.  &#xD;
Through my investigation of both mentor-mentee and research-practice relationships, I gained insight into the processes of successful relationship formation and characteristics of long-term relationships.  I encountered several methodological barriers and used these as opportunities to identify strategies for overcoming challenges inherent in mentoring research.  The knowledge gained through this dissertation can be applied by mentoring agencies to develop evidence-based mentor training programs and by researchers and practitioners to form successful research-practice collaborations, which are necessary to continue to further our understanding of youth mentoring.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The research performed in this work investigated evaporative spray cooling systems using water near a 45 degree bends in gas turbine exhaust piping systems. Both experimental data and numerical data were generated with the goal of evaluating the ability of Fluent 6.3.26 to predict the performance of these systems for the purpose of design using only modest computational resources. Three cases were investigated in this research: single phase exhaust flow with no water injection, injecting water before the bend and injecting water after the bend. Various probes were used to measure dry bulb temperature, total pressure and water mass flux of the two phase flow at the exit of the pipe. Seven hole probes and pitot static probes were used to measure single phase flow properties.&#xD;
Numerical simulations were performed using mass flow boundary conditions which were generated from experimental results. A turbulence model was selected for the simulations based on comparisons of single phase simulations with experimental data and convergence ability. Using Fluent’s discrete phase model, different wall boundary conditions for the discrete phase were used in order to find the model which would best match the evaporation rates of the experimental data. Mass flux values through the exit plane of the pipe were found to be the most reliable of all the two phase data collected.&#xD;
Results from numerical simulations revealed the shortcomings of the available discrete phase wall boundary conditions to accurately predict the interaction of the liquid phase with the wall. Experimental results for both cases showed extensive areas of the wall which had liquid film layers running down the length of the pipe. Simulations resulted in particles either failing to impact the wall and create a liquid film, or creating a liquid film which was much smaller than the film present in experimental results. This led to 8% and 15% discrepancy in evaporation &#xD;
amounts between numerical and experimental results for water injection upstream and downstream of the bend respectively. Under-prediction of areas wetted with a wall film in the simulations also led to gross over predictions of wall temperature in numerical results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study was carried out to investigate the flotation and leaching behaviour of bornite and chalcopyrite when they are together as principal sulphide minerals. Bench scale flotation performance was examined both in the absence and in the presence of a collector, PEX. In the absence of a collector, chalcopyrite floated significantly better than bornite. In the presence of a collector there was a reversal in selectivity, with bornite recovery presiding over that of chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite recovery was marginally improved from the collectorless flotation case while bornite experienced vastly improved recoveries in the presence of a collector to surpass the recovery of chalcopyrite. The gap between floatability of bornite and chalcopyrite became more prominent under oxygen-deficient conditions induced by nitrogen flotation, which significantly decreased flotation rate of both minerals, but the floatability of bornite was still much higher than that of chalcopyrite. It is suggested that galvanic interactions promote the interaction of bornite with a collector while retarding interactions of chalcopyrite with the collector. Collectorless flotation of chalcopyrite observed under oxidizing conditions using air is thought to be prevalent even in the presence of a collector obscuring the selectivity of the process.&#xD;
Leaching of the mixtures of bornite and chalcopyrite at mass ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 3:1 are performed under various conditions to investigate the possible changes in leaching behaviour in relation to galvanic interactions. Leaching at 90°C in the presence of 0.1 M ferric ions in 0.1 M sulphuric acid provided the best results with 90% copper extraction from the mixtures in 6 hours. Observed copper extractions suggested increased copper extraction from chalcopyrite with this approach. The introduction of cupric and ferrous ions into solution, together with variation of solution potential made it difficult to assess in details on the effects of galvanic interactions due to these parameters being known to improve copper extraction from chalcopyrite. Galvanic interactions together with the presence of cupric ions were held mainly responsible for the increased copper extraction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As a major project, this work studies the spoken word genre as a response to, and interpretation of, oppression and examine my own spoken word performance through the lens of narratology, narrative-making and auto-ethnography. This project is composed of two parts: a full-length spoken word performance and a curatorial analysis of this performance. While attempting to re-enact the trauma of oppression, this performance dually recognizes the impossibility within the task. Maurice Blanchot writes in The Writing of the Disaster, “The disaster, unexperienced. It is what escapes the very possibility of experience- it is the limit of writing. This must be repeated: the disaster de- scribes.” This project aims to perform the places of de-scription. In poems detailing experiences of trauma, racism, misogyny, and relationships, this spoken word performance will offer an account of the subject for whom the act of narration is subversive. In this, the performance is self-aware and self-reflective; it communicates experiences for which the language to describe such experiences is either unavailable or nonexistent. The continuous theme of ‘home’ is maintained throughout the performance- how its absence marks the absence of the oppressed subject, how its absence implies the absence of language for the subject, and how spoken word can begin the outlining of a narrative, a foundation, for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
My accompanying curatorial paper will examine similar themes. As spoken word is an art form deeply linked to activism, my paper will begin with an analysis of how this art has taken place, what its role has been in community development, and how it continues to&#xD;
 &#xD;
function as a teaching tool. My paper argues that spoken word is instrumental in tying learning to voice; by offering young people a medium that both gives them a forum to voice the issues directly impacting their lives, while giving them a means of developing skills in language, presentation and communicating ideas effectively, spoken word acts as a unique and important teaching tool.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) display deficits in voluntary saccade generation but improved automatic, visually-triggered saccade performance. This can be tested using prosaccades, saccades to visual stimuli, and antisaccades, saccades in the opposite direction from the visual stimuli. Voluntary saccade impairments resulting in antisaccade direction errors and longer saccadic reaction times (SRTs) are thought to be due to insufficient presetting of neural circuitry during saccade preparation in complex tasks involving suppression and selection. The basal ganglia, a major site of PD pathology, might be the cause of abnormalities in preparing for action selection in PD patients. Recently, microsaccade rates have been hypothesized to reflect the dual preparatory signals of saccade facilitation and suppression. In this thesis, we investigated the microsaccade behaviour of PD patients as they performed prosaccades and antisaccades. We hypothesized that deficits in voluntary movements in PD would result in impaired suppression of involuntary movements as reflected by increased microsaccade rates. Our findings demonstrate consistently elevated microsaccade rates in PD subjects compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, positive correlations were found between antisaccade direction error rate and microsaccade rate as well as microsaccade rate and Hoehn-Yahr score, an indicator of disease severity in PD patients. We conclude that microsaccades reflect the impaired suppression of involuntary movements caused by voluntary movement deficits in PD pathology. Our findings indicate that microsaccades provide insight into action preparatory mechanisms and BG dysfunction. Therefore, measuring microsaccades in PD may provide a useful biomarker to follow disease progression and effectiveness of treatment therapies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (alkyl-PAHs) are major constituents of crude oil, and the 3-5 ringed alkyl-PAHs have been identified as the main components chronically toxic to fish. While chysene homologues have higher cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) induction potencies than alkyl-phenanthrenes, there is little characterization of toxicity for 4-ringed alkyl PAHs. This study measured the chronic toxicity of chrysene, benz[α]anthracene, and some alkylated congeners to the embryos of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) using the partition-controlled delivery method (PCD) of exposure. This exposure method relies on the partitioning of chemicals from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films, loaded with various concentrations of test chemical, to embryo rearing solutions. The objectives of this thesis were: (1) to further characterize the PCD method with a series of 4-ringed PAHs; (2) to evaluate the effects of different chemical structures on the toxicity of test compounds; and (3) to extend structure toxicity relationships from alkyl-phenanthrenes. The PCD method generated a gradient of aqueous concentrations for test compounds, and these exposure concentrations were maintained constant for the 17-day period. Benz[α]anthracene showed higher toxicity than chrysene. Toxicity increased with the degree of alkylation on the ring structures, except that 2-methylbenz[α]anthracene was less toxic than the unsubstituted benz[α]anthracene. Substitutions at the middle region contributed to a higher toxicity than substitutions at the distal region. While actual mechanisms for these compounds to cause toxicity are unknown, the narcotic mode of action seems to be not involved due to the lack of mortality. Within the range of test concentrations, the chronic sublethal toxicity was limited by the low solubility of the test compounds. A structure toxicity relationship was illustrated by the regression between log EC50s and log Kow values. In addition to hydrophobicity represented by log Kow, structural dissimilarities between compounds and physical characteristics such as aqueous solubility limits should be taken into account in toxicity assessments with alkyl-PAHs. This research is the first toxicological assessment of alkyl-chrysenes and benz[α]anthracenes which is essential for a better understanding of structure toxicity relationships of alkyl-PAHs, and will contribute to more accurate ecological risk assessments of PAH contamination.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pseudo-plane strain compression tests are carried out on rolled plate Zircaloy-2 using different &#xD;
combinations of loaded and constrained sample directions relative to the plate principal directions. Lattice &#xD;
strains are measured for 17 out of 18 possible measureable sample directions. The inability to obtain true &#xD;
plane strain led to little effect of the compression rig on deformation during elastic loading; however &#xD;
noticeable differences are seen when compared to similar uniaxial data for Zircaloy-2 in the plastic &#xD;
region. Work hardening increased with increased constraint and was affected by the configuration of &#xD;
loaded and constrained sample directions.  &#xD;
 &#xD;
Constraint showed significant effects on twinning when twinning was present. For the RD loaded cases &#xD;
the initiation of twinning occurs at -318 MPa for the RD/ND case (RD loaded, ND constrained direction) &#xD;
and -420 MPa for the RD/TD case. Intensity profiles of the (0002) and {101&#xD;
̅&#xD;
0} indicate that more &#xD;
twinning occurs in the RD/TD case than the RD/ND case. For TD/YD an amplification of twinning was &#xD;
seen in the TD/RD when compared to the TD/ND. This is indicated both by texture results as well as the &#xD;
intensity profiles of the (0002) and {101&#xD;
̅&#xD;
0}. &#xD;
 &#xD;
Using the experimental data an elastic-plastic self-consistent (EPSC) code was used to probe the &#xD;
micromechanical processes that are occurring when the compression rig is operated. The experimental &#xD;
data was used further to constrain the hardening parameters of the EPSC code using an inverse approach. &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>First Person Shooter (FPS) games are one of the most popular game genres and have a history of over 2 decades. While there has been extensive research on such games, the focus has been limited to their analysis at an individual level. In this thesis, we present a comparative analysis of three first person shooter games - Doom, Quake3 and Cube from an architectural point of view. All of these games have come at different times in the history of first person shooter games, and thus possess different and unique features.  We describe the process followed in deriving their architecture at various levels of abstraction – the file level, the subsystem level, the library/non-library level and the individual subsystem level for a given part of code. We conclude with a comparative analysis of the similarities and differences in the structure and architecture of the three gaming systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although neurotrophins are conventionally associated with the proper growth and&#xD;
survival of developing neurons, there is increasing evidence that they play an equally&#xD;
significant role in the functions of adult neurons. Specifically, brain derived neurotrophic&#xD;
factor activation of its preferred receptor TrkB is essential in the regulation of&#xD;
motoneuronal activity. Neurotrophin‐dependent and independent activation of TrkB&#xD;
regulates the motoneuronal dendritic integrity, and maintains unique classes of synapses. In&#xD;
addition, it regulates the expression and function of ion channels as well as the strength of&#xD;
inhibitory and excitatory synapses via different intracellular pathways. The recent&#xD;
physiological findings in the regulatory roles of TrkB are implicative of its presence on&#xD;
motoneuronal dendrites. Although, the expression of TrkB in the soma has long been&#xD;
confirmed, its distribution on the dendritic tree of motoneurons remains unknown. We&#xD;
aimed to examine the distribution of TrkB in the cytoplasm and membrane‐associated&#xD;
regions of the dendritic tree of adult neck motoneurons.&#xD;
We have determined, via confocal microscopy, that TrkB is present and abundant&#xD;
throughout the cytoplasm and the membrane‐associated regions of motoneuronal dendrites&#xD;
as well as the soma. TrkB is organized in clusters and its distribution is best described as&#xD;
punctated. We then developed a technique to separately extract and quantify the TrkB&#xD;
immunoreactivity associated with the membrane and the cytoplasm as function of distance&#xD;
from the soma and dendritic tree. We have demonstrated that there is no bias in TrkB&#xD;
immunoreactivity to a specific region of the dendritic tree in five trapezius motoneurons.&#xD;
These observations were confirmed for both cytoplasmic and membrane‐associated TrkB.&#xD;
There is compelling evidence that both mature full‐length and immature&#xD;
hypoglycosylated TrkB isoforms are active in strengthening the response to excitatory&#xD;
synapses in motoneurons. We identified the full length TrkB as well as 3 hypoglycosylated isoforms in cervical spinal segments that contain trapezius motoneurons and phrenic&#xD;
motoneurons.&#xD;
Taken together, these data indicate that TrkB is likely involved in regulating and&#xD;
maintaining different classes of ion channels and synapses on the dendrites as well as the&#xD;
soma. Various isoforms of TrkB may also be involved in regulating motoneuronal activity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The liquid argon target of the DEAP-3600 dark matter detector is contained by an extremely radiopure acrylic vessel. Alpha decays from the inner surface of the acrylic vessel are a source of background. If a fraction of the alpha energy is observed, or if the recoiling nucleus from the alpha decay is observed, the event will not be separated from a dark matter candidate event. In addition to the low level of inherent contamination from uranium and thorium, the Pb-210 from Rn-222 diffusion during manufacturing must be measured. The limit for the DEAP-3600 acrylic vessel is 1.1 × 10^−20 g/g Pb-210. By vaporizing a large quantity of acrylic and counting the concentrated residue with an ultralow background HPGe well detector and a low background alpha spectrometer, the bulk acrylic was found to have an upper limit of 10^−19 g/g Pb-210. The design, installation, commissioning, operation, and analysis for various aspects of the acrylic assay are described.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigated polymer properties for their application as extractants in two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs), which are intended to remove inhibitory fermentation products as they are produced. Three applications of polymer TPPB extractants were studied, followed by an investigation into poly(ether)-based polymers’ affinity toward representative target molecules, to identify properties which confer improved extraction performance. &#xD;
The first investigation aimed to replace a liquid extractant (silicone oil) using a block copolymer, Hytrel® 8206, in the biotransformation of indene to cis-(1S,2R)-indandiol, a chiral pharmaceutical intermediate, by Pseudomonas putida ATCC55687. The polymer simultaneously delivered substrate and removed the product and by-products to alleviate inhibition, improving operability and productivity relative to silicone oil, which could only deliver substrate. Subsequently, soft segment composition and proportion were varied in different block copolymers to selectively extract product or by-product(s) from the same biotransformation, altering the cells’ production profile. This demonstrated selective polymer extraction to help direct substrate utilization toward the product rather than by-product(s) in complex biotransformations.&#xD;
The next study was on absorptive extraction of a hydrophilic target molecule, 4-valerolactone, produced by recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440, featuring an equilibrium-limited final step. The aim was to demonstrate the first application of equilibrium-pulling using selective product absorption, improving production by 30%. Furthermore, this study showed that limited polymer water absorption is helpful to aid in extraction of hydrophilic target molecules, but high polymer water content compromises selectivity, diminishing the equilibrium-pulling effect. &#xD;
Finally, the effects of soft block proportion, molecular weight, and chain-end composition on affinity toward representative target molecules, carveol and carvone, were studied using commercial block copolymers and their representative homopolymer components. Target molecule affinity improved at low molecular weights in the absence of polar homopolymer end-groups. End-group polarity had an effect whose direction depended on the polarity of the target molecule, improving affinity toward a third, polar target molecule, 4-valerolactone, thereby providing a means to tailor selectivity. Crystallinity and hard segment proportion were both found to reduce uptake.&#xD;
This work has provided insights into the selection of polymeric TPPB absorbents by identifying polymer properties which improve affinity and selectivity toward different fermentation target molecules, especially relatively hydrophilic ones. The future design of purpose-built polymer extractants will benefit from considering these findings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation studies volatility measurement and modeling issues when asset prices are subject to price limits based on Bayesian approaches. Two types of estimators are developed to consistently estimate integrated volatility in the presence of price limits. One is a realized volatility type estimator, but using both realized asset prices and simulated asset prices. The other is a discrete sample analogue of integrated volatility using posterior samples of the latent volatility states. These two types of estimators are first constructed based on the simple log-stochastic volatility model in Chapter 2. The simple log-stochastic volatility framework is extended in Chapter 3 to incorporate correlated innovations and further extended in Chapter 4 to accommodate jumps and fat-tailed innovations. For each framework, a MCMC algorithm is designed to simulate the unobserved asset prices, model parameters and latent states. Performances of both type estimators are also examined using simulations under each framework. Applications to Chinese stock markets are also provided.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Meeting observations, literature review, document analysis, and Delphi surveying are used within a “mixed methodology” to tease out emerging patterns of thought in an effort to provide an urban forestry coalition, “Trees for Life” with critical information that could be used to help shape future projects. The purpose of this research is to identify key themes to help direct future Trees for Life (TFL) projects, and to also recognize stakeholders and possible new players to establish more productive partnerships within the coalition. Specific barriers that impede the success of TFL are also outlined. Ecological degradation of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) watershed continues, despite the many initiatives carried out by the Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) to protect and conserve ecosystem health. Social change is critical in addressing this issue. The TFL coalition is an umbrella group beneath Green Infrastructure Ontario (GIO), another coalition working towards establishing green infrastructure technologies and practices as required components of urban planning and development to address ecological degradation. This coalition is overseen by a steering committee that includes TRCA. The overarching goal of TFL is to increase tree canopy cover in the GTA to 40%.  The TFL is comprised of several urban forestry groups, each with unique roles and perspectives, but all striving to achieve the 40% goal. This research will help TFL to build adaptive capacity and may lead to the adoption of adaptive environmental management techniques. Ultimately, this study will provide some valuable insight into TFL and other programs involved with enhancing social-ecological resilience of the TRCA and the GTA.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In response to viral infection, host cells activate various antiviral defence mechanisms to inhibit virus replication. Therefore in order for a virus to replicate efficiently, it must counteract cellular antiviral defence. Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a cellular protein involved in intrinsic immunity. It inherently forms nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) that assemble at the site of viral genomes. Proteins related to epigenetic regulation are recruited to PML-NBs, and silence viral gene transcription. This study focuses on the role of two herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) proteins, ICP0 and Us3, in disrupting PML-NBs and counteracting cellular antiviral defence. En passant mutagenesis was used to create recombinant HSV-2 viruses lacking ICP0, Us3, or both ICP0 and Us3. Growth analysis of these recombinants indicates no growth defects for the ICP0Δ virus, while the Us3Δ virus grows to one log lower titres than wild type virus (WT). By contrast, the ICP0Δ virus displays a delay in PML-NB disruption, but the Us3Δ virus is as efficient as WT. However, Us3 is still important for PML-NB disruption, since the ICP0Δ/Us3Δ double mutant exhibits a greater delay than the ICP0Δ single mutant. Although PML is a mediator of the interferon (IFN) response and it was predicted that ICP0 and Us3 interfere with the IFN response through disruption of PML-NBs, my results show that only some HSV-2 Us3Δ clones are hypersensitive to the effects IFN, and others are resistant. Us3 affects more than one cellular pathway, and those cellular pathways are affected by more than one viral protein. I conclude that the activities of multiple viral proteins create a fine balance between activating cellular pathways to promote virus replication, and inhibiting cellular antiviral defence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the emergence of flexible display technologies, graphical user interfaces will no longer be limited to flat surfaces. As such, it will become necessary for interface designers to move beyond flat display designs, contextualizing interaction in an object’s physical shape. Grounded in early explorations of Organic User Interfaces (OUIs), this thesis examines the evolving relationship between industrial and interaction design and argues that not only what, but how we design is changing. To understand how to better design OUIs, we report on an empirical study of pointing behavior that shows how Fitts’ law can model movement time on an extremely convex surface. We also show that touch sensing technology can be repurposed for the OUI design process by making it possible to tape, draw, or paint touch sensing directly on a physical prototype. We then discuss how supporting sketching, a fundamental activity of many design fields, is increasingly critical for the interactive three-dimensional forms in OUI and that a ‘hypercontextualized’ approach to their design can reduce the drawbacks met when everyday objects become interactive. Finally, we discuss that when interactive hardware is seamlessly melded into an object’s shape, the ‘computer’ disappears. When designing OUIs, it is better seen as a basic material, like the clay, foam core, or plastics used by an industrial designer, and one that happens to have interactive potential.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis focuses on the design and analysis of a novel variable inductor (VID) based VCO solution to the frequency tuning range (TR) limitation of the IEEE 802.11ad compliant radio systems. The IEEE 802.11ad standard has drawn strong attention from the industry as the next generation affordable multi-gigabit speed wireless communication standard. Prepared for the global market, IEEE 802.11ad compliant systems are required to cover a broad 8 GHz TR centered on 60 GHz. This wide TR at V band imposes significant challenge to the VCO design in radio transceivers, and makes the TR of the integrated VCO a major bottleneck to the successful commercialization of many IEEE 802.11ad compliant radio systems today.&#xD;
&#xD;
As an effort to solve the current TR problem for the IEEE 802.11ad compliant radio systems, 2 VCOs designs based on this novel VID-based solution and a conventional Colpitts-Clapp VCO design are presented in this thesis report. The novel VCOs integrate a VID into the differential Colpitts configuration to create a feasible solution to the aforementioned TR problem. The VID in the VCO tank eliminates the base node varactors and their fixed parasitic capacitance that degrades TR in conventional VCO designs, while the differential Colpitts configuration provides advantageous performance at mm-wave frequencies and high output power for real-world applications. Also, a fundamental 30 GHz Colpitts-Clapp VCO was developed in conjunction with the other 2 VCOs for comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
One of the 2 VID-based VCO designs is a fundamental 30 GHz VID-based Colpitts VCO that covers 17% TR for proof of concept to the novel topology. Another is an IEEE 802.11ad compliant 60 GHz VCO chain consists of the 30 GHz VID-based Colpitts VCO and a frequency doubler covering 17% TR with 3 dBm output power and -115.7 dBc/Hz phase noise at 10 MHz offset. The conventional Colpitts-Clapp VCO is used to compare with the other 2 VID-based VCOs. As the measurement results indicate, this VID-based VCO topology provides a viable solution to overcome the TR bottleneck in the current IEEE 802.11ad compliant VCO development. All 3 VCOs are fabricated using a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Met has been found to be over-expressed in human breast cancer, correlating with disease progression and poor prognosis. Src and Stat3 have also been found to be over-expressed in many human cancers, including breast. Met, Src and Stat3 have all been proposed as potential therapeutic targets for basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer defined by expression of Cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition, Src and Stat3 have been shown to act co-operatively to promote the transcription of HGF, while Stat3 can also increase the expression of Met mRNA. The goal of this study was to determine if Src and Stat3 affect the activity and expression of Met in human breast cancer. The study has also assessed the functional effect of Src, Stat3 and Met blockade on cultured breast cancer cells and a breast tumour xenograft model. Finally, a preliminary assessment was performed of Src, Stat3 and Met as biomarkers for distinct clinico-pathological parameters in a breast cancer cohort, and of the prognostic value of these markers in an online, publically available, breast cancer database. &#xD;
The results demonstrate a density- and Src-dependent increase in Met protein levels in cultured cells, through Stat3 (Src/Stat3-Met). Furthermore Src, Stat3 or Met blockade in tumour xenograft models were found to inhibit primary tumour growth. However treatment with Dasatinib (Src inhibitor) or Met knockdown had no effect on pulmonary metastasis, while Stat3 inhibition (CPA7) increased metastasis, indicating that Stat3 may have a protective function in metastatic breast cancer. Finally Src and the Stat3 target gene, Cyclin D1, were found to correlate with distinct clinico-pathological parameters in a human breast cancer cohort. &#xD;
My study has identified a Src/Stat3-regulated Met pathway in human invasive breast cancer. These findings further provide insight into the minimal effectiveness of Src and Met inhibitors as single agent therapeutics in breast cancer treatment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is exhibited by 20-40% of patients following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). POAF is associated with increased long-term morbidity and mortality, as well as additional healthcare costs. I aimed to find techniques for predicting which patients are likely to develop POAF, and therefore who may benefit from prophylaxis.&#xD;
Methods: Informed consent was obtained prospectively from patients attending for elective CABG. Patients were placed in the POAF group if atrial fibrillation (AF) was sustained for at least 30 seconds prior to discharge, and were placed in the ‘no AF’ (NOAF) group otherwise. I evaluated the performance of classifiers including binary logistic regression (BLR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, and a committee of classifiers in leave-one-out cross validation. Accuracy was calculated in terms of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and C-statistic.&#xD;
Results: Consent was obtained from 200 patients. I excluded 21 patients due to postoperative administration of amiodarone, 5 due to perioperative AF ablation, and 1 due to both. Exclusions were also made for 8 patients with a history of AF, 2 patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), and 3 patients with no CABG (valve replacement only). POAF was exhibited by 54 (34%) of patients. Factors significantly associated (P&lt;0.05) with POAF were longer postoperative hospital stay, advanced age, larger left atrial (LA) volume, presence of valvular disease, and lower white blood cell count (WCC). Using BLR for dimensionality reduction, I created a feature vector consisting of age, presence of congestive heart failure (CHF) (P=0.06), valvular disease, WCC, and aortic valve replacement (AVR). I performed leave-one-out cross validation. In unlabeled testing data, I obtained Se=70%, Sp=56%, PPV=89%, NPV=26%, and C=58% using a committee (BLR, k-NN, and ANN).&#xD;
Conclusion: My results suggest that prediction of patients likely to develop POAF is possible using established machine learning techniques, thus allowing targeting of appropriate contemporary preventative techniques in a population at risk for POAF. Studies appear warranted to discover new predictive indices that may be added to this algorithm during continued enrolment and validation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Mackenzie Mountains of NW Canada contains a superb record of biotic evolution through the late Ediacaran-early Cambrian that is ideal for studying the biological, ecological, behavioural, and environmental innovations that occurred during the Ediacaran and basal Cambrian. Newly discovered Ediacara-type megafossils in the uppermost Blueflower Formation at Sekwi Brook include tubes possibly attributable to suspension-feeding annelids, the preserved top of a large frond holdfast, and several problematica. These fossils represent the youngest and shallowest Ediacaran fossils known from NW Canada, and differ significantly from the communities of deep-water rangeomorphs preserved lower in the succession. &#xD;
&#xD;
Behavioural evolution of the infauna through the Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian can be observed in the rich trace fossil records of the Blueflower and Ingta formations. Trace fossils in the lower part of the Blueflower Formation are characterized by millimeter-diameter, simple, horizontal burrows of microbial grazers and deposit feeders that demonstrated very primitive and inconsistent two-dimensional avoidance strategies. Upper Blueflower trace fossils additionally include three-dimensional avoidance burrows and oblique burrows of filter-feeders or predators, reflecting new behavioural innovations and increased three-dimensional use of the substrate. The Cambrian strata of the Ingta Formation further include probing, U-shaped, and radiating burrows, irregular networks, and arthropod trails. These new feeding strategies were accompanied by increasingly more systematic grazing burrows. The development of more diverse feeding styles upwards through the succession both caused and reflected the spatial and temporal disappearance of Proterozoic matgrounds and their replacement by Phanerozoic mixgrounds. Avoidance strategies among grazing burrows became more consistent and complicated upward throughout this succession, increasingly resembling the guided meanders of Phanerozoic trace fossils. This implies that, while the first avoidance burrows probably reflected the responses of individual burrowers to individual stimuli, genetically-coded programmed behaviour developed and became dominant in the earliest Cambrian. These observations imply that increases in sensory and neural capacity accompanied skeletonization as a major factor in the Cambrian explosion of animal life.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Networks, such as the Internet, are comprised of dense information flows with expansive, multi-directional reach that continuously change—and this changeability is what keeps the network active, relative, and vital. I call the form of network exhibiting those dynamic features the vital network. This form of network is not simply the outcome of connectivity and communication between affiliative objects and actors such as cell phones and humans that together convey a sense or feeling of ‘aliveness,’ it is the outcome of software programming goals for communication systems inspired by nonhuman, self-organizing biological life. The biological turn in computation produces an organizing logic for the vital network that self-propagates connections and disconnections, services, collectives, and structures proximal to forms that feel vital and dynamic. The vital network can do things, it has capacities to act, and different material consequences emerge out of the organization and coordination of communication with particular implications for human privacy, autonomy, and network transparency. &#xD;
I examine the biological turn in computing as a feature within a development program for the design of digital network control systems that rely on self-regulation and autonomous communication processes intentionally constructed to be non-transparent. I explore nonhuman models of control as a response to this requirement considered through three objects: microbe, simulation, and control, each understood in process terms that disclose what these things do and how they act. It is appropriate to the concerns of this dissertation to think of these as object-processes occurring within three moments or transverse becomings: first, in terms of Gilles Deleuze’s notion of differentiation from the one to the many; secondly, from organism to simulation through the use of models to describe microbial processes in informatic terms; and finally, from description to control through the progression in computing from an emphasis on structure and descriptive procedures, to processes of control.&#xD;
Given that so much of contemporary life is structured by communication technology, my study points to the need for an ethics of control to imagine how much and how deep control should go when considering the organization appropriate to our shared, technically enabled, sphere of communication.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Loss of the ssp1 protein kinase (CAMKK) gene results in stress sensitivity, cell elongation, slow growth and in some cases cell cycle arrest.  In order to identify new components of the ssp1 stress response pathway, a transposon mediated suppressor screen was used to identify loss of function suppressors of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe ssp1 gene disruption. The Musca domestica Hermes transposon was used to randomly insert the KanMx6 selectable marker in the genome.  The selection was for Hermes insertions which rescued the G2 cell cycle arrest phenotype of ssp1- when grown at pH 3.5 and 36 C.  Second site mutations that rescued the cell cycle arrest and allowed for colony formation were identified.   In total 121 mutant strains with elongated morphology but capable of colony formation at pH 3.5 and 36 C were isolated and 22 insertion sites were identified by inverse PCR and sequencing. Genes for a transcriptional suppressor, scr1 (SPBC1D7.02c ),  a spermidine transporter (SPCC569.05c ), cyp9 cyclophilin 9 (SPCC553.04), complexed with cdc5 (cwf4)  (SPBC31F10.11c),  ptr8 (SPAC17A5.06), (SPBC1921.07c), and set7 (SPCC297.04c) were identified as second site loss of function suppressors of the ssp1 deletion.  Identifying these genes and their phenotype in conjunction with loss of ssp1, substantially improves our understanding of the Ssp1 molecular pathway in cell cycle control and cell stress response</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Asphalt-rubber mixtures have been shown to have useful properties with respect to distresses observed in asphalt concrete pavements. The most notable change in properties is a large increase in viscosity and improved low-temperature cracking resistance. Warm mix additives can lower production and compaction temperatures. Lower temperatures reduce harmful emissions and lower energy consumption, and thus provide environmental benefits and cut costs.&#xD;
	In this study, the effects of crumb rubber modification on various asphalts such as California Valley, Boscan, Alaska North Slope, Laguna and Cold Lake were also studied. The materials used for warm mix modification were obtained from various commercial sources. The RAF binder was produced by Imperial Oil in their Nanticoke, Ontario, refinery on Lake Erie. A second commercial PG 52-34 (hereafter denoted as NER) was obtained/sampled during the construction of a northern Ontario MTO contract.&#xD;
	Some regular tests such as Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR), Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) and some modified new protocols such as the extended BBR test (LS-308) and the Double-Edge Notched Tension (DENT) test (LS-299) are used to study, the effect of warm mix and a host of other additives on rheological, aging and failure properties. 	 &#xD;
	A comparison in the properties of RAF and NER asphalts has also been made as RAF is good quality asphalt and NER is bad quality asphalt.&#xD;
 From the studies the effect of additives on chemical and physical hardening tendencies was found to be significant. The asphalt samples tested in this study showed a range of tendencies for chemical and physical hardening.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation argues that we ought to promote the integration of groups as groups. Group integration is characterised by the process through which a group develops its own institutions and becomes a participatory member of its host society. This dissertation is neither a refutation of previous literature on individual integration, nor is it a rejection of the idea that immigrant groups are owed different rights than are national minorities and aboriginal groups. Instead, the goal is to fortify our understanding of what treatment is owed to immigrant groups. This dissertation argues that it is normatively desirable to promote group integration both for instrumental benefits in terms of expediting individual integration, and due to reasons of justice and democratic equality between groups. &#xD;
	Chapters Two, Three, and Four are predominantly theoretical. They involve a discussion of the importance of group rights and group deliberation, why group integration is normatively desirable, and a response to theoretical critiques of my proposal that group integration ought to be promoted. Chapters Five and Six are based on an application of the theory developed in the preceding chapters, and explore cases where we can see evidence of group integration. It is argued that group integration can justify differentiated rights for immigrant groups that may have integrated, as individuals and groups, under different historical circumstances. The Sixth chapter explores some implications that group integration may have for a group that is not easily characterised by the traditional liberal multiculturalist categories of aboriginal, immigrant group, and national minority. Finally, in Chapter Seven I provide an overview of the three main rubrics of argumentation used in this dissertation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Semantic Web is an endeavour to enhance the web with the ability to represent knowledge. The knowledge is expressed through what are called ontologies. In order to make ontologies useful, it is important to be able to match the knowledge represented in different ontologies. This task is commonly known as ontology alignment. Ontology alignment has been studied, but it remains an open problem with an annual competition dedicated to measure alignment tools' performance. Many alignment tools are computationally heavy, require training, or are useful in a specific field of study. We propose an ontology alignment method, NeCO, that builds on clone detection techniques to align ontologies. NeCO inherits the clone detection features, and it is light-weight, does not require training, and is useful for any ontology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The most widely accepted approach to long-term storage of nuclear waste is to design and construct a deep geological repository, where the geological environment acts as a natural barrier to radio nuclide migration. Sedimentary rocks, particularly argillaceous formations, are being investigated by many countries because of favorable isolating qualities (laterally continuous and low permeability) and the ability of self-sealing of fractures. Underground construction creates a damage zone around the excavation. The depth away from the excavation surface of the damage zone depends on the rock mass properties, the stress field, and the construction method. This research investigates the fracture development process in sedimentary rocks and evaluates continuum modelling methods to predict the damage zone dimensions. &#xD;
At the laboratory scale, a complete classification system for samples of carbonate and siliciclastic rocks has been developed, with geotechnical considerations, which when applied narrows the variability of the mechanical properties. Using this system, crack initiation (CI) shows the most uniform range in each class, particularly for mud rocks. Tensile strength was found to be higher for the Brazilian method than Direct method of testing. Brazilian reduction to Direct values was found to be rock type dependent. Laboratory testing results are also influenced by the orientation of bedding. &#xD;
Bedding and other structures were also found to influence the excavation behaviour as observed at the Niagara Tunnel Project in a mudstone and in excavations in the Quintner limestone of Switzerland. The conceptual stages of damage development and the potential fracture networks in sedimentary rocks are used to summarize the understanding of excavation damage developed in this thesis.&#xD;
Using a continuum based modelling approach, a set of predictive damage depth curves were developed for the different excavation damage zones. This approach was found to be most sensitive to the tensile strength used as an input. Back analysis of the Niagara Tunnel Project and forward prediction of the excavation damage around a shaft in the Queenston Formation are used to illustrate the importance of this research. The prediction methods were also applied to cut-off design analysis. This research has enhanced the understanding of excavation damage development in sedimentary rocks and provided a methodology to predict the dimensions of the excavation damage zones using a continuum based approach.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It would be a great advantage in reconstructive surgery to have an off-the-shelf biomaterial to promote regeneration and volume augmentation following soft tissue damage. With this long-term objective, human adipose tissue (fat) is an abundant and accessible source of extracellular matrix (ECM) for bioscaffold fabrication. The main goal of the current research project was to optimize the established 5-day detergent-free decellularization protocol developed by the Flynn group, by shortening it to a maximum of 3 days, while achieving comparable results in terms of cell and lipid extraction with preservation of the ECM. The effectiveness of the optimized protocol was assessed by examination of the decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) and its characteristic biological properties, including in vitro bioactivity assays with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to measure adipogenic potential, as well as in vivo testing of scaffold biocompatibility. In the optimized approach, the addition of mechanical processing steps including repeated pressing and centrifugation were shown to enhance cell extraction. Fibrous ultrastructure was observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the original and optimized protocols. The preservation of collagen fibres was assessed with picro-sirius red staining and confirmed by high hydroxyproline content. Enhanced preservation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was determined for the optimized protocol. Residual DNA content was higher in the DAT scaffolds processed with the optimized protocol, including larger DNA fragments that were not typically observed in the samples treated with the original protocol, which incorporated additional enzymatic treatment stages with DNase, RNase and lipase. However, no residual nuclei were visualized through DAPI staining for both protocols. Enhanced removal of DNA was achieved with electron beam (e-beam) sterilization. E-beam sterilization caused some changes in the fine fibrous structure of the ECM, but did not negatively affect the adipo-conductive potential in vitro. In comparison to the original protocol, DAT produced via the optimized protocol exhibited similar adipo-conductive properties in vitro. The in vivo biocompatibility study over a 16 week period using an immunocompetent Wistar rat model showed promising results. DAT implants produced with the original and optimized protocols promoted adipogenesis and angiogenesis, gradually being remodelled to resemble mature adipose tissue.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Macromonomers bearing oligomerizable C=C functionality have been prepared by the nucleophilic displacement of allylic bromide functionality on brominated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) (BIIR). Whereas commercial grades of isobutylene-rich elastomers do not cure under the action of peroxides, these materials undergo simultaneous cross-linking and degradation when activated by radical initiators, with the competitive balance dictated by the reactivity of the oligomerizable group. Vinyl benzoate, vinyl imidazolium, and acrylate functionalities cure rapidly to high cross-link density whereas the maleimide graft is too reactive and unstable for any utility. Methacrylate and itaconate macromonomers cure to moderate extent while maleate esters and unactivated terminally unsaturated groups are unable to significantly counteract the degradation mechanism and do not afford any appreciable cross-link density to BIIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
The most reactive macromonomers display the potential for scorch, an effect that is efficiently mitigated with the introduction of (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) to quench free radical cure activity. Furthermore, an acrylated adduct, AOTEMPO, is able to recover more of the cross-link density that would otherwise be lost to irreversible free radical coupling. These nitroxyls display longer than expected induction times, likely due to the catalytic nature of TEMPO when alkoxyamine decomposition is significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
A suite of elastomeric ionomers bearing N-functional imidazolium bromide functionality have been prepared in order to investigate the N-alkylation dynamics with brominated poly(isobutylene-co-para-methylstyrene) (BIMS) as well as the subsequent peroxide cure activity of the reactive ionomer. A functional imidazole bearing a methacrylate group displayed moderate alkylation rate and good cure activity whereas a 4-vinylbenzyl analogue provides fast alkylation at the expense of storage stability. N-Allylimidazole is rapidly alkylated by BIMS in both solution and solvent free processes and the resulting ionomer displays unique cure dynamics. This phenomenon is investigated by model compound polymerization and is likely due to the unique free radical reactivity of allyl imidazolium moieties. The cross-linked ionomer displays many of the beneficial physical properties associated with a hybrid ionic/covalent network including good resistance to stress relaxation and thermal stability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores connections between the labour market experiences of skilled middle-class immigrants in Canada, and their civic engagement in both sending and receiving countries. My work expands scholarship by delving into the ways that the criteria of social distinction, such as gender, race, immigrant status, and class, and the internalized roles, values, and norms passed down over generations shape citizenship practice. I argue that there is a link between inclusion and the possibilities offered through civic engagement, in that the struggle for inclusion is also a struggle for the recognition of resources that are valued as markers of valued members of society.&#xD;
This research engaged with a theoretical orientation that required synthesizing various forms of social structures that shape societies. Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of practice offered an alternative perspective on the use of assets in order to retain or improve social positioning, and the use of networks and civic engagement as a form of capital that can also serve to influence one’s place in society. Semi-structured interviews and participant observation were used to gather information regarding the experiences of skilled Jamaican immigrants involved in ethnic-based organizations that support economic, social, and infrastructural development projects in Jamaica and organizations that focus on the socio-economic well-being of the black community in Canada.&#xD;
This research shows that the processes of migration and (re)settlement have implications for the ways ideologies and social relations shift across space. I found that historically-shaped values, ideals, and norms associated with the development of a middle-class identity informed the ways the participants responded to barriers in the labour market, and changes in socio-economic status. Responses to changed socio-economic positioning through civic engagement were found to be based on gendered relations, the recognition and experiences of racism, and political attitude towards Jamaica, and relied on familiar strategies of the uses of social and cultural capitals to retain and/or improve their middle-class positions. This process of negotiation revealed the complex ways that middle-class(ness) is produced and reproduced across territories, and the implications for civic participation not only in Canada, but also in support of Jamaican development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Discrete shapes can be described and analyzed using Lie groups, which&#xD;
are mathematical structures having both algebraic and geometrical&#xD;
properties.  These structures, borrowed from mathematical physics, are&#xD;
both algebraic groups and smooth manifolds.  A key property of a Lie&#xD;
group is that a curved space can be studied, using linear algebra, by&#xD;
local linearization with an exponential map. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Here, a discrete shape was a Euclidean-invariant computer&#xD;
representation of an object.  Highly variable shapes are known to&#xD;
exist in non-linear spaces where linear analysis tools, such as&#xD;
Pearson's decomposition of principal components, are inadequate.  The&#xD;
novel method proposed herein represented a shape as an ensemble of&#xD;
homogenous matrix transforms.  The Lie group of homogenous transforms&#xD;
has elements that both represented a local shape and&#xD;
acted as matrix operators on other local shapes.  For the&#xD;
manifold, a matrix transform was found to be equivalent to&#xD;
a vector transform in a linear space.  This combination of&#xD;
representation and linearization gave a simple implementation for&#xD;
solving a computationally expensive problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Two medical datasets were analyzed: 2D contours of femoral&#xD;
head-neck cross-sections and 3D surfaces of proximal femurs.  The&#xD;
Lie-group method outperformed the established principal-component&#xD;
analysis by capturing higher variability with fewer components.  Lie&#xD;
groups are promising tools for medical imaging and data analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My thesis maps a genealogy of patriarchal structures that underpin Algerian history, culture, and institutions between the war of independence and the 1991-2001 civil war. More specifically, I contextualize the ways in which patriarchal lineages and origin stories—and thus the symbolic and structural promises of the family—underpin political struggle. In mapping these symbolic lineages found at work in the promise of independence, and the ways in which they underpin political struggle, I demonstrate how the war of independence reified and redefined familial and patriarchal kinships within political and social structures. I suggest that historical and social conditionings found at work at these different historical moments have legitimated, to a certain extent, the domination over women and a normalization of violence against them. My thesis examines social and political discourses at four central moments in Algerian history. Firstly, in the constructions of the Algerian nation-state post independence in 1962; secondly, in the Islamic Renaissance of the 1980s and the creation of the Family Code; and in a third moment, I draw connections between the Family Code, violent political clashes of 1990s and the civil war that ensued. Finally, I analyze laws and discourses created after the civil war and the resistance movements that have continuously contested power and oppression throughout these different periods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of students with intellectual disability (ID) and their teachers throughout the implementation process of an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device. Two students and three teachers at an arts-based school for adults with developmental disabilities were trained by a speech and language pathologist on how to use the device. The students were selected by the teachers because they had limited ability to produce speech, and it was thought that they would benefit from using the device. The three teachers made up the school’s faculty, and the speech and language pathologist was selected based on her expertise working with people with developmental disabilities.&#xD;
	Self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985) framed the study, and, it guided the observations and discussion of this thesis. Student experiences were explained through the lens of this theory, but teacher experiences were more applicable to Guskey’s (1989) model of teacher change. This framework was used to interpret the experiences of the teachers.   &#xD;
	Data were collected through direct observations and teacher journals throughout the implementation process, and semi-structured interviews, post-implementation. A total of 10, one-hour observations per student were conducted between January 15, 2013 and March 11, 2013; with one additional observation of an unplanned follow-up session that lasted one-and-a-half hours on May 8, 2013. The researcher observed student communication and engagement before, during, and after the device was brought into the class. The implementation steps included: introduction and experimentation with the AAC device in-class; teacher-only training; in-class student coaching and modeling; and withdrawal of SLP support.&#xD;
	This study found that that there were practical and logistical challenges with AAC device implementation for both students and teachers. Limited time for in-class training, strategic planning, goal-setting, and financial resources, such as funds to hire supply teachers so that teachers could observe in-class training, were barriers to implementation. One student, more than the other, used the AAC device to communicate throughout the study. Recommendations emerging from the study included more purposeful advance planning, goal-setting, developing teacher pedagogical knowledge prior to implementation, and collectively-planned in-class training sessions for students and teachers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the interweaving of colonial and post-colonial British and Jamaican Laws and the interpretive legalities of sexuality, compulsory heterosexuality, and queerness. The research project begins by exploring the ways in which the gendered colonial law produces black sexualities as excessive and in need of discipline while also noticing how Caribbean peoples negotiate and subvert these legalities.  The work then turns to dancehall and its enmeshment with landscape (which reflects theatre-in-the round and African spiritual ceremonies), psycho scape (which retains African uses of marronage and pageantry as personhood), and musicscape (which deploys homophobia to demand heterosexuality), in order to tease out the complexities of Caribbean sexualities and queer practices.  I couple these legal narratives and geographies with interviews and ethnographic data and draw attention to the ways in which queer men inhabit the dancehall.  I argue that queer men participate in a dancehall culture—one that is perceived as heterosexual and homophobic—undetected because of the over-arching (cultural and aesthetic) queerness of the space coupled with the de facto heterosexuality afforded all who ‘brave’ dancehall’s homophobia. Queer dancehall participants report that inhabiting this space involves the tactical deployment of (often non-sexual) heterosexual signifiers as well as queering the dancehall aesthetic by moving from margin to centre. In so doing, I argue, queer dancehall queers transition from unvisible (never seen but always invoked) to invisible (blending into the queered space) while also moving across and through, as well as calling into question, North American gay culture, queer liberalism, and identity politics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In conventional power generation systems, large centralized plants operating on fossil fuel mainly generate the electric power. The generated electricity has to travel through the long transmission and distribution lines to be delivered to the end users. In addition to being costly, this structure yields poor reliability and low efficiency. On the other hand, serious concerns have been raised about the shortage of fossil fuels, global warming, and energy security. As a result, the power systems are moving toward more distributed structures based on renewable energy resources.&#xD;
During the last decade, the concept of small-scale energy resources distributed over the grid has gained a considerable interest. This concept is often called distributed generation (DG). DG systems are mainly using renewable energy sources as their prime movers. Renewable energy sources (including biomass, wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal) can provide clean, efficient, reliable and adequate energy supply while making modern energy services accessible and affordable.&#xD;
However, despite the substantial benefits of distributed generation, the application of an individual DG system can cause as many problems as it may solve. To avoid such problems and to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation, a system approach has been taken, in which generation and loads are considered as a subsystem called “micro-grid”.&#xD;
One important issue in the existing power network is the capability of renewable energy sources to increase the power quality of the micro-grid. One aspect of this feature is harmonic compensation using distributed resources. &#xD;
In this thesis an adoptive notch filter (ANF) is employed in the control system of a distributed generation (DG) system for harmonic compensation. It is shown that the performance of the system is highly improved using the adoptive notch filter.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ornamental traits in male birds have been the subject of much research effort, and sexual selection is recognized as the leading explanation for their evolution. The expression of ornamental traits in females has received little study until recent decades. Female colouration has been considered a non-adaptive, correlated response to selection on males. However, models predict that male mate choice, female competition, and the evolution of honest signals could help explain female ornamentation, especially where male investment in offspring and variation in female quality are high. I investigated this in the American robin (Turdus migratorius), a socially monogamous species with bi-parental care and variable female ornamentation. Female robins display conspicuous red breast plumage, bright yellow bills, and achromatic ornamentation. Female ornamentation is similar to males, but is subdued to varying degrees across individuals. &#xD;
Female colouration could function as a useful criterion in mate selection by males if it is correlated with aspects of female quality important to producing viable offspring. I assessed whether female ornamentation in robins might act as an honest signal by relating variation in female colour to measures of individual quality and reproductive investment. To assess ornamentation, I took colour measurements of the bill, crown and breast of male and female robins in the field using reflectance spectrometry. Female bill, breast and crown traits reliably predicted age, crown and bill colour traits were related to better body condition, and bill colour decreased seasonally as well as with ectoparasite load. I found evidence of assortative mating based on crown UV reflectance and bill colour. To assess reproductive investment, I measured egg size, yolk proportion, and deposition of yolk testosterone and carotenoids. Females with brighter (lighter) carotenoid-based bill colour laid larger eggs, and females with yellower bills laid eggs with higher yolk proportions and more total yolk carotenoids. Yolk testosterone level was associated with redder female breasts. These results support the hypothesis that female colour may be a reliable indicator of individual quality and capacity for reproductive investment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Given the high risk of cancer development associated with BRCA1 mutation carriers, it is important that they be identified early and accurately. Identification is impeded however, by the large number of variants of unknown significance (VUS) and the pleiotropic nature of BRCA1 function. Our lab has developed a novel functional assay that identifies BRCA1 mutation carriers based on gene signatures in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs). Given that this assay was developed using blood-derived cells, we hypothesized that the same abnormally regulated genes would be detected in fresh blood samples and that this could be used to develop a novel blood-based functional assay for the determination of BRCA1 status in a patient population. The first part of the study used selected reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) as well as flow cytometry (FC) to determine protein expression in LCLs and identify potential targets for the development of a protein-based functional assay. Interestingly, many of the strong predictors of BRCA1 carriers were proteins involved in two signalling pathways: Interferon (IFN)-regulated signalling and B cell development. If validated in fresh blood samples, these observations represent potentially novel findings and suggest yet unexplored functions for BRCA1. Next, this study established the methodology to identify the desired cell population within a heterogeneous whole-blood sample by determining that LCLs express the pan B cell surface marker CD20. To determine which targets were detectable in CD20+ B cells isolated from fresh blood samples, mRNA and protein expression of the selected targets was examined using a sample cohort of BRCA1 mutation carrier and non-carrier control patients. The results showed that four mRNA targets, CXCR3, GLDC, IFIT1 and TBX21 were detectable in these fresh blood samples identifying them as appropriate targets for further development of a qRT-PCR-based assay. However, given poor RNA quality and changes in transcript expression levels as the age of the blood samples increased, the development of a protein-based assay is the best approach moving forward. Moreover, four proteins, IGHM, IGHD, CD24 and CXCR3, had high expression on CD20+ B cells, identifying them as the best targets for further development of a FC-based functional assay.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this research, I provide a foundation for theorizing and understanding institutionalized antiracism initiatives; under-examined sites of geographical research. Through an examination of three different research sites (Queen’s University, the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), I seek to understand how organizations working in different contexts negotiate a range of variables so as to achieve the most effective outcomes possible. With a focus on site-specific context and its role in antiracist initiatives, this research combines a range of qualitative methods including interviews and researcher observations to assess the factors that influence the strategic directions and decisions of organizations. This thesis contributes to the exploration of social change and human rights strategies by positioning institutionalized antiracism initiatives as the focus of study; highlighting the importance of geopolitical context and other institutional factors in this work; identifying key challenges and opportunities; presenting findings on effective human rights strategies; and filling a gap in this area of geographic study. More specifically, this research demonstrates that institutionalized antiracism initiatives experience specific advantages and challenges as a result of factors internal and external to the organization. It also provides insight into the climate of social change in Canada and reveals some important findings with regard to antiracism strategies that can be used by organizations to improve the effectiveness of their initiatives and programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ease with which our brains learn to control our bodies belies intricate neural processing which remains poorly understood. We know that a network of brain regions work together in a carefully coordinated fashion to allow us to move from one place to another. In mammals, we know that the motor cortex plays a central role in this process, but precisely how its activity contributes to control is a matter of long and continued debate. In this thesis we demonstrate the need for developing mechanistic neural network models to address this question. Using such models, we show that contentious response properties of non-human primate primary motor cortex (M1) neurons can be understood as reflecting control processes which take into account the physics of the body. And we develop new computational techniques for teaching neural network models how to execute control. In the first study (Chapter 2), we critically examined a recently developed correlation-based descriptive model for characterizing the activity of M1 neuron activity. In the second study (Chapter 3), we developed neural network control laws which performed reaching and postural tasks using a physics model of the upper limb. We show that the population of artificial neurons in these networks exhibit preferences for certain directions of movement and certain forces applied during posture. These patterns parallel empirical observations in M1, and the model shows that the patterns reflect particular features of the biomechanics of the arm. The final study (Chapter 4) develops new techniques for building network models. To understand how the brain solves difficult control tasks we need to be able to construct mechanistic models which can do the same. And, we need to be able to construct controllers that compute via simple neuron-like units. In this study, we combine tools for automatic computation of derivatives with recently developed ideas about second-order approaches to optimization to build better neural network control laws. Taken together, this thesis helps develop arguments for, and the tools to build mechanistic neural network models to understand how motor cortex contributes to control of the body.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ordering of knowledge is generally understood as the process through which ideas are anchored to structure. If the nature of the structure is understood, the ideas that it contains are navigable and retrievable, particularly in their relation to one another. To maneuver through our epistemological history, we turn to the map, dictionary, museum, and so on—sanctioned spaces that purposefully bring together the variables of what we know. Currently, studies regarding encyclopaedism in fiction have been devoted almost entirely to its use in satire, as the pretence to totalized knowledge is rife with satirical possibilities.  My dissertation proposes that encyclopaedism is more than merely girth or epic ambition; it is also an expression of the desire to understand and communicate the experience of the world through ordering systems.  &#xD;
My second chapter provides a theoretical discussion of collecting and its relation to encyclopaedism with an interdisciplinary methodology drawn from psychoanalytic and phenomenological theories.  I propose that collecting (like writing) is less a working-through of a psychoanalytic problem than an engagement with a phenomenological problem, and psychoanalytic theory describes only part of a process that is fundamentally about our relationship to the world of objects and ideas.  My third chapter charts the arc of the encyclopaedic paradigm, considering its philosophic and literary consequences beginning with seventeenth century encyclopaedic projects.  These early encyclopaedias (also known as Dictionaries) served as a catalyst for the aestheticization of classificatory representational systems which in their practical form were thought to represent both transparently and pragmatically and to signify a totality of knowledge. My fourth chapter looks at specific examples of encyclopaedism in fiction, with an emphasis on the generative possibilities of the encyclopaedic work.   &#xD;
My dissertation provides an updated exploration of the encyclopaedic paradigm, showing how and why in recent years it has be manipulated to account for the unaccountable through the mapping of impossible worlds or the ordering of an only partially knowable totality, relevant to an age seduced by the possibility of ordering the mind, the infinite and the unknowable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes significant disabilities. Students diagnosed with this syndrome generally present in the classroom with a lack of oral language, significant developmental delay, a uniquely cheerful personality, and challenges with motor control and motor coordination. This project reviews the literature on Angelman syndrome in order to explain the learning characteristics we would expect to see in these students in the areas of communication, cognition, physical abilities, sensory abilities, affect, attention, and unique medical needs. These learning characteristics are summarized along&#xD;
with a review of instructional approaches that may be appropriate to assist educators to meet the needs of these students. Next, the literature review is summarized in fact sheets collected in an informational booklet for educators. The fact sheets suggest specific instructional strategies to assist educators to meet the needs of students with Angelman syndrome. Finally, the project concludes with a description of how families and educators can re-imagine the needs of students with Angelman syndrome to maximize opportunities for these students to participate in regular classrooms and to access instruction in the general education curriculum.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  The “gold standard” in chronic pain treatment is multidisciplinary care.  With long wait times to receive appropriate care, there is a need for improved access to non-pharmacological treatments in the time gap between primary and specialist care.  The Internet is emerging as a tool for delivery of healthcare information and intervention.  Using this format to offer access to chronic pain therapies prior to specialist intervention may improve outcomes.&#xD;
Objective:  To develop and test a guided Internet-based intervention for individuals with chronic pain waiting for specialty care.&#xD;
Method:  A novel, Internet-based chronic pain intervention (ICPI) was developed, using evidence-based concepts proven effective in face-to-face interventions.  This study was designed to assess feasibility of conducting larger-scale research and usability of the ICPI, and to collect preliminary data on effectiveness of the intervention.  Data were collected at baseline, after each of the six intervention modules and 12 weeks after completion of the intervention.  &#xD;
Results:  Participants with chronic pain (n=41) reported satisfaction with the structure of the intervention, and ease of use at and away from their computers.  Use of the Internet as a recruitment strategy aided in accrual of participants, making further large-scale study of the ICPI feasible.  Preliminary data showed that the ICPI was effective in improving emotional function, had no demonstrable effect on physical function and produced a small but significant decrease in average and current pain intensity and pain interference.  Most participants felt they benefited at least minimally overall as a result of using the ICPI.&#xD;
Conclusion:  The newly-developed ICPI was well-received by participants and demonstrated some positive outcomes in this preliminary study.  Further research with more participants is feasible and necessary, to fully assess the effect of this intervention.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interactions between multiple anthropogenic stressors can have unexpected synergistic or antagonistic effects, making it difficult to predict their combined effect using single stressor studies. The interaction between invasive consumers and nutrient enrichment is particularly important as both of these stressors frequently co-occur and their respective bottom-up and top-down effects have the potential to interact across multiple trophic levels. We conducted a mesocosm experiment that crossed an increasing nutrient addition gradient against an increasing zebra mussel invasion gradient. Native zooplankton communities were added to the mesocosms, and after three months we examined how the single stressor effects on available resources and the zooplankton community were altered by their multiple stressor interaction. Added nutrients had no effect on primary producer abundance, but increased the abundance and dominance of the top consumer, which likely increased predation pressure on the producers and so prevented their response to increased nutrients. Zebra mussels reduced total phytoplankton abundance by ~75%, rotifer abundance by ~80%, and shifted communities towards dominance of cladocerans and adult/juvenile copepods. When combined, the top-down control exerted by the mussels interacted antagonistically to prevent any bottom-up influence of nutrient enrichment on the zooplankton community. These results provide insight into the potential outcomes of nutrient and invasive consumer stressor interactions, and illustrate the need for researchers to consider single stressor problems in a multiple stressor context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Living in harmony with nature is a pervasive ideology, or cultural blueprint, of how a "sustainable future,” a "good society,” and a "fulfilled life" would look like. However, this notion of harmony with nature is highly paradoxical, as consumers often want and even must dominate and control nature. The current thesis explores consumers’ desires of living in harmony with nature through a post-human analysis of how backcountry hikers negotiate tensions between utilitarian and romantic discourses of nature vis-à-vis their experience of material forces of nature. Through conceptualizing nature as an active actor in a symmetric assemblage of material and cultural entities (i.e., nature agency), this thesis contributes to our understanding of the human/nature relationship, materialism, and sustainable consumption.&#xD;
Findings are presenting through three interrelated themes. The first theme highlights how hikers appropriate romantic discourses by seeking harmony in a nature that is perceived as external to civilization. Noting the contradiction that hikers’ quest for being in harmony with a “romantic nature” oftentimes exposes them to higher physical dangers in material nature, the subsequent themes explore how harmony can arise when hikers have to struggle with physical dangers of nature. Focusing on physical dangers that are experienced in material nature, theme 2 finds that hikers’ relationship with nature is highly ambivalent: They strive to experience “more nature and less civilization”, but also “more civilization and less nature.” The third theme explores how meanings of nature and technology emerge from fluidly shifting assemblages, finding that the same technological resources can both distract from and enable feelings of harmony with nature.&#xD;
These findings contribute to consumer research by broadening our understanding of the human/nature relationship and by challenging previous notions (Canniford and Shankar 2013) that technology and civilization must always betray consumers’ experiences of “romantic nature.” Furthermore, the notions of nature agency and that no single actor can unilaterally shape the assemblage of heterogeneous entities contribute to the emerging material turn in consumer research. Finally, this post-human analysis of consumers’ relationships with nature offers theoretical and practical implications for sustainable consumption and sustainable marketing.</dcterms:abstract>
