      <dcterms:abstract>The actions of a variety of actors in the institutional or organizational field shape the rules of the game as well as the tactics, actions and forms of organization that are considered possible and legitimate. Yet despite a burgeoning literature on fields, the understanding of the role of endogenous field agents and their potential to change or maintain field structures remains relatively limited. In this dissertation I examine an increasingly contested field, U.S. municipal water services, through in-depth qualitative case studies and interviews in Detroit and Chicago. I seek to offer insight into the role of these agentic actors in field transition in three related studies. First, I address the role of individual or micro-level actors and their interactions with macro-level actors as transnational institutional changes are introduced to the field. I argue that heretofore unacknowledged and informal field configuring events offer important opportunities for change. Next, I explore the work of actors in fighting to maintain existing institutional structures, namely public water services, in the face of change. I identify novel variations in the types of actors who perform this work and the forms of institutional renewal work they perform. Lastly, I examine the often-overlooked role of central corporate actors in field change and offer a theoretical argument for taking these actors more seriously in our conceptualizations of field change and maintenance.  Specifically, I seek to offer insight to the role of central field actors and what conditions may induce core and embedded actors to act to change the field, contrary to the predictions of much extant field theory. In addition to theoretical contributions these studies offer practical guidance to managers, policymakers, and members of the public as they seek to understand and better manage the complex and multifaceted emerging water crisis, and the conflicts and challenges that surround it.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This phenomenological inquiry of wise acts and wise practices presents a perspective of wisdom as a social phenomenon. Wisdom is shown to emerge out of unique human interactions in particular contexts between wise-act-catalysts and receptive witnesses. This is a shift from the traditional perspective of wisdom as a person-centered internal manifestation. Rather, this study recognizes wisdom as externally manifested; co-created between individuals.	&#xD;
An adapted six-step approach is employed for this research inquiry that pushes the boundaries of a typical phenomenological study. Data were collected through themed group discussion sessions. Eight Canadian wise individuals aged 62-93 years of age, nominated for their history of wise action, participated in six group discussion sessions that lasted 2-2.5 hours each session. These same participants were individually interviewed twice, pre- and post- the group discussion sessions, for approximately 90 minutes each interview. In total, each participant devoted approximately 20 hours of his or her time to this research process. The collected data include the in-depth and transcribed audio files from the interviews and themed group discussion sessions but also writing pieces and drawing exercises submitted by the wise nominees. As a result, the collected data are extensive allowing for a deep understanding of the participants’ lived experiences and perspectives regarding their wise acts, wise practices, and how these relate to wisdom. &#xD;
Patterns of “Self” and “Self-in-Relation-to-Other” emerged through the data analysis. Each pattern encompasses multiple themes that evolved from the recounted words of the participants. The voice of each participant is distinctly identifiable throughout the study and each participant’s voice powerfully contributes to the study’s view of wisdom’s social nature. &#xD;
The study closes with recommendations for future research, implications for practical ways these findings can be integrated into one’s everyday life, and poignant words from the study’s wise nominees.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
Due to enhanced human and climatically-driven environmental changes, numerous water bodies including the Great Lakes area have seen increased harmful algal blooms (HABs) (including those caused by blue-green algae) in the past few decades. HABs affect the ecological integrity of the affected water by disrupting or altering the biological communities, bringing more challenges to water-quality monitoring and sustainable water management. Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) monitoring for detection of possible microbial and pathogen contamination is a significant water-management practice, with implications for water resource sustainability.&#xD;
Work in this thesis focuses on HAB impact on faecal indicator bacteria survival and thus the use of FIB for indicating microbial contamination. To serve this purpose, microcosms that contain the representative algae and indicator bacteria were established to explore the algae-bacteria dynamics at laboratory scale. Two species of Microcystis (M. smithii and M. aeruginosa) and four lab strains of E. coli (ATCC 25922, 8739, 51813, and 11775) were used. The sample water was collected regularly for Microcystis and E. coli screening. Microcystis was shown to dramatically reduce E. coli survival in the microcosms. Three possible factors contributing to the observed algae-E. coli dynamics, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability, water pH, and microcystin production by Microcystis, were examined; microcystin production was the only factor found to be able to linked to E. coli death. Lastly, lake strains of E. coli and Total coliforms sampled from Lake Ontario were included and showed the same general behavior.&#xD;
The results show that use of FIB (E. coli and Total coliforms) as indicators of faecal contamination in water with Microcystis spp. (and possibly other blue-green algae) present could be greatly compromised, especially if algal toxin is produced. On the other hand, FIB survival dynamics, if interpreted properly, might be used to detect the onset of toxin-producing harmful algal blooms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, there has been greater recognition of the importance of examining and improving the mental health of Canadian youth, in that approximately 50% of mental health problems surface during adolescence (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2013). One of the most debilitating mental health issues facing young people is anxiety (Canadian Mental Health Association, 2014; Rockhill et al., 2010). The ability of anxiety to impair the daily functioning of students at school is becoming an increasing concern for Canadian teachers (Canadian Teachers’ Federation, 2012). The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of six young women between 18 and 22 years of age who self-reported having anxiety during secondary school. Semi-structured interviews were used to assist in further understanding these women’s experiences. An inductive approach was employed to analyze the data.&#xD;
Data analysis revealed four primary themes: (1) experience of anxiety, (2) triggers of anxiety, (3) effects of anxiety, and (4) coping with anxiety. All participants’ experience of anxiety included physiological and cognitive symptoms. For some of these young women, a lack of awareness of their anxiety and stigma were additionally encountered. Participants identified academic, teacher, social, family, and future triggers that caused them to feel anxious at school, as well as academic, social, and emotional effects of anxiety. The young women used talk strategies, academic coping strategies, personal coping strategies, pharmacotherapy, and avoidance to manage anxiety. Two secondary themes additionally emerged across these primary themes: (1) fear of the future and (2) perfectionism. Further to these young women’s experiences was a fear of uncertainty in things to come, as well as a need to control outcomes through perfectionism and high academic standards. Finally, while no participant approached their teachers for assistance in coping, these young women suggested teachers could help anxious students by using specific teaching strategies, by being approachable, and by talking about mental health at school. While there were many similarities across participants’ experiences, the phenomenon of having anxiety during secondary school is complex – unique to each individual, personal circumstances, and life events.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite the growing dependence we have developed upon an array of computer-based technologies, technology in and of itself is not the cause of alienated conditions of labour. Rather, it is the cultural context within which it is used that allows different forms of alienated labour to form.  This thesis explores this argument by utilizing E. Gabriella Coleman’s ethnography of the contributors to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). This group’s activities challenge aspects of a capitalist political economy, particularly in regards to Karl Marx’s notion of alienated labour. FOSS contributors engage in a practice that integrates aspects of play and work, while embodying a continual creative process that remains within their individual control. To explore this further, this project examines a variety of classical and FOSS-related material and offers a description of Marx’s theories and analyses of the labour process, an introduction and overview of hackers and FOSS, and an evaluation of FOSS’s ability to resist domination. Reviewing these themes reinforces the dynamic and unstable elements of capitalism, promoting the centrality of human beings in producing social change. It becomes apparent that while FOSS is often coopted by a vast range of capitalist interests, the practice of FOSS contributors create an environment that prevents aspects of alienation from taking hold, allowing individuals to realize the potential and capabilities of their labour power. Their activities bear a striking resemblance to C. Wright Mills’ craft labour ideal, while emphasizing Bourdieu’s notion of skholè in the building of one’s skills and abilities. Their promotion of the open access ethos reinforces the need to draw attention to the degrees of access to tools and information necessary for this growth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Undergraduate students at Queen’s University were surveyed and interviewed to examine the factors behind engineering program selection and academic transfer to engineering. The surveys were completed by 416 2nd-4th year undergraduate engineering students examining: reasons for entering engineering, demographics, personal knowledge of engineers, and their understanding of engineering programs and the engineering profession. The survey was also used to recruit students who had undergone an academic transfer for interview. Seven interviews were completed with these students, examining the reasons for their transfer, as well as the factors behind their initial program selection. &#xD;
Four primary factors were identified as important to the selection of engineering programs: interest in the subject matter, strength in prerequisites, knowing an engineer, and vocational factors. It was found that knowing an engineer correlated with greater reported knowledge of the engineering profession, but not with a greater knowledge of engineering programs. &#xD;
Small correlations were found between two survey variables and satisfaction: likelihood to continue on to an engineering profession and personal interest in subject matter. This presents ‘personal interest’ as a particularly valuable criterion for program selection.&#xD;
Reasons that students transferred into engineering were split between a similarity of values with the program and practical reasons. Social/cultural values were discussed, suggesting that students valued engineering traditions and that engineering students were more social than expected. Students further identified academic values that they shared with the engineering program: co-operation and group work, practicality and problem solving. Understandings of these values were generally gained after they had entered Queen’s, through peers already in the engineering program. Transfer students also addressed practical considerations: degree versatility, directness to workplace, personal change/growth, the engineering job market, and support from others.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Educational technology, although valued, is often underused within today’s classrooms. The following Master’s Project outlines the development, and pilot testing of a web-based resource for Mathematics educators who are looking to incorporate more technology into their assessment for and assessment as learning within the Number Sense and Numeration strand of the Ontario Mathematics curriculum. The main research question for this study was: What do educators think about a web-based resource designed to integrate technology and assessment for and as learning, in Grade 6 Mathematics classes? Through a document analysis and a group interview, a small sample of educators evaluated a web-based resource that embraces and amalgamates a note-taking application with assessment for and as learning. Key design features including flexible unit plans were developed using backwards design. Feedback was used to improve and refine the development of the resource. The project is discussed in terms of future development of the website.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lithographically fabricated point contacts serve as important examples of mesoscopic conductors, as electrodes for molecular electronics, and as ultra-sensitive transducers for mechanical motion. We have developed a reproducible technique for fabricating metallic point contacts through electromigration. We employ fast analog feedback in a four-wire configuration in combination with slower computer controlled feedback to avoid catastrophic instability even when there is significant series resistance. This hybrid system allows electromigration to proceed while dissipating approximately constant power in the wire. We are able to control the final resistance of the point contact precisely below 5 kOhm and to within a factor of three when the target resistance approaches 12 kOhm where only a single conducting channel remains. This system makes it possible to efficiently create point contacts through electromigration for fundamental studies of atomic-size conductors or applications such as displacement transducers.&#xD;
&#xD;
As an application of the hybrid feedback system for forming point contacts, we have developed a low-temperature, high-frequency noise measurement system. The system, which operates from 0.8 to 1.5 GHz at temperatures as low as 320 mK, takes advantage of impedance matching techniques to improve power transfer by up to 65%. This is accomplished by combining an inductor with unavoidable stray capacitance to form a resonant LC circuit. Noise measurement tests with a photodiode-LED pair at room temperature demonstrated the ability to resolve shot noise down to 5e-26 A^2/Hz. This corresponds to the shot noise of 155 nA through a single channel point contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
We designed and fabricated an aluminum superconducting planar inductor coupled to a gold point contact wire to test the noise measurement system at ultra-low temperatures. Finite element simulations suggested that the inductor may not be superconducting at the onset of electromigration but the study was not conclusive. Tests at 320 mK revealed that the inductor was not superconducting at the currents required for electromigration, preventing controlled electromigration and noise measurements. Future work should explore alternative inductor designs to allow for noise measurements in the 0.8-1.5 GHz range.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bacterial ice-nucleation proteins (INPs) initiate water freezing at high subzero temperatures. Despite having an opposite function to antifreeze proteins (AFPs), INPs and AFPs both have significant similarities in sequence and structure. Based on these common features, I hypothesize that INPs also organize water molecules on their surface into ice-like geometries, as suggested for AFPs. If this is true, an undefined structural characteristic must differentiate ice nucleation. While AFPs are generally small (&lt;40 kDa) monomeric proteins in vivo, INPs form large (&gt;1 MDa) aggregates on the outer-membrane surface. Therefore, I propose that the distinguishing feature of ice nucleation is a relatively large water-organizing template.&#xD;
To test this hypothesis, I set out to engineer an AFP from a small INP fragment. A 26.5-kDa recombinant protein was designed by joining two sections of the Pseudomonas syringae InaV INP, one encoding P141-A220 and the other encoding G1021-E1196. CD spectroscopy of this recombinant protein indicated it had β-rich secondary structure that was increased by detergent. The construct shaped ice into a hexagonal bipyramid at high concentrations, but evaluation of antifreeze activity was complicated by trace AFP impurities leaching from shared equipment. The truncated INP in a zwitterionic detergent did show small but significant potentiation of ice nucleation. Taken together, these results are inconclusive about the relationships between INPs and AFPs but point the way to more definitive studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In light of the overwhelming harm caused by General Motors and its failure to recall defective vehicles for nearly a decade, this thesis explores the GM ignition switch recall and the numerous errors and omissions that enabled it to occur. This thesis begins by introducing corporate criminological studies broadly, then, in the second chapter, moves to develop a history of automobile regulation specifically. Following that, in the third chapter, this thesis builds the case against GM, showcasing how at several junctures GM chose profits over safety, and how the state regulatory system permitted this to happen by allowing the corporation to define a critical safety defect as a “customer convenience problem.” Finally, in chapter four, this thesis examines the state’s response to GM’s malfeasance, situating this in its broader social context, and then moves to criticize compliance and punishment oriented regulation from Ruth Morris’s (2000) conception of transformative justice.  To effectively respond to corporate crime, this thesis argues that state responses should attempt to transform the criminogenic aspects of capitalism and the corporation, rather than punish or persuade.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Health organizations recommend that body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) be measured together to estimate a person’s obesity-related health risk. When BMI and WC are high, a person’s risk of death and disease increases. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a measure of a person’s ability to perform aerobic exercise. Despite the fact that CRF reduces health risk, even in people with high BMI or WC, measurement of CRF is not currently recommended alongside BMI and WC in healthcare settings. We sought to determine whether CRF will improve our ability to predict risk of death when both BMI and WC are already considered.&#xD;
We analyzed data from 31 267 adult male participants of the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS), a prospective study established in 1970 to examine associations between lifestyle factors and health risk. Baseline characteristics were recorded during medical examinations taking place at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas between 1974 and 2002. Participant follow-up continued until either death or December 31st, 2003. Participants were first categorized by BMI according to whether they were normal BMI, overweight, or obese. They were then grouped according to whether their WC was high or normal based on their BMI category. CRF was assessed by a treadmill exercise test performed to voluntary exhaustion. Participants with the lowest 20% times on treadmill were classified as unfit, while the remaining 80% were classified as fit.&#xD;
Our primary results are that, for most combinations of BMI and WC, unfit men were at significantly higher risk of mortality compared with fit men within the same BMI and WC group. Higher mortality risk due to low fitness was observed in males with normal BMI regardless of WC, in males who were overweight with normal WC, and in males who were obese with high WC.&#xD;
Our observations add support to the idea that CRF should be measured in healthcare settings along with BMI and WC to help identify and manage health risk associated with overweight and obesity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>How do we observe other people engaged in activities? Predictive gaze in action observation was first described in 2003 by Flanagan and Johansson who showed that in a block stacking task, observers, like actors, shifted their gaze to locations of upcoming contact events (objects to be grasped and object placement sites) around the same time that a hand movement was initiated. Later studies have shown that even when observers do not know what the actor is going to do next ahead of time, their gaze is still robustly drawn to contact events,  typically arriving there before the actor's hand based on extrapolation of the ongoing action. &#xD;
Here I introduce an organizational framework for gaze behavior in action observation in terms of distinct modes of predictive gaze – anticipation, extrapolation, and tracking – and contextual factors shaping observer gaze behavior. These factors include the scene configuration as well as the timing, kinematics, and goals of the actor's movements, but also crucially depend on observers, their knowledge and skills, their perspective on the scene, as well as their own interest and goals. In the three studies presented here we investigate the proposal that observers, like actors, seek to closely monitor object contact events, including object lift-off, in part to learn about and keep track of object properties in the service of guiding future actions. In chapter 2 I describe and quantify social motor learning of object weight. In chapter 3 I show that when observing a demonstrator lift two objects at the same time, participants preferentially shift their gaze towards objects which they expect to subsequently act on themselves. In chapter 4 I describe how knowing the circumstances of an action (object value and distance) translates into predictive gaze behavior in action observation, characterize distinct gaze strategies, and evaluate their visual consequences for the observer. In the final chapter I apply this framework to critically review the current literature – which tends to conflate modes of predictive gaze – revisit the relationship between observer gaze behavior and the mirror neuron system, and review studies into the developmental trajectory of predictive gaze in action observation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The biosynthesis of quantum dots has been explored as an alternative to traditional physicochemical methods; however, relatively few studies have determined optimal synthesis parameters.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequentially treated with sodium selenite and cadmium chloride synthesized CdSe quantum dots in the cytoplasm.  These nanoparticles displayed a prominent yellow fluorescence, with an emission maximum of approximately 540 nm.  Investigations into the optimisation of the biosynthetic method revealed that quantum dots were produced more efficiently when stationary phase cultures were treated directly with 1 mM sodium selenite for 6 hours, followed by incubation with 3 mM cadmium chloride in fresh growth medium.  Synthesis of quantum dots reached a maximum after approximately 84 hours of reaction time.  The influence of glutathione to the biosynthetic mechanism was explored through the use of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and buthionine sulfoximine to deplete intracellular glutathione content.  The synthesis of CdSe quantum dots was significantly inhibited in most cases by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and buthionine sulfoximine treatment, suggesting that glutathione plays an important role in the biosynthetic process, particularly following the addition of cadmium.  The possible mechanism for CdSe quantum dot formation is discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wealthy countries are increasingly experiencing shortages of a wide range of generic drugs. These shortages are creating substantial harms for patients and problems for health systems. Despite recurring shortages and industry investigations, the nature and character of the drug shortage crisis remain the same: shortage drugs provide slim or negative profit margins, generic drug companies are reluctant to invest in quality improvements, and manufacturers are finding more reason to exit shortage drug markets. This thesis catalogues and explores these and other causes of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
The proposals that have been made to address the problem at best merely mitigate it, and only target the systemic manufacturing and regulatory issues that immediately precede a shortage. The targeted issues are only symptoms, and not the root causes of drug shortages. In order to properly address the drug shortage crisis and minimize these symptoms, solutions must acknowledge the underlying economic mechanisms that make the crisis a reality. This thesis argues that, specifically, tackling drug shortages requires that one examine the economic pressures exerted on drug manufacturers by the Medicare Modernization Act’s Average-­Sales-­Price reimbursement system, and the practices and behaviours of group purchasing organizations. To understand these pressures and effects on manufacturers is to uncover some of the root economic causes of the drug shortage crisis that give rise to the manufacturing issues immediately preceding drug shortages.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 1968, Ontario’s Department of Education released a report entitled Living and Learning: The Report of the Provincial Committee on Aims and Objectives of Education in the Schools of Ontario, which quickly came to be called the “Hall-Dennis Report” or simply “Hall-Dennis” after the names of its chairmen, Emmett Hall and Lloyd Dennis. The Report urged Ontarians to accept a new vision of education, one in which students were no longer organized in classes, their progress no longer measured by grades, and their experience no longer characterized by the painful acquisition of subjects but rather by a joyous and open-ended process of learning. The Report marked a significant moment not only in the development of Ontario’s educational system but in Canadian cultural history. In its outline of a new, “democratic” system of education for Ontario, one that it associated with the highest ideals of progress, liberalism, and humanism, Hall-Dennis revealed not only the high ambitions of liberal utopianism in the 1960s, but also suggested the extent to which its proponents sought to tame the forces of radicalism and maintain the pre-existing socio-economic order, albeit under the daunting and increasingly fragmenting circumstances of high modernity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis, comprised of two studies, investigates the use of historical data to describe changes in fish communities over time. Identifying changes in fish community is important for the conservation of biodiversity. The first study focused on fishes in southeastern Ontario, a region identified as a biodiversity hotspot. The study found a major change in fish community as well as the major drivers of this change between 1969 and 2014. A strong shift from cyprinid-dominated to centrarchid-dominated communities was found and significant changes in water temperature and shoreline use were identified as contributing drivers. The second study explored issues associated with the use of historical fisheries data.  In this study, it was found that sampling effort influenced the interpretation of fish community changes over time. The second study also highlights major assumptions currently made when applying historical fisheries data and suggests steps to gain a better understanding of how to apply historical fisheries data in future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The population is aging rapidly in China as a result of the baby boom, the One-Child Policy and a declining mortality rate in the past decades.  The government has proposed “Aging at home” and “Societalization of elder care” as the basic strategies for the older population. Beijing is a typical case to study for emerging social programs and services as the capital city. In the human geography literature, experiences of aging and care at home and at the community level have been barely studied in a Chinese context. Methodologically, a “new division” is taking place between quantitative and qualitative researchers in health geography. (Rosenberg, 2015)  This dissertation seeks to contribute to the current literature by providing a non-Western lens and combining quantitative and qualitative methods in understanding old age, place and care.&#xD;
There are two broad research objectives in the dissertation: first, to understand the experiences of aging in place and older people’s negotiations with changing environments in old age; and second, to understand access to home and community-based services and the experience of care. The above research goals are achieved by using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Four hundreds and fifty-one valid questionnaires were collected for quantitative analysis. Forty-seven older people and 21 caregivers were interviewed for qualitative analysis. It is found that the current physical, built and social environments inform the meanings of place and challenge the identities older people that have been established throughout the life course. The representation of the socialist past among older people is circumscribed by their economic conditions and environmental situation. Home and community-based care is largely provided by informal caregivers while their roles are decreasing. Access to care is varied by individual socioeconomic characteristics and place. The public sector’s role in providing care is still small and conflicts are common between older care recipients and private sector providers. By adopting mixed methods, they complement each other to provide a more complete story and bring different foci to the fore in understanding the issues. The dissertation sheds light on the government’s planning and policy making in China.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Freshwater fishes are among the most imperiled organisms on Earth and understanding their life history is vital to conservation efforts. Grass Pickerel, a top predator, is a nationally imperiled fish that is found at the northern edge of its range, has a highly patchy distribution, and can be rare to abundant where found in Canada. The distribution of Grass Pickerel within a watershed was explained using generalized linear models and is largely driven by site-scale variables such as ample submerged aquatic vegetation, channel cover, and associated wetlands in the floodplain, but regional factors, presumably climate, appeared important as well. Additionally, Grass Pickerel has declined in an eastern Ontario population since 1960 and forage fishes have increased in richness and abundance. Changes in the fish community were evaluated using non-metric multidimensional scaling and are likely due to combined effects of land use changes and alterations to stream hydrology from beaver activity and variable climatic conditions. The results from this study are informative for habitat protection and mitigating threats to this species, but also make a case for improved, standardized monitoring and baseline data. Grass Pickerel populations in Ontario are at the periphery of the species’ range and are, perhaps, the most important for the species persistence in a changing world.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project attempts to answer the question whether Kantian matrimony succeeds conceptually as a context for moral sex, from the perspective of a feminist who values Kant’s emphasis on respect for persons. Kant is right in thinking that sex often does pose a threat to human dignity, and that it also has the potential to undermine all sorts of relationships, including friendships. As such, Kant may have correctly identified a dimension of insecurity within friendship which matrimony is conceptually protected against.  At the same time, Kant’s proposed solution (i.e. matrimony) may not be a sufficient solution either, and we have strong grounds to rethink Kant’s problematic assumptions about the nature of sexuality itself, specifically those about gender and sexual desire and desirability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the aftermath of World War II, Canada entered a period of tremendous transformation. The years between 1947 and 1955 were marked by changes to the political, economic, and social landscape of Canada. Reconstruction meant not only moving away from a wartime industrial base and from debt to surplus but a remaking of a national identity. Slowly emerging as an independent nation during the postwar period, Canada struggled to define its national identity. From a Dominion imperceptibly tied to the United Kingdom through citizenship, trade, politics and culture, the increasing independence meant redefining that relationship, its national identity and Canadianizing existing structures. &#xD;
Of these constructions, long-held notions about assimilation were in dispute. The increased ethnic diversity resulting from reformed immigration policies intensified the pressure to quickly assimilate new Canadians into what was seen as the new world order. Older ideologies such as Anglo-conformity vied with emerging assimilation concepts such as pluralism for dominance, both destabilized by the ongoing dualistic nature of the French and English-speaking populations. Immigrants entering Canada during these years were caught in this flux. The turbulence, however, created an environment conducive to negotiating citizenship on an individual level. As such, these assimilation theories significantly impacted Canadian immigration policies and integration strategies. &#xD;
Education played a significant role in assimilating immigrants into Ontario’s dominant culture. Schooling provided an opportunity to indoctrinate immigrants in both the state and process of citizenship, which were considered integral elements of assimilation. This thesis, in particular, examines the assimilation of Dutch immigrants in Ontario’s rural schools during the years 1947-1955. However, schools proved a contradictory space for assimilation–demanding unquestioned conformity and yet allowing opportunities to negotiate citizenship.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis defends the worldview and reasoning of Robert Fludd through a detailed examination of his illustrations.  I am continuing the work of Wolfgang Pauli, who wrote on Fludd’s polemic with Johannes Kepler.  Diving into this fascinating event in the history of science, my contribution is a more detailed analysis of the mathematical dimension, particularly of arithmetic and the concept of number.  I begin by giving the context of Fludd’s systematic philosophy.  Following this is Fludd’s macrocosmic thesis of how the divine presence manifests in the external world.  From this basis comes Fludd’s microcosmic thesis of how the divine presence manifests in the human being.  Both theses have the same formal structure, which I have identified as a theoretical logistic.  In contrast, Kepler pursued a practical logistic that led to formulation of his three astronomical laws.  Each kind of logistic uses formal structures for different purposes, either for predicting regular patterns in sensible objects or for expressing subjective opinions and beliefs.  The latter method has an ambiguous relationship with natural science since it relies on the idea acausal meaning.  In the conclusion, I discuss this concept as it was articulated by Carl Jung.  Combining this with Pauli’s historical thesis, I argue that the objectivity of scientific knowledge depends on both causal and acausal forms of meaning.  While the causal is a conscious form of rational ordering (of light), the acausal is decidedly non-rational, hidden and unconscious (of dark).  It is this darker side of the human being that the scientific worldview of the West has left unreconciled.  In Fludd’s system, there is the potential for what Pauli called a ‘correction of earlier one-sidedness’, which Jung compared to the Eastern concept of Tao.  I aim to demonstrate that unified meaning must include the acausal just as absolute systematicity must include the unsystematic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis intervenes into recent online media discourse on queer rap and its attendant queer liberal agenda by situating black queerness, hip hop, and homophobia within colonial and post-slavery contexts. The research project begins by exploring the ways in which websites that produce discourses on the “new wave” of “queer rap” participate in panoptical imaginaries that produce black sexualities as excessive and blackness as pathologically homophobic; this work therefore also examines the authenticating tactics used to confirm an artist and their music as “queer.” I argue that normalizing racial-sexual classifications, as well as the classificatory work of musical genre, are limiting and damaging logics that fail to fully take up a work of art and the individual artist’s personhood. I expand and complicate these narratives by turning to Le1f, an identified “queer rapper,” to focus upon the interaction between media coverage and the content that is represented in his music video “Wut.” I argue that when one examines this work closely, we find an articulation of Le1f’s sexuality that is closely bound up with his blackness and colonial histories of interracial violence, fantasy, and desire.  “Wut” and Le1f, together, resist the media’s impulse to forget race in discussions of queerness. I then turn to another artist touched by this discourse, Zebra Katz, and examine interviews alongside his music video “Ima Read.” I show how Katz provides a space to think through racial-sexual classifications as sites of injury and trauma while also drawing attention to black queer education as a project of ethical relationalities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the market valuation of earnings announced by U.S. firms initiating or reinitiating antidumping trade investigations against foreign exporters. Trade investigations are an interesting setting because firms petitioning the trade regulator for import relief face strong incentives to manage earnings to increase the likelihood and magnitude of import relief. In addition, the setting allows an examination of opportunities for investors to learn about earnings management because (1) investigation initiation dates and determinations are in the public domain and (2) some firms initiate investigations more than once. Import relief firms’ diverse investor base further enriches the research setting and allows for a study of investor learning by both more and less sophisticated investors. Using cross-sectional, time-series and size-matched samples and a valuation model that relates stock prices to accounting book values and earnings, I find an attenuated price-earnings relation for antidumping investigation-initiating firms only in the presence of an opportunity to learn and primarily when the firm has higher levels of following by sophisticated investors. That is, the price-earnings relation in the valuation model is attenuated only when firms with sophisticated shareholders initiate their second or subsequent antidumping investigation. This dissertation contributes to the accounting literature by shedding light on which market participants learn to identify firms’ incentives to engage in earnings management.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis reports on the use of auxiliary finger input to complement touch-only interactions on mobile devices. While a majority of touchscreen based mobile devices support multi-touch input, mobile device interactions in one-handed usage scenarios are usually limited to a single point of contact with the screen. In most cases, the thumb is the preferred source of touch input. Selecting user interface elements, such as buttons and sliders, requires frequent movement of the thumb, occludes a display, and, to reach targets, demands frequent adjustments of grip. &#xD;
&#xD;
To tackle these usability problems of single-handed usage scenarios, we explored the use of the auxiliary fingers — that is, the fingers that grip, support, and make contact with a mobile device — as additional input channels. Sensing input from the auxiliary fingers might lead to significantly less thumb movement, with target selection and other interactions distributed across all five digits.  We built a series of mobile device prototypes that sense isometric pressure at different areas on their surfaces. To evaluate the performance of this interaction paradigm, we measured task completion times and error rates for common mobile tasks, including document formatting, application switching, and map navigation, and validated that the use of additional fingers for input led to performance gains. We follow-up with a study to measure each finger’s ability to apply pressure on the side of the device and measured the effect of this pressure on the thumb's range of motion around the screen. Finally, we provide software and hardware design recommendations based on these studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is one of three components of the doctoral project Roots and Routes: Cuban Cinemas of the Diaspora in the 21st Century. The project also comprises an archive of materials on Cuban diasporic cinemas in the post-2000 era and a travelling showcase —animated by the archive— which took place in Canada in March-April, 2015. The written text is formed by six chapters and several attachments that present information on the films, filmmakers, program notes and other data relevant to the curated events. The thesis is motivated by two main research questions. 1) In what ways has the diaspora experience transformed Cuban filmmaking practices? 2) How have the aesthetic decisions and economic processes of film production in the diaspora placed young Cuban filmmakers vis-à-vis the hegemonic structures of the nation-state, both in the homeland and the host societies? In answering those questions, this study offers insights into the new forms of mobility, politics of place and gendered/racial identities that emerge in the cultural landscapes of contemporary Cuban diasporas. Since young diasporic filmmakers contest the previous notion of Cuban “national cinema,” the hypothesis states that audiovisual producers in the diaspora have indeed transformed the way in which Cuban film is conceived and understood today, on and off the Island.&#xD;
The project had three main goals: to gather and organize information on Cuban diasporic filmmaking; to promote this form of cinema among Canadian audiences through a travelling showcase; and to generate scholarship on this topic that had not been considered by systematic academic investigations to date. The research presents a model of autoethnographic curatorial work and considerations that may be of help to future students developing project-based thesis. One of the fundamental contributions of Roots and Routes… is how it transcended the borders of the academic context and succeeded in engaging local communities in different sites.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accurate and ubiquitous localization is the driving force for location based services in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs). In urban areas, Global Positioning System (GPS) and in-vehicle navigation sensors (e.g. odometers) suffer from prolonged outages and unsustainable error accumulation, respectively. The need for precise vehicle localization remains paramount, and cooperative vehicle localization based on ranging techniques are being exploited to this end. This research presents a novel Cooperative Localization (CL) scheme called CL KF-RISS that utilizes Round Trip Time (RTT) for inter-vehicle distance calculation, integrated with Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS) measurements to update the position of not only the vehicle to be localized, but its neighbors as well. We adopted the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), to limit the effect of errors in both the sensors and the neighbors' positions, in computing the new location. In comparison to the existing cooperative localization techniques, our proposed cooperative scheme does not depend on GPS updates for the neighbors’ positions thus making it far more suitable in urban canyons and tunnels. In addition, our scheme considers updating the neighbors' positions using their current inertial sensor measurements resulting in improved position estimation. The scheme is implemented and tested using the standard compliant network simulator 3 (ns-3), vehicle traces were generated using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and error models were introduced to the sensors, the initial and the updated positions. Different scenarios using different velocities and neighbors' densities were implemented. GPS updates with different percentages and error variances were introduced to test the robustness of the proposed scheme. Results show that our scheme outperforms the non-cooperative GPS and the non-cooperative RISS typically used in challenging GPS environments. Moreover, we compare our proposed scheme to a cooperative scheme based on GPS positions and demonstrate the reliability of a reduced inertial sensor system (RISS)-based cooperative scheme for relatively long time duration.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the summer of 1730, the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations (the Board of Trade) determined to make a treaty with seven Cherokee delegates who were then in London, England. Drawing on their experiences and observations of treaty making with European and Native American parties, as well as on expert advice, the Commissioners of Trade concluded a treaty that they believed fulfilled European and Native American expectations of legitimate treaty making and formalized a relationship of layered sovereignty between the Cherokee Nation and the British Crown.&#xD;
	Foregrounding the 1730 Anglo-Cherokee Treaty as its hinge, this project places British treaties with Native Americans within Britain’s broader treaty practices. Doing so reveals the expectations and assumptions that underlay British treaty making with First Nations, yet have been overlooked and taken for granted in studies of British treaty making with First Nations in situ on the North American continent. I examine the 1730 Anglo-Cherokee Treaty as one event in the Board of Trade’s work relating to treaties, between the years 1717 and 1730. Employing a forensic approach to the Board of Trade Minutes, along with additional correspondence and papers, this project draws out the assumptions about treaties, treaty making and sovereignty that the Commissioners of Trade deployed. This analysis shows that the Commissioners of Trade, representatives of the larger British imperial administration, perceived treaties at one and the same time as a means to affirm and to act coercively on a polity’s sovereignty. It shows that the Commissioners pragmatically recognized a variety of parties as sovereign entities capable of making treaties. The Commissioners perceived treaties as common, necessary and desirable tools for establishing and maintaining relationships between sovereign peoples, relationships which could thereby be manipulated for British commercial and territorial advantage. Treaties, in this understanding, could be used to establish situations of “layered sovereignty,” in which each party’s recognized sovereignty existed concurrently but unequally by expressing itself within different parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The present study examined 413 Euro-Canadians and 480 Chinese over four studies on their preferences for offensive and defensive strategies. Past research has demonstrated that East Asians think more nonlinearly and are more prevention focused, whereas North Americans think more linearly and are more promotion focused. Based on these cultural differences, I predicted that East Asians would prefer defensive strategies more than North Americans would, whereas North Americans would prefer offensive strategies more than East Asians would. I also hypothesized that the effect of culture on preferences for strategies would be mediated by regulatory focus, and that Chinese would endorse more nonlinear beliefs about offense and defense, whereas Canadians would endorse more linear beliefs about them. However, across various scenarios/domains - sports and martial arts (Study 1a), marketing and negotiation (Study 1b and 1c), Chinese were found to prefer offensive strategies more than Canadians did, whereas Canadians preferred defensive strategies more than Chinese did. These cultural differences in their self-reported preferences were not reflected in the strategic moves they made in the behavioural game played in Study 2. In addition, promotion focus did not mediate the relationship between culture and preference for offense, and prevention focus did not mediate the relationship between culture and preference for defense. Nonetheless, Canadians were more likely to endorse linear beliefs more than Chinese did, whereas Chinese were more likely to endorsed non-linear beliefs about offense and defense more than Canadians did.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rock fragmentation has always been an indicator for the efficiency of blasts in mines. Several suggestions have been made by blast operators and specialists to improve the rock fracturing mechanisms in order to obtain smaller fragments. The order of blast hole initiations together with the timing interval between holes has been observed to affect the blast results. In this study, a series of small-scale tests, simulating bench blasting have been made to establish the effect of delays in the sequence of blast initiation. The blasts were performed in high strength grout blocks, which were cast to provide a similar to rock condition excluding the possible structural weaknesses of the rock material. Homogeneity of the grout also helped to create a proper testing environment, ensuring the comparability of the blast results from different specimens. The grout used in the experiments had a strength of 50 MPa, density of 2.2 g/m3, and P-wave velocity of 4000 m/s. Unwanted reflections of blast generated stress waves were eliminated by confining the blocks using a yoke. The tests were made with a range of inter hole delays from 0 to 2000 μs. The fragments achieved after each blast were collected and screened to analyze fragmentation from different delays. In general, coarse fragmentation was obtained from short delays while back break was minimal. Relatively longer delays resulted in better fragmentation with more damage to the back of the blocks. The work continued to investigate the effect of blast gas on fragmentation by conducting similar tests in blocks but by placing copper pipes in the blast holes to control the gas propagation through the blast zone. Although gas penetration did not seem to be fully inhibited by the copper pipes, the new design yielded different results in the delay range which had produced optimum fragmentation. The current study is considered to be a start point for more investigations in the field of efficient blasting with regard to the requirements for the mine to mill process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the advent of Web 2.0, Big Data workflows which are being designed in order to extract useful information from data, are run on many engines, one of which is Apache Spark. Apache Spark is a fast and efficient in-memory parallel-processing software framework. By retaining the data in memory, it speeds up the execution of a wide variety of applications. It maintains fault-tolerance by storing information required to recompute the data in case of failure in stable storage. However, for Big Data, recomputing large amounts of data will lead to a performance penalty. In addition, because Apache Spark runs on commodity hardware, the increased likelihood of failure strengthens the need for a fault-tolerance mechanism.&#xD;
 In order to reduce the impact of failures on the processing of these workflows, we propose a framework called OCTWAS (Online Check-pointer for Workflows on Apache Spark). OCTWAS makes use of knowledge of how the data is used in a workflow and takes into account the gain in time obtained when the data is check-pointed at a particular stage and  a failure occurs. The framework is designed to be lightweight so that the performance does not degrade when there are no failures. OCTWAS decides the check-points and writes the data to the disks at these check-points while the workflow is being executed. OCTWAS has been tested by simulating failures at fixed intervals. A sample workflow has been designed for Apache Spark for testing purposes. The performance when the workflow is run with OCTWAS, both with and without failures, is compared to the performance when the workflow is run without OCTWAS, under the same conditions. Results indicate that OCTWAS not only reduces the impact of failures on the processing time of Big Data workflows, but also does not degrade the performance when failures do not occur.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the challenges to decolonizing education in British Columbia (BC), one of the thirteen provinces and territories in Canada. It is an analysis of the K-12 curriculum documents in BC. The analysis is based on critical literature on settler colonialism, Indigenous critical theory, and critical pedagogy. Recent revisions to the curriculum documents have responded to increasing calls for integration of content about First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples and Indigenous perspectives into education in BC. However, critical silences, problematic representations and placement of content, and subordination of Indigenous ways of knowing and being to settler-colonial epistemology and ontology hinder meaningful integration of Indigenous perspectives into the curriculum. In particular, the naturalization of settler-colonial sovereignty and territoriality in the curriculum reinstates settler interests and “commonsense.” This tendency is particularly problematic in the context of the contemporary neoliberalization of education in settler societies. This thesis proposes that decolonizing education in BC will require a shift in the ways settlers and Indigenous peoples relate in and with place.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Contemporary business ethics asks the question: what moral responsibilities do actors in a market economy have? Specifically, what obligations do corporate managers have? In this paper I consider a new method for answering these questions, Joseph Heath’s market failure model of business ethics. On this view, the market is a staged competition that is normatively justifiable through its tendency to promote Pareto efficiency. Since the market is justified by Pareto efficiency, competitive behaviour in the market should be constrained by a set of rules that is consistent with the pursuit of Pareto efficiency. Treating business as a competition is philosophically justified, I argue, both in the sense that it satisfies the conditions of a game, or at least a game­like activity, and in the sense that the deontic weakening that competition brings with it is justified in the market. I consider one case in more detail, to demonstrate the value of the approach. Within the business competition, I argue, lobbying is an impermissible, though conditionally excusable strategy. This is because lobbying routinely produces market failures, and indeed is often pursued precisely with that goal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome without consensus on its etiology or treatment. Present biomedical outcomes for IC/BPS remain poor. There is growing recognition within the medical field of the significant role psychosocial factors play in the chronic pain experience. Catastrophizing, behavioural coping strategies, and depressive symptomology are all noted for their negative impact on chronic pelvic pain outcomes. In particular, the relationship between catastrophizing and pain, long recognized in other chronic pain populations, has recently been highlighted in IC/BPS research. The primary aim of this study was to identify the conditional processes through which catastrophizing predicts pain. Using the transactional model of stress and coping and the fear of re-injury model as theoretical frameworks, a moderated multiple-mediation model was tested which predicted that illness-focused and wellness-focused behavioural coping strategies mediate the relationship between catastrophizing and pain, and that these mediating effects were stronger among individuals with higher levels of depressive symptomology. Female patients diagnosed with IC/BPS (N=341; 49.77 ± 14.49 years) were recruited from tertiary care urology clinics in Canada, USA, Taiwan, Denmark, and India. Participants completed questionnaires measuring levels of pain, catastrophizing, behavioural coping strategy usage, and depressive symptomology. Illness-focused behavioural coping strategies were found to mediate the relationship between catastrophizing and pain (both sensory and affective). Additionally, depressive symptomology moderated the mediating effect of illness-focused behavioural coping on the relationship between catastrophizing and affective pain. The relationships between pain, catastrophizing, behavioural coping strategies, and depressive symptomology are discussed in relation to the extant chronic pain literature, along with clinical implications, limitations, and areas for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Romans were the first civilization that envisaged an international legal system rooted in the human person and for all humankind.  The innovation of this concept was precisely its universality centered on the human conscience, which, different from past approaches to international law, was not theoretically limited to a group of people or a religion. Although still deprived of universal de facto application, the Roman concept of the law of nations or jus gentium guided, to a greater or lesser extent, all subsequent writings on the subject until its complete limitation to a law between states and its current revival within the theoretical framework of international human rights law. The general framework of human rights is the Roman notion that international law flows from an universal reason of all humankind and is equally observed by all peoples and used as law by all peoples or nations. It is this definition, looked through the perspective of modern times, which forms the pro homine framework. Both the European and Inter-American human rights courts unconsciously follow the precepts of the Roman jus gentium. They contribute to the reaffirmation that international human rights is indeed centered on the human person as the end and source of law. This individual-centric and Roman-based conception guide the transformation, application and interpretation of international human rights law setting the basic parameters of individuals as bearers of rights, duties, capacity and interests at the international level. Accordingly, declarations, treaties and courts merge traditional elements of international law (the language of declarations and treaties) with the core elements of the Roman law of nations (universality, the human person as the source and end of law, international law setting guidelines to change and adapt domestic law and the importance of written instruments and magistrates). Adapting to different historical, legal, social and political contexts, international human rights law is in theory and method part of a truly corpus juris gentium romani (body of the Roman law of nations</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Autonomy is an important developmental task that begins in toddlerhood and continues into adulthood. Research has generally examined autonomy from parents and peers in adolescence, as there are a number of cognitive, physical, and emotional changes during this period of development that may influence how youth become autonomous. There is limited research, however, on how dependence (or lack of autonomy) from both relationships develops jointly across adolescence. As well, few studies have examined the relationship quality and psychosocial adjustment outcomes associated with joint parent and peer dependence. The objectives of the current research were to investigate how the combination of parent and peer dependence develops together, and to assess its effects on youth’s functioning. In the first study, semiparametric group-based modeling analyses were used to identify youth that followed different developmental trajectories of dependence with parents and peers. Our results indicated that there are individual differences in autonomy development, with some youth following a high trajectory of parent and/or peer dependence, and others following a low trajectory of parent and/ or peer dependence. Four joint parent and peer dependence trajectory groups emerged. The second study built on the results from Study 1 and found that youth who reported low levels of dependence on both parents and peers had healthy relationships and psychosocial adjustment. On the other hand, youth with high dependence on both parents and peers may be at risk for psychosocial problems. Results also suggest that parent and peer dependence may have differential roles in influencing adolescent functioning. Together, these findings emphasize the interrelatedness of parent and peer dependence, and demonstrate the need to consider both parent and peer relationship contexts when examining youth functioning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Excessive drinking is associated with significant negative consequences for individuals, and enormous costs to the healthcare system and economy. Around the world, university students comprise a particularly vulnerable population with respect to excessive drinking. This demographic group exhibits heavier drinking patterns than older adults and like-aged peers who do not attend university. Given the widespread negative fallout associated with alcohol misuse, the identification of pre-existing factors that are associated with increased vulnerability for this behaviour is critically important, especially among high-risk groups such as undergraduates. The goal of the current dissertation was to explore, among undergraduates, individual differences in intrapersonal factors that confer risk for excessive drinking, particularly disinhibited behaviour and stress – factors that have been robustly associated with the development of alcohol use disorder. Study 1 examined whether impulsivity, sensation seeking, and anxiety sensitivity were related to escalated drinking behaviour in the transition between high school and the first year of undergraduate studies. Our findings demonstrated that individual differences in trait impulsivity prospectively predicted increases in hazardous drinking and, at a trend level, drinking intensity. Study 2 assessed whether exposure to acute stress increases voluntary alcohol intake and, further, whether intake of alcohol relates to individual differences in anxiety. Consistent with our hypotheses, psychosocial stress increased voluntary intake of alcohol, but not placebo or non-alcoholic beverages. In contrast, ad libitum alcohol intake was not related to individual differences in anxiety. Finally, Study 3 examined whether alcohol induces biochemical stress responses in a non-clinical population and, moreover, whether this effect relates to individual differences in impulsivity and subjective alcohol responses. Our data demonstrated that alcohol intoxication was associated with increases in biochemical markers of stress, namely cortisol and alpha amylase, among males.  Biochemical responses were highest among individuals who reported the greatest stimulant effects of alcohol. Additionally, trait impulsivity was positively correlated with cortisol responses to alcohol. Taken together, the current studies underscore the importance of individual differences in behavioural disinhibition (e.g., impulsivity) on the subjective effects of alcohol and drinking behaviour among undergraduates. Clinical implications and avenues for future research are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known colloquially as drones, have proliferated throughout North America. Canada, in particular, has been favourable to the growth of the UAV market. Given that this topic requires analysis, this thesis endeavours to explore UAVs in a socio-historical context, one in which the origin of UAVs can be traced until its present manifestation. First, this thesis situates the concept of “politics of visibility,” which resides at the core of surveillance studies. Visibility, anchored in surveillance, helps scholars and the public to understand how UAVs operate and interact with their environment. Second, the theoretical framework of this thesis amalgamates concepts such as visibility with others notions, such as tracking, and considers how these terms function more broadly within a new military urbanism. Third, this thesis advances a theory of drones, one that identifies these devices not merely as “objects” but rather as technological devices with an “infused” politics. Fourth, this thesis situates UAVs within a Canadian context, one in which the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has already utilized these devices for policing. The evolving nature of policing will be highlighted to demonstrate how archaic notions of policing from the previous century must be challenged and ideally overcome. Finally, this thesis investigates the implications of UAVs in relation to the two Canadian privacy statutes: The federal Privacy Act (1983), which regulates how the Federal government handles Canadians’ personal information, and the Personal Information Protection Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) (2000) which sets guidelines for organizations dealing with the personal information of Canadians.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. has invested 2.8 billion dollars in its Rocanville Division, a&#xD;
potash mine in southeast Saskatchewan. The investment was made to increase site production nameplate&#xD;
capacity from 3.0 million tonnes per annum (MMtpa) (K20) to 5.7 MMtpa (K20). The expansion consisted&#xD;
of three components. First, processing capacity was doubled by building a second mill facility. Second,&#xD;
ore hoisting capacity was increased by converting the existing service shaft into a production shaft.&#xD;
Finally, mine production capacity was increased by nearly tripling the production mining machine fleet&#xD;
and opening new ore reserves. In addition to this, a new (third) remote shaft to act as a new service shaft&#xD;
was also constructed. This thesis covers the design of a mine ventilation system that will meet the&#xD;
operating constraints of the post-expansion production requirements, the publishing of which is unique&#xD;
compared to typical potash mine ventilation practice, which has historically been based solely on field&#xD;
experience. The mine ventilation system was designed by analyzing the minimum requirements for&#xD;
effective production on a ‘per machine’ basis. Shaft capacities for airflow were also analyzed and mine&#xD;
resistance was estimated using ventilation engineering principles. Design calculations were then verified&#xD;
through extensive computer modeling, and used to generate specifications for fan systems. This thesis&#xD;
also presents the planning of the construction and commissioning and the phased implementation of the&#xD;
system while the mine continued to produce potash. The transition phases were planned to work in&#xD;
conjunction with mine production downtime, complement other ‘expansion’ related construction&#xD;
activities, and most importantly provide effective ventilation to the mine throughout the entire process. A&#xD;
comparison of the ventilation model to in-field survey data was completed during several of the early&#xD;
transition phases to verify the design calculations. This thesis also presents novel applications of&#xD;
engineering principles used to optimize the design from and aerodynamics and health and safety (sound&#xD;
exposure and local air velocity) viewpoint, perspectives often unconsidered when performing conveyance&#xD;
design, shaft design, and determining fan placement. All of this was done in order to reconcile ventilation&#xD;
requirements with production expectations, allowing for efficient and productive potash mining.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>How the visual system resolves conflicting information in the construction of a stable and coherent conscious experience remains one of the central problems of vision science. One striking example of this resolution of conflict is known as object substitution masking (OSM). OSM describes the phenomenon whereby the representation of an initially presented stimulus (the target) is replaced by the representation of a subsequently presented stimulus (the mask). OSM has been used as evidence for a visual processing mechanism that evaluates emerging object representations based on incoming perceptual input. Specifically, if incoming perceptual information is found to be discrepant with previously presented information, the prior information will be replaced by the new information such that it never enters conscious awareness. OSM has typically been investigated by the simultaneous and brief (&lt; 50 ms) presentation of a target object surrounded by four small dots (the mask). When the four dots persist after the offset of the target object, it is common for observers to only consciously perceive the mask and not the target. Leading theories of OSM explain failures in target awareness as the result of a discrete all-or-none process in which target information is eliminated before it ever enters conscious awareness. However, OSM has to date only been assessed using forced choice methodologies. Thus, theories of OSM remain underspecified in the extent to which the target is processed before, during, and after the mechanism responsible for OSM occurs. The purpose of the experiments presented in this thesis was to understand the nature of target representation during OSM in order to understand the nature of conflict resolution in the visual processing stream during conscious object perception. In Chapter 2, OSM was found to both increase random guessing about, as well as decrease the precision of, a target object’s orientation. This finding of reduced precision provided novel evidence that OSM can impact object representations in a continuous, rather than discrete, manner. In Chapter 3, I presented target objects for durations far exceeding those of typical masking paradigms. In support of a temporal trimming account, OSM was found to reduce the perceived duration of a target (Experiment 1) and prematurely terminate the updating of a target’s orientation (Experiment 2). This finding strengthened the notion that the process responsible for OSM is continuous in nature and further demonstrated that OSM can interfere with object representations following their formation as conscious percepts. These findings challenge existing theories of OSM and argue that the process responsible for OSM is the result of a continuous, rather than discrete all-or-none, process. Further, these studies extend the reach of OSM as a tool for investigating conscious vision beyond the processes involved during the formation of a conscious representation.</dcterms:abstract>

The pecking motion appears to be a single continuous movement, however video analysis examined at frame rates slower than real-time has shown that pigeons briefly stop the movement of their head twice during a single peck. After the second stop, they initiate a final ballistic movement which terminates when they make contact with a target (Goodale, 1983). It has been hypothesized that during the first stop (or fixation) phase pigeons are making the decision whether or not to peck the target. During the second stop phase pigeons are thought to calculate finer details of the target such as its specific size and depth as well as program the final motor movement needed to make an accurate peck. The current experiment was designed to analyze the function of the second stop phase by varying target size. Four pigeons were trained on a task involving pecking at five sizes of stimuli for a food reward, and the movements of their heads and bodies were recorded during pecking as well as walking towards the screen where the targets appeared. The main hypothesis, that the duration of the second stop phase would increase as stimulus size decreased, was tentatively supported; the data followed the hypothesized trend across all sizes of stimuli except the largest. Other interesting findings concerning head and body movement were also found, such as that pigeons appear to begin calculating the orientation of their head for the final peck during the first stop phase, and that the distances from the screen that the pigeons hold their heads at during both stop phases increase as stimulus size increases. Future directions expanding from these findings are proposed to further examine the function of the first stop phase.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research examines the factors that influence the emergence of cooperative municipal-First Nation relationships, and explores how these relationships can be sustained and built upon so that they are based on the principles of mutual recognition, mutual respect, sharing and mutual responsibility. Municipalities and First Nations are increasingly collaborating on land use planning, development, and services provision, and municipal officials, including planners, need to consider the role they can have in transforming organisational structures and land use planning practices in a way that will foster collaboration with First Nations. Strong relationships allow for mutually beneficial projects to be explored and undertaken, they reduce the chance for conflict and misunderstanding, and they play an important role in meaningful reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples&#xD;
This research utilizes a case study of the City of Calgary and the Tsuut’ina Nation to examine municipal-First Nation cooperation, and centres on how the relationship between the two communities evolved during negotiations to construct the southwest Calgary ring road through Nation land. Document review, policy analysis, and semi-structured interviews were used to determine the factors that encouraged the emergence of a cooperative relationship between the two neighbours. The research points to the importance of visionary community leadership in building trust and respect between First Nations and local governments, and in arriving at mutually beneficial outcomes.&#xD;
Since political turnover, conflict, and changing priorities can threaten relationships, this thesis also explores how the City of Calgary can work toward organisational arrangements to sustain and build upon its relationship with the Tsuut’ina Nation. Municipal politicians and employees have a&#xD;
iii&#xD;
responsibility to pursue active reconciliation with First Nations, and this research suggests practices, processes, and values that municipal governments, planners, and other officials can strive to adopt. This research suggests that comprehensive strategies, developed in partnership with First Nation neighbours and targeted at the levels of planning practice, policy, and culture, have the potential to enable municipal governments, planners, and other officials to respectfully and effectively engage with First Nations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), the role of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is very important since it enables Secondary Users (SUs) to access the spectrum without affecting Primary Users' (PUs) communications. SUs' and PUs' geometry has an effect on the performance of the spectrum sharing algorithms. Also, SUs' mobility changes the topology of the network as well as  interference between the PUs and SUs.  The scenario of multiuser multichannel CRNs introduces new challenges such as co-channel interference.  Consequently, the power budget should be allocated to the SUs subject to specific constraints. Hence, different SUs will have different power and interference limits depending on the activity of PUs and on which SUs will be causing co-channel interference to each other. In addition, enabling Energy Harvesting (EH) in CRNs is promising to extend their lifetime so that the hybrid interweave/underlay access scheme is adopted, which means that SUs can access the active and non-active PU bands.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, I propose  new optimal and suboptimal Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) algorithms that employ an interweave/underlay access scheme. I also study the impact of the following factors: mobility of the SUs, spectrum mobility, the Primary Exclusive Regions (PERs), the geographical locations of the nodes, connectivity of SUs, correlated shadow fading,  and the activity of both PUs and SUs. A cross-layer approach is adopted in order to benefit from the  information of the other layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Moreover, to increase both the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency, I also propose a novel algorithm that enables SUs to harvest energy with minimal impact on their spectrum access performance. The algorithm allows SUs to participate in making decisions regarding their operating mode. Also, the algorithm ensures that the energy level in CRN cannot be lower than a specific threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, I propose different optimal and suboptimal algorithms that optimize the power allocation among SUs. The objective is to maximize the Spectral Efficiency (SE) while respecting the power budget along with the other constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results are presented for all of the proposed algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Children going to school or bed hungry due to lack of food at home is a public health concern in Canada. Hunger adversely affects child health and development. Social support can alleviate hunger among adults. However, limited literature exists on this in adolescents. There is a need to understand the concept of hunger and aspects of food insecurity from adolescents’ perspective in order to improve existing health promotion or nutrition programs. &#xD;
Objectives: This mixed methods study aims to: [1] assess qualitative content validity of the hunger item on the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; [2] understand Canadian adolescents’ perspectives on the HBSC item and on hunger more broadly; [3] investigate the epidemiologic relationship between social support from parents and teachers and adolescent’s report of hunger.&#xD;
Methods: Manuscript 1: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using adolescent focus groups across Ontario. Coding proceeded in three stages with codes, themes and overarching concepts identified. The relative importance of themes were determined through assessment of depth, immediacy and richness of interaction surrounding them, as well as their reoccurrence. Manuscript 2: Canadian 2009/2010 HBSC data were used to examine the relationship between social support and hunger using adjusted Poisson regression. &#xD;
Results: [1] Content validity assessment showed adolescents considered quantity, consistent access and food preference, but not food quality when answering the HBSC hunger item; [2] Adolescents’ discussions highlighted four overarching concepts: hunger related to family affluence, societal influences on food choice and practices, parental influence on food availability and practice, and the effect of hunger on health; [3] Parental and teachers’ support were independently and consistently associated with hunger. Adolescents who reported lower perceived support were also more likely to report going to school or bed hungry because there was not enough food at home. &#xD;
Conclusion: The HBSC hunger item should be cautiously interpreted with regards to food quality. When responding to the hunger item adolescents considered economic, social, family-related and health-related ideas. Overall, results from these studies may be informative to school- and community-based nutrition and health promotion programs that focus on the potential benefits of using social networks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The six papers presented in this half-thesis trace my progression through various schools of thought in human geography. It is an “ensalada mixta” that presents a mix of approaches and investigative methods related to food studies and Cuba. &#xD;
The first paper in this collection engages with the concepts of the right to food, food security and its measurement at a macro level. It demonstrates the extent of the world food problem and discusses some of its complex underpinnings. In the second paper, I review the impacts of the Special Period on Cuban food production and examine the urban agriculture program that emerged in response. I show why the Cuban urban agriculture program is often cited as a “best practice” example for other food insecure countries and I present some of the challenges the program faces to ensure its long-term sustainability.&#xD;
For the third paper, I use a feminist lens to take a closer look at the crisis of social reproduction created by the economic and food crises of the Special Period. In this paper, I also argue that a male bias has been introduced through Cuba’s urban agriculture policies and programs (despite women being the primary participants and beneficiaries of urban agriculture programs elsewhere in the world).&#xD;
In the fourth paper, I examine how Cuban women navigate and negotiate food crisis situations, such as the one created by the devastating triple hurricanes of 2008. This paper is founded on a three-month period of fieldwork in Havana in the fall of 2008 and shows how—twenty years after the onset of the Special Period—women’s opportunities for gender equality continue to be affected by periodically recurring economic and food crises. &#xD;
Finally, in the fifth and sixth papers (a case study and project proposal, respectively), I take a historical geographical approach to examine the writings of 19th century travellers to Cuba. I illustrate how their day-to-day experiences with food were used as markers of place and difference, how they contributed to the production of geographical knowledge and the establishment of identities and power relationships between travellers, hosts and audience.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cultural geographers have long been interested in “the everyday,” but rarely is everyday life acknowledged in the context of incarceration. In Canada, the recent adoption of “tough-on-crime” policies has meant that increasing numbers of individuals spend their daily lives behind bars. In this dissertation, I ask: what do prisons sound like, and what is the role of sound in the way prisons are managed, conceptualised, and embodied? The recent flourishing of scholarship on carceral geographies has made crucial inroads in the study of the cultural politics and spatialities of incarceration, yet the notion of incarceration as a multi-sensory, embodied experience remains under-researched. &#xD;
Drawing on Feld’s notion of acoustemologies, or auditory knowledges, I argue that one way to better understand the production of carceral space is through engagement with sonic techniques, histories, and materialities of prisons. Thinking about sound as a tangible and intangible force, I show how different conceptualisations of sound – including silence, noise, and music – (re)shape power relations in Canada’s prisons. In the midst of overcrowding and segregation in prisons, Canada’s political climate reverberates through its carceral soundscapes, leaving lasting soundprints on incarcerated bodies. Alongside these authoritative and often oppressive uses of sound, I articulate how sonic tactics have also been employed to reclaim dignity and resist pains of imprisonment (Sykes, 1958). &#xD;
To address how the everyday is negotiated sonically in prisons, I draw on situated narratives of individuals who have visited, worked, and lived inside prisons, recognising the experiences of people whose voices are often silenced in prison literature. This research employed a wide range of methods, including interviewing, blog analyses, archival research, and auditory techniques to investigate multi-sensory accounts of carceral life. Bearing in mind the political nature of access to Canadian prison environments, I urge researchers to explore the potential for sonic methods to navigate these challenges, to produce geographical and (trans)carceral knowledge, and to imagine alternatives to current practices of incarceration. I conclude with a call to consider more critically the role of listening in future research, as an instrumental route to empathy and reconciliation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interstitial Cystitis /Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and refractory medical&#xD;
condition that is characterized by chronic pelvic pain along with abnormal urinary frequency and urgency.&#xD;
There is no widely accepted etiology or efficacious cure for IC/BPS, thus treatment often relies on pain&#xD;
and symptom management. IC/BPS is associated with a complex array of psychological, behavioural,&#xD;
cognitive and emotional issues, and as such examining these relationships within a comprehensive model&#xD;
is warranted. Current perspective on the biopsychosocial framework has introduced models of self regulation,&#xD;
which help to explain how individuals cope with chronic illness. The literature reviewed in&#xD;
this dissertation examines the interconnection between impairments (pain and symptoms), illness&#xD;
perceptions, coping (illness-focused, wellness-focused and emotion regulation) and outcomes (mental&#xD;
health and physical disability). Many of these relationships have yet to be investigated within samples of&#xD;
IC/BPS. Thus, the primary aim of this dissertation was to evaluate a self-regulation model of coping with&#xD;
IC/BPS through a series of model building methodologies. Female patients diagnosed with IC/BPS by a&#xD;
urologist in tertiary care hospitals were recruited across centres in North America (n=217). Steps 1 and 2&#xD;
evaluated the measurement models to determine the structure and composition of the main constructs.&#xD;
Step 3 evaluated the model fit and specified hypotheses in the proposed IC-Self Regulation Model, and&#xD;
step 4 evaluated alternative models. The results support the structural model of the IC-Self Regulation&#xD;
Model that demonstrates relationships amongst impairments, illness perceptions, coping and outcomes. In&#xD;
particular, physical disability was modeled through negative illness perceptions, illness-focused coping&#xD;
and emotion regulation, and mental health was modeled through illness self-efficacy perceptions,&#xD;
wellness-focused coping and adaptive emotion regulation. The specified relationships are discussed in&#xD;
relation to the literature along with theoretical and clinical implications, study limitations and areas for&#xD;
future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project, containing a written thesis and documentary film, investigates contemporary film production by young Cuban filmmakers in Havana, Cuba. In the changing audiovisual landscape young filmmakers are often positioned as ‘independent’ cultural producers. Social, political and economic relationships to institutional structures have encouraged initiatives within the filmmaking community. Young filmmakers participate in these initiatives forming new spatial, social and financial relationships on and off the island. These connections are facilitated through growing access to media and technology as well as a desire for engagement with global film markets. These factors also influence the types of images young filmmakers seek to produce as well as their production methods. &#xD;
The documentary film entitled Por Amor al Arte follows the experiences and films of five young filmmakers in Havana, Cuba. The documentary further addresses the question: How do young Cuban filmmakers produce films away from the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC), the dominant film institute, within the contemporary Cuban context? And do they have the desire to continue to produce film in Cuba and why? Because the Cuban film industry continues to function on the centralized model established after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the ICAIC maintains its position as the sole producer and distributor of Cuban cinema. Due to scarce resources and little economic support in the 1990s many of Cuba’s filmmakers sought alternative methods to produce their films away from the ICAIC. Today young filmmakers benefit from certain resources and approaches developed in the 1990s, while new struggles emerge within a contemporary context. Filmmakers who produce away from the ICAIC, however, do not have legal standing in the country and cannot operate as independent production companies. Furthermore, most productions are created and screened in Havana, Cuba, which privilege those who live in the city. Young filmmakers in Havana negotiate these factors and consider the possibilities of staying in Cuba to produce their work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, we consider a general binary and M-ary hypothesis testing problems with unknown parameters. In a hypothesis testing problem, we assume that the probability density function (pdf) of observation is given while some unknown parameters exit in the structure of the pdf and the set of unknowns under each hypothesis is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the first part of this study, for a binary composite testing, we prove that the Minimum Variance and Unbiased Estimator of a Separating Function (SF) serves as the optimal decision statistic for the Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) unbiased test. In many problems, the UMP test does not exist. For such cases, we introduce new suboptimal SF-Estimator Tests (SFETs) which are easy to derive for many problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the second part, we study the relationship between Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) and invariant tests. We generally show that for a family of distributions, the unknown parameters are eliminated from the distribution of the maximal invariant statistic under the Minimal Invariant Group (MIG) while the maximum information of the observed signal is preserved. We prove that any invariant test with respect to the MIG is CFAR. Then, we introduce the UMP-CFAR test as the optimal CFAR bound among all CFAR tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the third part, the asymptotical optimality of the CFAR tests is studied after reduction using MIG. We show that the CFAR tests obtained after MIG reduction using the Wald test is SFET and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test and the Rao test are asymptotically optimal. To find an improved test, we maximize the asymptotic probability of detection of the SFET using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We propose a systematic method allowing to derive the Asymptotically Optimal SFET. Finally, we extend the concept of SFET to the M-ary hypothesis testing. Defining M different SFs for an M-ary problem, we show that the optimal minimum error test is achieved using the MLE of SFs. Moreover, in the case that the optimal minimum error test does not exist, the error probability of the proposed SFET tends to zero when the number of independent observations tends to infinity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Estimating biomechanical measures of the human body requires body segment inertial parameters (BSIP). Widely cited estimation methods (Chandler et al., 1975; Dempster, 1955) are based on an elderly population, have inherent errors (Hanavan, 1964) and may not represent subjects to which they are applied. Subject specific methods such as medical imaging or geometrical techniques can be time consuming, expensive and may require a variety of manually acquired inputs. Presented here is an alternative, subject specific approach to estimating BSIPs, requiring no manual measurements at a equipment cost of approximately $300.&#xD;
A 3D scanning protocol using a single Microsoft Kinect V2 was developed. Twenty-one subjects (10 male, 11 female) were scanned 3 times with per scan durations of approximately 20-30 seconds. Each full body 3D scan was segmented in Meshlab according to a 16 segment link model defined by Zatsiorsky and Seluyanov (1983). The 3D data was analyzed in custom MATLAB software that estimated the volume, MOI, COM, length and mass of each of the link segments. Results were compared to estimates obtained using an elliptical cylinder model (ECM) (Jensen 1978) and to estimates obtained using regression equations developed from medical imaging techniques (Zatsiorsky and Seluyanov 1983). &#xD;
The body volume estimates using the Kinect demonstrated high repeatability (ICC≥0.95) with a volume overestimation ranging from 0.0023 m3 (3%) for males and 0.0038m3 (5.1%) for females. The upper torso accounted for the majority of the overestimation of approximately 0.0019m3 (83%) for males and 0.002 m3 (53%) for the females. The Kinect protocol estimated COM with an average error of  &lt;2%. Segmental mass estimates were overestimated by 3.11% for males and 5.23% for females when compared to ECM. This research established that the Kinect V2 could be used as a tool for BSIP estimation. Future work should improve on the scanning posture, scanning protocol and reducing the scan duration. Furthermore, future research should investigate on methods to eliminate the manual segmentation proposed for this protocol.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As vehicle electronic control systems become responsible for an increasing number of functions, developers of such systems find themselves pulled in two directions: the need to perform more and more computation while at the same time reducing cost, weight and power consumption. Traditionally, safety isolation and fault containment of software tasks has been achieved through either physical or temporal segregation. This approach is reliable but inefficient in terms of processor utilization. Recently, there has been a move towards systems which achieve better processor utilization by executing all tasks together and guaranteeing safety isolation and fault containment by means of formal verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, a definition for one such system was developed, based on PharOS and Giotto. The system modelled attempts to ensure observably deterministic data flow (i.e., inputs from and outputs to other systems), but allows for non-observable nondeterminism. It also allows for sporadic deadline overruns and accounts for criticality during fault handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, a method for verifying a given input system definition (system, set of tasks and fault model) for predictable data flow was developed. A stand-alone tool was made that performs this verification and displays the results graphically. The core exhaustive verification is performed by the Spin model checker.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2012, I used Body Mapping to explore personal experiences of HIV risk among 6 young men and 4 young women, ages 18-19, in Soweto, South Africa.  Using a series of arts-based exercises designed to foster participant engagement and knowledge production, and facilitated over the course of four days, participants used the power of art-making to engage in a participant-researcher dialogue about sex, HIV risk, relationships, violence, substance use, the need for trusted mentors, and more. At the end of each art-making day, the Body Mapping participants gathered to discuss their artwork. The participants conveyed that the Body Mapping experience provided a safe, non-judgmental space in which they could challenge their attitudes and understanding about difficult-to-discuss topics. Moreover, the results of the Body Mapping project suggest that HIV prevention measures are not as important as young people’s need for trusted adults with whom they can speak candidly about life’s challenges. The participants also suggested that they require sexual health information and resources based on their lived experiences. Moreover, they articulated that they most needed accessible and youth-friendly communication tools that facilitate honest, non-judgmental, and deliberate conversations about their sexuality, relationships and sexual health practices with trustworthy, reliable adults. Furthermore, the Body Mapping narratives, together with the artwork, offer an in-depth perspective of growing up in post-apartheid South Africa, one in which community leaders, educators and those who connect with youth must challenge their way of engaging with and developing HIV prevention messaging for young people. For youth to better understand HIV risk, adult mentors must be willing to listen to adolescents and young adults and provide them with a safe space in which to talk openly, honestly and without judgment about their risk-taking behavior.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Humans have been automating increasingly sophisticated behaviours for some time now. We have machines that lift and move things, that perform complex calculations, and even machines that build other machines. More recently, technological advances have allowed us to automate increasingly sophisticated decision-making processes. We have machines that decide when and how to use lethal force, when and how to perform life-saving medical interventions, and when and how to maneuver cars in chaotic traffic. Clearly, some automated decision-making processes have serious ethical implications—we are now automating ethical decision-making. In this dissertation, I identify and explore a novel set of ethical implications that stem from automating ethical decision-making in emerging and existing technologies.&#xD;
I begin the argument by setting up an analogy between moral proxies in healthcare, tasked with making ethical decisions on behalf of those who cannot, and technological moral proxies, those machines (artefacts) to which we delegate ethical decision-making. The technological moral proxy is a useful metaphor. It allows us to import the many established norms surrounding moral proxies in bioethics, to inform the ethics, design and governance of certain machines. As is the case with moral proxies in healthcare, we need norms to help guide the design and governance of machines that are making ethical decisions on behalf of their users. Importantly, I argue that we need a methodology and framework to ensure we aren’t subjecting technology users to unacceptable forms of paternalism.&#xD;
Having set up the analogy, I situate the discussion within various theories in science and technology studies (STS). STS provides a rich philosophical vocabulary to help ground the particular ethical implications, including implications for designers and engineers, raised by machines that automate ethical decision-making. Thus, STS helps to frame the issues I raise as design and governance issues.&#xD;
I then provide a rudimentary taxonomy of delegation to help distinguish between automated decision-making that is ethically permissible, and that which is impermissible. Finally, I combine the various pieces of the argument into a practical “tool” that could be used in design or governance contexts to help guide an ethical analysis of robots that automate ethical decision-making.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) are a bioprocessing tool that limits inhibition of cell growth by toxic compounds in bioreactors by utilizing an immiscible secondary phase to sequester compounds that inhibit microbial cell growth. Early TPPBs used organic solvents as the sequestering phase despite challenges identifying solvents that were inexpensive and biocompatible, although recent efforts have utilized polymers as the sequestering phase in TPPBs. Research on the selection of polymers for use as the sequestering phase in TPPBs has focused on predicting solute uptake by first principles in order to maximize the partitioning coefficient of a target solute. Some research has shown that low molecular weight (MW) polymers have improved partitioning coefficients, although their biocompatibility is in need of further study; this thesis investigates the effect of polymer MW on microbial biocompatibility. Trends in biocompatibility were assessed for polypropylene glycol to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pseudomonas putida. Given that log P has been used as an important physiochemical property for predicting biocompatibility, with higher log P values associated with improved biocompatibility, experiments were performed to determine the log P of polymers. Polymers were also water-washed to shift the log P upwards by removing low MW polymer chains. Average log P determination experiments showed that as the polymer MW increased, the measured log P also increased. Biocompatibility, as measured by the change in optical density of the cultures after 24 hours of exposure to the polymers, also improved with increasing MW and log P, and that polypropylene glycols possessing MWs of 1000 and higher were all found to be biocompatible. It was also shown that water-washing noticeably improved biocompatibility by removing low MW polymer from samples. Initial research was also undertaken to examine the use of amine-functionalized reactive polymers for extracting organic acids in TPPB in terms of their efficacy and their biocompatibility. An amine functionalized polyacrylate was synthesized which was stable under acidic conditions, and did not inhibit cell growth over 24 hour exposure. It was also shown to extract 60-85% of organic acids from aqueous solution over 2 hours with polymer concentrations of 10 g/L, and acid concentrations of 2.5 g/L.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability of the body to manage blood sugar is referred to as insulin sensitivity. Reduced insulin sensitivity is both a risk factor and is involved in the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an established predictor of insulin sensitivity. Whether this association persists following control for exercise is not known. The primary objective of this study was to determine the independent associations between changes in exercise, CRF and insulin sensitivity. The influence of changes in body weight and waist circumference (WC) on these associations was examined in secondary analyses.&#xD;
       Participants were 140 middle-aged, inactive, abdominally obese adults that participated in a 24-week exercise program. Exercise was performed 5 times per week for the duration of the program and was measured as Calories of energy expended, herein referred to as exercise energy expenditure (exercise EE). CRF was measured using a treadmill test to exhaustion. Body weight was measured on a Detecto scale and WC was measured at the level of the hip bone. Physical activity performed outside of the exercise sessions was measured using portable activity monitors known as accelerometers. Caloric intake was monitored using daily diet records. Following oral consumption of a 75-gram glucose drink, 2-hour insulin area under the curve was calculated as a measure of insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
        Change in insulin sensitivity was associated with exercise EE, change in CRF, change in body weight and change in WC. Exercise EE was associated with change in insulin sensitivity after we adjusted for change in CRF, whereas change in CRF was not associated with change in insulin sensitivity after we adjusted for exercise EE. After further adjustment for changes in body weight and WC, neither exercise EE nor change in CRF were associated with change in insulin sensitivity. Changes in body weight and WC were associated with change in insulin sensitivity after adjustment for exercise EE and change in CRF.&#xD;
      The principle finding of this study was that the link between CRF and insulin sensitivity is largely explained by variations in exercise. Further, a reduction in obesity is one of the ways in which exercise improves insulin sensitivity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The DEAP-3600 dark matter search experiment uses 3600 kilograms of liquid argon as a target medium contained in a spherical acrylic vessel. Particle interactions in liquid argon produce vacuum ultraviolet light at a peak wavelength of 128 nanometers, which is not directly visible by the 255 inward-facing photomultiplier tubes. To make visible these interactions, the organic wavelength shifter 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene, with a re-emission spectrum peaked at 430 nanometers, was evaporatively deposited over the inner surface of the acrylic vessel. The several micron thick coating covers approximately 9 square meters. Application of the coating was performed under vacuum using an evaporation source deployed in the center of the vessel before filling with argon. Research and development on the deployment system for sources inside the acrylic vessel, small scale testing of the evaporation source, and data from test deposition thickness monitoring will be presented, as well as details on the development of the final source, deployment, and performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Political theorists, in increasing frequency, have focused on the application of theories of justice to concrete social issues and policy prescriptions. This so called “policy turn” has made it ever more important to reflect upon the goal of political theory. At the heart of this debate is a concern for action-guidance and a dissatisfaction with what political philosophy has offered in terms of practical relevance. The ideal guidance approach to ideal theory, best exemplified by John Rawls, holds a complementary relation between ideal and non-ideal theory, in which the former provides the goal for the latter to approximate. This approach to ideal theory, however, has been challenged by the Theory of the Second Best which undermines the assumption that simply approximating an ideal will result in the second best available option. Despite this challenge from the TOSB it will be the project of this paper to defend a more indirect role for ideal theory in political theorizing. &#xD;
 My thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 will introduce the concept of ideal theory and fact sensitivity and provide a brief overview of how philosophers have attempted to define these concepts. I will argue that it is important to distinguish the ideal guidance approach from more epistemological approaches to theorizing about justice. In chapter 3, I will examine a unique challenge to the ideal guidance approach to ideal theory, the Theory of Second Best (TOSB). In chapter 4, I will discuss how comparative approaches to justice attempt to construct a theory of justice in light of the TOSB by rejecting the use of ideal theory for real world reform. Finally, in chapter 5, I will mount a moderate defense for the use of ideal theory in normative political theorizing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wireless sensor networks are becoming more and more popular in a widespread number of applications related to monitoring environments, structures, and machinery. Wired monitoring systems are currently widely adopted in industrial settings due to their reputation and history in performing to established standards. In order to explore the field of low-power wireless industrial sensor network monitoring applications, experimental work has to be done in numerous environments.&#xD;
In this thesis, there is a focus on the design and development of hardware and software for such a purpose. Network coordinator devices capable of Internet connectivity over Ethernet, battery-powered sensor nodes equipped to measure acceleration and temperature, and accelerometer boards were designed and produced for the application. The software on the devices was developed as an adaptation of an open-source operating system, Contiki, and explores Internet version 6 connectivity. The goal of the work on this system is to develop a wireless sensor network platform for future research in the areas of sensor testing and industrial monitoring.&#xD;
Two test networks were created with the aforementioned devices to demonstrate their functionality. One network was formed in a laboratory environment where network performance could be judged and tests could be run efficiently. The network contained nine end-nodes and one gateway, and ran for 49 days with an average packet reception rate of 98.2%. The second network was setup in a compressor room on Queen’s University campus; the topology included four end-&#xD;
ii&#xD;
nodes and one gateway. The network observed continuous data collection for 36 days with an average packet reception rate of 86.6%. The battery replacement cycle for the end-nodes was calculated in-laboratory to be 1.36 years; the platform would be suitable for use in a laboratory setting for future research but more work on the system is necessary to improve performance in an industrial environment.&#xD;
The compressor room case study continues to run as a subject of future work. Software changes expected to improve the performance of the system will be uploaded to the devices as they are developed. Such software changes may improve the system’s efficiency and result in an improved battery replacement cycle length.</dcterms:abstract>

	Gleason scores (GS) 3+3 and 3+4 prostate cancers (PCa) differ greatly in their clinical courses, with Gleason pattern (GP) 4 representing a major independent risk factor for cancer progression. However, GP is not reliably ascertained by diagnostic biopsy, largely due to sampling inadequacies, subjectivity in the Gleason grading procedure, the high degree of heterogeneity of the disease, and a lack of more objective biomarker assays to stratify PCa aggressiveness. In most aggressive cancer types, the stromal microenvironment exhibits a reciprocal pro-tumourigenic metabolic phenotype consistent with the Reverse Warburg Effect (RWE). The RWE can be viewed as a physiologic response to the tumour phenotype that is both independent of tumour genotype and direct tumour sampling. This study aims to classify GP3 and GP4 based on differences in their stromal RWE-associated gene expression profiles. &#xD;
Methods:&#xD;
	Gene expression profiling was conducted on RNA extracted from laser-capture microdissected (LCM) stromal tissue surrounding 20 GP3 and 21 GP4 cancer foci from PCa patients with GS 3+3 and GS ≥4+3 respectively. Genes were probed using a 102 gene NanoString probe-set targeted towards biological processes associated with the RWE. Differentially expressed genes were identified from normalized data by univariate analysis. A top-scoring pair (TSP) analysis was also completed on raw gene expression values. &#xD;
Results: &#xD;
	Univariate analysis identified nine genes (FOXO1 (AUC: 0.884), GPD2, SPARC, HK2, COL1A2, ALDOA, MCT4, NRF2 and ATG5) that were differentially expressed between GP3 and GP4 stroma (p&lt;0.05). However, following correction for false discovery only FOXO1 retained statistical significance at q&lt;0.05. TSP analysis identified a significant gene pair, namely ATG5/GLUT1. Greater expression of ATG5 relative to GLUT1 correctly classified 77.4% of GP3/GP4 samples. &#xD;
Conclusions:   &#xD;
	The stroma associated with GP3 is distinct from that associated with GP4 tumour foci by the higher expression of FOXO1 and a greater expression of ATG5 relative to GLUT1. Together, FOXO1 and the relative expression of the ATG5/GLUT1 gene pair represent RWE-based classifiers for GP3 and GP4 PCa, that have the potential to distinguish between true low-risk (GS 3+3) and false low-risk (GS 3+3 harbouring unsampled ≥GP4) patient cases.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite attempts to identify the mechanisms by which obesity leads to the development of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), it remains unclear why some but not all adults with obesity develop T2D. Given the established associations between visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat with insulin resistance, we hypothesized that compared to age and obesity matched adults who were non-diabetic (NT2D), adults with T2D would have greater amounts of VAT and liver fat.&#xD;
The International Study of Prediction of Intra-Abdominal Adiposity and Its Relationship with Cardiometabolic Risk/Intra-Abdominal Adiposity (INSPIRE ME IAA) aims to study the associations between VAT and liver fat and risk of developing T2D and cardiovascular disease. Four thousand, five hundred and four participants were initially recruited; from this, 2383 White and Asian adults were selected for this ancillary analysis. The NT2D and T2D groups were matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). The T2D and NT2D groups were also compared to participants with either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; IFG/IGT)). Abdominal adipose tissue was measured by computed tomography; liver fat was estimated using computed tomography-derived mean attenuation. Secondary analysis determined whether differences existed between NT2D and T2D groups in VAT and liver fat accumulation within selected BMI categories for Whites and Asians. &#xD;
We report across sex and race, T2D and IFG/IGT groups had elevated VAT and liver fat compared to the NT2D group (p&lt;0.05). VAT was not different between IFG/IGT and T2D groups (p&gt;0.05), however liver fat was greater in the T2D group compared to the IFG/IGT group in both Whites and Asians (p&lt;0.05). Within each BMI category, the T2D group had elevated VAT and liver fat compared to the age and anthropometrically matched NT2D group in both Whites and Asians (p&lt;0.05). With few exceptions, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was not different in the T2D or IFG/IGT groups compared to the NT2D group independent of sex and race. &#xD;
Compared to age and obesity-matched adults who are NT2D, we observe that White and Asian adults with T2D, and those with IFG/IGT, present with greater levels of both VAT and liver fat.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>IL-27 has been shown to have important pro- and anti-inflammatory roles in the adaptive immune response.  However, its role in the innate immune response is less well characterized.  The goal of this research was to examine the role of IL-27 in the innate immune response.  Two in vitro models of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, were developed.  S. typhimurium is an intracellular pathogen that can facilitate its own uptake into host cells where it is able to replicate, often leading to host cell death.  Based upon previous research on the role of IL-27 in innate immunity, it was hypothesized that IL-27 pre-treatment of THP-1 cells would result in an enhanced ability of THP-1 cells to fight S. typhimurium infection.  Infecting THP-1 cells with late stationary phase S. typhimurium resulted in a low level of infection whereas infection of THP-1 cells with late exponential phase S. typhimurium led to a high level of THP-1 cell infection.  Adherent THP-1 cells were stimulated with IL-27 for 16 hours prior to infection with either late stationary or late exponential phase S. typhimurium.  A gentamicin protection assay was used to quantify internalized bacteria to assess if IL-27 pre-treatment affected the initial invasion and subsequent survival of S. typhimurium in THP-1 cells.  THP-1 cells stimulated with IL-27 had the same level of internalized S. typhimurium as untreated THP-1 cells initially and over the subsequent 12 hours.  THP-1 cell viability was monitored between 1-12 hours after the addition of S. typhimurium to determine if IL-27 pre-treatment influenced THP-1 cell death.  Pre-treatment with IL-27 did not result in a difference in THP-1 cell death.  TNFα and IL-6 secretion from S. typhimurium infected THP1 cells were assayed to determine if IL-27 pre-treatment resulted in an altered cytokine response.  IL-27 stimulation resulted in significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) levels of TNFα and IL-6 than untreated cells at 1-12 hours after the addition of S. typhimurium indicating IL-27 stimulation of THP-1 cells promotes a pro-inflammatory response.  Overall, IL-27 pre-treatment of THP-1 cells did not alter S. typhimurium infection of THP-1 cells but did enhance the pro-inflammatory response by these cells indicating IL-27 has a role in the pro-inflammatory response by innate immune system to S. typhimurium infection.  Further work is needed to explore the host-pathogen interaction that resulted in enhanced cytokine production in THP-1 cells and if this plays a significant role in immune cell survival over an extended time frame. Understanding the role of IL-27 in the innate immune response to pathogens will provide more information on how the immune system combats disease.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent advances in biotechnology have opened the door to new forms of human enhancement via smart drugs. Studies show that the decision by healthy individuals to use off-label pharmaceuticals in an attempt to self-enhance is surprisingly common in student populations. These studies investigate attitudes toward smart drug use in oneself and in others by relating enhancement decisions to key psychological variables, with a focus on the social dimensions of agency and communion. Data from three main studies and one pilot study show that people generally want to enhance any traits they feel they lack and which they see as important and negatively related to communion. Preferences toward distinctly agentic and communal traits indicate that people prefer to enhance in themselves traits that are associated with agentic themes of intelligence, efficiency, and capability more so than traits associated with communal themes of kindness, trustworthiness, and social relationships. This preference is reversed when considering self-enhancement of others, suggesting that attitudes toward smart drug use vary according to the perspective of actor or observer. Evidence from a priming study also affirms the importance of agency for the self: participants primed with agency were more willing than neutral participants to enhance agentic traits, while priming communion had no measurable effect on self-enhancement preferences.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inverse incentive learning is the loss by stimuli of their ability to elicit approach and other responses. This has been shown in the horizontal bar test. Rats in the Paired group (n = 10) were injected with haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg) and initially descended almost immediately but over days descent latencies grew longer. Control rats were tested daily and received haloperidol (Unpaired group, n = 9) or saline (Saline group, n = 10) later in their home cage. Controls showed no evidence of increased descent latencies. On the final test day, all groups were tested after haloperidol and only the Paired group showed increased descent latencies. c-Fos immunohistochemistry was used to identify brain regions associated with inverse incentive learning. Expression of c-Fos positive neurons in the nucleus accumbens core and ventral pallidum was significantly lower in the Paired rats than in the Unpaired and Saline rats, even though all groups received haloperidol on the test day. Compared to the Saline group both the Paired and Unpaired groups showed evidence of lower c-Fos levels in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens shell, possibly a result of daily haloperidol injections. No group differences in c-Fos expression were found in the piriform cortex, ventral hippocampus, ventral tegmental area or lateral habenula. The numbers of rats in the Saline, Paired, and Unpaired groups were: 9, 10, and 6 for the piriform cortex, dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum; 5, 10, and 5 for the ventral hippocampus; 5, 5, and 5 for the ventral tegmental area; and 6, 6, and 7 for the lateral habenula. Results reveal brain region-specific changes in neuronal activity associated with inverse incentive learning. Results support possible underlying neuroplastic changes for learned decreases in responsivity to environmental stimuli.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>While the natural sciences have convincingly argued for the reality of anthropogenic climate change, the social sciences have not paid sufficient attention to how knowledge of climate change becomes real through social practices. Yet investigating how climate change becomes real offers insight into the range of responses available to publics and policymakers. This dissertation addresses this gap in knowledge by studying how the sciences are being reorganized in response to cryospheric change. &#xD;
The social reorganization of the polar sciences that is examined in this dissertation is informed by two main factors: (1) the recognition of the implications that anthropogenic climate change has for Indigenous populations dwelling in the Arctic, and (2) the recognition that climate change impacts in the Arctic cannot be adequately understood by examining parts of the environment in isolation from each other, but rather that a more holistic consideration is required. &#xD;
To examine the social reorganization of the polar sciences, this dissertation draws upon science and technology studies, reflexive sociology, and poststructuralist ethics. The dissertation uses several qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews with key informants and participant-observation. &#xD;
The central empirical foci of the dissertation are the inclusion of the “human dimension” in the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008, the engagement with Indigenous knowledge in Canadian IPY projects, and the call to go “From Knowledge to Action” that concluded the IPY in 2012. I further examine the roles of uncertainty pertaining to rates of ice sheet melt, the positioning of stakeholders as mediators of complexity, and how the gap between knowledge and action is addressed in the Canadian High Arctic Research Station (CHARS) through social-ecological systems theory. &#xD;
One of the main narratives this dissertation relates is the shift from reflexivity to resilience that informed the transition of Canadian science-for-policy from planning for the IPY 2007-2008 to planning for CHARS. I argue for the importance of “listening vulnerably” to human and non-human others, including the role sea ice plays as homeland for Arctic Indigenous peoples.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a main cause of chronic low back pain, which results in significant economic loss to society and compromised life quality of patients. Traditional treatments of IVDD include surgical procedures, such as discectomy, and spinal fusion. However, these methods cannot preserve the biological or biomechanical functions of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Moreover, they decrease the mobility of the associated spinal motion segment and increase the load and stress on contiguous discs. Currently, artificial IVD replacements have gained interest. Although these implants are capable of preserving disc motion and disc height, they are unable to sustain compressive forces applied on the IVD due to their lack of elasticity. Therefore, there is a great need for an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IVDD. For mild or early stages of IVDD, regeneration by injecting pre-differentiated adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) into the nucleus pulposus (NP) has been considered. This study aimed to investigate whether NP cells could direct human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) to differentiate into an NP cell phenotype. These cells could then serve as an alternative cell source for the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration in the clinical setting. Interactions of ASCs and NP cells were studied via an indirect co-culture system using N-cadherin conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA) embedded within calcium alginate gels as scaffolds by evaluating the changing profiles of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and type II collagen. NP cells showed the potential ability to induce hASC differentiation in terms of enhanced ECM production, such as collagen and GAG in an indirect co-culture system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is divided in the following manner:  Chapter 1 offers a short introduction, Chapter 2 describes the higher-order rhodium-catalyzed semi-intermolecular [(3+2)+2] carbocyclizations of alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) with allenes, Chapter 3 highlights our results with respect to the rhodium-catalyzed semi-intermolecular [(3+2)+1] carbocyclizations of ACPs and carbon monoxide, while Chapter 4 covers the conclusions and future recommendations.&#xD;
Section 2.1 provides an introduction into the metal-catalyzed carbocyclizations, followed by a description of three-carbon synthon utilized in higher-order carbocyclizations.  Section 2.2 particularly focuses on the reactivity of ACPs towards different transition metals to provide three-carbon surrogates in this type of cycloadditions.  Section 2.3 describes the metal-catalyzed cycloaddition reactions that employ allenes as exogenous two-carbon π-components, and concomitantly highlight the challenges associated with controlling chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity for these processes.  The development of the rhodium-catalyzed [(3+2)+2] carbocyclization of alkyne-tethered ACPs is discussed in Section 2.4, which includes the optimization studies, the scope with respect to both substrates and also a plausible reaction mechanism, which accounts for the exclusive formation a single geometrical and regioisomer.  Section 2.5 describes the isolation of the key rhodacycle intermediate and its application towards the development of a highly enantioselective [(3+2)+2] carbocyclization of alkene-tethered ACPs and allenes.  We were able to isolate the corresponding cyclic adduct in 90:10 enantiomeric ratio and excellent regio- and diastereoselectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 3 commences with an introduction to the Pauson–Khand reaction (PKR) and continues with the description of the intra- and intermolecular [3+2+1] carbocyclization reactions (Section 3.1).  The following section details our efforts towards the development of the diastereoselective rhodium-catalyzed [(3+2)+1] carbocyclization of alkenylidenecyclopropanes and carbon monoxide.  In collaboration with Prof. M.-H. Baik’s group, we employed high-level DFT calculations, which were supported by experimental studies, in order to construct a reliable hypothesis and demonstrate the scope for this reaction.  All reactions afforded the six-membered bicycles in excellent yield and diastereoselectivity.  Finally, Section 3.3 describes an extension of this [(3+2)+1] carbocyclization reaction by employing alkyne-tethered ACPs to construct substituted bicyclic phenols.  Overall, the methodologies described in this thesis have the potential of being utilized as key steps in the synthesis of important natural products (e.g. guaianolides).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A grade is a prevalent symbol used to communicate student performance over a period of learning. Grading is the process of assigning a grade, which can be affected by a variety of determinant factors (e.g., achievement and non-achievement factors), scales, reporting formats, and other socio-personal factors (e.g., subjects, schools, teachers’ personal beliefs, and teachers’ values). Grading policies, standards, and documents are published to establish and maintain consistencies for teachers’ grading practices. However, grading policies are evident across multiple levels within an educational systems (e.g., governmental, state/provincial, school district, school family, school, grade level), which can contribute to diverse conceptions of grading causing potential discrepancies related to grade determination, interpretation, and use.&#xD;
This research aims to examine the alignment of grading policies at three educational levels––national, provincial and school––within the Chinese educational system. This study aims to respond to the following questions: (a) how do national, provincial, and school level grading policies describe the purpose and process of grading, and (b) what is the degree of alignment across grading policies from national, provincial, and school levels. Results from this study found that there are points of alignment and misalignment related to the purpose and process of grading across system levels. Data from this study may contribute to knowledge of grades and grading in the Chinese context, and may also serve as a reference for future grading policies and grading related studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hemophilia A and B are X-linked deficiencies of coagulation factor VIII and IX respectively.  Males are affected, while females are carriers of the disease. Recently, it has become clear that more than a third of hemophilia carriers (HC) are symptomatic. Carriers may experience prolonged bleeding postpartum, following trauma and surgery as well as menorrhagia.  This is the first research to incorporate both a bleeding assessment tool, to assist in objectively quantifying severity of bleeding symptoms, as well as a validated quality of life (QoL) questionnaire to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between bleeding symptoms and QoL.&#xD;
 The objectives for this study are to validate a self-administered bleeding assessment tool (Self-BAT) as a screening tool to accurately identify HC with low factor levels (FL) and abnormal bleeding symptoms, to measure QoL of HC using the SF-36v2 and describe its relationship to bleeding severity and FL, and to investigate variability in FL. &#xD;
To date, 59 HC have been enrolled.  A positive or abnormal Self-BAT bleeding score (≥6) has a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 42%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.48 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.79 for the identification of HC with low FL. Analysis of QoL data shows an inverse correlation between QoL and BS (r=-0.52, p&lt;0.0001).  No significant relationship is observed between QoL and FL. This study found skewed X-inactivation ratio (XIR) to be significantly more prevalent in this population than has been observed in the general population.  This suggests that determination of XIR may be useful in predicting risk of deficient FL.&#xD;
This study validates the Self-BAT as an effective tool to identify HC with low FL and/or abnormal bleeding symptoms. For HC, Self-BAT BS is a more accurate measure of bleeding severity and resultant QoL than FL. HC will benefit from treatment strategies aimed at controlling bleeding symptoms which will facilitate improvements in the management of these patients overall.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Supply Chain Optimization (SCO) problem under uncertainty can be modeled as two-stage optimization problem where first-stage decisions are associated with design and development of facilities and second-stage decisions are associated with operation of the supply chain network. Recently, a robust scenario approach combing the traditional scenario or robust approach has been developed to better address uncertainties in SCO problems, and it can ensure solution feasibility and better expected objective value. But this approach can only address uncertainties bounded with the infinity-norm.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis proposes a modified robust scenario approach, which can be used to address uncertainty region bounded with the p-norm in SCO. In this case, after the normalization of the uncertainty region, the smallest box uncertainty region, that covers the normalized uncertainty region, can be partitioned into a number of box uncertainty subregions. Following some screening criteria, two subsets of the subregions that over-estimates and under-estimates the original uncertainty region can be selected. When the number of scenarios increases, the optimal objective values of the two robust scenario formulations converge to a constant, which is a good estimate of the true optimal value. This new robust scenario approach is then extended for any bounded uncertainty regions, in the context of robust optimization. &#xD;
&#xD;
In many industrial problem, the historical realizations of uncertain parameters are known. This thesis gives a preliminary discussion on a data driven robust scenario approach, where the available data are normalized and a reference box that covers the data with a certain confidence is constructed. Then, the reference box is partitioned into box-shaped uncertainty subregions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The benefits of the proposed robust scenario approach are demonstrated through some simple examples as well as an industrial SCO problem. The approach requires the solution of large-scale optimization problems when the number of scenarios is large, and these large-scale problems have a decomposable structure that can be exploited for efficient solution via decomposition-based optimization. A computational study demonstrates that, when the large-scale optimization problem is a second-order cone programming problem, generalized Benders decomposition is much faster than a state-of-the-art optimization solver.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Numerous studies suggest that social context and culture significantly impact perceptions of homosexuality. Chinese international students studying in Canada have experienced both homophobic and homo-friendly social contexts and cultures. As a result, the evolution of their perceptions toward homosexuality is interesting to study and may suggest social and educational contexts that promote more positive perceptions of homosexuals. The current research is a narrative study investigating both heterosexual male (N=3) and gay male (N=3, including the researcher) students’ perceptions of homosexuality with a focus on how their perceptions have evolved throughout their time in Canada. Both gay and heterosexual Chinese international students reported a significant evolution in their perceptions towards homosexuality since entering Canada. The evolution of participants’ perceptions towards homosexuality started with an unclear and negative perception of gay identity (i.e., beliefs that gay relationships are not faithful and gay people need to hide their identify and live heterosexual lives). Through their Canadian experiences, gay students were validated in their homosexual identity. An optimistic perception came to shape that they were able to open their identity to others, believing meaningful connections are possible to be built through open interactions. Heterosexual students also began to transition their negative perception of homosexuality to start perceiving gay individuals as normal. This normalization of homosexuality was reinforced through their school education and entire social experience.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>AarF domain containing kinases 3 and 4 (ADCK3 and ADCK4, respectively) are paralogous human mitochondrial proteins, co-orthologs of the yeast protein Coq8 and bacterial protein UbiB. These proteins are required in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q, a lipid-soluble electron carrier well known for its role in energy metabolism, more specifically in the electron transport chain. Patients with mutations in ADCK3 experience an onset of neurological disorders from childhood, including cerebellar ataxia and exercise intolerance. Mutations in ADCK4 cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, and are also associated with coenzyme Q deficiency. Aside from this minimal characterization at the biochemical level, the precise biological functions of both ADCK3 and ADCK4 remain poorly understood. After extensive screening for soluble recombinant protein expression, N-terminal fusions with maltose-binding protein were found to facilitate the overexpression of human ADCK3 and ADCK4 truncations in Escherichia coli as soluble and biologically active entities. For the first time, our work revealed Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity of ADCK3, providing strong support for the theoretical prediction of these proteins being functional atypical kinases. Subsequent experimentation confirmed protein kinase activity for both ADCK3 and ADCK4. This observed kinase activity was inhibited by the presence of an atypical N-terminal extension – containing an invariant KxGQ motif – found within the kinase domains of these proteins, suggesting an autoinhibitory role for this motif. Additionally, ADCK3 was shown, through radiometric kinase assays, to phosphorylate a peptide corresponding to a potential phosphorylation site in ATP synthase F0 subunit 8, providing insight into a potential role of this atypical kinase family.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Howard’s Pass district (HPD) of sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) Zn-Pb deposits is located in the Selwyn basin, Yukon, and comprises 14 Zn-Pb deposits that contain an estimated 28 Mt of Zn+Pb metals. Semi-massive to massive sulfide mineralization is hosted in carbonaceous and calcareous to siliceous mudstones. Host rocks to these deposits lack visual and chemical evidence of hydrothermal alteration and mineralogical haloes and, accordingly, several aspects regarding mineral deposit genesis in the HPD are poorly constrained or unconstrained. Detailed petrographic and combined electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) studies were done on pyrite and apatite to better understand the mineralizing process(es), source(s) and pathways of sulfur and the ambient marine paleoenvironment at the time of mineralization.&#xD;
Pyrite is a minor, but ubiquitous component of the host rocks and mineralization. Individual crystals or crystal aggregates of pyrite are texturally complex and show multi-stage growth. Growth stages range from syngenetic to earliest diagenesis, to early to late diagenesis, through to metamorphism; LA-ICP-MS and SIMS analyses reveal that pyrite of different textures possesses different trace element and sulfur isotope compositional ranges. Moreover, these data support a predominantly diagenetic origin for base-metal sulfide mineralization, formed from thermochemically-reduced sulfate below, or at, the sediment-water interface.&#xD;
In places, the host rocks also contain abundant apatite that occurs as fine-grained layers stratigraphically above, within, and below the SEDEX deposits. EPMA and LA-ICP-MS reveal that apatite major, minor, trace and rare earth element-yttrium (REE-Y) compositions are remarkably similar throughout the stratigraphic succession. Several REE-Y proxies for depositional conditions and comparisons among apatites with diverse origins indicate that apatite from the HPD is hydrogenous rather than hydrothermal in origin. Previous workers concluded that sustained euxinic conditions were requisite in the formation and preservation of SEDEX deposits in the HPD, but the data presented in this thesis contradict this. These data include uniformly negative Ce anomalies in apatite (i.e., suboxic phosphogenic conditions) and extremely negative sulfur isotope values in framboidal pyrite (i.e., incremental depletion of seawater sulfate in the water column did not occur). Collectively, the current research presented here has redefined the ambient environmental and genetic models for the HPD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>All programming languages need to be updated regularly by adding new features that fill programming needs. Existing approaches to determine new language features are completely manual and are based on language developers' experience, source code analysis, feature requests, and programmer interviews. Although these are acceptable practises, they are time-consuming and require a lot of brainstorming tasks, such as preparing interview questions, understanding ambiguous ideas, finding the common requirements, etc. No research, to our knowledge, has attempted to make the task of language feature identification easier. Through our research, we propose a systematic approach for identifying language features with the help of pattern and clone detection tools that work on source code. It semi-automates the task of feature identification, works quickly, and reduces the effort involved in existing practises. We identify features for the TXL language by implementing our idea and enabling the NiCAD clone detector to perform clone analysis on TXL source code, and developing a pattern detector. After detecting code patterns with the pattern detector and analyzing them, we propose eleven new features that can help improve the feature set of TXL.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study investigated the effectiveness of an intervention approach called Cognitive Strategy Instruction (CSI) that was supported with the use of graphic organizers (GOs). The intention of the research was to determine if CSI with the use of GOs could help improve the word problem solving performance of Grade 8 students experiencing difficulties in mathematics. The CSI approach incorporated instructional elements and guidelines from a Cognitive Strategy program called Solve it! (Montague, 2003). This study was conducted over 18-weeks. Three, female students participated in a 13-week group instruction. Field observations were collected during instruction to examine students’ mannerisms, such as their positive and negative responses, as well as their understanding of the material. Data were also collected from pre- and post- measures to examine students’: (a) feelings toward math problem solving; (b) knowledge, use, and control of the seven cognitive strategies and processes; and (c) performance in solving math word problems. The students participated in pre- and post- individual interviews (based on the modified MPSA-SF; Montague, 1996), as well as a pre- and post-math word problem solving quiz (based on Grade 6 EQAO assessments). &#xD;
The results indicated that students’ participation on CSI training with the support of GOs may provide potential benefits to students who struggle in math. Two of the three students improved their performance in solving one-step math word problems on the post-intervention quiz. There was also a general improvement in students’ feelings toward math problem solving and an overall improvement in their knowledge and application of the problem solving strategies. In addition, the field observations provided insight about students’ positive and negative responses during instruction, such as their engagement and motivation. This study provides educators with an instructional program to help struggling students succeed in Ontario’s math classrooms. Future research is recommended to gain further insights about the perceived benefits of CSI training with the support of GOs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Changes in river temperatures are caused by thermal energy exchanges at the interface between water and the atmosphere and between water, the streambed, and subsurface water. In permafrost regions, deeper active layer formation due to a warming climate can affect ground and channel bed thermal regimes and subsurface flow pathways. The main hypothesis is that within cold region landscapes, stream inflows into rivers provide relatively warm sources of water, while subsurface sources of water such as soil water contribute relatively cold water sources which alter the thermal and isotopic composition of the river, and as such, downstream temperature measurements can identify these sources in space and time.&#xD;
In this study, river water temperature patterns were used as primary indicators of slope water exchanges along the West River at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada (75º N, 109º W). Water temperature data was collected through detailed longitudinal surveys along the river during the 2014 recession and baseflow periods to locate surface and subsurface lateral inflows. Limited water stable isotope sampling was also undertaken at fixed stations to determine possible mixing from different water sources.&#xD;
Atmospheric factors and channel snow were found to be the main contributors to thermal variance in the river during the 2014 Summer season, with tributary inflow discharge also being a strong factor. The longitudinal temperature profiles indicate clear localized downstream changes in the thermal conditions of the river at multiple locations, and are interpreted to be indicative of subsurface and surface water exchange through inputs of cooler or warmer water. River temperature increased downstream and stable isotopic composition show progressive downstream enrichment in the two study reaches during the majority of the baseflow period, which is indicative of a culmination of localized surface flow inputs along both reaches. &#xD;
These results demonstrate some key processes that influence the thermal regime of a High Arctic river and will contribute to a greater understanding of how surface, subsurface and other water exchanges influence stream hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dual phase (α-β) Zr-Excel Pressure Tube (PT) material has been heat treated in the (α+β) or β-phase regime to generate variable microstructures. These heat-treated microstructures revealed significant modification in the inital microstructure. The microstructural changes by heat-treatment will have a profound influence on their deformation behavior; characterizing those properties is the main goal of this study. In this dissertation, the experimental results are presented in a manuscript format, which is divided in three technical chapters. Chapter 3 discusses the effect of heat treatment on texture modification; where, as received (ASR) PT materials were heated to a range of temperatures and cooled either in water or in air. It has been observed that due to the orientation relationship between α and β-phase, the ASR microstructure has been significantly altered during heating and cooling. The extent of this alteration strongly depends on the solution temperature and cooling rate. Although, variant selection is observed during texture modification, significant randomization is noticed in the room temperature texture. In Chapter 4, line profile analysis technique has been used to quantitatively analyze the microstructural details of the heat-treated materials. Diffraction pattern analyses demonstrated significant peak broadening in the heat-treated material; which is attributed due to the increase of volume fraction of martensitic α and alteration in the dislocation structures. Line profile analyses also revealed that primary α consists with large sub-grains and correlated dislocations but the martensitic α are highly dislocated. Finally in Chapter 5, thermal creep behavior of the heat treated materials has been studied. Microstructural analyses were also conducted in the pre- and post-creep materials to understand the creep mechanism. Creep anisotropy of the heat treated materials has been investigated by correlating the experimental creep data with their associated texture. The ASR PT material shows very anisotropic creep behavior due to the strong texture. However, the water-quenched-895 treatment substantially decreased the anisotropy by creating a balance between the texture and microstructure. Nevertheless, texture randomization at higher solution temperatures might have changed this balance and made the material being anisotropic again.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Geological models, including maps and 3D models, are used in geotechnical site investigation in order to contribute to the evaluation of an area.  A geological map is constructed through a complex, subjective interpretation process and represents both a data set and a conceptual geological model.  Uncertainty is associated with the data set, but also with the conceptual geological model.  This uncertainty can be considered as potential change to a set of discrete geological interpretations, here called patterns.&#xD;
Similar to the conceptual abstractions used in architecture and software engineering, geological patterns provide a means of using, organizing and transmitting information.  It is possible to recover a set of permissible patterns, a representation of a conceptual geological model, from a geological map alone.  The connections between aspects of the geological patterns called parameters and the geotechnical evaluation function can be made explicit.  The result can be used to construct a map of the relative uncertainty of the geotechnical evaluation, as a function of the uncertainty associated with the conceptual geological model.  It can also be used to map the relative effectiveness of different observation modes for constraining the geological and thus the geotechnical model.&#xD;
The analysis described here allows unprecedented consideration of where geotechnical models are uncertain and how that uncertainty can be resolved.  The generalization of geotechnical evaluation as an evaluation function allows the adaptation of this workflow to other fields of geological decision-making, such as mineral exploration and land use planning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many cell types are known to respond to the stiffness of polymeric biomaterial substrates. However, the mechanism by which cells sense this stiffness is still under investigation. Cell response to a material is believed to be mediated by the composition and/or configuration of the protein layers that adsorb to the biomaterial surfaces prior to cell contact. It is, therefore, hypothesized that polymer stiffness, and specifically, the flexibility of the polymer chains at the polymer aqueous interface, affects the composition and configuration of the adsorbed protein layer, which is responsible for influencing cell response. In this thesis, two biomaterials known to induce stiffness dependent cell responses are used as model systems to determine whether polymer chain flexibility influences cell behavior via differences in the protein adsorption. The first is an elastomer formed from an acrylated star-poly(D,L-lactide-co-ϵ-caprolactone) (ELAS) which has been shown to support higher NIH3T3 fibroblast proliferation on a less stiff version of the elastomer despite minimal differences in surface chemistry. The second is poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) which has been shown to degrade in vivo via macrophage mediated erosion at molecular weights higher than 100 kg/mol, but does not degrade at molecular weights of less than 70 kg/mol, despite no difference in surface chemistry. Quantity and viscoelastic properties of protein layers adsorbed from individual solutions of albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibronectin and vitronectin, as well as fetal serum and adult plasma supplemented environments were compared on different stiffnesses of these materials to determine whether polymer chain flexibility affects protein adsorption. Polymer stiffness was found to affect quantity and conformation of individually adsorbed protein layers as well as the composition of protein layers adsorbed from serum and plasma supplemented media. Surface adsorbed fetuin A and vitronectin were identified and proposed to be responsible for influencing fibroblast proliferation and macrophage behavior, respectively. It was concluded that the flexibility of the polymer chains at the polymer-aqueous interface affects the arrangement of water molecules at the interface and alters the entropic gain associated with protein adsorption, thus favoring the adsorption of different types and adsorbed conformation of proteins which influences the subsequent cell response to the biomaterial.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My dissertation explores the relationship between sleep and work, with attention to how sleep impacts work-related outcomes. Study 1 extended the current work stress and sleep literature by examining the reciprocal relationship between sleep and work stress within the job demands-control-social support model of work stress. The reciprocal relationship was tested using five-wave longitudinal data. This cross-lagged model was partially supported, as sleep impacted perceptions of work stress across the five wave study, whereas work stress affecting sleep was marginally significant across the five wave study.&#xD;
Study 2 examined the influence of sleep on both positive (i.e., transformational leadership) and negative (i.e., abusive supervision) leadership behaviors. I hypothesized that sleep influences leadership indirectly through its effects on self-control. To examine the indirect relationship between sleep and leadership behaviors, a daily diary study methodology was used, where leaders described their daily sleep and self-control and followers rated their leaders’ leadership behaviors. A multilevel structural equation model was used to test these mediational models. There was support for sleep affecting abusive supervision through self-control across the 15 day daily study, however this relationship was not supported for transformational leadership. &#xD;
Study 3 examined the impact of a common sleep disorder (obstructive sleep apnea; OSA) on work withdrawal behaviors. To examine this relationship, a sample of individuals attending an overnight sleep laboratory, with possible OSA were recruited. A within-subjects, pre-test, post-test design was used, where individuals completed a survey before and then two times after they received clinical treatment for their sleep disorder. Latent growth curve modeling was used to test this relationship. Findings show that daytime sleepiness caused by OSA effects withdrawal from work (partial absenteeism and absenteeism). Daytime sleepiness also lead to withdrawal at work (work neglect) through cognitive depletion. In addition, receiving treatment for sleep apnea decreased daytime sleepiness across time, and this improvement in daytime sleepiness resulted in decreased withdrawal from and at work over time; the indirect effects of the improvements in daytime sleepiness on withdrawal at work was mediated by improvements in cognitive depletion. &#xD;
The dissertation closes with a general discussion of the contributions of these three studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The phosphorylation of the sensor-checkpoint Rad9A is essential for Chk1 activation in S-phase and during the G2/M checkpoints. Previous studies have demonstrated a late phosphorylation of Rad9A after DNA damage. Rad9A late phosphorylation requires the previous phosphorylation of S387, and it is not detected when Rad9A is overexpressed. Since Rad9A and TopBP1 interact through a phosphorylated S387 for ATR activation, it has been hypothesized that the late, damage-dependent phosphorylation on Rad9A is part of a positive feedback loop involved in checkpoint maintenance. This thesis shows that Rad9A is hyperphosphorylated and accumulates in cells exposed to DNA damage, and that this prevents Rad9A polyubiquitination and degradation. This work also shows that Rad9A polyubiquitination and degradation is observed in cells recovering from DNA damage, and that there are active processes regulating Rad9A degradation. This research further shows that Chk1 is required for the stabilization and accumulation of Rad9A after DNA damage, and that there is a positive feedback loop involving Rad9A and Chk1.  Rad9A acetylation is observed in conjunction with polyubiquitination, and Rad9A deacetylation following DNA damage prevents Rad9A polyubiquitination and degradation. This work also shows evidence of Brca1 and Rad9A association at the time of Rad9A polyubiquitination and degradation suggesting a Brca1 involvement in this process. In summary, this thesis shows a new positive feedback loop between Rad9A and Chk1 for checkpoint maintenance and the stabilization of Rad9A through its deacetylation following DNA damage to prevent Rad9A polyubiquitination and degradation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Metal-based laser additive manufacturing techniques such as selective laser melting offer unique capabilities in the manufacture of geometrically complex metal components. The ability of these techniques to fabricate unique part designs of high-strength metals is of great interest to advanced engineering sectors such as aerospace, automotive, biomedical, dental, and defense. Despite the advantages offered by these processes, online quality assurance and process control still remain major challenges limiting the widespread adoption of these techniques. In this thesis a low-coherence interferometric imaging technique, termed inline coherent imaging (ICI), is integrated into the selective laser melting process to monitor melt pool morphology changes and stability at 200 kHz with axial and transverse resolutions reaching 6 µm and 35 µm respectively. Powder layer, processed track, and layer quality are assessed in situ using ICI.&#xD;
&#xD;
ICI-based imaging of single track processing of 316L stainless steel powder was investigated under a range of process parameters to determine the influence of processing conditions on melt pool morphological stability. Process parameter spaces involving 40-320 W laser powers; 50-600 mm/s scan speeds; 50-500 µm layer thicknesses; and supported and unsupported build environments were investigated. Galvanometer-based scanning of the imaging spot relative to the melt pool presented a unique perspective of the melt pool local geometry, undetectable by existing thermal-based imaging techniques. High-speed, time-resolved ICI measurements demonstrated that melt pool fluctuations and morphological stability strongly influence final track quality. Process defects resulting from poor process parameter regimes were detected and characteristic fault signatures were identified. Building on the success of ICI in monitoring single track processing, an ICI-integrated 3D-capable selective laser melting system was designed and constructed. System imaging and processing capabilities are characterized, and layer-wise ICI measurements of powder bed and processed layers taken during a 3D build are presented. Results presented throughout this work demonstrate the potential benefits ICI offers laser additive processes: layer-wise quality assurance measurements, morphology-based feedback control signals, improved parameter space optimization processes, and reductions in overall build times.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The number of Lyme disease cases in Ontario has increased in the last decade and is projected to continue to increase due to climate change.  The northern limit of Lyme disease cases in Ontario has also been progressing northward from the United States.  It is unknown whether the increase in Lyme disease cases is due to climate change, changes in host abundance, host and vector migration, or a combination of these factors.  The objective of this research is to determine if the climate has changed to increase the geographic range of areas suitable for sustaining a reproductive tick population.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Monthly air surface temperature values from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s North American Regional Reanalysis was used to yield positive degree days above 0 degrees Celsius from 1979 to 2013 and derive warming trends in Ontario.  Next, the average of monthly mean day and monthly mean night time land surface temperature from MODIS were fed in to a basic reproductive tick population model to determine areas with climate suitable for sustaining tick populations.   Principal components analysis was conducted to determine changing suitability patterns.  The model outputs were compared against tick surveillance data supplied by Public Health Ontario from 2002 to 2012.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Areas in Ontario were identified where Lyme disease risk has become suitable for sustaining a black-legged tick population due to climate change, particularly in 2005, and 2010 - 2012.  This study shows that climate has allowed black-legged tick populations to sustainably move northward in the past decade.  However, the vast majority of submitted ticks were collected by health practitioners in geographic locations that were already suitable for sustaining a reproductive tick population.  This suggests that most Lyme disease cases in the past decade have been due to the tick population stabilizing in areas of suitability, or increased human-tick interaction in areas already suitable, rather than progression of ticks into new geographic areas due to climate change.&#xD;
This analysis supports climate change models that indicate Lyme disease risk will continue to move northward and also provides high resolution Lyme disease risk maps.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Polyvinyl acetate and other polyvinyl esters, and their copolymers are used in coatings, adhesives and plastics, and hence fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and polymerization kinetics is vital for process development, and production of existing and new polymer grades in an effective and safe manner. The propagation kinetics of radical homopolymerization (bulk) of vinyl acetate (VAc), vinyl pivalate (VPi) and vinyl benzoate (VBz) was studied using Pulsed-Laser Polymerization coupled with Size Exclusion Chromatography (PLP-SEC) at laser pulse repetition rate (prr) between 2 and 500 Hz, and the temperature range of 25 - 90 °C. The propagation rate coefficient, kp, determined for VAc and VPi increases significantly with prr (20 % between 200 and 500 Hz prr), with the kp value for VPi ~50 % higher than that of VAc. This significant increase in kp with prr has been explained by the head-to-head addition defects that occur during vinyl ester polymerizations. For VBz, no kp value was reported due to lack of PLP-structure, likely due to resonance stabilization of the radical. Solution polymerization of VAc and VPi was also studied by PLP-SEC using ethyl acetate (EAc) and heptane (50 % by volume) at 50 °C, with the kp values having no substantial solvent effect. The polymerization kinetics of these vinyl ester monomers were also investigated using small-scale batch polymerization at 60 °C both in bulk and in solution (using EAc). The monomer conversion profiles obtained showed the same pattern in both bulk and solution, with the rate of conversion faster for VAc than VBz, and VPi even faster, trends consistent with the kp values determined using PLP-SEC. Kinetic models were implemented in the Predici software package, and are shown to fit the experimental batch polymerization data reasonably well.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>While studies of mesic tundra vegetation types across latitudinal gradients have shown decreasing levels of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide at more northern sites, little work has explored the factors regulating NEE in the polar semi-desert, a vegetation type which is widely distributed across the High Arctic. In 2013, eight ADC Automated Carbon Exchange (ACE) systems were deployed at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) to quantify the contribution of the polar semi-desert vegetation type to landscape-scale NEE. As polar semi-desert vegetation cover varies at relatively small spatial scales, the chambers were distributed between vegetated areas (18-51% cover) and bare soil. Measurements were made every 30 minutes from late May to late July. Air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture measurements were collected in conjunction with NEE and ecosystem respiration (Re). In July 2013, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were collected to quantify variability in vegetation cover within the polar semi-desert. NDVI varied from -0.12 to 0.31, with the highest values occurring at vegetated sites and low values occurring on bare soil. Percent vegetation cover and NDVI correlated well at peak biomass (R2 = 0.96).&#xD;
NEE is driven by variability of several biophysical factors, and the factors that best predict NEE vary throughout the season. In the early season, respiration drives NEE, and air temperature is the strongest predictor (R2 = 0.23 to 0.55). During the warmer part of the season, photosynthesis is the dominant component of NEE, and photosynthetically active radiation becomes the best predictor. Results suggest that once a threshold temperature is reached photosynthesis will dominate NEE in polar semi-desert vegetation types. Therefore, longer growing seasons, if associated with higher temperatures, would enhance NEE. These relationships may be useful for quantifying NEE in polar semi-deserts using remotely-sensed data in future studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rapid diagnosis of pathogens requires the ability to detect the presence of a target pathogen in a sample at as low concentrations as possible. In the present thesis, a surface-based method that can provide early and label-free detection of target microorganisms in water is presented. The method combines three key features, namely, (a) accelerated transportation to, and focusing of bacteria on, the detection surface by means of alternating current (AC) electrokinetic effects; (b) selective capture of the target microorganism using surface-immobilized antibodies; (c) sensitive detection of target bacteria with micro-Raman spectroscopy. The non-uniform electric field is created by an AC signal-driven planar, quadrupolar, gold microelectrode array that is deposited on the detection surface (oxidized silicon wafer). The combined effects of AC electroosmosis and dielectrophoresis concentrated the bacteria onto a surface within a few minutes. Bacterial detection is subsequently, accomplished through Raman spectra acquired at pre-determined locations near the electrodes after sample removal and rinsing of the capture surface. Detection was successful at concentrations as low as 102 bacteria/mL using a sample volume of 50 μL. The method is sensitive enough to detect the capture of a single bacterium. &#xD;
The bacterial capture efficiency was found to be strongly dependent on the selection of the applied voltage and AC frequency values. Tests performed in the range 1-20 Vpp and 1 kHz-1 MHz showed that the most effective operating conditions was (12 Vpp, 10 kHz). Overall, high bacteria capture efficiencies were observed at low frequencies (≤10 kHz). &#xD;
The mechanism of bacteria capture was investigated with the aid of numerical simulations. It was found that the capture efficiency was very high under electric field conditions that cause a strong AC electroosmotic effect. The simulations results were in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Alginate-based amphiphilic graft copolymers were synthesized by single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP), forming stable micelles during polymerization induced self-assembly (PISA). First, alginate macroinitiator was prepared by partial depolymerization of native alginate, solubility modification and attachment of initiator. Then, methyl methacrylate was polymerized from the alginate macroinitiator in mixtures of water and methanol forming poly(methyl methacrylate) grafts, prior to self-assembly. PISA of the amphiphilic graft-copolymer resulted in the formation of micelles with diameters of 50-300 nm. As the first reported case of LRP from alginate, this work introduces a synthetic route to of alginate-based hybrid polymers with a precise macromolecular architecture and desired functionalities. LRP from alginate can be applied to improve alginate-based hydrogel systems such as nano- and micro-hydrogel particles, islet encapsulation materials, hydrogel implants and topical applications. Such modified alginates can also improve the function and application of native alginates in food and agricultural technologies. &#xD;
Targeted drug delivery using polymeric nanostructures has been at the forefront of cancer research engineered for safer, more efficient and effective use of chemotherapy. Here, a new polymeric micelle delivery system was designed for active tumor targeting via receptor-induced endocytosis. Oseltamivir phosphate targets and inhibits Neu1 sialidase activity associated with receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors which are overexpressed on cancer cells. By decorating micelles with oseltamivir, it was found that micelles actively targeted human pancreatic PANC1 cancer cells. Amphiphilic block copolymers with oseltamivir conjugated at the hydrophilic end, oseltamivir-poly(polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate), were synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) living radical polymerization. Oseltamivir-conjugated micelles have self-assembling properties forming worm-like micellar structures. Oseltamivir-conjugated micelles dose dependently reduced the cell viability of PANC1 cells compared to micelles without oseltamivir. Oseltamivir-micelles loaded with hydrophobic dye produced internalization by PANC1. These results clearly indicate that oseltamivir-conjugated micelles show potential as an entirely new active tumor targeting drug delivery system with the ability to internalize hydrophobic chemotherapeutics by receptor-mediated endocytosis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A non-hydrostatic phase-resolving wave model is used to investigate wave transformation and energy dissipation due to wave breaking over different small and large scale morphological features.  Simulations of waves in the nearshore region of a sandy beach at the Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, North Carolina (NC) were conducted to evaluate the Simulating WAves til SHore (SWASH) model ability to predict wave transformation and breaking in a high resolution 3-dimensional configuration for four moderate wave events. The model is forced with directional wave spectra from an acoustic wave sensor at the boundary of the computational domain, and validated with three acoustic sensors and water surface elevation observations from a LIDAR scanner mounted on the beach dune. Results indicate the model is able to accurately predict significant wave heights, spectral evolution, and energy dissipation due to wave breaking in the nearshore. This research shows that small-scale morphological features including shore-parallel bars, rip channels, and a large-scale feature corresponding to scour depression under the pier have a strong impact on the rate of wave energy dissipation and location of breaking in the surf zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
The validated model is applied to four additional field sites in NC to determine the influence shore-oblique bars have on wave transformation and the alongshore variability in wave energy. Two sites with shore-oblique sandbars, and two beaches with straight contours were simulated with SWASH. The results indicate that higher alongshore variability in depth due to the shore-oblique bars causes large alongshore changes in cross-shore wave energy flux. This work shows that shore-oblique bars, known to be spatially correlated with areas of high shoreline change rates, introduce high alongshore variability in nearshore wave energy that could be the primary driver of changes in sediment transport rates and induce localized erosional hotspots on the shoreline.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation, a companion to the documentary film Planting Stories, Feeding Communities, explores how film can be used to transmit information generated by an Indigenous community during research and return it in a manner that most closely approximates the multi-sensorial scope of the oral tradition. Of all modern forms of communication, I argue that film is the medium that lies closest to the mode of Indigenous storytelling. My dissertation explores film as a means of reporting findings back to the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation, whose members played key roles in the history of Native Studies in Ontario – hitherto the focus of my MA research. Throughout, the most pertinent question has remained: What are the “best practices” – under the current circumstances – that can be put in place to ensure that colonial approaches, imposition of harmful outside authority foremost of all, are not perpetuated? &#xD;
Bridging the gulf between my Indigenous and European ancestry requires a leap of faith from both sides. Lee Maracle, a writer of the Stó:lō Nation, describes the dilemma as “a basket in the middle of the bridge into which each side can contribute their accumulated light and teachings” (SAGE Writing Retreat, February 22, 2014). My contribution to the basket, I trust, is acceptance of a number of best practices revealed through collaborative research, which might contribute to increased transmission of academic findings to Indigenous communities. &#xD;
Procedures rooted in community-based participatory research (CBPR) offer an array of best practices that proved pivotal to maintaining a balanced relationship between the researcher and those who are researched, ensuring that (as much as possible) control of the process rests with the community. Members of Six Nations expressed their opinions on camera in (i) a Community Circle and (ii) interviews with the key subjects. Subsequently, we collaborated to create a film to tell their story. “Best practices,” therefore, highlight ways in which film as a means of pedagogy can be used to transmit information to Indigenous communities in a manner that resembles and echoes the oral tradition.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although the role of context in various aspects of medical education has been highlighted as an area needing further research, to date few studies have explored how contextual factors shape feedback interactions within various clinical settings. Consequently, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how contextual factors shape feedback interactions within and across various clinical settings. In particular, this study explored the nature of feedback in inpatient and outpatient Pediatrics clinical settings from attendings’ and residents’ perspectives. Three research questions guided this study: (a) What are residents’ and attendings’ conceptions of feedback? (b) What contextual factors shape the nature of feedback interactions between residents and attendings? and (c) Which types of feedback interactions, if any, may be classified as dialogic feedback processes? &#xD;
An embedded single case-study design was used to study feedback interactions in four Pediatrics clinical settings (i.e., Ward, NICU, Ambulatory Clinic, and General Pediatrics Clinics). Direct observations, interviews, and researcher memos served as data sources. Twelve Pediatrics physicians participated in the study including four residents and eight attendings. Data analysis involved a three-step process of data analysis and presentation that used coding techniques (i.e., open coding and axial coding) from Strauss and Corbin’s (1990) approach to Grounded Theory coupled with situational mapping from Adele Clarke’s (2003) Situational Analysis.&#xD;
	Findings suggest scheduling constraints, physical space, trusting relationships, and residents’ and attendings’ behaviours are contextual factors that can impact feedback interactions. Key contributions of this research include: (a) highlighting the relationships among forms of feedback, embedded feedback strategies, and existing models of feedback in medical education; (b) exploring the role of physical space as a possible barrier to feedback; (c) highlighting that residents may have narrower conceptions of feedback than attendings; (d) highlighting the distinction between practices related to structured and embedded feedback; (e) suggesting that due to constraints within different clinical settings, there is space for all models of feedback to coexist to support residents’ competence development; and (f) filling a gap in Pratt and colleagues’ (2006) study that highlighted how various contextual factors influenced residents’ competence development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent interest in organizational justice and disability management has resulted in this thesis, the purpose of which was to examine the relationship between perceived organizational justice and return to work (RTW).  Three studies were conducted to this end. First, a scoping study mapped current literature and identified gaps in the justice and RTW literature. Secondly, a phenomenological study was conducted with 12 injured workers in a RTW program to examine their “lived experience” of justice and to identify emergent themes around justice and RTW. Finally, a quantitative study was conducted with injured workers who were participating in RTW programs to determine the relationship between organizational justice, organizational support and RTW outcomes. &#xD;
The scoping study identified 14 justice/RTW articles that were reflected within three themes: claims, RTW interventions and outcomes. The scoping study demonstrated that there was very little research examining justice and RTW and that it was important to continue to explore this area. The phenomenological study revealed in five major themes: consistency of treatment of injured workers; accommodation equals fair treatment; outcomes of fair treatment; intensity of injured worker response; and support and 5 subthemes related to the experience of justice.  The results of the quantitative study demonstrated that justice is positively correlated with job satisfaction, affective commitment and support, while being negatively correlated with intent to withdraw. Justice had no correlation with continuance commitment or duration. Support was positively correlated with job satisfaction and affective commitment, but not correlated with continuance commitment, intent to withdraw or duration.  Further hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that support mediates the effect of justice on job satisfaction and affective commitment. Justice accounts for ten percent of the variance in intent to withdraw. &#xD;
The results of the thesis show that justice is an important psychosocial factor to consider in RTW. Consideration is also given to how the results of these studies add to both social exchange theory; a major theory within the justice literature, and the disability management literature. This thesis provides recommendations for practice and future scholarship.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Biodegradable microspheres have been extensively studied for controlled and minimally invasive in situ protein delivery. Their small size and thus ready injectability makes this device extremely popular for localized administration, which is particularly advantageous for protein delivery applications. In this study, amphiphilic low melting biodegradable tri-block copolymers of PEG, ε-caprolactone and glycolide monomers were synthesized using bulk ring-opening polymerization (ROP). The design and characterization of this biodegradable copolymer was focused on the formation of microspheres for localized, controlled delivery of the therapeutic chemokine protein SDF-1α. Molecular weight and compositional changes were used to tailor the thermal properties of the copolymers so that the produced materials were solid at room temperature but had minimum crystallinity after hydration at 37 °C. A complete degradation was achieved for the copolymers studied within eight weeks with minor acidic degradation effect on the external and internal microenvironment pH of the microspheres. The copolymers exhibited great ability for microsphere formation with high protein encapsulation efficiency (≥75%) using an electrospraying technique. Prolonged release of SDF-1α was observed with its bioactivity well retained after encapsulation and release, as analysed using cell-based assays.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Transcriptional responses to stressors are typically measured as changes in mRNA levels, despite a broad awareness that transcript levels do not equate to transcription rates. I was able to use goldfish (Carassius auratus) to assess the impact of a single exercise bout on transcription and transcript levels by measuring unprocessed mRNA (pre-mRNA) and mature mRNA levels for critical bioenergetics genes in red and white muscle tissue.  I examined housekeeping genes (β-actin: BACT and tubulin: TUB) and select genes for mitochondrial metabolism (citrate synthase: CS and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4-1: COX4-1), and hexokinase II: HXK. In red muscle, I found that the transcript level for mitochondrial genes (CS and COX4-1) and the housekeeping gene BACT does not change significantly regardless of exercise intensity, but that there is an increase in pre-mRNA levels for these genes at the highest exercise intensity. HXK mRNA showed complex patterns. The mature HXK mRNA increased after a 3 h bout of exercise at the highest exercise intensity (in red and white muscle) but only in recovery after exhaustive exercise in white muscle. The increases in HXK pre-mRNA occurred following exercise and after recovery (in red muscle) and after a period of recovery (in white muscle). In red muscle, exercise didn’t increase the mRNA for any gene within a recovery period of 1 h, except exercise at 80% Ucrit. Analysis of white muscle tissue after a 3 h bout of exercise indicated that there was no change in COX4-1 mRNA post exercise or after recovery, a slight decrease in BACT mRNA after recovery, a significant increase in CS mRNA after recovery and a significant increase in HXK mRNA post exercise. Overall, I found that: the levels of pre-mRNA changed more dramatically than did mature mRNA, the greatest changes occurred at the highest exercise intensity, the increases were mainly seen in recovery rather than during exercise, and there was a greater response in the pathways and tissues that are recruited during the exercise activity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>RATIONALE: Work absences due to depression are prevalent, suggesting the need for interventions addressing the challenges facing people returning to work following depression. Few such interventions have been developed and evaluated. Cognitive work hardening is a return-to-work intervention for people on mental health disability leaves. Anecdotal evidence supports its use for individuals returning to work following a depressive episode; however, it has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to: 1) examine the theoretical underpinnings of cognitive work hardening; 2) test the effectiveness of cognitive work hardening in preparing people to return to work following a depressive episode; and 3) identify key elements of cognitive work hardening based on participants’ experiences. METHODS: Intervention mapping was used to analyze cognitive work hardening by deconstructing it into fundamental elements and theoretical underpinnings including occupational therapy models. Intervention effectiveness was assessed with a single group (n = 21) pre-post study design. Participants reported their return to work readiness using work ability, fatigue, and depression measures. Participants shared their experience at intervention completion and at 3-month follow-up. Work status and sense of well-being were also reported at follow-up. RESULTS: The Person-Environment-Occupation (PEO) Model, the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E), and the Canadian Model of Client-Centred Enablement (CMCE) emerged as occupational therapy models underlying cognitive work hardening. Self-reported work ability, fatigue, and depression severity significantly improved from pre to post intervention. At follow-up, most participants were off disability with 76% either working or engaged in other meaningful occupation. Main gains were reported in routine, work stamina, self-confidence, cognitive abilities, and coping strategies. Participants identified structure, work simulations, realism of simulated work environment, support, and education as key intervention elements. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive work hardening shows promise as a return-to-work intervention following a depressive episode. Participation in cognitive work hardening improved participants’ self-reported work readiness with positive work status and well-being at 3-month follow-up. Findings inform the fields of return-to-work and occupational therapy by offering an occupationally-focused return-to-work intervention with the potential for wider adoption and improved health outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The pannexin-1 (panx1) hemichannel is associated with the Nod-Like Receptor Protein-1 (NLRP1) inflammasome following MCAO in a mouse model of focal ischaemic stroke.  We investigated how blocking panx1 using probenecid affects post-stroke neuroinflammation and the formation of the NLRP1 inflammasome complex.  We first investigated the expression levels of panx1, NLRP1 and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) using semi-quantitative Western blotting of brain tissue lysates.  We investigated the presence of a spatial distribution overlap between NLRP1 and panx1 using confocal microscopy on acute brain slices taken from the brains of mice that had had strokes.  To determine whether or not NLRP1 and panx1 for a direct protein-protein interaction, we also performed co-immunoprecipitation on brain tissue lysates collected from mice that had been given strokes.  &#xD;
	We make several key findings.  The first is that the normalized optical density of IL-1β Western blot bands were increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the post-stroke brain relative to the contralateral one (n=6; meanODipsilateral=0.94±0.1; meanODcontralateral=0.81±0.1; p=0.04).  Further, we found that the normalized OD of NLRP1 Western blot bands was also increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere relative to the non-ischaemic hemisphere (n=6 per hemisphere; meanODipsilateral=0.27±0.05; meanODcontralateral =0.21±0.04; p=0.04).  Band optical densities for panx1 protein did not differ between hemispheres of mice given strokes. Importantly, probenecid attenuated the interhemispheric difference between IL-1β and NLRP1 levels after stroke, displaying an anti-inflammatory effect in the post-stroke brain.  We performed co-immunoprecipitation o brain tissue lysates from mice that had strokes and found that NLRP1 did not coimmunoprecipitate with panx1. We draw the conclusion that they do not form a direct protein-protein interaction in acute stroke.  Confocal imaging revealed demonstrated an overlap in the spatial distribution patterns of pannexin-1 and NLRP1 that occurred after stroke, but only in ischaemic tissue.  The results of Western blot protein quantification studies, co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging together suggest that panx1 and NLRP1 are related by function but not by a direct protein-protein relationship. &#xD;
	The anti-inflammatory effects of probenecid that we observed make it an attractive target for future studies on the prevention of post-ischaemic brain damage after stroke.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The physical configuration of water distribution systems is closely tied to the layout of the urban areas they serve. Over the last century, urban areas in North America have changed significantly in design, moving from high-density grid-based neighbourhoods to low-density suburban developments. The objective of this thesis is to examine the impact of urban form on the energy use in water distribution systems. This relationship was investigated at the neighbourhood-level through an energy analysis of scenarios characterized by different street topologies and population densities. The results suggest that gridiron neighbourhoods have lower energy requirements than warped parallel or cul-de-sac/loop neighbourhoods because their networks are highly connected. Gridiron neighbourhoods also have lower irrigation requirements due to their native high population densities, resulting in lower pumping energy requirements. &#xD;
&#xD;
The link between long-term urban development and energy use was investigated at the city-level through an energy analysis of a real-world, complex water distribution system. The system's three pressure zones corresponded well with areas from different periods of development, with distinctly different urban form characteristics. An energy balance approach was used to quantify the operating energy inputs and outputs for each of the system's pressure zones. The results suggest that there is an increasingly large "energy penalty" associated with expanding the city's urban fringe due to the sharp increase in ground elevation moving away from the water source. An alternative development scenario was also investigated, where instead of expanding outward, an existing urban area was intensified through an increase in population density. The results suggest that intensification can contribute to significant energy savings because more of the system's overall demand is met nearer to the water source, at lower elevation. Although the results obtained from this analysis are specific to the case study system, the general trends identified in the study can be relevant to other systems with similar characteristics, and could be used to guide future urban development plans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the last two decades, the study of transnational corporations (TNCs) and other non-state actors has gained an undisputed momentum in the fields of International Political Economy (IPE) and global governance, thus challenging realist notions of the state as the main actor in International Relations (IR). This dissertation argues that along with this paradigm shift, IPE and global governance scholars have increasingly understated the role that sate actors –especially those from the global south– play within global governance structures. My dissertation undertakes an in-depth examination of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a voluntary global governance initiative launched in 2002, which aims to foster transparency in the oil, gas and mining sectors. The dissertation asks why some African states have complied with the EITI requirements, while others have not. I focus on the primary cases of Ghana and Gabon, two key illustrations of oil-rich African countries that have, in respective order, complied with, and failed to comply with, the EITI Standard. To explain this puzzle, dominant theories in African Politics and in IR focus on 1) “good” or “bad” governance within host states as an aid or challenge to compliance; 2) corporate behaviour as a hindrance, or as a boost, to host state compliance; or on 3) the voluntary nature of the initiative as a challenge to compliance. Based on in-person interviews and participant observations from fieldwork, as well as extensive primary document analysis, I argue that African postcolonial states, through their continued negotiations for equality in the current world order, place a top value on their sovereignty, which affects their behaviour on the global stage. My argument theorizes the role of postcolonial states in global governance, and addresses limitations in the extant literature, which I suggest is marked by both a technocratic and Eurocentric approach to the study of voluntary regulation. My analysis draws upon Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL) scholarship and de-colonial critiques of IR, to unpack the design and governance process of the EITI, as well as its implementation in Gabon and Ghana. The analysis also considers South Africa’s non-adherence to the EITI, in order to further make sense of findings in Ghana and Gabon. This dissertation has key implications for the relevance of contemporary IR theory in explaining postcolonial state behaviour in the international system, and points to the need to recognize the active role that postcolonial states play in shaping global governance structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by the malfunctioning β-Hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme, for which there is no current treatment. HexA is composed of two similar, non-identical subunits, the alpha and the beta, which must interact with the GM2 activator protein, a substrate-specific co-factor, to hydrolyze GM2 gangliosides. Mutations in either subunit (or the activator) result in the development of GM2 gangliosidoses due to the toxic accumulation of GM2 gangliosides, within the neurons of the central nervous system. The resulting neuronal death induces the primary symptoms of the disease; motor and sensory impairments, and seizures. The aim of this study was to observe the long-term in vivo effects of an innovative gene therapy treatment method in a Sandhoff (β-subunit deficient) mouse model. The treatment utilized a new engineered variant of Hexosaminidase isoenzyme, HexM, which is formed by the homodimerization of a modified human Hex α-subunit called Hex µ, which contains critical beta-components that allow it to form stable homodimers and interact with the GM2 activator protein to reduce substrate storage. We tested this scAAV vector expressing HexM through intravenous injections of the neonatal mice.  Previous work on a systemic gene therapy treatment saw drastic increases in lifespan to approximately 43 weeks in the Sandhoff mice using a beta-subunit treatment. We monitored one cohort for 8 weeks and another cohort long-term (&gt;40 weeks) for biochemical, behavioural and molecular analyses. Through the enzymatic and GM2 ganglioside lipid analyses, we observed that with a slight non-significant increase in enzyme activity, there is a significant decrease in the storage of GM2 gangliosides. On behavioural tests, the treated mice outperform their knockout age matched controls and perform similarly to the heterozygous controls. While the untreated controls were humanely euthanized by 16 weeks, the treated animals have survived significantly longer, to an average of 41 weeks. The molecular analyses revealed a slightly variable distribution of the vector between brain and spinal cord regions. In conclusion, the neonatal delivery of our newly synthesized viral vector expressing HexM to the Sandhoff mice provided long-term correction of the disease. This study will have implications not only for treatment of Sandhoff disease, but also Tay-Sachs disease (α- subunit deficiency).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The main goal of the thesis is to develop strategies for the fed-batch production of medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (MCL-PHA) by Pseudomonas putida KT2440 from decanoic acid (DA) co-feeding with glucose (G). Since decanoic acid is poorly water soluble and a solid at room temperature, two methods were tested to maintain it as a liquid by either mixing it with acetic acid (AA) or heating it to feed into the bioreactor. Exponentially feeding the carbon substrates at a ratio of 3:3:4 of DA:AA:G at a specific growth rate (µ) of 0.15 h-1 resulted in 26 g L-1 biomass containing 57% PHA. The final PHA composition was 74 mol% 3-hydroxydecanoate (3HD), 14 mol% 3-hydroxyoctanoate (3HO) and 12 mol% 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx). As the ratio of DA:AA:G increased from 3:3:4 to 5:1:4, 50% higher biomass and 73% higher PHA were obtained. An even higher biomass concentration of 75 g L-1 containing 74% PHA was achieved by applying the same specific growth rate followed by constant substrate feeding strategy. Heating decanoic acid without acetic acid was performed as a control experiment at feeding ratio of DA:G (1:1) resulting in a final higher biomass of  41 g L-1 but containing only 58% PHA.&#xD;
A fadB and fadA knockout mutant of P. putida KT2440 named P. putida DBA-F1was constructed to increase the fraction of the dominant monomer (3HD) in PHA by limiting the fatty acid β-oxidation activity. Using a feeding ratio of decanoic acid and acetic acid (DAA) to glucose (G) (6:4) at specific growth rate of 0.15 h-1, significantly different monomeric composition (97% 3HD:3% 3HO) but a lower biomass (8.5 g L-1) and PHA concentrations (3.5 g L-1) were obtained compared to the wild type. The performance could be improved at a feeding ratio of DAA:G of 2:8, leading to 18 g L-1 biomass containing 100% poly(3-hydroxydecanoate) (PHD). MCL-PHA with enriched 3HD monomers could also be obtained using acrylic acid (Aa) as a chemical inhibitor of the β-oxidation pathway by P. putida KT2440. At a ratio of DAA:G:Aa (6:4:0.2), 21 g L-1 MCL-PHA with 84 mol% 3HD was produced.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spreading depression (SD) occurs as a slowly propagating wave of neural inactivity and plays an important role in both the vertebrate and invertebrate CNS.  Mammalian SD is associated with human pathologies such as migraine, stroke and traumatic brain injury while SD in the insect nervous system is involved in environmental stress-induced neural shutdown. Despite obvious differences in the design of the vertebrate and invertebrate CNS evidence suggests that the cellular mechanisms underlying mammalian and insect SD are conserved. In my thesis I investigated mechanisms of SD in the CNS of Locusta migratoria and demonstrate its occurrence in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster. I show that increases in neural activity heighten susceptibility to SD while reductions in activity are inhibiting, demonstrating that SD in the locust is strongly dependent on existing levels of neural activity.  Additionally, my work demonstrated that glial cells play a critical role during locust SD.  I show that treatments that inhibit glial spatial buffering or that disrupt the perineurial cells (specialized glia) of the blood-brain barrier exacerbate SD. Moreover, I found that SD induced under hypotonic conditions was associated with shorter latencies to onset, greater ionic disturbances and faster propagation rates compared to SD induced under hypertonic conditions. The results suggest that hypotonic-induced cell swelling promotes the accumulation of extracellular K+ ions ultimately promoting SD initiation. Indeed, reducing the accumulation of extracellular K+, either by limiting cell swelling or by inhibition of voltage-gated K+ channels, was found to protect against SD development. Lastly, I demonstrate that SD can be reliably induced and monitored in the brain of Drosophila melanogster. I characterized fly SD and show that different genetic strains vary in their vulnerability to the ionic disturbance. Overall, the results from my locust experiments led to a better characterization of invertebrate SD which was important at substantiating previously proposed models.  My work also expanded on the comparative similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate SD providing further evidence that insect SD is a useful model for mammalian SD. Furthermore, I provided a new model system, the fly brain, on which control mechanisms involved in SD can be genetically dissected.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is well established that exercise is an efficacious method for the management of abdominal obesity; however, the optimal amount and intensity of exercise that is required to combat obesity remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the separate effects of exercise amount and intensity on abdominal and whole body adipose tissue in adults who are abdominally obese. &#xD;
One-hundred eight participants who were previously sedentary and had abdominal obesity were randomized into one of 4 groups: Control (n=21 (10 females)), low amount, low intensity (LALI) (180 kcal/session for females and 300 kcal/session for males at 50% VO2peak, n= 25 (15 females)) high amount, low intensity (HALI) (360 kcal/session for females and 600 kcal/session for males at 50% VO2peak, n=32 (21 females)), or high amount, high intensity (HAHI) (360 kcal/session for females and 600 kcal/session for males at 75% VO2peak n=30 (19 females)). Participants performed supervised exercise 5 times/wk for 24 wks. Daily dietary logs were completed throughout the intervention and unstructured physical activity was monitored using accelerometers. Change in total and abdominal adipose tissue (AT) and skeletal muscle mass was measured via magnetic resonance imaging. &#xD;
Exercise duration in minutes was 32 (SD, 4.8) for LALI, 58 (SD, 6.6) for HALI, and 40 (SD, 6.7) for HAHI. There was no difference in unstructured physical activity change and there was no difference in the adherence to prescribed diets between groups. Reductions in VAT was greater in LALI (-0.5 kg; SE, 0.1; p=0.001), HALI (-0.5 kg; SE, 0.1; p&lt;0.001), and in HAHI (-0.5 kg; SE, 0.1; p&lt;0.001) compared to control but did not differ between the exercise groups p&gt;0.139. Reductions in total AT, SAT, total abdominal AT, abdominal SAT, weight and waist circumference was also greater in all exercise groups compared to control (p&lt;0.002) but did not differ between groups (p&gt;0.05). &#xD;
These findings indicate that there is an intensity and amount independent reduction in adipose tissue depots with exercise with a preservation of skeletal muscle mass, which highlights that there are several exercise treatment options for the management of abdominal obesity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This essay is a case study of the imperial cult as it manifested in the city of Tarraco in Roman Spain. It begins with a discussion of what the imperial cult itself was and how it developed, through a look at the precedents for the cult and its origins starting from the death of Julius Caesar. The origin of the imperial cult in Spain specifically is then discussed. The architectural evidence for the cult is then examined. There is a focus on the location and dating of a municipal altar and temple, as well as the provincial temple, which has been the subject of scholarly debate for decades. Finally there is a study of the flamines or priests of Tarraco. This is done through the use of epigraphic evidence to discuss what patterns there were in the career of the flamines to gain an understanding of the type of citizen who gained this role, through their family history (if applicable) and the cursus honorum that they followed through their life.</dcterms:abstract>
