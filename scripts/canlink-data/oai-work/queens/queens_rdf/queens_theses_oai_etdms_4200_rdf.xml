      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is centered around particular Calabi-Yau threefolds. Borcea \cite{Borcea} and Voisin \cite{Voisin} construct Calabi-Yau threefolds using elliptic curves and K3 surfaces with non-symplectic involutions. This family has an incredible property, that a general member has a mirror pair within this family. We start by investigating if this construction works only for Calabi-Yau threefolds with non-symplectic involutions or with non-symplectic automorphisms of higher order as well. Thereafter, we generalize this construction to Calabi-Yau fourfolds.&#xD;
&#xD;
After this, we focus on the underlying construction that lead Borcea to the families above, using a product of three elliptic curves with non-symplectic involutions. These threefolds do not come in families, so we cannot ask about mirror symmetry, but if we have models defined over $\Qbb$, we may ask arithmetic questions. Many arithmetic properties of the Calabi-Yau threefolds can be studied via the underlying elliptic curves. In particular, we are able to show (re-establish in the rigid case) that the Calabi-Yau threefolds are all modular by computing their $L$-functions. Then, guided by a conjecture of Yui, we investigate their (Griffiths) intermediate Jacobians and a relationship between their respective $L$-functions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vitamin D is hypothesized to decrease breast cancer risk by controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and estrogen synthesis and signalling in breast tissue. Transport of circulating vitamin D to sites of action is facilitated by vitamin D binding protein, encoded by the GC gene, whereupon it binds to the vitamin D receptor, encoded by the VDR gene. Given that polymorphisms in the GC and VDR gene have not been consistently associated with breast cancer risk, our objectives were to assess the associations of vitamin D-related genes with overall, premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk; to determine these associations according to tumour receptor status; and, to assess associations between vitamin D receptor (VDR) haplotypes and breast cancer risk. A case-control study with 1,037 incident breast cancer cases and 1,050 age-frequency matched controls in Vancouver, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario was conducted. Logistic regression in an additive genetic model was used to calculate age- and centre-adjusted odds ratios for associations between 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the GC and VDR gene and breast cancer risk. Polytomous regression was used to assess associations with breast tumour subtypes, and weighted logistic regression was conducted to calculate odds ratios for associations between VDR haplotypes and breast cancer risk. False discovery adjustments were made to address multiple testing. Among European women, two SNPs in the VDR gene, rs1544410 (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21 – 0.70) and rs7967152 (OR = 2.80, 95% CI: 1.62 – 4.85), were associated with risk of ER-/PR-/HER2+ breast tumour subtype, but not with other breast tumour subtypes. Although there were suggested associations with breast cancer risk for some SNPs and VDR haplotypes, there was no association after false discovery rate adjustment. In conclusion, breast tumour subtypes may be etiologically distinct disease states, with different risk factors and prognostic outcomes. Interactions between variations in vitamin D-related genes and breast tumour subtypes are biologically plausible given our current understanding of anti-carcinogenic properties of vitamin D elicited through the regulation of cell growth and reproductive hormone synthesis. Our findings provide additional insight into the etiologic differences among breast tumour subtypes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accidental explosions in the chemical, oil &amp; gas industry are a serious problem. The ultimate objective of this thesis is to establish a new parameter/process that can be used to categorize the relative detonation explosion hazard of a fuel that can be measured in a smaller, more practical apparatus. Experiments were carried out in an apparatus consisting of a 6.1 m long (composed of 2 equal length sections), 100 mm inner-diameter tube. A detonation was initiated in the first half of the tube using an acetylene-oxygen driver ignited by a weak spark. The second half of the tube contained orifice plates equally spaced at the tube diameter. Six different orifice plate diameters between 38.1 mm (1.5˝) and 76.2 mm (3˝), in increments of 6.4 mm (1/4˝) were used in the study. The average combustion front velocity was obtained from time-of-arrival measurements deduced from ionization probe signals. The critical (minimum) orifice plate diameter required for successful transmission of a detonation from a smooth tube was measured for different stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures. The ratio of the critical orifice plate diameter (d) and the mixture detonation cell size (λ) varies strongly with the orifice plate blockage ratio (BR), with a value approaching unity (d/λ→1) with decreasing blockage ratio. It is proposed that the critical orifice plate diameter could be used to categorize the detonation hazard potential of single or multi-component fuels. Additional experiments were performed in same apparatus to measure the Deflagration to Detonation Transition (DDT) and detonation propagation limits (distinguished by the method of initiation). Both the propagation and the DDT limits narrow with increasing BR, more significantly for the DDT limits. The narrowing of the limits with increasing BR also corresponds to a larger deviation from the d/λ=1 detonation limit criterion. These results indicate that the beneficial effects of the orifice plate in providing a reflection surface diminishes with increased BR due to the increased effect of shock wave weakening by the diffraction process. Novel use of soot foils showed that the structure of the detonation wave is very non-uniform and highly unsteady, characterized by local detonation initiation and failure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Today, throughout the engineering world, there is a large emphasis being placed on the environment which requires the development of new greener materials. This is no different in the realm of composite materials with natural fibers and new bio-based resins being investigated to replace their synthetic alternatives. However, a large obstacle has prevented a more wide spread use of green Natural Fiber Reinforced Polymer (NFRP) materials, and that is their poor elevated temperature (ET) and fire performance. One common method for increasing the fire performance of a material is the incorporation of fire retardant (FR) additives.&#xD;
The purpose of this research was to investigate, and try to maximize, the ET properties of new NFRP composites. Specifically, this included evaluating the mechanical properties of NFRP composites at room temperature (RT) and ET, as well as assessing the effect of FR additives on these properties. A secondary goal of this research included comparing a synthetic epoxy resin, Biresin, with a bio-based epoxy resin, Super Sap.&#xD;
This was accomplished using one type of natural fiber (flax), two resins (one synthetic, one bio-based) and three FR additives. In all, four different testing methods were employed. The first was Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis of all composite materials. The second type of testing evaluated the resin plus additive combinations without any fibers. The final two types of testing evaluated the mechanical properties of the fabricated NFRP at RT and ET.&#xD;
Several important conclusions were reached with regards to this research. One of these noted the percentage loadings used in this research did not negatively affect the NFRP samples enough to be considered a major hindrance against their use in NFRP fabrication. It was also determined Super Sap composites could be used as an appropriate replacement for Biresin FRP composites in high temperature applications. Finally, two recommendations toward NFRP design, for RT and ET applications, are proposed. From this research, the gained knowledge will aid in the future design and construction of NFRP materials used in possible fire and ET situations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Public perceptions of policing in the United States have drastically shifted in the last decade as images of police brutality have dominated the media. This thesis asks whether or not the militarization of policing in the United States is a new phenomenon, or whether it represents the rebirth of traditional state modes of policing. Answering this question entails linking together various elements of urban militarism, urban policing, and geographical decentralization in order to understand the shift towards militarized policing. Using a “bricolage style methodology” consisting of a case study, complemented by thick description, documentary, and content analysis, an analysis of both the media and official government reports will provide the landscape through which the case study is to be analyzed. An historical overview of the police and policing in the United States provides a platform for comparing traditional and contemporary definitions of policing, police jurisdiction, and discourses of securitization, militarization, military urbanism, and risk. Additionally, an overview of America’s role in Vietnam contextualizes colonial influence and its role in shaping police-citizen relationships and encouraging militarization through “othering.” Using recent events in Ferguson, Missouri (death of Michael Brown in 2014) as the case study, there is a close reading of the March 2015 Justice Department Report to assess whether a series of transformations in United States policing have or have not occurred. In addition, an historical overview of the history of Ferguson and Missouri is presented. The results of the analysis challenge the original hypothesis. Although this thesis attributes current issues in American policing to militarization, it is argued that it is actually an emerging characteristic of the entrepreneurialism of policing in the United States that is increasingly responsible for the continuing conflict between police and citizen.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this era of BigData, designing a workflow to gain insights from the vast amount of data has become more complex. There are several different frameworks which individually process the batch and streaming data but coordinating the jobs between the engines in the workflow creates a performance penalty and other performance issues. Current workflow systems typically run only on one engine and do not offer the versatility required for today’s workflows. The process of submitting the jobs on different engines manually is not only time consuming, but also requires the expertise of working on these engines. In this thesis, we have overcome the above mentioned issues by proposing a MEWSE - Multi Engine Workflow Submission and Execution on Apache YARN. It should also have design with plug and play functionalities to allow the inclusion of new engines. MEWSE has been tested on Amazon EC2 with a sample workflow which requires the following engines, Hadoop, Mahout, java and some scripts to process the data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The main objective of this research project was synthesizing CO2-responsive latexes by nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP). Therefore, 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA)  as a CO2-responsive monomer was chosen for the synthesis poly(DEAEMA) macroinitiator that can be used as a stabilizer for the preparation of poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, latexes. &#xD;
     NMP of DEAEMA was performed in bulk with excellent control and livingness. The synthesized poly(DEAEMA) was then used in the protonated form as a macroalkoxyamine and stabilizer for the preparation of pH-responsive and CO2-switchable latexes with surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. The resultant latex particles were stable with small particle size and narrow size distribution. To simplify the process, PMMA latexes were prepared by one-pot two-step nitroxide-mediated surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. First, DEAEMA was polymerized for the first time in water and then at high conversions, MMA was added to the reaction media and amphiphilic diblock copolymers were formed, which converted to the latex particles when the hydrophobic block reached to the critical chain length based on polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) mechanism. However, the synthesized nanoparticles with poly(DEAEMA) shell and PMMA core were not redispersible after coagulation. It was figured out that the main reason for the irreversible coagulation of latex particles was the low glass transition temperature (Tg) of poly(DEAEMA) which causes the diffusion of the particles shell into each other. Also, it was demonstrated that DEAEMA is hydrolyzed very fast in the basic conditions and high temperatures suitable for NMP. &#xD;
     To address these issues, dimethaminopropyl methacrylamide (DMAPMA) was used as another CO2-responsive monomer with higher Tg and also hydraulic stability in the synthesis of MMA and styrene latexes. In this case, the synthesized nanoparticles were redispersible by the stimulation of CO2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A 0.8L, 3 cylinder turbocharged diesel engine was retrofitted for premixed and port injected dual&#xD;
fuel operation. Diesel baseline testing was conducted and conventional diesel trends in efficiency and&#xD;
emissions were found in relation to pilot start of injection (SOI) and load. However, at low loads the&#xD;
combustion mode deviated from a conventional diffusion flame. The end of injection was found to occur&#xD;
well before start of combustion (SOC), suggesting that combustion was closer to premixed charge&#xD;
compression ignition (PCCI).&#xD;
Dual fuel mode operation was carried out using two methods. First, the fuel proportions were&#xD;
varied while maintaining 25% full load (FL). The brake fuel conversion efficiency (BCFE), unburned&#xD;
hydrocarbons (UHC) and CO emissions suffered, while NOx emissions and peak pressure decreased with&#xD;
increased methane substitution. Ignition delay increased with methane substitution. Port injected dual fuel&#xD;
modes yielded improved BFCE, but similar UHC and CO emissions compared to premixed dual fuel.&#xD;
Second, constant pilot tests with small pilot quantities resulted in decreased BFCE and increased&#xD;
CO and UHC emissions compared to diesel-only. Increasing load resulted in improved BFCE relative to&#xD;
diesel performance and decreased UHC and CO emissions. Constant pilot NOx emissions were lower&#xD;
than diesel-only at low load, but far exceeded diesel levels above 50%FL. Increased pilot injection&#xD;
quantity provided emissions and BFCE benefits compared to the minimum pilot quantity for low loads&#xD;
only (below 50%). Advancing SOI increased peak cylinder pressure and temperature, and improved UHC&#xD;
and CO emissions. Further advancement resulted in decreased BFCE due to very early heat release&#xD;
(BTDC). Similarly at 50%FL SOI advance increased peak pressure and temperature. Much less&#xD;
improvement in BFCE was found with SOI advancement, but UHC and CO emissions were reduced. At&#xD;
very early SOI angles SOC and peak pressure was retarded and yielded a slow ignition event followed by&#xD;
a single heat release event. Increasing the load and/or pilot quantity resulted in further advancement of&#xD;
SOI timing compared to the smaller pilot quantity. All tests reported in this thesis were conducted at an&#xD;
1800RPM nominal engine speed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An observational approach to excavation design and construction is commonly employed in order to assess excavation driven displacements which, in turn, affects the design of support systems used to maintain the stability within underground projects. A correct and accurate evaluation of the support system performance will therefore, be critical to both the safety and economics of the construction process. This necessitates a monitoring program capable of capturing the support system behaviour in order to verify assumptions made at the design stage and as the excavation advances. Conventionally, this has been approached from an external perspective where the behaviour of individual support elements has been inferred from the measurements of the excavation periphery (e.g. geodetic monitoring) and displacements surrounding the support (e.g. multi-point-borehole-extensometers). This is possibly due to the difficulties of operationally instrumenting ground support. However, this has ultimately lead to a gap in knowledge in terms of the distinct performance of each support element in isolation and as part of a multi-component support system. Within this context, a novel distributed optical strain sensing (DOS) technology has been implemented with rock bolt and forepole support elements. Unlike conventional, discrete strain measurement methods, the optical technology captures a distributed strain profile along the length of a standard, low-cost, single mode optical fiber (i.e. 1.25 millimeter spatial resolution). In this regard, this research has been devoted to developing a technique whereby the optical sensor is capable of being installed with rock bolt and forepole elements to be used as primary support in situ. The development of such an optical technique is a non-trivial undertaking. Furthermore, the DOS technology has never before been implemented within the geomechanics community and was therefore subjected to a comprehensive laboratory testing program, which considered: bending, axial loading, and shearing of optically instrumented support elements. Results of the testing program demonstrated the capability of the optical technique to capture expected loading mechanisms of the support elements throughout their serviceability life, agreeing well with numerical and theoretical predictions. Additionally, the optical technique was found to capture complexities of support behaviour at an unprecedented level, overcoming limitations of conventional monitoring.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Extracellular sugar polymers, or exopolysaccharides, play crucial roles in gram-negative bacteria that enable their survival and proliferation in hostile environments. As a result, the proteins involved in the synthesis, transport, and regulation of these sugars are potential targets for antibiotic development. &#xD;
Escherichia coli tyrosine kinase (Etk) is an inner membrane protein that is part of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) export complex. The autophosphorylation of Etk is considered to be the regulatory signal that controls CPS export, but the mechanism for transmitting this signal to the other members of the protein complex has yet to be elucidated. It is expected that the periplasmic domain of Etk is involved. The first portion of this thesis discusses progress towards determining an x-ray crystal structure for Etk’s periplasmic region. Significant advancement occurred when the unstable full-length Etk protein was truncated to include only the periplasmic domain and the two transmembrane helices. Attempts to improve the reproducibility and quality of crystals obtained provided the realization that detergent concentration was a crucial factor. This led to the development of an improved method for detergent concentration measurement in small-volume, membrane protein samples using a colorimetric reaction with 2,6-dimethylphenol. Other traditional chemical reactions that can be applied to detergent measurement were also tested. &#xD;
Another important exopolysaccharide produced in E. coli is lipopolysaccharide. The second part of this thesis presents the first crystal structure of a newly identified, key regulator of lipopolysaccharide synthesis, lipopolysaccharide assembly protein B (LapB). Zn-SAD phasing with high-redundancy data was used to determine the experimental phases required for structure solution. Retrospective analysis of the same data revealed that this structure could also have been solved with lower redundancy data. The protein contains nine tetratricopeptide repeats and a rubredoxin metal binding domain that fold together in an unexpectedly intimate arrangement. Proper functioning of LapB, including the binding of the rubredoxin domain to the TPR helices appears crucial for optimum cell growth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Through an in-depth study of Canadian NGOs, my thesis explores the degree, if any, to which NGO discourse intersects with post-development theory. A growing body of post-development literature, Ferguson (1990), Matthews (2008), proposes that development goals should focus on making policy changes in the developed world while development projects themselves should be initiated at the grass-root level in the developing world. I will investigate if and how post-development theory parallels “development” practice of Canadian NGOs. To do so, I analyze five different NGOs through interviews and documents, such as published reports and studies released by the organizations in question.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Studies of the forces that shape local adaptation contribute to our understanding of origins of range-wide variation, speciation, and potential responses to changing environments. Phenology is an important component of such local adaptation. Phenological research is central to studies of geographical range limits and species distributions, migration, speciation, response to climate change and ex situ conservation and re-introduction programs. Despite over 22,000 phenological studies published thus far, there is a lack of phenological information on reproductive patterns of temperate anurans, particularly for females. My thesis therefore focuses on gaining insights into temperate frog phenology primarily of females, and patterns of female choice. I focus on Hyla versicolor (Gray Treefrogs), an Eastern North American temperate frog. My data come from perimeter transect surveys done at two wetlands at the Queen’s University Biological Station over the entire 2014 breeding season. I compared male and female peak abundance using an N-mixture model. Both males and females peaked on Julian Day 154 (June 3rd 2014). Females arrived three days after males in my focal wetlands, and left three days before. Timing of arrival is most likely based on a combination of females responding to male advertisement calls, and both sexes responding to abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, precipitation) across the season. Additionally, I looked at trends in male size over the season and found a weak positive relationship between male size and Julian day. However, females showed no preference for larger males, implying that female choice may focus on other things like genetic quality. I did find evidence of positive assortative mating, perhaps because of biophysical limitations of small females carrying larger males during oviposition. A fuller knowledge of female phenology enhances our understanding of local adaptation, and potentially provides insights into speciation and responses to climate change.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arginase-1 deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of the urea cycle that normally converts ammonia to less toxic urea. Symptoms include neurodegeneration, spastic diplegia and mental retardation. We designed a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to correct an induced Arg1 exon 7 and 8 deletion (Arg1∆) that produces arginase-1 deficiency in mice.&#xD;
Three cell lines were generated to study this disease. The first was primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from Arg1∆-mice (Arg1∆-PMEF). The second was mouse induced-pluripotent stem cells converted from the aforementioned PMEFs (Arg1∆-miPSC). The third was human embryonic 293T kidney cells with introduced Arg1∆-transgenic DNA (Arg1∆-HEK). These three cell lines were transfected with a targeted Cas9:guide-RNA (gRNA) plasmid. PCR amplicons were subjected to a heteroduplex cleavage assay and sequenced to confirm Cas9 cleavage just upstream of the exon 7 and 8 deletion site.&#xD;
DNA cleavage by Cas9:gRNA can promote homologous recombination with a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) to produce small edits in the genome of miPSCs. This mimicked an editing strategy that could be used to correct single nucleotide mutations in Arg1. Homologous recombination was also used to introduce a targeting vector containing both wild-type exon 7 and 8 cDNA and a removable positive-negative selection cassette in miPSCs. PCR analysis and sequencing of “targeted” (positively selected) cells has shown the presence of the repair vector in the correct location in Arg1. Attempts were made to subsequently remove the selection cassette by PiggyBac transposase. The “repaired” (negatively selected) miPSCs were probed by PCR to test for the correct incorporation of exons 7 and 8, showing unclear results. These cells were converted to hepatocyte-like cells showing the correct morphology and staining positive for glycogen. Future tests will be conducted to introduce these hepatocyte-like cells into Arg1-deficient mice. These experiments will serve as a functional model to test gene editing in arginase-1 deficiency. Because the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be designed to target any gene precisely, it has far-reaching applications, particularly for genetic disorders.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is a study of Canada’s cultural approaches toward the Communist world – particularly in the performing arts – and the ways in which the public and private sectors sought to develop Canada’s identity during the Cold War. The first chapter examines how the defection of Igor Gouzenko in 1945 framed the Canadian state’s approach to the security aspects of cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union. Chapters 2 to 4 analyse the socio-economic, political, and international context that shaped Canada's music, classical theatre, and ballet exchanges with communist countries. The final chapter explores Expo ’67’s World Festival of Arts and Entertainment as a significant moment in international and domestic cultural relations. I contend that although focused abroad, Canada’s cultural initiatives served a nation-building purpose at home. For practitioners of Canadian cultural diplomacy, domestic audiences were just as, if not more, important as foreign audiences.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pakistanis in Hollywood films and U.S. television shows have largely been depicted as a threat to the western world. Television shows such as Homeland and Numbers, and films like G.I Joe and Zero Dark Thirty, have depicted Pakistani characters as terrorists and as one-dimensional characters, lacking depth. Their screen portrayal has been particularly negative after 9/11/01. Given that most Pakistanis identify themselves as Muslims, Pakistanis in the U.S. have been automatically subjected to racial profiling and surveillance by the U.S. state apparatus following the September 11 attacks. As a Pakistani studying in North America, I decided to focus my MA research on exploring this fractured identity in the post 9/11/01 landscape. I chose to do this through films as they inform people’s interpretations of the world, of themselves, and of others. This thesis will review non-Western films, which I argue, offer a counter narrative to mainstream Hollywood’s treatment of Pakistanis. I will be examining two international co-productions, Khuda Ke Liye (2007; Pakistan and USA) and The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2012; USA, UK and Qatar). Both films depict the experience of the Pakistani “Other” in the U.S., immediately following the 9/11/01 attacks. This paper will review the ideological messages of both films, and analyze how the films portray their Pakistani protagonists. Through examining these non-Western films, I will show that such cinematic works can offer a global resistance, and a global solidarity, against the “us versus them” narrative prevailing in American entertainment. I thus investigate how these international co-productions viewed the 9/11 attacks while also considering the impact it generated on the lives of Pakistani Muslims living in the West.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The increased demand for space cooling and the resulting summer peak in electrical demands are motivating research into thermally-driven air-conditioning systems that can use renewable or waste heat. One promising technology is the use of a Liquid Desiccant Air-Conditioning (LDAC). &#xD;
An evaporative cooling tower (ECT) was used as a cooling device to reject the heat from a LDAC at Queen’s University. Investigation of the ECT showed significant power consumption and ineffective operation in humid conditions which contributed to the low electrical and thermal coefficients of performance (COPE and COPT). Therefore, the present study was undertaken to identify and evaluate alternative heat rejection strategies that can provide a better thermal and electrical system performance.&#xD;
The relationship between the relative humidity and the ambient air temperature at a variety of cooling water temperatures was modelled using TRNSYS, a transient simulation program, as the first stage of the study. To find the most promising heat rejection technologies, available cooling methods were reviewed and two were selected (based on the results of the first phase of the study), namely, (i) a cooling water storage (CWS) system and (ii)  a ground-source heat exchanger (GSHX) system. These were simulated and evaluated in detail. Finally, an experimental investigation of a stratified cooling water storage tank (SCWS) and night cooling water storage (NCWS) was undertaken to confirm the results of an additional simulation on the use of a stratified cooling tank.&#xD;
From the simulation results and the overall comparison of the selected heat rejection strategies of the LDAC, it was concluded that GSHX system with 25 boreholes showed better COPE than the CWS system whereas the COPT improvement of both systems was almost same. The improved performance of the GSHX however, is expensive as the capital cost for boreholes is higher than the other systems. When comparing the CWS system (with mixed tank) and the SCWS (with stratified tank) it was observed that the stratified tank had the better potential of improving the COPT, depending upon the water flow rate and initial tank temperature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I consider whether coincident objects can be avoided, while preserving matter’s survival of substantial change and the everyday understanding of identity, by recognizing the ontological category of stuff. In Chapter 1, I explain the “statue problem”, which will serve as the guiding example of substantial change, establish the demands on an appropriate solution to it, and define the “stuff ontology”. In Chapter 2, I present Grandy, Burge, and Jubien’s solutions to the problem, which avoid coincidence by eliminating all objects, and argue that they are inferior to ones which – like Burke’s and McKay’s – include things in addition to stuff because of the latter’s ability to preserve the analogy between the constitution of things by stuff and the constitution of wholes by parts. In Chapter 3, I defend Burke and McKay’s views from objections, and demonstrate their superiority over the rival account of four-dimensional objects. In Chapter 4, however, I argue that, by imposing identity conditions on stuff, Burke and McKay reduce it to technical objects, thereby arguing in favour of coincidence between conventional and technical objects. The charge might be avoided by denying that technical “quantities” are genuine objects, but this response appears to attribute identity conditions, generally features of objects, to stuff. I conclude that the most promising avenue is to eschew the applicability of identity to stuff, and that Burke and McKay’s account must be supplemented by a means of distinguishing the sense of sameness applicable to stuff from its counterpart applicable to things in order to present a coherent alternative to coincident objects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Circumcision—the surgical removal of some/all of the male prepuce (foreskin)—is among the oldest and most common surgical procedures globally. Research on circumcision—and the recent North American policy endorsing it—focuses on health outcomes; sexual correlates of circumcision remain largely unexplored. A review of the circumcision literature was conducted (Chapter 2), and four studies investigated the sexual correlates of neonatal circumcision. Chapter 3 employed quantitative sensory testing (detection/pain thresholds using punctate/thermal stimuli) to examine penile sensitivity in healthy adult men (circumcised, intact). Findings indicate minimal differences across circumcision status. Chapter 4, which compared sexual functioning across circumcision status, found no significant differences between circumcised and intact men with respect to genital response (via laser Doppler imaging: LDI), subjective experiences of sexual arousal, or sexual/urological history variables. Chapter 5 explored men’s attitudes towards their circumcision status and the implications of these attitudes on body image and sexual functioning. A proportion of circumcised men who completed this online survey indicated high distress about their circumcision status. Furthermore, negative attitudes towards one’s circumcision status—as opposed to circumcised status per se—was related to worse body image and sexual functioning. Chapter 6 assessed the impact of a man’s circumcision status on their female and male sexual partners. In this online study, circumcision status did not impact partner’s sexual functioning, but gender differences emerged with respect to attitudes towards one’s partner’s circumcision status (women preferred circumcised partners, men preferred intact). Overall, however, women and men were satisfied with their partner’s circumcision status and did not wish for it to change. Taken together, this research program indicates that minimal physiological differences exist between circumcised and intact men (i.e., sensitivity, sexual response, the experience of sexual arousal). However, attitudes towards one’s circumcision status—as opposed to circumcision status alone—was an important aspect of men’s and their sexual partners’ sex lives. In particular, dissatisfaction with one’s circumcision status is associated with worse body image and sexual functioning in men. Here, we provide a multidimensional perspective of the sexual correlates of circumcision with implications for public policy and individual stakeholders (e.g., medical professionals, parents, men).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The transformative power of Information Technology (IT) presents many exciting opportunities for organizations to use IT to achieve business success. While some CEOs of leading organizations are taking advantage of IT’s transformative potential, others are not due to their lingering doubt concerning the potential of IT and the ability of IT executives to contribute to business value and competitive advantage. These expectancies of IT and IT executives, held by CEOs, are believed to be instrumental in decisions regarding the eventual deployment of IT. To examine this important organizational phenomenon, this dissertation studies the existence and nature of CEOs’ expectancies of IT and their IT executives  in increasing business value and strategic advantage, and investigates the antecedents and consequences of these value expectancies using data of large- and medium- sized Canadian organizations. Based on prominent social and cognitive theories, the research frameworks can provide a powerful lens for examining this organizational phenomenon. Through this lens, the dissertation contributes to the theoretical underpinnings and empirical findings about CEOs’ value expectancies of IT and IT executives, their performance implications, their social and cognitive antecedents, and ultimately suggesting how managers can leverage IT resources and capabilities to enhance their organizational performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gendered expectations about wartime duty were central to Toronto’s mobilization during the First World War. How Torontonians defined these duties and responsibilities – and how they imagined the war they were waging – exposes attitudes and reactions towards war that were contrary to those expected and promoted by the war effort. Many of these expectations were based on the prevailing imperial understandings of manhood, war, and militarism of the era. The historiography of the First World War generally presents ideas of a national coming of age. However, how Torontonians lived and imagined war from 1914 to 1918 demonstrates this experience was both contested and gendered.&#xD;
This case study of wartime Toronto examines how municipal, provincial, and federal authorities reinforced masculine expectations during wartime, and especially how active service was framed as the ultimate expression of manhood and masculinity. This study traces links between masculine duty and enlistment for war as communicated through war posters and the city’s municipal organizations. Wartime activities – including recruitment and conscription, the identification of enemy aliens, and civil unrest – were framed by understandings of manhood that valued active military service as its ultimate test. Toronto was a military centre for the recruitment of acceptable soldier-volunteers, and later soldier-conscripts; it was also a place where “enemy aliens” were identified, suspected, and registered and where veterans struggled to readjust to civilian life. While some Torontonians supported the war and the ideals of freedom and democracy it was believed to safeguard, others voiced their displeasure about the war and its effects within the city.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In Canada, under the guise of austerity measures, the state is increasingly distancing itself from the responsibility of helping families raise their children (Vandenbeld Giles 2012; Walmsley and Tessier 2015). This distancing is evident in Canada’s provincial legal-judicial child welfare systems, where the focus on protective child services significantly outweighs preventative programming and family support. A tenant of neoliberalism, a focus on individual responsibility is evident in the increasing concern that parents are risk factors in their children’s lives (Brown 2006; Romagnoli and Wall 2012). This ideology is apparent in the constructed “bad” mother label applied to mothers involved with Canadian child welfare, where 89% of involved caregivers are biological mothers (CIS 2008:40). Focusing specifically on the Ontario child welfare system, this case study examines how manufactured ideologies of the “bad” mother become synonymous with marginalized mothers. Using the theoretical lens of Pierre Bourdieu and the material-feminist work of Angela McRobbie, the institution, practices, and policies of Ontario child welfare are discussed as both class and racially biased. Further, prescriptive ideologies of intensive mothering, a concept coined by sociologist Sharon Hays, are found intertwined with notions of “good” mothering and normalized within the intersecting fields of mothering and child welfare. The landscape of “bad” mothers involved with child welfare is discussed surrounding the non-essentialist categories of monstrous mothers, the incarcerated mother, and the mother next door – the vague category where marginalization and disadvantaged social positioning serves as an invitation for increased scrutiny and gaze from the state (Appell 1998; Reich 2005; Swift and Callahan 2009; Swift and Parada 2004). This thesis challenges assumptions and stereotypes held about mothers involved with child welfare by highlighting the marginalized contexts in which they navigate life for both themselves and their children including experienced poverty, racism, colonialization, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Moreover, a specific analysis of language constructions and reforms to Part III of the Child and Family Services Act made in 2000, reveal how such changes are manufactured more so for the protection of the state and its governing agencies, than they are for the protection of children and their families.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Acute mental stress has been shown to elicit a transitory impairment in the function of the endothelial cells that line the arteries. While this effect of mental stress on endothelial function is generally accepted, the mechanisms by which this occurs remain unclear. One putative mechanism is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The objective of the study performed for this thesis was to examine whether orally administered vitamin C (an antioxidant which can combat the negative effects of ROS) can attenuate reductions in brachial artery endothelial function due to mental stress. Fifteen men (21 ± 2 yrs) were given 1000mg of vitamin C or placebo over two experimental days (one per visit) in a randomized, double-blinded, within-subject study. Acute mental stress was induced using the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST), which consists of both a speech and mental arithmetic task. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), an index of endothelial function, was assessed using ultrasound at baseline, prior to the acute mental stress task, and 30, and 90 minutes post-stress. Saliva samples were taken to measure the stress hormone cortisol at all FMD time points as well as immediately post-stress. Stress reactivity was also characterized by changes in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).  A significant stress response was elicited by the TSST in both conditions as MAP, HR and salivary cortisol all increased significantly. Contrary to the hypothesis, endothelial function was unaffected by time (p = 0.631) or condition (p = 0.792). However, a correlation was found between Δ%FMD at 30 minutes and ΔMAP (p = 0.015) and Δsalivary cortisol (p &lt; 0.001) in the placebo condition but not the vitamin C condition (p = 0.480, p = 0.461). These findings indicate that acute mental stress may not impair endothelial function in healthy, young adults. The observation that relationships between stress reactivity parameters and changes in FMD were abolished in the vitamin C condition may indicate that ROS signaling influences FMD post-stress. Further research is required to elucidate the role of ROS in modulating stress-induced changes in endothelial function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent climate warming has resulted in substantial changes in vegetation production at high northern latitudes (above 60°N). Understanding the direction, magnitude, and rate of these changes warrants investigation given that tundra and boreal biomes play important roles in global energy partitioning and carbon sequestration. Satellite-based measures of aboveground production have indicated both positive and negative trends across tundra and boreal biomes over the last 30 years, respectively. The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between the remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a widely used indicator of primary production, and interannual variation in ring-widths of dominant coniferous and deciduous species situated in a boreal mountainous region of southwest Yukon, Canada. Trends in maximum annual NDVI from 1990 to 2013 were generated from two Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) datasets: The Alaska Composite NDVI (1km), and the third generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) NDVI (8km). Results from the NDVI trend analysis indicated a dominant low-level greening trend across the study region. Twenty 1km2 sites, divided equally between those undergoing “high greening” (NDVI/yr &gt; 0.004) and “low greening” (NDVI/yr 0 – 0.003) trends were selected for dendrochronological sampling. During the summer of 2014, the dominant coniferous and deciduous species were sampled at each site. Annual rings were measured and standardized, yielding two chronologies (coniferous and deciduous) for each site. Ring-width trends varied in direction and magnitude for both coniferous and deciduous species. Agreement between NDVI trends and ring-width trends was low; however, eight coniferous site chronologies showed significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05) with GIMMS3g NDVI during the growing season. Our findings suggest that while trends in maximum annual NDVI do not consistently reflect changes in radial growth of dominant species, ring-widths may be reflected in NDVI at some point during the growing season. We hypothesize that correlation between NDVI and ring-widths remains low in southern Yukon due to landscape heterogeneity, low spatial resolution of NDVI time series, and shifts in energy and resource allocation within individual plants as a response to a changing climate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Populations of birds that feed on flying insects (i.e., aerial insectivores) have been declining for several decades in North America, yet the cause of these declines is poorly understood. Among aerial insectivores, Eastern Whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus; “Whip-poor-will”) populations have declined across their breeding range since at least the late 1960s, and breeding habitat loss is thought to be a primary cause. Here we test this hypothesis using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey — the same data that were used to document long-term Whip-poor-will population declines in Canada. If breeding habitat loss contributed to the observed Whip-poor-will population declines, then we predicted that changes in breeding habitat cover would, in part, explain changes in Whip-poor-will occurrence at precise survey locations. We used aerial photographs and satellite imagery to measure changes in land cover at Breeding Bird Survey stops in Canada that have lost or gained Whip-poor-wills over time. We found support for our hypothesis: the loss of useable open habitat (e.g., forest clear-cuts, old fields) within 1140 m of Breeding Bird Survey stops predicted the declines in Whip-poor-wills at the same stops. The loss of useable open habitat at stops was primarily caused by forest succession of clear-cuts and old fields; any gains in useable open habitat were primarily a result of forest clear-cutting and initial succession of abandoned farmland. Overall, declines in useable open habitat explained approximately 40-57% of the variation in Whip-poor-will occurrence, suggesting that breeding habitat loss was an important contributor to the declines in Whip-poor-wills at Breeding Bird Survey stops in Canada. The results also suggest that breeding habitat loss cannot fully explain the reductions of Whip-poor-will populations, and that other unidentified factors, such as habitat loss on the wintering grounds or declines in available insect prey, have also contributed to the population declines of this species in Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ordinarily, we suppose that material objects sometimes do, and sometimes do not, form a further object.  In his book Four-Dimensionalism, Theodore Sider develops an argument that attempts to show this assumption is mistaken.  Sider’s argument from vagueness is one of the most influential arguments in support of universalism, the thesis that composition is unrestricted: whenever some concrete entities exists, so does their mereological fusion.  The argument from vagueness is defective – I submit – because it begs the question.  Sider distorts the notion of a ‘concrete object’ so that it does not coordinate with ordinary object-sortals and so that it presumes any arrangement of matter forms a unit, thereby assuming the very claim his argument intends to prove.  I begin by reconstructing the argument from vagueness and assessing its two crucial denials: that there can neither be sharp cut-offs in composition, nor indeterminate cases of composition.  I survey a variety of responses to these claims, which prove either unsatisfactory or ontologically burdensome, and offer my own response, which avoids ontological burdens.  My strategy forces Sider into the dilemma of either recanting one of his two denials, or admitting that the fusions generated by his argument cannot bear ontological weight.  Neither option can support a universal theory of composition.  My purpose here is to refute the argument from vagueness; this paper does not advance a novel theory of composition.  Nonetheless, the flaws I identify in Sider’s position advocate that an adequate theory of composition should countenance vague objects and attend to the distinct mereological nature of non-individuative physical substances, which requires further exploration.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Simple View of Reading is a theoretical model that explains reading comprehension as a product of listening comprehension – the process and ability to understand information by listening – and decoding – the ability to make a letter-sound correspondence to process written information (Gough &amp; Tunmer, 1986). The present study uses the Simple View of Reading model to explore reading comprehension in two different second language-learning groups – the first group from a Core French background (n=16) and the second group from a French Immersion background (n=19). These are both adult groups who completed initial programming in French as a Second Language in secondary school and were studying French at the university level.&#xD;
	The Simple View of Reading has often been used to predict reading comprehension outcomes for children from both first language settings and second or foreign language settings. The present study seeks to compare the skills associated with the Simple View of Reading within the two aforementioned groups, the first of which did not receive as much French instruction as the second (compare 600 hours to 3800 hours by end of high school for each respective group; Ministry of Education, 2013a). This study fills the gaps in research by using a sample of adult participants in a Canadian context that looks specifically at how two different French programming backgrounds both lead to the development of reading skills and the way in which reading comprehension is accounted for by three essential aspects – listening comprehension, decoding, and the Simple View of Reading model itself. The results are somewhat consistent with the research that show that listening comprehension and decoding are significant predictors of reading comprehension, however, there is not enough evidence in the present study to show that the Simple View of Reading is a significant predictor of reading comprehension.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prediction is needed to compensate for neural delays between a sensory input and an&#xD;
appropriate motor output. We designed an eye movement task to clarify the behavioural control&#xD;
and neural correlates that are involved in both temporal and spatial prediction. A task involving&#xD;
temporally and spatially predictive and non-predictive saccades was employed in an MRI machine in which four conditions were tested: spatially/temporally predictive (ST-PRED), temporally predictive/spatially non-predictive (T-PRED), spatially predictive/ temporally non-predictive (S-PRED), and spatially/temporally non-predictive (NON).&#xD;
Data from 24 normal human participants (mean age = 22.4 yrs) showed distinct behavioural&#xD;
differences between conditions. All participants elicited primarily predictive saccades (saccadic&#xD;
reaction time: SRT &lt; 100ms) in the ST-PRED condition. The NON condition elicited primarily&#xD;
reactive saccades (SRT &gt; 100ms). The average SRT of the S-PRED condition fell between the&#xD;
average of the ST-PRED and NON conditions, and no significant differences in SRT were&#xD;

showed activation of the PEF, insular cortex, and DLPFC which may play a role in the control of predictive saccades. Contrasts that isolated spatially predictive areas also showed activation of the PEF, insular cortex, and DLPFC while contrasts that isolated temporally predictive areas showed select activation of the&#xD;
cerebellum which may serve as the internal clock that drives the regular rhythmic behaviour&#xD;
observed for the temporal aspect of predictive saccades. Surprisingly, activation or frontal areas&#xD;
responsible for saccadic control such as the Frontal and Supplementary Eye fields were equal&#xD;
among all conditions. The behavioural differences validated the activity of the contrasts to isolate&#xD;
brain areas that are correlated with both spatial and temporal prediction. The results from these&#xD;
contrasts indicated that brain activation in the ST-PRED and S-PRED conditions reflects&#xD;
predictive responses to visual stimuli while brain activation in the T-PRED condition reflects&#xD;
motor-timed responses. This suggests that utilizing a predictive saccade task is a valuable tool&#xD;
for simultaneously testing both spatial and temporal prediction that involves fast internally-guided&#xD;
responses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Unconscious reminders of religion boost people’s ability to exercise self-control even after they have completed an earlier self-control task. However, other research has shown that when people initially engage in a task does not involve self-control, people who are high in religiosity or who engage in personal prayer do not engage in greater self-control than do people who are low in religiosity or do not pray.  The goal of the current research was to see if first completing a task that does not involve self-control similarly would undermine the positive effects of a religious prime on subsequent self-control and prosocial behavior.  In the first three studies, following a task that purportedly required self-control, people who were primed with religious concepts consistently exhibited greater self-control (Study 1) or prosocial behavior (Studies 2a or 2b) on a subsequent task than did people who were primed with neutral concepts.  However, after completing a task that should not necessitate self-control, the religious and neutral prime condition participants either did not differ in their performance on a subsequent task (Studies 1 and 2a) or the religious prime participants exhibited less self-control than did the neutral prime participants (Study 2b).  In Study 3, a distraction task was administered in between the prime task and the dependent measure.  This methodological change was sufficient to yield the religious priming effect consistently found in prior research and the first three studies regardless of whether or not the first task required self-control.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During my research to find real solutions for Aboriginal student success, I have come to understand that there is an overall, encompassing factor, which is fundamental in Aboriginal education, i.e. the importance of relationships.&#xD;
Through a process of qualitative study, I have reviewed literature and studied reports and case studies on successful Aboriginal schools, examined other models of education, and reviewed Aboriginal perspectives in education. Through this process, I explore the concept of relationships in regards to Indigenous education and how those relationships possess key components in finding solutions for Aboriginal student success. The relationships that I examine in this report are: Aboriginal peoples and Canada, the self, school, leadership, teachers, and parents and community. Embedded in each one of these relationships lies solutions for Aboriginal student success. &#xD;
Working on the relationship of Aboriginal Peoples and Canada starts with education. Education is key in promoting understanding and initiating change. Governance and Leadership is the success factor that was found most often by researchers in case studies of successful Aboriginal schools. The positive relationships between the physical, emotional/mental, intellectual and spiritual realms of the Self is a recommended concentration in Aboriginal education. Research shows that the relationships that exist within the School have a fundamental influence on the overall climate and the success of students within the school. The Teacher-student relationship is a central and most influential one in the school, one that could heed or hinder a child’s learning, therefore teacher education and recruitment programs should be examined in order to reflect on their role in the transformation of Aboriginal education. The relationship of Parents and Community in education should be considered as a key resource in Aboriginal education.  &#xD;
It is a time for change in Aboriginal education as more and more Canadians are becoming aware of the mistakes of our past, being educated on the current concerns, and recognizing the importance of this issue. Considering that the Aboriginal population is the fastest growing demographic in Canada, it is clearly an area of concern that not only impacts the Canadian Aboriginal population but impacts the Canadian population as a whole.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a multimeric complex of the electron transport system. The largest of the 10 nuclear-encoded subunits, subunit 4, contains two paralogs COX4-1 and COX4-2. In species studied to date (humans, rodents), COX4-1 is the more abundant paralog in all tissues, the highest expression of COX4-2 is found in brain and lung. In mammals, the two paralogs differ in hypoxia responsiveness; the COX4-2 gene is induced in response to hypoxia. The COX4-2 gene in other lower vertebrates (goldfish, zebrafish, anoles and turtles) did not appear to be hypoxia-responsive. To add to the current range of vertebrates studied, I examined the levels of COX4 transcripts and proteins in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) across tissues and in response to hypoxia. In contrast to mammals, (1) COX4-2 was the dominant isoform in most tissues, and (2) hypoxia did not trigger any consistent induction of the COX4-2 mRNA or protein levels.  Focusing on tissues that expressed both COX4-1 and COX4-2, I used immunohistochemistry to assess the intercellular patterns of expression. In most tissues (brain, gill, and liver) the distribution of COX4-1 and COX4-2 protein appeared to be specific to individual cells, with cells expressing predominantly one paralog or the other. However, in heart, individual myocytes appeared to express both COX4 paralogs, although select non-myocytes did not express detectible COX4-2. In addition to intertissue differences in relative paralog abundance, there were transitions seen in select tissues in relation to body size. Heart, for example, was dominated by COX4-1 mRNA and protein in small fish but transitioned to predominately COX4-2 in large fish. Collectively these studies show that fish COX4-2 differs from mammalian COX4-2 in that it is generally not hypoxia responsive, but more abundant in each tissue. Whether these differences are related to metabolic regulation in relation to hypoxic metabolism remains to be demonstrated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Information and communications technology (ICT) is increasingly being incorporated into undergraduate courses to use resources efficiently without compromising teaching and learning quality. While instructors have started to revisit the use of assessment as a means to support students’ learning by encouraging greater levels of self-directed learning, traditional forms of assessment are often resource-intensive. The use of online assessment can better support students’ learning by enabling students to take more assessments, resulting in more frequent feedback. Moreover, the features found within online assessments can make administration more accessible and efficient by decreasing the necessary level of external learning supports, which can benefit both students and faculty. These features are pertinent to the application of universal design to assessment, a set of principles that focuses on minimizing differences in access between students with and without disabilities.&#xD;
This research reports on a case study of an undergraduate psychology course that transitioned to online quizzes, replacing one of the course’s paper-based assessments. The quizzes set out to bring forth improvements in efficiency, feedback, self-directed learning, and accessibility through practices consistent with universal design. Based on faculty and student perceptions gathered through interviews, surveys, and focus groups, in addition to quiz data, the study aimed to identify the benefits and challenges of implementing these quizzes to support teaching and learning in a large-enrolment course. &#xD;
The study found that timing and scheduling issues during quiz administration interfered with the expectations of course staff. Consequently, students used the quizzes for unintended purposes (e.g., maximizing their marks). Moreover, because of these aforementioned issues, instructors did not express confidence that the quizzes were supporting student learning. Course administrators addressed these issues by changing the period of access one year, and then removing time limits the next. It was only after these two years that consistent and immediate feedback for students became possible; prior to these changes, among three desired properties of online assessment–accessible, efficient, and consistent–only two of them were satisfied at a given time. Thus the perceived usefulness of the quiz information (feedback) to teaching and learning was largely determined by the properties that were considered.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the fall of apartheid in 1994 came the erosion of previously demarcated social spaces throughout South Africa, a process which necessitated a drastic reimagining of South African national identity. Since this transition, South Africa has legislated the collapse of apartheid and the attendant reorganization of movements of people through urban landscapes while simultaneously negotiating its re-entry into international networks of commerce and cultural exchange. There are, however, numerous ways in which literary works have challenged the narrative of the “rainbow nation” by pointing to how South African urbanscapes physically manifest various anxieties of post-apartheid subjectivity. To illuminate this interaction, this thesis explores the interrelationship between formations of national identity and fictionalized representations of urban space in the works of Ivan Vladislavić. &#xD;
Vladislavić is an acclaimed yet surprisingly under theorized South African author whose work gestures to the conceptual challenge of rethinking the relationship between subjectivity and social space. Vladislavić's characters are frequently architects or city planners; his narratives focus on the symbology of the contemporary cityscape, enabling him to illustrate how, in the specific context of Johannesburg (the setting for each of his major works), imagining and representing space is foundational to understanding and influencing the material reality responsible for controlling human movement. The central contention of this thesis is that Vladislavić’s novels The Restless Supermarket, The Folly, and The Exploded View, provide a critique of urban development discourse by deconstructing discursive systems that produce static, closed, and diagrammatic spatial representations and in doing so reveal key ideological foundations of apartheid that both pre-existed and currently survive its formal regime. Additionally, his novels Double Negative and Portrait with Keys provide examples of alternative subjectivities whose spatial imaginations offer different vantage points for mapping the built environment that remain changeable and open to alterity and that therefore suggest a potential ethical response to existing inside/outside social demarcations that are currently spatially realized in South Africa.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examined group differences in theory of mind understanding of children with versus without a maternal history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and potential mechanisms underlying these differences, in particular, maternal mental state talk and physical touch. Children of depressed mothers have been shown to experience a number of negative outcomes; however, little is known about the effects of maternal MDD on children’s theory of mind understanding. In this study, children with (n= 19) and without (n= 44) a maternal history of MDD were administered a battery of four false belief tasks and a theory of mind scale. Children with a maternal history of MDD performed significantly poorer on the false belief battery compared to children without a maternal history of MDD. Regardless of diagnostic status, less maternal mental state talk was also related to poorer child performance on the false belief battery. Similarly, children experiencing little or moderate physical touch performed significantly poorer on the false belief battery compared to those receiving high physical touch. A lack of maternal vocal inflection was significantly related to less mother-child physical touch. The results remained while controlling for child language ability. Finally, child executive functioning did not significantly moderate relations between either maternal mental state talk or physical touch, and child false belief performance. Results are discussed in light of specific vulnerabilities to depression, with possible alternative explanations and directions for future research presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The MexCD-OprJ multidrug efflux pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a RND-type efflux system that is capable of exporting, and thus providing resistance to, multiple classes of clinically-relevant antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, β-lactams and macrolides. Although quiescent in wild-type P. aeruginosa, mexCD-oprJ is induced by membrane-damaging agents such as detergents and the biocide chlorhexidine (CHX), which perturb the cell envelope. Induction of mexCD-oprJ by membrane-damaging agents requires the envelope stress sigma factor AlgU, an indication that MexCD-OprJ is a component of the envelope stress response in P. aeruginosa. In the absence of CHX-mediated envelope stress, the expression of mexCD-oprJ is regulated solely by the NfxB repressor, which binds as a tetramer to the nfxB-mexC intergenic region to repress transcription of the mexCD-oprJ operon. Recently, a second repressor of mexCD-oprJ with homology to NfxB, EsrC, was discovered. In the absence of CHX-mediated envelope stress, the expression of esrC is negatively regulated by NfxB. In the presence of CHX-mediated envelope stress, the repressor activity of NfxB is alleviated and EsrC is produced, where it contributes to moderate repression of the mexCD-oprJ operon, which is expressed at moderate levels. Interestingly, EsrC requires NfxB in order to act as a repressor of the mexCD-oprJ operon. Consistent with previous research, this study demonstrated a physical interaction between NfxB and EsrC. In addition, this study showed that the C-terminal domains of NfxB and EsrC are required for the NfxB-EsrC interaction to occur. The demonstration of an interaction between NfxB and EsrC suggests that these two repressors co-regulate the expression of the mexCD-oprJ operon in the presence of envelope stress to either prevent the potentially detrimental effects of MexCD-OprJ overexpression, or to modulate mexCD-oprJ expression in response to multiple envelope stress signals which are recognized by the NfxB and EsrC components of the heteromultimeric repressor.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has recently gained interest as a potential regulator of anxiety-like behaviours. However, its anxiety-associated effects in the ventral hippocampus are not well known, even though this structure is also heavily implicated in anxiety regulation. The goal of this thesis was to investigate whether neuropeptide Y and its Y1 and Y2 receptors are associated with anxiety regulation in the ventral hippocampus. To determine whether NPY has a role in anxiety regulation in the ventral hippocampus, I infused rats with either NPY or vehicle control. Next, to determine whether the effects of NPY on anxiety-related behaviour are associated with the Y1 receptor, I infused rats with either the Y1 antagonist, BIBO 3304 or saline, followed by infusions of either NPY or saline just prior to testing (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, I infused the Y2 antagonist, BIIE 0246 prior to infusions of either NPY or saline. In all experiments, the rats were tested in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the shock-probe burying test (SPBT). Infusions of NPY alone into the ventral hippocampus decreased rats’ shock-probe burying duration (p = .007), but did not affect rats’ open-arm exploration (Experiment 1). This pattern of findings was replicated in Experiment 2 and 3. The results demonstrate that infusions of NPY into the ventral hippocampus powerfully suppress defensive burying in rats, while not affecting their open-arm activity. This suppression of burying was attenuated by infusions of BIBO 3304 but not BIIE 0246, suggesting that this anxiolytic-like effect is associated with the Y1, but not Y2, receptor. Thus, NPY seems to have an anxiolytic-like effect in the ventral hippocampus, in a test-specific fashion, that is associated with the Y1 receptor.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation investigates Indigenous new media artworks shown at Urban Shaman: Contemporary Aboriginal Art Gallery, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. I argue that Urban Shaman is an institution of Indigenous resurgence and translocal citizenship in Winnipeg. The new media artworks I examine operate as authoritative civic spaces by drawing upon Indigenous aesthetic traditions and new media technologies. The first chapter centers on new media artworks by artists Scott Benesiinaabandan (Anishinaabe) and Rosalie Favell (Métis), conveying Winnipeg’s histories through their artistic renditions of personal and public archives that frame Winnipeg’s city spaces. The chapter locates these works in conversation with artists Terril Calder (Métis) and Terrance Houle (Blood) whose new media artworks reframe and restage civic archives in Toronto and Calgary. The next chapter considers how new media artworks at Urban Shaman by Jude Norris, Nadia Myre, Jordan Bennett, and Terril Calder enact what I am calling Indigenous civic ecology, relating human and non-human elements of the city through Cree, Anishinaabe, Mi'kmaq and Métis genealogies. The final chapter discusses how new media artworks by Jason Baerg (Cree/ Métis), Rebecca Belmore (Anishinaabe), and Scott Benesiinaabandan (Anishinaabe) advance a lexicon of aesthetic values, particularly “travelling traditional knowledge” and “blood memory,” in response to globalization. This dissertation illustrates how new media artworks shown at Urban Shaman embody critical Indigenous methodologies in relationships of ongoing praxis. Ultimately, it demonstrates that Indigenous new media art functions as, and through, practices of translocal Indigenous citizenship, rearticulating urban civic ecology, and resurging, maintaining, and developing Indigenous epistemology and values in Winnipeg.   </dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research utilized topology and size optimization to optimize a lunar rover chassis in order to reduce structural mass while satisfying the required surface and launch vehicle loading criterion. Renewed interest in lunar exploration has provided an opportunity for Canada to participate in a Lunar Prospecting Mission in collaboration with NASA. Queen’s University, in collaboration with Neptec Design Group, has developed methodology to produce the structural design of a next generation lunar rover chassis using systematic design optimization techniques to minimize the structural mass of the chassis. Typical lightweight design can be achieved using lightweight materials, advanced manufacturing processes or systems, and design optimization. Due to the unique requirements for spacecraft, the proposed research is limited to specific materials and processes, therefore weight reduction is achieved exclusively through design optimization.&#xD;
The structural design was completed using a three stage design approach: Conceptual, Preliminary, and Detailed Design Stages. The Conceptual Design Stage developed chassis designs considering component layout and bounding box topology. The generated concepts were evaluated qualitatively to select the best candidates for design optimization. The Preliminary Design Stage utilized Hyperworks© Optistruct  commercial software to complete topology optimization to optimize the chassis bounding box topology while considering lunar surface and launch vehicle loading. The topology optimization results were then used to create preliminary optimum designs. In the detailed design stage, size optimization with Optistruct was used to refine the preliminary design further to produce a final optimum design which had characterized mass and structural performance. All optimization work was constrained to satisfy displacement, stress, and natural frequency constraints.&#xD;
The final optimum design reduced the weight of the chassis by 38.7% when compared to the baseline design while satisfying all required loading scenarios. By current valuation, this mass reduction can be valued at approximately $24 million dollars [2] from the current cost per kg of transporting payload on the lunar surface. This research has shown that new methods can achieve substantial weight reductions in the structural design of spacecraft. Mass reduction of the magnitude found in this research stands to have significant benefits to the development of future space exploration programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are the most abundant lymphocyte in early human and mouse decidua. UNK cell functions have been deduced by histopathologic comparisons of implantation sites between alymphoid (NK-T-B-), NK cell reconstituted alymphoid (NK+T-B-) and normal NK+T+B+ mice. Circulating (c)NK cells are reported to be absent from C57BL/6 mice genetically ablated for the transcription factor Nfil3 (cNK-T+B+) and these mice experience midgestation Th17 cell-mediated fetal loss when mated by BALB/c males. Recently, tissue resident subsets of NK cells have been described in this mouse. &#xD;
A histological time-course examination of syngeneic Nfil3-/- male x Nfil3-/- female and allogeneic BALB/c-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J&#x2028;male x Nfil3-/- female pregnancy (gestation day; GD 6.5-15.5) was performed to determine the consequences of a maternal cNK-T+B+ phenotype on pregnancy with an Nfil3-/- or Nfil3+/- conceptus. Whole mount immunofluorescence (WM-IF) was used as an additional technique to provide greater insights at midgestation. Nfil3 is a pleiotrophic factor; to examine Nfil3-dependent uNK cell-specific effects, pregnancies in Nfil3-/- bone marrow engrafted alymphoid mice (BME) were studied. &#xD;
UNK cells were less frequent in Nfil3-/- pregnancies and viability of Nfil3-/- implantation sites (IS) did not differ from wild type (WT) matings. Early gestation pathologies included impaired antimesometrial decidualization (AMD) and delays in lumen closure and embryo development (ED). WM examination revealed an enrichment of CD45+CD11c+ cells at GD 8.5 in Nfil3-/- IS compared to WT. Mid-late gestation placental development, including labyrinth vascular space area and interhemal membrane width, deviated significantly less from WT in allogeneic compared to syngeneic matings. BME and alymphoid placental development was similar to WT. Spiral artery (SA) remodeling did not occur in any experimental mating. &#xD;
Results of the present investigation suggest Nfil3-independent uNK cells do not promote AMD or GD 8.5 ED and cannot remodel SAs. Nfil3 plays a role in placental tissue layer (specifically labyrinth) development possibly through trophoblast-dependent mechanisms. The absence of Nfil3 may promote recruitment or differentiation of CD45+CD11c+ cells in the early gestation implantation site. Although not an effective model for studying NK-T+B+ pregnancy, the Nfil3-/- mouse deepens the understanding of innate lymphoid cells and their respective subsets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The vestibular system plays a role in postural control and spatial orientation. Ageing adversely affects vestibular function, postural control and the ability to maintain accurate spatial orientation. Study I investigated the interaction of vestibular input with lower limb somatosensory and visual inputs for head and trunk control during normal walking (NW) and narrow-based walking (NBW) and the effect of age on these interactions. The association of clinically measured functions of the vestibular system, lower limb somatosensation and vision with head/trunk control in the frontal plane during NW and NBW, and the impact of age were also examined. Study II evaluated the inter-trial reliability of three tools which can be used to screen for vestibular dysfunction via assessing spatial orientation, in young and older participants, and their sensitivity of these tools to age-related difference in vestibular function. In Study I, 15 young [25.40(3.56) years, 7 females and 8 males] and 15 older [72.60(5.33) years, 8 females and 7 males] were asked to perform NW and NBW. Vestibular, lower limb somatosensory and visual information was manipulated using galvanic vestibular stimulation, medium density foam and blurring goggles respectively; either concurrently or individually. The variables representing head control were more affected by visual and vestibular manipulation. The variables representing trunk control were more affected by lower limb somatosensory manipulation. Further, trunk roll angle during NW was significantly associated with lower limb vibration sensitivity, indicating the importance of lower limb somatosensory signals for trunk control. Age-related difference was only reflected in head control. In Study II, 15 young [28.27(4.61) years, 7 females and 8 males] and 15 older [75.47(4.42) years, 7 females and 8 males] were asked to perform 6 trials of each of the Fukuda Stepping Test (FST), Triangle Walking Test and Straight Walking Test. Reliability and variability of all the relevant variables in the tests were evaluated. Distance of displacement (DD) in the FST was the only variable that exhibited moderate to high reliability and acceptable variability in both age groups. DD was also significantly higher in the older group, suggesting its sensitivity to potential age-related difference in vestibular function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Electrical signaling by neural tissue is responsible for ~20% of the basal metabolic rate.  This high-energy consumption predisposes neural tissue to metabolic stress that can compromise signaling and cause irreversible damage. The locust central nervous system (CNS), however, has adaptive mechanisms for surviving metabolic stress and the axon of the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) of the locust visual system is capable of modulating high-frequency performance after an anoxic coma to conserve energy.  We investigated how other metabolic stresses could modulate the DCMD axon’s performance and what channels are involved in high-frequency signaling that may be a target for metabolic stress.  To investigate metabolic stress, we compared azide, a mitochondrial toxin, with starvation of 1- and 4-days.  We found azide caused a similar reduction in high-frequency signaling as previously reported after an anoxic coma, reducing conduction velocity (CV) and the number of elicited, high-frequency APs.  However, starvation had little effect on the DCMD's performance, and 1-day starvation increased the number of high-frequency APs, suggesting an increase in energy consumption.  So, given that after anoxic stress and during azide exposure, high-frequency APs are fewer and conduct slower, we explored mechanisms involved in faithful high-frequency conduction.  The DCMD has been previously reported to produce an afterdepolarizing potential (ADP) at high temperatures that could be caused by a T-type calcium channel that may improve high-frequency firing.  At high temperatures, we exposed the DCMD axon to cadmium and nickel, both calcium channel blockers, and observed a decrease in CV with a larger effect size for high-frequency APs.  Cadmium and nickel exposure also significantly increased the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that could be caused by blocking T-type calcium channel.  However, removal of extracellular calcium failed to confirm the presence of a calcium channel as it did not mimic exposure to divalent cation.  Persistent and resurgent sodium channels could also be responsible for the ADP and are known to be blocked by divalent cations. Computer modeling confirmed that a persistent sodium channel could shorten AHP and improve CV.  Therefore, we believe persistent sodium channels could be a source of modulation during metabolic stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis describes the preparation of several phosphine-borane species containing bulky aryl groups on the heteroatoms for steric protection. Depending on the system, they either exhibit interesting photophysical properties, unusual reactivity, or both, based on the environment around the heteroatoms as well as the linking unit connecting them. &#xD;
&#xD;
A highly congested P-B donor-acceptor compound with a 1,8-naphthalene backbone has been synthesized. Despite the high degree of steric congestion, this molecule was found to possess a P-B dative bond which persistents in solution. The new P-B molecule is thermally and photochemically inert, displaying no reactivity toward some common small molecules with the exception of halogens. The high stability of the molecule is attributed to the crowded environment around P and B, as well as the highly rigid 1,8-naphthyl linker. The reaction of this new P-B molecule with halogens in the presence of water leads to the formation of a P-O-B compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
An unbound U-shaped new phosphine-borane compound has been synthesized and displays distinct through-space CT transition and intense dual emission. The use of this new P-B compound in turn-on/switchable fluorescent sensing of fluoride has been demonstrated. The P-B compound was found to have a ratiometric response toward fluoride ions greater than that of the related N-B compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
Converting the unbound U-shaped donor-acceptor compound to its phosphonium salt greatly enhanced its fluoride binding affinity at the boron center by 2 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, despite the significant steric congestion present in the phosphine-borane species, it behaved as an effective ligand towards metal ions such as Au(I) and Pt(II) yielding their respective coordination complexes. In the case of the Pt(II) complex, it displayed interesting “turn-on” fluorescent to fluoride addition.&#xD;
Finally, the cationic phosphonium-borane compound was found capable of effectively tearing apart an NHC molecule, yielding a vinyl-amine bridged P-B species. In addition to IMe which plays a key role in its self-destruction, a FLP-like ylide-borane and IMeH+ salt have been identified as key species involved in this transformation. The balance of Lewis acidity/basicity and the cooperativity among the phosphonium/ylide, IMe, and borane appear to all be critical in this unprecedented fragmentation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Innovative strategies have been implemented within primary care across Canada to improve the quality of care that is delivered. One such strategy has been the utilization of interprofessional teams, of which nurses are an integral component. The overall purpose of this thesis was to understand nursing contributions within primary care, specifically related to chronic disease management.&#xD;
Objectives: (1) To determine the roles of nurses in chronic disease management and the extent to which chronic disease management strategies have been implemented within primary care in Ontario, (2) to identify data collection tools that describe/measure primary care organizational attributes, (3) to determine the distribution and nature of organizational attributes across primary care practices in eastern Ontario, and (4) to explore relationships between the presence of nurses within Family Health Teams in south eastern Ontario and Type 2 diabetes health outcomes.&#xD;
Methods: Four studies were performed to address the stated objectives. A provincial nursing survey was conducted to obtain information about the roles of nurses working in primary care in Ontario and the extent to which chronic disease management strategies have been implemented in practices in which nurses work. A systematic search and review was completed to identify data collection tools that collect a broader range of organizational attribute data within primary care. Using the ‘Measuring Organizational Attributes of Primary Health Care Survey’ organizational-level&#xD;
data from practices in eastern Ontario were collected and then linked to diabetic patient outcomes.&#xD;
Results: The nursing survey and organizational attribute survey identified that nurses engaged in a broad range of chronic disease management activities and that chronic disease management strategy implementation was not uniform across practices. Registered nurses were identified as the most prominent non-physician healthcare provider within practices, and the inclusion of registered&#xD;
nurses in practices was associated with improved diabetes outcomes.&#xD;
Conclusions: Nurses are an integral component of primary care and undertake many important activities to support chronic disease management. However, there is an ongoing need to clarify roles between different nursing regulatory designations. This thesis showed positive associations between having at least one registered nurse in a practice and diabetes management indicators.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Deep Geological Repository (DGR) is the globally preferred concept for long-term storage of nuclear waste, in which the combination of engineered barriers and the surrounding geology are designed to safely and securely contain the radioactive waste. The construction processes of underground openings in hard rocks at depth are commonly associated with introducing some damage to the surrounding rock mass through the initiation and propagation of fractures parallel to the excavation boundary due to disturbance to the in situ stress condition, as well as the excavation process quality. The induced fractures in depth away from the excavation surface can provide a migration path for the radionuclides in case of damage to the engineered barriers. Therefore, different damage zones are defined according to the crack density and change in hydraulic permeability of the rock mass surrounding the waste storage tunnel and rooms, these are commonly referred to as the Excavation Damage Zones (EDZs). Crack initiation (CI) and propagation (CD) characteristics of massive rock masses have a significant influence on the mechanics and geometry of EDZs, and this research aims to provide a better understanding of these parameters for brittle rocks.&#xD;
This research addresses the short- and long-term in situ behaviour of massive brittle rock masses through characterization of the micro-mechanics of crack initiation and crack damage progress for rock specimens in the laboratory. Particular attention is paid to formulize the laboratory estimation of the crack damage thresholds. The effect of inherent fabric in intact rocks on the fabric-guided micro-fracturing is investigated through laboratory tests on different rock types. Similarly, the influence of the excavation process (i.e. confinement) and geological processes such as the glacial cycle (i.e. stress fatigue) are investigated for different brittle rocks in the laboratory. &#xD;
A developed approach for a three-dimensional discontinuum Grain-Based Model (GBM) complemented the laboratory investigation of crack damage in brittle rocks. The developed approach provides an in-depth understanding of the micro-mechanics of crack damage and demonstrates great potential as a predictive design tool. Finally, the laboratory and numerical investigations are discussed within the context of the short- and long-term behaviour of excavation damage zones (EDZs).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Writing today is a means of communication: a medium through which we learn, share and self-express (Graham, 2006). In the classroom, writing is used to acquire, remember, and share knowledge; writing aids in the process of discovering, shaping and refining ideas about a topic (Durst &amp; Newell, 1989). Although writing instruction is a fundamental component of both Academic English and French Immersion language courses at the Grade 9 level (Ontario Ministry of Education, 1999, 2007), concern remains that many adolescents do not develop the skills necessary in writing to be successful in academic, workplace or personal life domains (Graham &amp; Perin, 2007). Yet, little research has been conducted to determine what teachers are doing instructionally at the high school level. &#xD;
This study investigated the described individual pedagogies of teachers regarding writing instruction within two Grade 9 language contexts: English and French Immersion. I interviewed seven teachers, one-on-one, about their approach to writing instruction and the function of writing within their classroom, either in person or over the phone. A corresponding document of teaching materials referenced by teachers during the interviews was conducted. The data were thematically analyzed individually, by participant, and then subsequently analyzed within and between language contexts. The data analysis yielded four recurring themes: (1) Perceived Individual Experiences and Beliefs Informing Practice, (2) Role of Curriculum, (3) Individual Teaching Practice, and (4) Assessment. The findings from this study suggest that teachers, based on their beliefs and experience, make informed pedagogical decisions within their classrooms to meet the needs of their students. Writing is used in a variety of forms, and is utilized as a vehicle for assessment of other strand requirements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) have long been known to help organisms resist freezing (antifreeze) or tolerate freezing (ice recrystallization inhibition). Discoveries made in my thesis research reveal a third function for an IBP, which is host adhesion to ice. The IBP found on the cell surface of an Antarctic Gram-negative bacterium, Marinomonas primoryensis, is part of an exceptionally large protein of 1.5 MDa. The highly motile M. primoryensis swims to ice and attaches to the surface to form bacterial clusters. We suggest that MpAFP facilitates the formation of bacterial communities or biofilms underneath lake or sea ice, where oxygen and nutrients are most abundant due to the photosynthetic activity of other microorganisms.&#xD;
MpAFP can be divided into five distinct regions. The N-terminal end (RI) attaches to the bacterial cell envelope, likely by binding to the cell wall peptidoglycan or other polysaccharides on the cell surface while spanning the outer membrane. Next are ~ 120 identical tandem repeats of a 104-aa Ig-like domain (RII) that makes up 90% of the protein. Region III, which contains a carbohydrate-binding domain, separates the highly repetitive region II (RII) from the moderately repetitive region IV (RIV). The 34-kDa RIV, which folds as a Ca2+- dependent β-solenoid, is the only ice-binding domain of MpAFP. At the C terminus RV also contains Ca2+-binding RTX repeats that may serve as the secretion sequence for the giant protein.&#xD;
Using a “dissect and build” approach I succeeded in piecing together &gt;95% of the structure of MpAFP. With this knowledge, I was able to postulate a general mechanism by which RTX adhesins enable their hosts to form biofilms by using a combination of surface adhesion and cell cohesion. X-ray crystallography suggests tandem arrays of the Ig-like repeats (RII) attract and slide along each other in an antiparallel fashion until their sugar binding domains lock onto each other’s’ surface glycans. Thus MpAFP not only binds the bacteria to ice but can potentially link the bacteria together in clusters to increase the total number of adhesins binding the group to the underside of ice where the environment is most favourable for growth.&#xD;
Given that many bacteria produce adhesins similar to MpAFP, work described in this thesis can be extended to give insight into the formation and disruption of other bacterial biofilms, including those of human pathogens.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introducing automated formal methods for large industrial real-time systems is an important research challenge. We propose timed process automata for modeling and analysis of time-critical systems which can be open, hierarchical, and dynamic. The model offers two essential features for large industrial systems: (i) compositional modeling with reusable designs for different contexts, and (ii) automated state-space reduction technique. Timed process automata model dynamic networks of continuous-time communicating control processes which can activate other processes. We show how to automatically establish safety and reachability properties of timed process automata by reduction to solving timed games. To mitigate the state-space explosion problem, an automated state-space reduction technique using compositional reasoning and aggressive abstractions is also proposed. Before working on timed process automata, we did a survey on semantics, decision problems, variants, and tools of timed automata. The insights gained from this survey motivated us to use timed game theory and Uppaal Tiga in a couple of industrial case studies and the development of timed process automata. Both the case studies show that state-space explosion is a severe problem for timed games.  Suitable abstractions, however, dramatically improve the scalability of timed games in one case study. These case studies motivate the development of timed process automata and an automatable state-space reduction technique for them based on aggressive abstraction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines and critiques how the intersections of race, gender, and class in our current neoliberal environment produce particular complexities that are unique to women within the global chain of care. I will specifically investigate how Filipinas engage in domestic work and create transnational labour trajectories that stretch from rural and urban spaces in the Global South (the Philippines), to intermediary households in international ports (Hong Kong) to urban centres in the Global North (Canada).  My project expands and nuances existing models of labour migration by Filipinas who perform domestic labour, seeking to understand the creative struggles and strategies they employ in order to create lives for themselves and their families within and outside the Philippines.  This project will investigate how these women’s journeys are informed by global neoliberal reform, and will examine the counterhegemonic strategies that Filipinas employ to resist exploitation.  By examining the larger macrostructures of global labour alongside the everyday experiences of women who are employed as domestic workers in the Philippines, intermediary countries, and Canada, I seek to also illustrate how these women are agents of resistance, carving out stable spaces for themselves in ever-shifting and uncertain geographical locations.  My thesis interweaves feminist theory and geographies, migrant policy, hegemonic discourse, personal interviews, and ethnographic data in order to explore how migrants are constantly reworking, contesting, and transforming hierarchal structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Traditionally, societies use to design their built environment in a way that was in line with the climate and the geographical location that they evolved in, thereby supporting sustainable lifestyles (i.e. thick walls with small windows in cold climates). With the industrial revolution and the heavy use and reliance on cheap fossil fuels, it can be argued that the built environment has become more focused on aesthetics and cost savings rather than on true sustainability.  This, in turn, has led to energy intensive practices associated with the construction of homes, buildings, cities and megalopolises.  Environmental concerns with regards to the future have pushed people, entities and industries to search for ways to decrease human’s energy dependency and/or to supply the demand in ways that are deemed sustainable. Efforts to address this concern with respect to the built environment were translated into ‘green buildings’, sustainable building technologies and high performance buildings that can be rated and/or licensed by selected certifying bodies with varying metrics of building construction and performance. The growing number of such systems has brought real concerns: Do certified sustainable buildings really achieve the level of sustainability (i.e. performance) they were intended to? For the purpose of this study, buildings’ energy consumption will be analysed, as it is one of the main drivers when taking into consideration greenhouse gas emissions. Heating and cooling in the residential and commercial/institutional sector, combined account for approximately a fifth of the secondary energy use in Canada. For this reason, this research aims at evaluating the main rating systems in Canada based on the efficacy of their rating systems’ certification methodology and the weighting and comparison of energy requirements under each scheme. It has been proven through numerous studies that major energy savings can be achieved by focusing primarily on building designs (such as Thermal Building Envelopes) and Passive Systems and that rating systems may wish to incorporate such criteria more thoroughly and explicitly within their evaluation scheme of metrics. Hence, this paper will also aim at evaluating the inclusion of energy conservation techniques into the different rating schemes. &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Laser material processing is becoming increasingly popular in various disciplines of science and industry due to its clean and quiet operation, absence of tool wear and high positioning accuracy. In particular, laser osteotomy ("bone cutting") offers new opportunities with its well-identified advantages over conventional methods utilizing mechanical saws/drills. However, lack of depth control is a long-standing barrier to wide clinical implementation. In-process monitoring and real-time feedback is highly desirable for depth-sensitive surgical operations where cutting is performed above critical tissues (e.g., brain surgery). In this work, a low-coherence imaging technique known as inline coherent imaging (ICI) is utilized to monitor bone ablation processes and provide depth information about the sample with on-the-fly signal processing. ICI is analogous to spectral domain optical coherence tomography with its sample arm built "inline" with the ablation laser beam path. ICI is capable of an imaging speed up to 240 kHz and a high dynamic range of over 60 dB. The laser system used for bone ablation is a 1070 nm ytterbium-doped fiber laser. Its fiber delivery allows flexible cutting angles to access hard-to-reach areas in surgery. Laser bone ablation by the fiber laser is characterized by percussion drilling experiments and ICI depth tracking of the sample. The ablation parameters are optimized for high ablation efficiency and minimal thermal damage. Closed-loop feedback based on in situ ICI measurement is developed to achieve controlled ablation with complexity and high precision. Designed features, including 1D holes, 2D trenches and 3D morphologies, are ablated with accuracy verified by an ex situ stylus profiler. The thermal damage to the surrounding bone tissue is assessed by histology. The heat-affected zone is quantified as 5-10 um for 3D features created on both fresh and dry bone samples. This proof-of-principle study shows promising potential for ICI-guided laser osteotomy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As wireless systems proliferate worldwide, interference is becoming one of the main problems for system designers. Interference, which occurs when multiple transmissions&#xD;
take place over a common communication medium, limits system performance. Wireless devices can coordinate the use of scarce radio resources in order to manage the interference and establish successful communication. To effectively deal with the interference problem, some wireless devices must have a certain level of knowledge about the interference. In practice, this knowledge comes at the expense of using more resources (such as employing a proper channel training mechanism). With the remaining available resources, the question is how to achieve reliable communication? This thesis investigates an information theoretic approach and employs several coding techniques to improve system performance by either cancelling the interference or extracting knowledge from it about the information signal.&#xD;
The  first part of this thesis considers the transmission of information signals over a fading channel that is disturbed with additional interference. The system's information&#xD;
theoretic limit in terms of mean square error distortion is assessed. Moreover, hybrid coding schemes are proposed and analyzed to obtain an achievable performance.&#xD;
As an extension to this problem, source channel-state estimation is investigated; in this case, the receiver is interested in estimating the information signal and the channel-state (interference). It is shown that the achievable performance is close to the derived limit. Motivated by multi-terminal systems, the transmission of a pair of sources over the two-user Gaussian broadcast channel in the presence of&#xD;
interference is then studied. Inner and outer bounds on the system's mean square error distortion are obtained. Unlike the  first part of the thesis, in the second part, two additional constraints are added to the picture: 1) low coding delay and 2) low complexity. Similar communication scenarios as the ones in the first part are investigated under low delay&#xD;
and complexity requirements. These two constraints are motivated by the increased popularity of wireless sensor networks; a sensor node, often conceived as having limited&#xD;
lifetime and processing power, communicates its sensed field information to a fusion centre over a noisy wireless channel. To meet these challenges, we propose to use analog source-channel mappings. Parametric and nonparametric mappings are investigated in this last part of the thesis; it is noted that parametric mappings based on spiral and sawtooth curves are able to outperform linear scheme. Moreover, nonparametric mappings based on joint optimization of the encoder and the decoder are shown to outperform other low delay schemes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cardiopulmonary control relies on local and central integration of sensory inputs and reflex efferent signaling. Heart and lung sensors, integrators, and effectors are routinely studied in a reductionist manner to elucidate molecular mechanisms. This is accompanied by a need to explore mechanisms of cardiopulmonary integration within the autonomic nervous system. I focused on two elements of cardiopulmonary regulation: in vivo afferent signaling from the lung, and the use of whole animal heart rate variability (HRV) as a window into cardiac control in mammals and an aquatic invertebrate. In the former I characterized the mechanosensitivity of 85 single murine slowly-adapting receptors (SARs) to address the hypothesis that polymodal neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) are linked with mechanosensitive SARs via a common vagal afferent population by assessing the impact of: i) chemostimulation (10% O2 or 10% CO2); ii) pharmacologic blockade (serotonergic - tropisetron or purinergic-suramin); and iii) loss of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on quasi-static SAR signaling. Expression of CaSR is reported in murine NEBs and implicated in asthma pathogenesis. Loss of CaSR increased NEB size and proliferative markers (immunohistochemical staining); however, we found no evidence for NEB-SAR interactions based on Na+/K+-ATPase staining. Murine SARs possess greater mechanosensitivity than reported for large mammals, and loss of CaSR reduced SAR mechanosensitivity by &gt; 35%. Chemostimulation/pharmacologic antagonism had minor effects on SAR behaviour, consistent with minimal NEB-mechanosensor interactions. To address the later, I applied in vivo HRV analysis to assess autonomic (ANS) control in the development of murine airway hyperresponsiveness. Sensitization decreased HRV prior and subsequent to antigen challenge, suggesting that HRV reflects early changes in ANS function and may be useful in the detection of early lung disease. I also applied HRV analysis for the first time in juvenile Pacific oysters using a novel, non-invasive video-microscopy method developed to assess HR/HRV during acute temperature changes in oysters acclimated to 22°C or 10°C. Acclimation to 10°C reduced the incidence of asystole and increased HRV vs. warm-temperature acclimation. HRV increased as temperature (and HR) decreased in both acclimation groups. Application of HR/HRV analyses in oysters may provide a new tool to optimize aquaculture rearing protocols and explore the ontogeny of cardiac control in a simple model organism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The function of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is crucial for the development and proliferation of normal human breast cells. The primary activity of GR is in its binding to glucocorticoids and the subsequent activation of its transcriptional target genes. However, GR is also able to transcriptionally regulate target genes in the absence of ligand in EPH4 mouse mammary cells, which is termed the unliganded activity of GR. Unliganded GR stimulates the activity of the BRCA1 and CH25H promoters and is important in modulating apoptosis and cell growth. The activity of unliganded GR in normal human breast cell lines was investigated in this study in order to validate its regulatory role. Unliganded GR did not upregulate BRCA1 or CH25H expression in the human breast cell lines MCF-10A and 184-hTERT. As well, no novel target genes of unliganded GR were identified in normal human breast cells, however both PRLR and CDKN1A were found to be negatively regulated by liganded and possibly unliganded GR respectively. &#xD;
The second portion of this study focused on the exploration of the role of GR in modulating tamoxifen response in ER+ breast cancer. GR was overexpressed in response to tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer cells in the ER+ cell lines MCF-7 and T47D. As well, GSTM1 expression was increased by tamoxifen in a GR-dependent manner which suggests that downstream GR signaling is also increased in response to tamoxifen. This is crucial as it suggests that the increase in GR leads to increased GR activity and signaling. The ERα pioneer factor, FOXA1 was overexpressed by tamoxifen as well and may be responsible for activating GR overexpression. Finally, loss of GR may initiate a survival signal in ER+ cells as tamoxifen also increased the expression of cancer stem-like marker genes, EpCAM and ALDH1A3. EpCAM expression was found to be upregulated by tamoxifen and loss of GR expression and ALDH1A3 expression was increased 5-fold by tamoxifen alone. This upregulation of cancer stem-like markers suggests that tamoxifen resistance could occur through the formation of a stem-like chemotherapeutic resistant cell population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates two aspects of precast concrete insulated sandwich wall panels, namely mechanical connections and fatigue behaviour. In the first part, flexural tests were performed on panels with various end support conditions, loading orientations, and reinforcement and shear connector materials. Bolted angle connections were used to simulate practical support conditions, while loads were applied in a manner to simulate windward pressure as well as suction. Panels with steel and basalt fibre-reinforced polymer (BFRP) longitudinal reinforcement were tested and compared. Discrete steel and BFRP shear connectors were also used and evaluated. The bolted angle connections provided partial end fixity, thereby increasing the overall strength and stiffness relative to identical panels simply supported by rollers during testing. In all cases the bolted connections succeeded in developing the full strength of the sandwich panels. Panels with steel reinforcement failed due to rupturing of flexural reinforcement, while a panel with BFRP reinforcement failed due to rupturing of shear connectors and crushing of concrete in one wythe. Panels loaded in the direction of wind pressure achieved higher peak loads than identical panels loaded to simulate suction. An analytical model accounting for material nonlinearity, end support conditions and partial composite action from the shear transfer system was developed. The model accurately predicted flexural stiffness, while the peak load was underestimated in most cases. &#xD;
In the second part of the study, seven fatigue tests were performed on four panels with either steel or BFRP flexural reinforcement and shear connectors. Cyclic bending was conducted at two loading amplitudes: a high (Pdef) and a low (Pstr) load, representing serviceability limits for deflection and stress, respectively; both considerably higher than the maximum national wind load. The effect of a moderate axial load, as in loadbearing walls, was examined. The panels initially had a Degree of Composite Action (DCA) of 76-84%. The axially-loaded steel-reinforced panel achieved 1M cycles under Pstr, then another 1M under Pdef. Its DCA reduced to 73 then 65%. Without axial load, 1M and 0.24M cycles were achieved under Pstr and Pdef, and DCA reduced to 69 and 22%, respectively. The BFRP-panel failed at 0.07M cycles at Pstr. Its DCA reduced from 76 to 69%. It was then axially loaded and retested successfully to 1M cycles. Stiffness degradations of 12-50% consistent with DCA reductions were observed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neurons, though highly metabolically active, have a poor capacity for nutrient storage and are sensitive to energy fluctuations. One mechanism for maintaining energetic homeostasis involves activation of the heterotrimeric AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cell- autonomous sensor to energetic changes regulated by ATP to AMP ratios. Starvation, which reduces nutrient availability, has been shown to decrease susceptibility to spreading depression (SD) in Locusta migratoria. Although AMPK activation is thought to be involved in this phenomenon, its presence has not yet been confirmed in the locust. In my thesis I established that AMPK is present in locust neural tissue, and that starvation increases its activation. I also investigated the effects of manipulating AMPK activity, via pharmacological agents and RNA interference (RNAi), on ouabain-induced SD in fed and starved locusts. Application of 5x10-5 M A-769662, a potent AMPK activator, did not have an effect on susceptibility to or recovery from ouabain-induced SD, in either fed or starved animals. Increasing the concentration of A-769662 to 10-4 M also yielded no significance. However, injecting AMPK dsRNA reduced the number of preparations that displayed SD-like events. This suggests that RNAi-mediated downregulation of AMPK decreased susceptibility to SD. Overall, I provide evidence of AMPK’s involvement in potassium ion homeostasis, which may further our understanding of SD and its effects within the nervous system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is well established in the medical education literature that raters represent a significant source of unexplained variance in performance assessments. To better understand the variance associated with raters’ evaluative judgments, this dissertation investigated how raters, in various assessment contexts, communicate and articulate what they observe during performance assessments. Empirical data collected from three different performance assessments: a multiple mini-interview (MMI), an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and workplace-based assessments (WBAs) were analyzed to better understand raters’ behaviours. Relationships that exist between different forms of assessment were also examined. The first study established a proof of concept, showing that raters are not always consciously aware of the associations they make during assessments. The second study examined conditions under which raters find it difficult to make a seemingly uncomplicated judgment. Finally, the third study examined relationships that exist between quantitative and qualitative methods used in the evaluation of performance assessments. The empirical findings from this dissertation suggest that although raters may behave idiosyncratically, there exist patterns of behaviour that could be used to attain better information from raters about a learner’s performance and potentially allow raters to be more suitably matched according to their strengths in performance-based assessments. The findings of this research should help to overcome some of the challenges associated with rater-mediated assessments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Elegy is an appropriate mode for expressing the complex feelings that may accompany an awareness of the state of human-caused climate change and the concomitant ailing health of the biosphere.  In order to understand these contemporary concerns, I look back to the early part of the twentieth century, when the cataclysms of global wars and their destructive effects on human and other-than-human life inspired the first generation of modern ‘resistant’ elegists.  Like modernist anti-war elegies, the contemporary ecological (visual) elegies – by artists such as Brandon Ballengée, Edward Burtynsky, Gwen Curry, Chris Jordan, Deborah Samuel, Kade Twist, and me – that I examine engage in deliberate, ethical mourning and melancholia to both express and demand affective engagement with ecological issues in an ultimately hopeful attempt to create a better future.  It is my hope that such works inspire viewers to think critically about their own potential to engage in what Clifton Spargo would call “wishful interventions” with regard to climate crisis.  The second part of the dissertation text is an ‘analytical archive’ of the ecological artworks that form the main component of my Ph.D. work, including Augury : Elegy, Indicator, National Elegy, 1,000 Flyers, and Vernal Pool.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>From 1929 to 1947 the city of Montreal was renegotiating the boundaries of belonging. This dissertation examines the relationship between the left and the city during this period of crisis. Attempts to impose order on the chaos of the period – from deportation to an all-out war on leftism – serve as valuable fault-lines in notions of citizenship and exclusion. Reinterpreting Montreal’s history in this period through Zygmunt Bauman’s conception of cultural modernity, this study challenges notions of Montreal’s left as lacklustre. It also probes the contours of municipal and clerical definitions of ‘Montrealer.’ Complicating existing scholarship on Montreal’s left as compliant, this dissertation broadens the definition of leftism and recasts leftists as resistant to state and clerical repression – not as passive victims of Montreal’s Grande Noirceur but as active participants in modern planning for the future of the city. &#xD;
Modernity is the common thread that weaves this dissertation together. This study opens with the Catholic Church – exemplified here by the École sociale populaire – as it attempts to redefine belonging in opposition to the radical left. It turns to the City of Montreal’s attempts to purge ambivalence through mass deportation campaigns that treated the unemployed and the foreign-born as outsiders to modern Montreal. It then examines a series of vigorous left moments as case studies of repression and resistance: Albert Saint-Martin’s Université ouvirère, the sedition trials of the 1930s, the Canadian Youth Congress, the Padlock Act, the War Measures Act, and Henri Gagnon’s Ligue des vétérans sans-logis.  &#xD;
In so doing, this study argues that Montreal’s leftists, though cast as enemies by the state, contested their status as ‘outsiders’ by engaging with modernity on their own terms. While there were crushing defeats, there were also significant victories. In these diffuse, linguistically diverse communities, we find Montreal’s left developing an alternative vision of the city. Moments of convergence between Montreal’s French-Canadian students and the Anglophone-dominated CPC bear witness to the power of the left to challenge state-sanctioned repression. These leftists saw themselves as part of a larger global movement for change, peace, and a better tomorrow – one which concentrated on challenging narrow notions of belonging in Montreal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goals of this research are to better understand the impact of wall section loss due to corrosion as well as the influence of different failure mechanisms on corrugated steel culverts. An accelerated corrosion technique was first developed to degrade multiple pipe specimens to different degrees of deterioration. A total of six deteriorated pipe specimens were created. Two dimensional maps of the remaining wall thickness of each specimen were then developed using an ultrasonic thickness gauge, showing that the average remaining wall thicknesses for the samples ranged from 18% to 47%. Seven corrugated steel pipes specimens (six accelerated corroded samples and one intact pipe) were then buried in the test pit at Queen’s University and examined under single wheel loading at both 0.9 m and 0.45 m of cover. The test results show that the surrounding soil compaction has a greater impact on the overall behaviour of corrugated metal culverts than the level of deterioration. However, the results suggest that a potential for a critical level of corrosion may exist which dictates the controlling failure mechanism. Current design procedures may consider the wrong failure mode in some instances, as the capacity of the intact pipe tested in this study was controlled by local bending in the top half of the pipe rather than thrust at the springlines. Lastly a full scale test was conducted on an intact horizontal ellipse culvert to understand the behaviour of these structures during backfilling and live loading. The horizontal ellipse culvert was tested at two different burial depths (0.9 m and 0.45 m) using tandem axle loading. The results suggest that the ellipse behaves similar to a circular culvert during backfilling, although the vertical stiffness of the ellipse was less than the horizontal stiffness. The live loading of the culvert suggests that the load carrying mechanism changes from thrust at 0.9 m of cover to bending at 0.45 m of cover. The structure ultimately failed due to the formation of a three-hinge plastic collapse mechanism across one shoulder.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ancient Green philosopher Sextus Empiricus provides us, in the Outlines of Skepticism, with arguably the most complete surviving account of Pyrrhonian Skepticism. He conceived of Skepticism as a way to live your life peacefully, free from the worries that are caused by oppositions in the world around us. For every claim, there is an equally plausible opposition, and this creates stress for the dogmatist. The Skeptic, on the other hand, by recognizing that there are oppositions and thus practicing suspension of judgement along with investigation, is able to be tranquil in the face of oppositions. To better be able to understand Skepticism, it is useful to see a practical application. Therefore, I will argue that Rick Blaine, from 1942’s Casablanca, matures into a Skeptic during the course of the film. Although the film is a work of fiction, there is enough character development to argue that the earliest version of Rick chronologically is not a Skeptic. As the film progresses, we can see his development and at the end of the film he is able to face making the decision to send his love, Ilsa, away without experiencing turmoil. I will also argue that the film has Skeptical qualities of its own which mean that it should be read as more than a wartime propaganda piece. Both of these arguments will be shown by completing a close reading of the film’s script, written by Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, as documented in Casablanca: Script and Legend by Howard Koch as well as my viewings of the film. The reading has been organized into the four phases that Rick experiences in his relationship with Skepticism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the global demand for nickel continues to increase and the nickel sulphide ore deposits are depleted, there is considerable interest in the exploitation of the nickeliferous laterite ores. However, current processing methods suffer from an inability to effectively concentrate the nickel content of the ore prior to processing, resulting in high costs and significant waste streams. One of the most promising methods of addressing this challenge is the selective reduction of the laterite ore to form a ferronickel alloy, followed by magnetic separation to recover the alloy, forming a nickel concentrate. The current work investigates several phenomena in the selective reduction process with the aim of identifying the conditions which yield the largest ferronickel particles, while still maintaining a sufficiently high nickel grade in the ferronickel. In particular, the effects of varying coal, sulphur, pyrite, and sodium sulphate additions, and reduction temperatures in the range of 1000 to 1200°C, have been investigated. By maximizing the ferronickel particle size it is expected that the nickel grade in the magnetic concentrate can be improved.&#xD;
The best results were achieved for the reduction of a limonite containing 6% coal and 4% elemental sulphur additions at 1100°C for 1 hour. Under these conditions an average ferronickel particle size of 1.59 μm and nickel grade of 4.96% was achieved, compared to 1.01 μm and 8.18% for the same ore and reduction conditions without the addition of sulphur. In general, increased coal and sulphur additions, and increased temperature, correlated with increased ferronickel particle size and decreased nickel grade in the limonite. In the case of a saprolite, the addition of sulphur appeared to decrease the average ferronickel particle size.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is an examination of Russian liberal thought, its durability, and its tensions in exile in interwar France.  Through analysis of archival documents and contemporary pamphlets, memoranda, and print media, this thesis adds new dimensions to the scholarship on Russia Abroad, Russian liberalism, and exile politics.  Russian liberal groups and actors held and established particular myths about their ideal homeland and harnessed critical occasions to elaborate their evolving ideology regarding the health, strength, and ‘greatness’ of the Russian state while addressing threats they perceived for their realization parallel to the existence of Soviet regime at home.  After October: Russian Liberalism as a ‘Work in Progress,’ 1919-1945 unpacks the lively political history of this stateless exile community as it sought ways to connect to the homeland and work for the improvement of the state and its people in spite of their spatial and political alienation.  Throughout, this thesis emphasizes key concerns for Russian liberals including the territorial unity and security of the state, its level of modernity and civilization vis-à-vis the West, the need to build a liberal democratic federal republic after Bolshevism, and the creation of a free, educated, loyal, and active citizenry capable of contributing to the socio-political commonweal.  Numerous tensions emerged in liberal thought and approach, indicating that their liberal visions of the state were very much still a work in progress.  Their continued efforts to elaborate on their values in response to developing circumstances at home and abroad show how Russian liberals created and maintained for themselves a sense of purpose and identity throughout the interwar period.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Magnetic Barkhausen Noise emissions are discontinuous magnetization changes within&#xD;
ferromagnetic materials that have been subjected to changing applied magnetic fields. These emissions are sensitive to microstrutural variations and stress states of the material, which can adversely affect magnetic properties or structural integrity of engineering components. Therefore, magnetic Barkhausen noise has potential as a non-destructive testing technique for indirect materials evaluation. However, simultaneous dependence of Barkhausen noise emissions on metallurgical variables, physical&#xD;
features and stress state of the material complicates its data interpretation. The purpose of the present thesis was, therefore, to address these complexities by comparing Barkhausen noise signal characteristics from different ferromagnetic steel grades, all using the same measuring system under reproducible flux-controlled magnetization conditions. This is in contrast to the majority of literature Barkhausen noise investigations, which have focused on case studies using different probes and systems under unknown conditions of flux, which therefore limits their comparability. Various steel grades were tested, including transformer and electric motor laminates, submarine hull steel, deep-drawing steel and low to high plain carbon steels. Barkhausen noise signal parameters were correlated with core loss, grain size, crystallographic texture, hysteresis characteristics and the amount of carbon content. The significant contribution&#xD;
of this thesis was to examine the influence of steel grade on tensile stress-response of Barkhausen noise. The experimental results were explained in terms of domain wall dynamics and a basic theory was developed as a starting point to model the behavior mechanism of Barkhausen noise under tensile stress. This work contributes to the further development and calibration of Barkhausen noise technology for magnetic non-destructive assessment of ferromagnetic steel components.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For many, toponyms, or place names, appear to provide objective descriptions of locations on the earth. But for geographers, names and naming practices are imbued with meaning, and a recent literature of critical toponymy has emerged that studies and recognizes place names as discursive agents of power and resistance that perform active roles in the ongoing production of place. However, the critical toponymy corpus had produced very little theoretically rich empirical research focusing how urban planning and policymaking processes mobilize place names, or how residents fight against such activities. This thesis fills that lacuna, first by generating a novel theoretical framework (toponymic assemblage) that describes the emergent, relational, and spatially grounded properties of place names. It then outlines a robust, extended, and mixed method case study approach that uses archival/newspaper documentation, discourse analysis, and interview data to form a historically based, theoretically driven, and structurally aware study of toponyms in relation to planning and policymaking. The thesis then presents two empirical case studies based in Vancouver, Canada’s impoverished Downtown Eastside (DTES) that are centred around the name “Japantown,” a toponym that recalls the neighbourhood’s long-time inhabitation by a community of Japanese Canadians who were forcibly uprooted from the Pacific coast during World War II. Specifically, this thesis situates contemporary neighbourhood conflicts within a historical context by constructing an interwoven analysis of toponymic assemblages in the DTES (including “Japantown”), noting how they emerged over time in relation to interventions such as planning, policymaking, the media, and activism while highlighting their fluid, malleable, and potential qualities. It then focuses on a recently enacted Local Area Planning Process (LAPP) in the DTES to illuminate how toponymic assemblages like “Japantown” were mobilized through planning to change understandings of place at the expense of current low income residents. The thesis concludes by considering the theoretical and positional limitations of the research, then suggests directions for future study and activism by highlighting how a more complete understanding of toponymic power and its limits can inform rights-based engagement among disparate groups.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis argues that the strongest account of moral rights entails that animals and other marginal cases hold rights. The thesis contends that mutual advantage social contract theories offer the strongest account of rights from a security perspective, and that such theories entail rights for animals and marginal cases. Both of these claims are widely contested. Chapter 1 examines the fundamental elements of a social contract theory as developed by Hobbes and Hume. Chapter 2 revises the fundamental elements of contract theory to make them more persuasive, and derives from them an account of rights for animals and marginal cases. Chapter 3 examines the most plausible competing accounts of rights for animals and marginal cases: utilitarianism, neo-Kantianism, and capability theory. Chapter 4 argues that the mutual advantage account of rights is better than the leading competitors from a security perspective.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Brachiopod shell chemistry is a commonly used proxy in paleoceanography and paleoclimate studies because their shells are composed of diagenetically-resistant low-Mg calcite and are, for the most part, in chemical equilibrium with ambient seawater. Few studies have evaluated a large database of brachiopods from a single stratigraphic interval across an extensive depositional system. The lateral isotopic variability across a carbonate shelf is, therefore, not well understood.  The southern margin of Australia is a vast, latitude-parallel continental shelf that is host to the largest cool-water carbonate depositional system in the modern world. Brachiopods are continuously distributed across the shelf. The zonal orientation of the southern margin results in a continental-scale system that falls within a single climatic and oceanographic zone. This study evaluates the δ18O and δ13C values of 936 samples from 442 specimens collected from modern shelf sediments at 222 sites across ~3000 km of the southern shelf. An additional 60 samples from 11 select specimens were analyzed for Mg and Sr concentrations. A detailed evaluation of intraspecimen trace elements and stable isotopes reveals the distribution of apparent equilibrium calcite within shells of south Australian brachiopods and helps to understand the source of non-equilibrium chemistry related to vital effects. The large, laterally extensive database of brachiopod δ18O and δ13C is in excellent agreement with modern oceanographic measurements and shows the range in primary stable isotopic values that naturally occur within an individual specimen, at a single site, and across an entire continental shelf. Furthermore, brachiopod stable isotopes record the details of seasonal changes in oceanography that are known to occur on the southern shelf, such as upwelling and downwelling events. Some isotopic values occur outside the range of equilibrium calcite values and are attributed to either individual vital effects or oceanographic processes that have not yet been detected by modern oceanographic measurements. This is one of the first studies to evaluate the synsedimentary stable isotopic and trace element variability that could have been present in ancient carbonate systems, and these results now make it possible to gauge the environmental and biochemical effects recorded in a suite of fossil brachiopods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The premise of parent-centered programs for parents of anxious children is to educate and train caregivers in the sustainable implementation of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the home. The existing operationalization of parent involvement however, does not address the systemic, parent, or child factors that could influence this process. The qualitative approach of grounded theory was employed to examine patterns of action and interaction involved in the complex process of carrying out CBT with one’s child in one’s home. A grounded theory goes beyond the description of a process, offering an explanatory theory that brings taken-for-granted meanings and processes to the surface. The theory that emerged from the analysis suggests that CBT implementation by mothers of anxious children is characterized by the evolution of mothers’ perception of their child from being ‘held back’ to being ‘mostly independent with ongoing needs’ and mothers’ perception of their role from being a ‘comforter/protector’ to being a ‘supporter/advocate’. This process allows a strategic shift in parenting strategies from reacting with emotion to responding pragmatically to the child. Changes occur as mothers recognize the crisis, make links between the treatment rationale, child’s symptoms, and their own parenting strategies, integrate tenets of CBT for anxiety, and eventually focus on sustaining therapeutic gains through natural life transitions. Mothers whose anxious child made threats of suicide and/or engaged in non-suicidal self-injury experience distinct phases and challenges. This theory widens our understanding of mothers’ role, therapeutic engagement, process, and decision-making. It allows clinicians to provide better support, anticipate difficulties, and to respond accordingly. The theory generates also new hypotheses regarding parent involvement in the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders, and proposes novel research avenues focused on mothers’ cognitions and parenting strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis concerns itself with a potential relationship between environmental philosophy and the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. Taking up the question of modern technology as a prima facie cause of environmental damage, I delve into Heidegger’s deeper analysis of this phenomenon and its meaning for human life and the world. I focus on the boundless aspiration of technology, seeking to reveal the world in its entirety as standing reserve. What Heidegger calls Gestell or ‘enframing’ aims to create a system which values and finds meaning in mere utility alone. Such a world becomes unconcerned with the unique and individual expression and meaning of things, levelling these things into undifferentiated and anonymous resources. If place entails a sense of meaning and being with things, humanity loses their place becoming ‘homeless.’ I also demonstrate a second-order aspect of this boundlessness as being concerned with unlimited potential for the ‘human project.’ Both I take as indicating a cause for the environmental damage we now notice. The problem is to reacquaint ourselves with a proper sense of place, and to find meaning with things, treating them appropriately. Heidegger calls this dwelling. This is perhaps the true theme of this paper. I discuss further the concepts of poiesis and techne, as well as poetic thinking, as avenues that allow for dwelling to occur. This is the positive solution that I critically engage with as a potential basis for an environmental philosophy. In the final chapters, I examine the potential of dwelling with machines, and the re-orientation in thinking that could allow for this. While some reservations may be made for connecting Heidegger’s philosophy with environmental concerns, I conclude that Heidegger’s thought as a whole offers a way for us to begin thinking about finding meaning and value that is non-instrumental. It is this thinking that contributes most to a proper environmental philosophy and attitude.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My doctoral project is a study of how art was used in the promotion and dissemination of colonial ideologies and in the recruitment of settlers to Canada in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, specifically under the aegis of Clifford Sifton as Canada's Minister of the Interior from 1896 to 1905. My project interrogates the content and dissemination of immigration advertising, establishes its role in the cultural production of settler and national imaginaries, and appropriates its tactics to build creative strategies of decolonization in contemporary sites. To this end, my project operates in two, interrelated ways: first, by establishing the colonialist agenda of immigration advertising through an integrated interrogation of primary sources using critical visual and theoretical analysis, and second, by appropriating and subverting Sifton's tactics of visual communication to create a series of artworks that critically reactivate and reframe this material in such a way that its ideological thrust and colonialist underpinnings are made apparent. &#xD;
	My project develops through creative practice in four ways. It examines the potential for creative practice to disrupt the ongoing cultural performance of settler colonialism, to open the reproductive practices of settler colonialism to critical reflection, to recruit participation in decolonization, and to actively operate in creating strategies of reimagining and restorying. I develop this work through practice-based research methodology, self-reflexively, from my perspective as a settler, settler descendant, and treaty person, focusing on a settler audience to contribute to anticolonial dialogues and conciliation in contemporary sites.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A single layer of cells, called the endothelium, lines the arteries of the human body. In response to an increase in blood flow-associated shear stress, these cells stimulate an endothelial-dependent, flow-mediated dilation (FMD). FMD resulting from a transient vs. a sustained stimulus may provide distinct information regarding endothelial function. Previous findings have shown that repeated, isolated increases in shear stress via forearm heat training improve brachial artery FMD in response to a transient shear stress stimulus (TS-FMD). However, the effects of heat training on FMD assessed in response to a sustained shear stress stimulus (SS-FMD) in the lower limb vasculature has not been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to determine the impact of heat training on superficial femoral artery (SFA) shear stress on SFA FMD, assessed via TS-FMD (created via reactive hyperemia following release of thigh occlusion) and SS-FMD (created via plantar flexion exercise). Thirteen healthy female participants (23 ± 2 years) underwent 8 weeks of unilateral lower limb heat training in 42.5C water for five 35-min sessions/wk. Biweekly assessments of TS- and SS-FMD were conducted in both the heated and unheated limbs. SFA diameter and blood velocity (for determination of FMD and the shear stress stimulus) were assessed using echo and Doppler ultrasound, respectively. The stimulus for TS-FMD and SS-FMD was stable over the 8 weeks of training (p = 0.113 and p = 0.540, respectively) and not different between limbs (p = 0.705 and p = 0.073, respectively). In the control limb, TS-FMD was lower at weeks 4 (p = 0.012) and 8 (p = 0.011) vs. week 0. SS-FMD did not change over time (p = 0.220) in either limb (p = 0.246). The main findings of this study suggest that 8 weeks of heat training and the associated shear stress stimulus in the SFA: 1) may have prevented a decline in %TS-FMD, and 2) did not affect the FMD response to a sustained increase in shear stress. This suggests that 8 weeks of repeated lower limb heating does not increase shear stress to levels that improve SFA endothelial function in healthy, young females.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a philosophical exploration of “agnotology”, the study of ignorance or non-knowledge, and focuses on the production of ignorance for private interests. In particular, I argue that corporate science often deliberately produces ignorance in an effort to promote corporate interests. My thesis is structured into five chapters. In Chapter 1, I introduce agnotology and outline Robert N. Proctor’s three categories thereof: ignorance as native state, ignorance as selective choice, and ignorance as active construct. In Chapter 2, I present a review of the agnotological literature on the basis of which I argue for two expanded categories of ignorance: ignorance from ideology, and ignorance from interest. In Chapter 3, I address the question of the normative assumptions underlying agnotology. As well, given agnotology’s task of unpacking the values laden in science, agnotology’s normative conception of science may stand in tension with a conception of science as objective, neutral inquiry. In the end, I argue that agnotologists need not deny science’s objectivity when they view science as value-laden. In Chapter 4, I present a case study. Through an agnotological analysis, I argue that some HPV vaccine legislation was passed via agnogenesis. I also argue that the silencing of vaccine skeptics is a form of agnogenesis. This case, interpreted in the light of the novel agnotological framework developed in Chapters 2 and 3, supports my main thesis that corporate science serves primarily corporate interests via agnogenesis. And, finally, in Chapter 5, I present concluding remarks, draw out the limitations of the thesis, and offer suggestions for directions of future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Living radical polymerization is an important technique for synthesizing advanced macromolecules including block copolymers. Since its discovery in the early 1990s the capability of the field has expanded with new types of chemistry and techniques. One of the most widely used chemistries is atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) also known as “metal mediated living radical polymerization” (Mt-LRP). Mt-LRP has also expanded its use to aqueous dispersed systems including emulsion, miniemulsion and microemulsion, with the biggest advancements seen in miniemulsion where the droplets act as nanosized reactors. Extremely hydrophobic catalyst complexes are typically used in miniemulsion.  While effective in controlling the polymerization, these hydrophobic catalyst complexes also get trapped in the final polymer particles and are difficult to remove. Herein I report the progress made using thermoresponsive polymer bound catalysts for Mt-LRP reactions in miniemulsion, which allow the successful LRP in miniemulsion with facile catalyst removal. Polymers could be prepared with less than 10 ppm of ruthenium in the final polymer compared to &gt;500 ppm in the reaction mixture. The polymerizations were improved by the addition of ferrocene (FeCp2) in miniemulsion, to give almost complete conversion in significantly shorter times. The addition of ferrocene adds a second catalytic cycle that is ionic in nature and requires excess halogens present for a successful polymerization to occur. The ionic species in this catalytic cycle meant that the use of cationic surfactants with halogen counter-ions could directly affect the polymerization chemistry, which was shown by increasing rates with the addition of a bromine counter-ion versus a chlorine counter ion in the cationic surfactant used. Water-soluble FeCp2 derivative cocatalysts were also used to improve the rates and conversions of Mt-LRP of ruthenium catalyzed polymerizations while also allowing colourless polymers to be synthesized. Finally, the ligand EHA6TREN, was found to be active in bulk or solution (anisole) when complexed to iron (III) bromide with reverse ATRP, or to iron (II) bromide with AGET ATRP, yielding an iron-mediated living radical polymerization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, reports of nuisance algae have increased within the Great Lakes Basin. These nuisance algal blooms have been known to include potentially hazardous cyanobacteria. There is a concern that harmful algal blooms are occurring more frequently which could have adverse impacts to wildlife, human activities and public health. However, there is a general lack of information on the distribution, frequency and taxonomic composition of algal blooms within the Great Lakes basin, particularly in eastern Ontario. This thesis addresses this lack of information through intensive sampling by researchers and citizen scientist volunteers. The St. Lawrence River/Lake St. Francis tributaries were used as a model system to evaluate the effects of various stressors (environmental, landscape and water quality) on algal density and frequency of harmful algal blooms. The monitoring program, run in both 2013 and 2014, found that algal assemblages were dominated by diatoms, followed by chlorophytes, and on average only ~ 1% of overall algal composition were cyanobacteria, with even smaller amounts of chrysophytes, euglenophytes, dinophytes, and cryptophytes. Multiple linear regression models were developed to predict both overall algal density and cyanobacteria density from physical and chemical variables; water temperature, total phosphorus and day of year emerged as the best predictors of algal density, and water temperature and depth were the best predictors for cyanobacteria. However, the variance explained by these models, although significant, was low. The between-year variance in algal density and composition was high, likely related to differences in precipitation. The reliability and utility of citizen science for the monitoring of harmful and nuisance algae occurrences was also evaluated. Results suggest that citizen science monitoring programs provide data complementary to traditional monitoring, although challenges associated with volunteer recruitment and retention can affect the overall effectiveness of this approach. Significant dissimilarities in community composition were observed between volunteer and researcher-collected samples, with volunteers collecting more chain forming diatoms and rare taxa. Citizen scientist samples also exhibited higher algal density than researcher-collected samples related to either differences site choice and/or the method of sample collection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Precast concrete sandwich panels are commonly used on building exteriors. They are typically composed of two concrete wythes that surround rigid insulation. They are advantageous as they provide both structural and thermal resistance. The structural response of sandwich panels is&#xD;
heavily influenced by shear connectors that link the wythes together. This thesis presents a study on partially composite non-prestressed precast concrete wall panels. Nine flexure tests were conducted on a wall design incorporating ‘floating’ concrete studs and Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) connectors. The studs encapsulate and stiffen the connectors, reducing shear deformations. Ultimate loads increased from 58 to 80% that of a composite section as the connectors’ reinforcement ratio increased from 2.6 to 9.8%. This design was optimized by reinforcing the studs and integrating them with the structural wythe; new connectors composed of angled steel or Basalt-FRP (BFRP) were used.&#xD;
The load-slip response of the new connector design was studied through 38 double shear&#xD;
push-through tests using various connector diameters and insertion angles. Larger connectors were stronger but more likely to pull out. Seven flexure tests were conducted on the new wall design reinforced with different combinations of steel and BFRP connectors and reinforcement. Composite action varied from 50 to 90% depending on connector and reinforcement material.&#xD;
Following this study, the axial-bending interaction curves were established for the new wall design using both BFRP and steel connectors and reinforcement. Eight panels were axially loaded to predesignated loads then loaded in flexure to failure. A technique is presented to experimentally determine the effective centroid of partially composite sections. Beyond the&#xD;
tension and compression-controlled failure regions of the interaction curve, a third region was observed in between, governed by connector failure.Theoretical models were developed for the bond-slip behaviour of the shear connection and to analyze the full panel’s flexural and axial response to determine the longitudinal shear force&#xD;
transferred between wythes and account for partial composite behavior. The models were&#xD;
validated against experiments and used to conduct a parametric study. Among several interesting findings, the study demonstrated how composite action increases with the slenderness of axially loaded panels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project examines Canadian cultural institutions through a decolonial lens to consider the&#xD;
structural complicity of these spaces in systems of epistemic violence, as well as grassroots&#xD;
means of resistance. This study is undertaken through two concurrent means: first, through a&#xD;
traditional, academic approach that critically examines the terrain of coloniality and resistance as&#xD;
it pertains to the exhibition of cultural products in discursive relation to Islam and Muslim&#xD;
bodies. Second, through a series of animations that interfere with the text and images discussed,&#xD;
allowing for an examination of the affective, embodied experience of such exhibits and their&#xD;
theoretical terrain. Though the written component of this project radically critiques the&#xD;
effectiveness of liberal constructions of multiculturalism and representation as tools in the&#xD;
decolonization of the cultural institution, the artwork included herein seeks to untidy any simple&#xD;
conclusions suggested through academic discourse. This project builds on the scholarship of&#xD;
critical museology by foregrounding a radical decolonial critique of curatorial practices, as well&#xD;
as the affective impacts of epistemic violence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Code clones are code snippets that come into existence when developers copy paste (and possibly modify) an existing piece of code. Studies show that cloning is an inevitable phenomenon leading to a significant presence of code clones (as much as 10%-30% of the source code consists of cloned code) in large software systems. To effectively manage these clones, researchers have proposed multiple activities along two dimensions: 1) proactive clone management, and 2) post-mortem clone management. Proactive clone management emphasis is on activities that prevent the introduction of new clones into the source code (e.g., identifying the factors that influence developers to clone code). On the other hand, post-mortem clone management focuses on managing the existing&#xD;
clones (e.g., detection or refactoring of a clone). In this thesis, we examine several open issues along both dimensions of clone management activities. For example, over 80% of research focuses on the detection of clones and studying their impact on code quality. However, limited research has examined the factors that make code more likely to be cloned. We find that an increase in the complexity&#xD;
of a method increases the likelihood of code being cloned from that method. Moreover, while there exists more than 70 clone detection tools, limited techniques are available to evaluate the performance (especially recall) of these tools. We find that current state-of-the-art framework for the evaluation of clone detection tools tend to overestimate their recall. Hence, we propose a statistically rigorous framework to evaluate the recall of clone detection tools. In addition, little has been studied to determine the life expectancy of an introduced clone. We find that the characteristics of a clone (e.g., size of a clone, or the directory-structure distance between clone siblings) at the time of its introduction highly influence its life expectancy. Practitioners and researchers can leverage our findings for: a) effective proactive clone management (e.g., by developing tools to propose the abstraction&#xD;
of code that is likely to be cloned) and b) effective post-mortem clone management by leveraging our framework to more accurately evaluate the recall of clone detection tools and by determining whether an introduced clone will be short-lived or long-lived to efficiently recommend clone management activities (e.g., annotation or refactoring of clones, especially the long-lived ones).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Since the advent of the concept of complicity in international crimes in the years following the end of World War 2, the international jurisprudence has had difficulties in conclusively establishing the content of this concept. To that effect, the ICTY, ICTR, SCSL, STL, and the ICC’s jurisprudence contain complicated, unresolved issues that need to be addressed in order to safeguard coherence in ICL. An example of the results of these issues is the discrepancy between the outcome in the cases of Charles Taylor and of Momcilo Perisic where, for essentially the same conduct, the former was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison while the latter was acquitted of all charges. In the current situation of on-going legitimacy deficit of international criminal law, this problem must be tackled efficiently. To do so, in this paper, I identified the issues of complicity in ICL and tried to find solutions for them through a proposed definition of the concept of complicity which could be incorporated in the statutes of international criminal tribunals or in the international jurisprudence. According to my proposition, an aid, assistance, or support that has a substantial effect on the commission of the crime by the perpetrator given while the accomplice knew or was wilfully blind that the crime was being committed or that the perpetrator wanted to commit the crime and that, in the normal course of events, it was almost inevitable that the crime would be committed would be the new legal standard for complicity in ICL. I argue that this definition would settle many grave problems currently afflicting complicity such as the lack of legal certainty and the discrepancies in the outcomes among ICL judgments. I conclude the thesis by observing that, given that we are at the outset of a new world order, the international community should take this opportunity to set out clearly the content of complicity, a concept which is likely to receive increasingly widespread application in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The need to consider context in organizational and leadership research has been highlighted by many scholars (e.g., Johns, 2006; Rousseau &amp; Fried, 2001), and in today’s increasingly volatile world, the need to understand leadership in extreme environments has never been greater.  This dissertation investigates the impacts of leadership in extreme contexts (i.e. where there exists “risks of severe physical, psychological or material consequences […] to organizational members or their constituents” Hannah, Uhl-Bien, Avolio, &amp; Cavarretta, 2009, p. 897), using two studies in the extreme context of healthcare.  &#xD;
Study 1 used growth-curve models to examine the changes in psychological outcomes (i.e. empathy, self-efficacy, daytime sleepiness) of medical and nursing students during their first eight-months of practical experience.  Predictors of changes were also studied, including leadership behaviours (i.e. transformational leadership, laissez-faire leadership, abusive supervision), and context-relevant experiences (e.g., patient morbidity and mortality, beneficiary contact, boredom). Findings show that both leadership and context-relevant experiences influence the development of empathy, self-efficacy, and daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
Study 2 investigated the impact of leadership (i.e. transformational leadership, laissez-faire leadership, over-controlling leadership) in the operating room on proximal and distal surgical outcomes (i.e. proximal: errors, blood loss; distal: complications during recovery at the hospital, complications post-discharge).  Leadership effects were hypothesized to occur through the mediators of psychological safety and boredom, but no support was found for any mediating effects.  However, certain direct relationships between leadership and surgical outcomes were moderated by surgical complexity.  Leadership predicted proximal and distal surgical outcomes, but the strength of the relationship depends on the complexity of the surgery.&#xD;
Results of both studies are presented, and the findings, avenues of future research, and practical implications are discussed.  The dissertation concludes with a general discussion of the studies and areas of future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Preeclampsia (PE) is a significant gestational disorder affecting 3-5% of all human pregnancies. In many PE pregnancies, maternal plasma is low in the placentally-produced angiokine “placental growth factor” (PGF). Offspring of PE (PE-F1) compared to uncomplicated pregnancies have higher risks for hypertension, cognitive impairment, and stroke. However, mechanisms explaining these risks are poorly understood. This thesis aimed to explore the mechanistic links between deficient gestational PGF expression, PE, and brain structural and functional development in PE-F1s. It was hypothesized that PGF deficiency, which often manifests in PE, diminishes brain vascular development, leading to impaired cognition and elevated stroke risk postpartum.&#xD;
Uteroplacental angiogenesis was assessed in pregnant mice expressing or lacking maternal and/or conceptus derived PGF by whole-mount immunohistochemistry or paraffin histology. Pgf-/- and Pgf+/+ adult mouse brain vasculature and structural anatomy were examined by arterial polymer casting and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. Cognition and behaviour were assessed in these mice by standard paradigms that tested depression, spatial learning, short and long term memory, activity and anxiety. PE-F1 and control children aged 7-10 were assessed for cognitive functions through psychometric testing and eye tracking of saccadic eye movements. Brain structural and vascular anatomy were assessed in the same children through MRI.&#xD;
Pgf-/- mice displayed reduced and aberrant uteroplacental vascular structure, particularly when conceptus-derived PGF was absent. Pgf-/- brain vasculature was deficient and abnormally patterned compared to Pgf+/+ controls. Cognitive and behavioural testing revealed numerous impairments in Pgf-/- mice, with sexually dimorphic differences. MRI revealed structural anatomic differences between the brains of Pgf-/- and Pgf+/+ mice, again with sexually dimorphic differences. In children, PE-F1s displayed deficits in working memory and oculomotor control compared to controls. PE-F1s additionally exhibited altered brain structural and vascular anatomy compared to controls.&#xD;
This work has uncovered a previously unknown link between deficient PGF expression, PE, and brain development in mice and humans. These results have implications for the clinical management of women with PE, as well as their offspring, and underscore the importance of PE prevention.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation considers the adaptive estimation of time-varying parameters and its use in extremum-seeking control problems. The ability to estimate uncertain time-varying behaviour can have a significant impact on a control system's performance. Hence, the problem of time-varying parameter estimation has been of considerable interest over the last two decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
The present work provides a formal scheme for time-varying parameter estimation in a class of nonlinear systems. The geometric concept of invariance is the key concept for the parameter estimation techniques developed in this thesis. The techniques use a number of high gain estimators and filters that generate an almost invariant manifold. The almost invariance property allows an implicit mapping and a parameter update law that guarantees exponentially convergence to a small region of the true values of the time-varying parameters. A generalization of the invariant manifold approach &#xD;
is considered to deal with the estimation of periodic parameters with unknown periodicity. &#xD;
&#xD;
In another step, this thesis seeks to apply the proposed time-varying estimation technique to the solution of extremum-seeking control problems. In extremum-seeking control, a gradient descent algorithm is used to find the optimal value of a measured but unknown cost functions. The contribution of this aspect of the thesis is the formulation of the extremum-seeking control problem where the unknown gradient of the cost is estimated as a time-varying parameter using the proposed invariance based estimation technique. The proposed approach is extended for the solution of constrained steady-state optimization problems.&#xD;
We establish two methods for finding the optimal points for systems with unknown objective functions that are subject to unknown/uncertain dynamics. For systems with unknown dynamics, a nonlinear proportional-integral controller is designed to find the optimal solution. Then for a class of control affine systems with known high frequency gains, an inverse optimal control technique is used for the direct design of a gradient-based controller.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is prevalent in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients but only a minority receives coronary angiography. Also, evidence for the effectiveness of coronary angiography in this population is conflicting.&#xD;
Objectives: 1) To describe the patient and hospital-level factors that are associated with receiving coronary angiography 2) To determine if receiving coronary angiography is associated with survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurologic outcome.&#xD;
Methods: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of 2578 consecutive cases of adult OHCA transported to and treated at 28 hospitals in Southern Ontario between March 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2014. We included patients with atraumatic OHCA, who achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survived to at least six hours after hospital arrival. Multilevel logistic regression was used to explore the association between exposure variables and outcome variables, while accounting for clustering of patients (level 1) within hospitals (level 2) and adjusting for potential confounders. &#xD;
Results: Coronary angiography use varied from 13% to 70% across the hospital sites. Overall, 33%(n=863/2578) of patients received coronary angiography, 42%(n=1082/2578) survived to hospital discharge and 38%(n=960/2552) survived to hospital discharge with favourable neurologic outcome. Multilevel analysis revealed that factors positively associated with receiving coronary angiography included patient age, STEMI status, being conscious at hospital arrival, having a shockable initial cardiac rhythm, an EMS witnessed arrest, initiation of therapeutic hypothermia, receiving bystander defibrillation, and being admitted directly to a PCI centre. Receiving coronary angiography was associated with neurologically intact survival (OR=2.03, CI95 1.47-2.80, p&lt;.0001) and survival to hospital discharge (OR=1.86, CI95 1.36-2.55, p&lt;.0001). Similar associations were observed in the subgroup of patients without ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (OR=2.90, CI95 1.90-4.43 and OR=2.44, CI95 1.62-3.69, respectively).&#xD;
Conclusions: There is significant variability in receipt of coronary angiography after cardiac arrest. We identified several patient and hospital-level factors that contribute to this variability. Neurologically intact survival amongst post cardiac arrest patients may be improved with coronary angiography, particularly for patients without STEMI. Future work should determine which post arrest patients will benefit most from urgent angiography, and our findings should be confirmed with randomized controlled trials.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gastrointestinal bleeding associated with angiodysplasia is a common, often intractable complication in patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD). von Willebrand factor (VWF), the protein deficient in VWD, was recently identified as a negative regulator of angiogenesis, which may explain the pathologic blood vessel growth in VWD. Blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) can be isolated from the peripheral blood and used to investigate the underlying pathologic mechanisms of VWD and angiodysplasia in the natural genetic environment of the endothelial cell. This thesis explores the normal range of angiogenesis in BOECs derived from healthy donors. In addition, we used this normal range to identify abnormal angiogenesis in BOECs derived from type 2 VWD patients.&#xD;
We found that the range of angiogenesis and VWF expression in BOECs from the normal population was highly variable. BOECs from a type 2A VWD patient with a HMWM VWF deficiency exhibited aberrant VWF multimerization, storage and secretion ex vivo. These deficits corresponded with increases in several functional parameters reflecting angiogenesis, namely proliferation, adhesion and migration. Along with the type 2A VWD BOECs, the type 2B VWD BOECs demonstrated an increased release of the angiogenic mediator angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and increased proliferation. VWF processing was normal in the in vitro environment of the type 2B BOECs. The type 2M VWD BOECs displayed abnormal storage of VWF and also exhibited increases in some metrics of angiogenesis. Though a VWF deficiency was not identified in the type 2N VWD patient, these BOECs exhibited increased angiogenesis as well.&#xD;
Finally, angiogenesis was explored in endothelial cells derived from a liver hemangioma of a type 1 VWD patient. Though they were proliferative, migratory and had decreased adhesion and tubule formation, it is unclear if VWF influenced this pro-angiogenic phenotype. &#xD;
In conclusion, these experiments have further elucidated the mechanisms of pathogenesis in angiodysplasia associated with VWD and provided insights into the use of BOECs for recapitulating the patient phenotype.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to explore how Ontario’s school safety policies influenced the educational experiences of racialized students between 2001 and 2013—a time period during which Ontario’s school safety policies underwent a philosophical shift from more punitive measures toward a more progressive discipline approach. To fulfill this purpose, I conducted a systematic policy analysis of the Safe Schools Act (SSA, 2000), Progressive Discipline and School Safety Act (PDSS, 2007), Keeping Our Kids Safe at School Act (KOKSS, 2009), and the Accepting Schools Act (ASA, 2012). I also engaged the voices of 20 self-identified racialized youth from Ontario’s two largest metropolitan areas (Toronto and Ottawa) who were suspended and/or expelled from Ontario public schools between 2001 and 2013, half of whom were excluded from school prior to and half after PDSS went into effect on February 1, 2008. &#xD;
 	Drawing from multiple data sources, findings indicate that, although safe schools legislation in Ontario changed from a punitive approach employed between 2000 and 2007 to a progressive discipline and restorative practice approach between 2008 and 2013, there was still disproportional suspension and expulsion of racialized students. The number of students being suspended and expelled from Ontario schools has decreased since PDSS (2007) was put in place (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2013a, 2013b). However, far too many students who experience exclusion from schools under these policies become increasingly disengaged from education.&#xD;
 	Racist, sexist, ableist, and homophobic ideologies still occupy the social structures in which racialized students, teachers, school administrators, school safety policymakers, and safe schools legislation all exist. These ideologies have historically resulted and continue to result in the inequitable treatment of racialized students in Ontario’s public education system, as seen through the eyes of 20 self-identified racialized students who participated in this study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We propose an enhancement to current parsing and transformation systems by leveraging the expressive power of Boolean grammars, a generalization of context-free grammars that adds conjunction and negation operators. In addition to naturally expressing a larger class of languages, Boolean grammars capture multiple parse trees of the same document simultaneously, allowing one to switch between these parse "views". In particular, source transformation and reengineering tasks can benefit from parse views by recasting the input text into whichever parse is most suitable for the task at hand.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Wait times while moving through the cancer diagnostic process are a public health concern. Rural populations may experience more challenges in accessing cancer care, which could translate into a longer diagnostic interval and represent a healthcare inequity. This project analyzed the association between rurality of residence and the diagnostic interval of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in Ontario, Canada.  &#xD;
Methods: This was a retrospective population-based cohort study. We used administrative databases available through the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) to identify incident CRC cases diagnosed from Jan 1, 2007- May 31, 2012. We assigned each patient a rurality score, based on their census subdivision, and calculated the length of their diagnostic interval. We defined the diagnostic interval as the time (in days) between a patient’s first diagnostic-related encounter with the health care system to the CRC diagnosis date. Data linkage through ICES allowed us to describe variations in cancer stage and the diagnostic interval by degree of rurality of patient residence and to analyze associations through multivariable models taking into account potential confounders. &#xD;
Results: Overall, the median diagnostic interval of the CRC cohort was 64 (IQR: 22-159) days and the 90th percentile was 288 days. Patients with stage I CRC had a longer median diagnostic interval than patients with stage IV CRC. Across rurality categories, a significant difference in median diagnostic interval was detected in the stage I stratum only, ranging from 58.5 to 108 days (p=0.0005), but with the most rural group having the shortest diagnostic interval. Results from adjusted multivariable models suggested that patients in mid-ranged rural categories had similar or longer diagnostic intervals compared to patients in the least rural category while patients in the most rural category maintained the shortest diagnostic intervals. Important covariates included age, comorbidities and CRC sub-site.&#xD;
Conclusion: Our results do not support a rurality effect on stage or the diagnostic interval in the hypothesized direction. Estimates of a shorter interval in the most rural category, especially for stage I disease, call for a deeper analysis to better understand care delivery in those areas and patient characteristics that might affect the interval.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis addresses observer design for nonlinear dynamical systems which can be approximated with dissipative Hamiltonian realizations. The design methods builds upon earlier developments that allow the approximate dissipative potential to be extracted using a homotopy operator. This potential is obtained by decomposition of the observer error associated one-form using the homotopy operator which generates the potential. A time-varying differential metric equation dependent on the Hessian of the potential and the measured output function is proposed, which is used to design a state observer. The stability of both the observer and metric equation are assessed using Lyapunov theory. A time-invariant metric is then proposed making use of the Hessian of the potential on a metric-state based observer. Using several process simulations, the approach is shown to provide an effective design alternative for nonlinear observer design.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Steam Generators (SGs) are a critical component of nuclear reactors, employing thousands of SG tubes to convert heat generated in the reactor core into useable energy. SG tubes are supported at numerous locations by Broach Support Plates (BSPs) that have trefoil shaped holes, which prevent excessive tube vibrations, while allowing water to easily flow through the support structures. A number of degradation modes occur in SGs, such as SG tube fretting, cracking or denting, requiring periodic inspection. Currently, conventional Eddy Current Testing (ECT) is used to non-destructively assess the condition of SG tubes and components. However, as reactors age, new modes of degradation will likely appear that may be difficult to detect and characterize using conventional ECT, such as wall loss in BSPs and build-up of corrosion products, which typically form as a hard sludge called magnetite. Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) technologies are an emerging technique that is presented in this work as a method to further advance inspection techniques used in CANDU® nuclear reactors. A PEC probe was designed to inspect the unique shape of the trefoil shaped hole to detect and characterize wall loss and the presence of magnetite in A516 carbon steel BSPs with trefoil shaped holes from within 15.9 mm (5/8”) Alloy-800 SG tubes. PEC was also used to observe how measurements of wall loss were affected by the presence of magnetite. This work presents Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations and experimental results collected to observe these degradation modes. The probe was demonstrated to be capable of detecting far side wall loss as low as 20%, locating and characterizing the relative permeability of magnetite, and of detecting wall loss when magnetite was present. FEM simulations and experimental results were found to be in good agreement, suggesting that additional investigations of the effects of BSP degradation on PEC signal response may also be performed using FEM models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Implementation of educational technology into Full Day Kindergarten (FDK) classrooms requires more than just the acquisition of hardware; it requires embedded professional development and training for the FDK educational team in order to foster sustainable change.    &#xD;
Research that underpins this project comes from literature related to: Effective educational technology integration in the early years; Designing effective professional learning for teachers; Shifts in the culture within a school; and shifts in teachers’ mindsets.  The literature is clear that in order for a sustainable shift in classroom culture, pedagogy and practice to occur there must be ongoing support for these changes. Face-to-face support, either due to lack of expertise, budget allocations, time restraints, or geographical location can be difficult to administer in a timely &#xD;
manner.  Therefore, this project focuses on the creation of a professional development resource &#xD;
that will supplement face-to-face professional learning and thereby bridge moments when direct support is not possible.  The artifact for this project is the independent creation of an Apple iTunesU course to support the developmentally appropriate and meaningful integration of iPad technology into an FDK educational team’s daily kindergarten classroom practice.  By designing a self-paced, professional learning collection of resources, combined with an asynchronous online discussion forum, the goal of this project is to provide professional learning that is &#xD;
relevant, easily accessible, responsive and ubiquitous over time and space.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis takes as its starting point a body of literature focusing on what is commonly referred to as ‘everyday aesthetics’. This literature is engaged in the process of chipping away at the intuition that the artwork is the paradigmatic object of aesthetic experience. My aim is to lend support to the everyday project. &#xD;
	The everyday aesthetician is concerned with defending the possibility of aesthetically experiencing an elegant ottoman, a luxurious car, and a stylish pair of pants. Some doubt that appreciating such everyday objects as listed above can properly be described as aesthetic. I argue that this doubt is mistaken and due to an art-centric conception of the aesthetic. I will defend the legitimacy of everyday aesthetics by appeal to aesthetic attitude theory. I argue that we can legitimately understand our everyday lives as aesthetic by appeal to a mental activity that human beings are capable of engaging in.&#xD;
	In Chapter Two, I give a historical account of the aesthetic attitude theory as it has been traditionally conceived. I turn my attention to everyday aesthetics in Chapter Three. There is some tension between the everyday project and aesthetic attitude theory. The latter tends to recommend divorcing objects from their practical dimensions. One view on offer contends that this is a misleading strategy. To divorce the ordinary from practical considerations is to rob the experience of the very thing that gives it its everyday quality. Chapter Four introduces a philosophical compromise by way of a more nuanced version of the aesthetic attitude theory. I suggest that a plausible construal of an attitude theory should not commit it to being an unusual, infrequent, or cognitively burdensome activity. Revising these features renders the theory flexible enough to account for those ordinary everyday aesthetic experiences. Furthermore, I show how we might conceive of attitude theory without necessarily limiting the role practical considerations play in our aesthetic experiences.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A great many philosophers suggest that we exercise epistemic agency – a kind of agency that is distinctly epistemic in character and which allows us directly to exercise agency over our beliefs. In this thesis I will question the intelligibility of this suggestion. In order to do so, I will consider and argue against the four common views that are supposed to locate and explain epistemic agency. The first view suggests that we exercise epistemic agency because believing itself is a species of act or action, in the ordinary sense or in the rational sense. The second view suggests that we exercise epistemic agency because belief formation can be directly controlled, either voluntarily or evaluatively. The third view suggests that we exercise epistemic agency when we reflect upon and make judgments about what to believe. The fourth view suggests that we exercise epistemic agency because we are responsive to reasons. I will contend that these views either fail to intelligibly locate and explain epistemic agency or they do not offer the right explanation of it. This gives grounds to doubt the intelligibility of the very idea of epistemic agency.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Following the detection in the late 70s of a strong magnetic field in the early B-type star sigma Ori E and, more recently with the results of the Magnetism In MassivE Stars (MiMeS) survey, an important and rare subclass of magnetic B-type stars has been emerging. Magnetic stars hosting so called "centrifugal magnetospheres" are characterized by rapid rotation and feature strong and broad emission lines in their spectra produced by a hot plasma co-rotating with the star well beyond the surface (at distances of several times the stellar radius). Since the first discovery of these properties in the magnetic B2Vp star sigma Ori E, the dense, rigidly-rotating circumstellar plasma has been understood as an accumulation of the star's wind in regions of closed magnetic loops above the surface. These objects serve as unique laboratories for studying how the fast winds emitted by all B-type stars interact with magnetic fields in extreme environments. In this study, the properties of two rapidly rotating stars, HD 23478 and HD 35502, hosts to centrifugal magnetospheres and exhibiting strong emission in their spectra, are derived. Our results establish new upper limits on the magnetic confinement-rotation diagram -- a diagnostic tool which is used to understand the magnetospheres of O- and B-type stars in a broader context.&#xD;
&#xD;
The derived rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields imply that these two stars occupy the most extreme region of the magnetic confinement-rotation diagram populated by known centrifugal magnetosphere-hosting stars such as sigma Ori E and HR 5907.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background&#xD;
The Allergic Rhinitis Clinical Investigator Collaborative (AR-CIC) uses a Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) model to study the pathophysiology of AR and provides proof of concept for novel therapeutics. The NAC model needs to ensure optimal participant qualification, allergen challenge, clinical symptoms capture and biological samples collection. Repeatability of the protocol is key to ensuring unbiased efficacy analysis of novel therapeutics. The effect of allergen challenge on IL-33 gene expression and its relation to IL1RL1 receptor and cytokine secretion was investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods&#xD;
Several iterations of the NAC protocol was tested, comparing variations of qualifying criteria based on the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) and Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF). The lowest allergen concentration was delivered and TNSS and PNIF recorded 15 minutes later. Participants qualified if the particular criteria for the protocol were met, otherwise the next higher allergen concentration (4-fold increase), was administered until the targets were reached. Participants returned for a NAC visit and received varying allergen challenge concentrations depending on the protocol, TNSS/PNIF were recorded at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and hourly up to 12 hours, a 24 hour time point was added in later iterations. Repeatability was evaluated using a 3-4week interval between screening, NAC1, and NAC2 visits. Various biomarker samples were collected. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results&#xD;
A combined TNSS and PNIF criterion was more successful in qualifying participants. The cumulative allergen challenge (CAC) protocol proved more reliable in producing a robust clinical and biomarker response. Repeatability of the CAC protocol was achieved with a 3-week interval between visits, on a clinical and biological basis. IL-33 cytokine is an important biomarker in initiating the inflammatory response in AR in humans. IL-33 and IL1RL1 expression might employ a negative feedback mechanism in human nasal epithelial cells. Comparing the clinical and biological response to ragweed vs cat allergen challenge, proved the CAC protocol’s suitability for use employing different allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
The AR-CIC’s CAC protocol is an effective method of studying AR, capable of generating measurable and repeatable clinical and biomarker responses, enabling better understanding of AR pathophysiology and ensuring that any change would be purely due to medication under investigation in a clinical trial setting.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nondestructive testing is a critical aspect of component lifetime management. Nuclear steam generator (SG) tubes are the thinnest barrier between irradiated primary heat transport system and the secondary heat transport system, whose components are not rated for large radiation fields. Conventional eddy current testing (ECT) and ultrasonic testing are currently employed for inspecting SG tubes, with the former doing most inspections due to speed and reliability based on an understanding of how flaws affect coil impedance parameters when conductors are subjected to harmonically induced currents. However, when multiple degradation modes are present simultaneously near ferromagnetic materials, such as tube fretting, support structure corrosion, and magnetite fouling, ECT reliability decreases. Pulsed eddy current (PEC), which induces transient eddy currents via square wave excitation, has been considered in this thesis to simultaneously examine SG tube and support structure conditions. An array probe consisting of a central driver, coaxial with the tube, and an array of 8 sensing coils, was used in this thesis to perform laboratory measurements. The probe was delivered from the inner diameter (ID) of the SG tube, where support hole diameter, tube frets, and 2D off-centering were varied. When considering two variables simultaneously, scores obtained from a modified principal components analysis (MPCA) were sufficient for parameter extraction. In the case of hole ID variation with two dimensional tube off-centering (three parameters), multiple linear regression (MLR) of the MPCA scores provided good estimates of parameters. However, once a fourth variable, outer diameter tube frets, was introduced, MLR proved insufficient. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were investigated in order to perform pattern recognition on the MPCA scores to simultaneously extract the four measurement parameters from the data. All models throughout this thesis were created and validated using experimental data. The final ANN models could provide estimates to within 2% of hole diameter and 3% of fret depth. Estimates of hole ID and tube position were further improved when considering fret depth as an input, which could occur if fret information was available. ANN models proved robust to measurement error, as would be encountered in real inspection settings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lasers are becoming an increasingly popular tool for use in industrial manufacturing settings. Their high power density, contact-free nature, and ease of automation give them an edge over traditional methods in processes such as welding, cutting, and drilling. However, laser beams are a difficult tool to control since they are made of light. Therefore, they cannot be monitored in the same way as a mechanical tool with constant physical dimensions. A recent invention, inline coherent imaging (ICI), uses the interference properties of light to monitor the depth of the processing beam at high speeds. However, the computational demands of ICI data processing are intensive, and it is difficult for standard computers to keep up with the high volumes of data that are output by an ICI system. As a result, the real-time control capabilities of ICI are limited by the rate at which the computer can process the data. In this work, I present a system that uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to process ICI data with a high level of determinism and low latency compared to computer-based ICI. The algorithms that were developed to take advantage of the FPGA's architecture are presented, followed by a detailed description of how they were implemented programmatically. I also describe the hardware that was used to perform experiments with closed-loop ICI feedback control. Finally, I present the results of tests done with two applications, autofocus and welding depth control. I show that FPGA-based ICI achieves superior performance to computer-based control, pushing the latency of an ICI calculation down from 3600±900 μs to 54±5 μs. Areas of future work include fine-tuned welding control, implementation of ASIC and/or advanced interpolation or FFT algorithms, and investigation of other laser processes such as additive manufacturing and surgical bone ablation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Creating art and performing as ManChyna collectively function as my entry into an autoethnographic mapping of mobility and space within liberal multiculturalism. I introduce the research creative method of autoethnographic creatography, because creation and performance are my interventions into and tools for analyzing social space. My parody of queer Asian racialization upends liberal multiculturalism’s promise of incorporation, or promissory exaltation (invoking Sunera Thobani’s, “racial exaltation”), which instrumentally disciplines and includes putative model minorities and homonorms alike. Thus, assimilation into a queer liberal multiculturalism is my primary theoretical target. Building on José Muñoz’s idea of disidentification, I introduce the notion of disassimilation as a performative embodiment of critical analysis and theory. How can individuals articulate the current contours of liberal ideology? How can one counter an ever-shifting dominant culture from a ‘minor’ point of view when one crucial aim of the latter’s evasive energy is the incorporation of that minor gaze? And how does the minoritarian subject represent her critical navigation of majority codes when the picture is complicated by her desire to assimilate into them? The theories of disidentification and disassimilation extend to my uprooting of rural space as supposedly settler land. Using my excessive queer Asianness, I dance on the supposed whiteness of rural Canada, mocking it, and connecting my limited incorporation into queer liberal multiculturalism with ongoing histories of racial exploitation and Indigenous erasure; ultimately, the aim is recognition of rightful Indigenous belonging, existence, and authority of the land. Creatography leads me, via ManChyna’s performance, to encounter intimate modes of racial and sexual discipline within the promises of assimilation and exaltation. ManChyna’s non-Black deployment of rap and humour connects my project to cross-racial political consciousness and alliance. ManChyna serves as a confluence of cultural pathologies, connecting maligned and (paradoxically) celebrated Asian and Black motherhoods with queer deviance. While the dichotomous construction of model and not-so-model minorities work to reiterate the instrumental opposition of minorities against each other, ManChyna’s creations and performances dialogue with other cultural texts that emerge as contradictory navigations of the inherently paradoxical “new whiteness” of queer settler multiculturalism; together, we map its evasive contours.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bill 56 was a response to, and a recognition of, the need for action concerning&#xD;
bullying and violence in schools. In Quebec, the Ministère de L’Éducation, du Loisir et&#xD;
du Sport mandated that school boards, schools, and principals deal with bullying and&#xD;
violence in schools by enacting Bill 56 in June 2012. However, although new laws and&#xD;
policies can provide supports and structures, their implementation often poses significant&#xD;
challenges for school administration.&#xD;
The purpose of this study was to examine Quebec school administrators’&#xD;
perceptions of the impact of Bill 56 on their work in maintaining a positive school&#xD;
climate. The following research questions guided this study:&#xD;
1. What are the goals and mandates of the anti-bullying legislation Bill 56 in the&#xD;
province of Quebec as stated in the document and perceived by Quebec school&#xD;
administrators?&#xD;
2. How do Quebec school administrators see their responsibilities and roles&#xD;
changing in regards to the mandates of Bill 56?&#xD;
3. What are school administrators’ perceptions of challenges and supports of the&#xD;
anti-bullying legislation Bill 56 in the province of Quebec?&#xD;
4. What is the impact on school administrators’ confidence as they attempt to&#xD;
maintain a positive school climate within the context of the implementation of Bill&#xD;
56?&#xD;
This study involved a document analysis and one-on-one, in-depth, semistructured,&#xD;
open-ended interviews with six school administrators of an English school&#xD;
board in Quebec. The interviewees were encouraged to share their thoughts, actions, and&#xD;
sense of confidence when dealing with the issues surrounding bullying and violence in&#xD;
their schools. Data were collected from March through June of 2014.&#xD;
The findings suggest that, overall, Bill 56 had a positive impact on school culture.&#xD;
Although the implementation of Bill 56 presented some challenges to the participants, the&#xD;
overall consensus was that Bill 56 positively affected and supported the work lives of&#xD;
principals. Participants acknowledged that creating and maintaining a healthy school&#xD;
climate by being transformational leaders was one of their main goals, and that Bill 56&#xD;
has provided the framework to achieve that goal. However, there were different levels of&#xD;
confidence and varying manifestations of transformational leadership traits among the&#xD;
participants. Based on the research results, this thesis concludes with implications for&#xD;
theory, practice, policy, and further research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The emerging epidemic of cardiovascular disease is threatening the health and well-being of various communities around the world. The risk of cardiovascular disease is amplified for the Punjabi Sikh population of Canada originating from Punjab, India. According to Statistics Canada’s National Household Survey, the Punjabi Sikh community represents approximately 115 000 or 9.3 percent of the total population within the Region of Peel, making it the second largest Punjabi Sikh community in Canada. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand factors that contribute to the decline in cardiovascular health of this growing sub-population. The research focuses on Punjabi Sikhs who are 55 years of age or older, immigrated to Canada, live in the Region of Peel and have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. This age group was selected given that cardiovascular disease diagnosis occurs earlier for Sikhs compared to their ethnic European comparator groups. The Punjabi Sikh population also encompasses an important aging ethnic population in Canada. Health geography plays a vital role in connecting how factors associated with where Punjabi Sikhs live are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Through a population health approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted using grounded theory with participants (n = 30) in the study. Analysis of the interviews suggests that factors such as genetics, lifestyle, the built environment and influences of differing cultures all create the “perfect storm” for cardiovascular disease within the study population. Understanding cardiovascular disease risk through research provides insight into how to address health needs of an increasingly multi-ethnic population in Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Intersections between gay liberation’s intellectual, communications, and transnational history reside at the core this thesis. Methodologically indebted to actor network theory, critical theorizations of counterpublics and the public sphere, and transnational historiography, the thesis develops four main arguments. First, far from a short-lived burst of Stonewall-era radicalism, gay liberation was a distinct formation of queer activism that stretched from the end of the 1960s to the emergence of HIV-AIDS in the early 1980s. Second, the decentralized dialogues, debates, and knowledge-making projects that animated gay liberation’s intellectual history cannot be reduced to a single intellectual framework or political ideology. Third, the periodicals in which gay liberation’s intellectual history materialized also constituted a transnational actor-network by bringing far-flung readers, writers, ideas, analyses, and discourses into association. Fourth, language and culture were much greater barriers to the circulation of gay liberation periodicals than national borders or absolute geographic space, and the Anglo-American world was the seat of a distinctive and profoundly interconnected manifestation of gay liberation as such. After exploring the diverse intellectual influences that nourished gay liberation across the Anglo-American world, this thesis examines activist writings on themes such as: the psychiatric, psychological, and psychoanalytic pathologization of homosexuality; the historicity and genealogy of homosexual resistance to oppression; complex entanglements between gay liberation and lesbian feminism; child and youth sexuality; and paedophilia and intergenerational sex.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neurophysiological and behavioural research has suggested that multiple potential actions are represented simultaneously.  For example, neural activity associated with multiple potential actions has been observed in premotor structures of monkeys.  Also, when humans are presented with two potential reach targets, they initially aim their reach toward the midpoint, or spatial average, of the targets.  Within the context of the neurophysiological findings, it has been suggested that this ‘spatial averaging’ phenomena reflects competing neural activity associated with multiple motor plans being implemented simultaneously.  However, it is also possible that the initial trajectory represents a perceptual average of spatial locations.  The goal of this thesis was to examine these two accounts of spatial averaging.  An initial experiment tested the idea that multiple motor plans specifying multiple motor parameters are prepared simultaneously.  Participant's reached toward multiple potential targets, one of which was cued after movement onset as the movement target, that varied in location and orientation.  Hand direction and orientation were found to be biased by both the spatial distribution and orientation; suggesting that fully specified motor plans are prepared simultaneously to potential targets.  The second experiment tested whether spatial averaging behaviour reflects the use of a perceptual representation or a motor representation of potential targets.  Participants preformed a rapid reaching task in which an obstacle blocked the movement to one of two potential targets.  The initial movement direction was found to be a weighted average of the movement directions to each target; as opposed to being an average of the target locations.  In chapter four, a visuomotor adaptation task in which individuals learned to produce identical movements to two separate visual targets allowed the perceptual representation and the motor representation of the targets to be dissociated and the predictions of each account to be tested separately.  The initial movement direction was shifted in the direction of the adaptation; providing support for the idea that multiple motor plans are computed simultaneously.  Taken together, the results presented herein  provide support for the idea that the brain prepares multiple movement plans in advance of deciding between potential actions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP), also known as controlled radical polymerization (CRP), has been a significant area of polymer research for more than 20 years, allowing the facile synthesis of complex macromolecules previously unattainable by conventional free radical polymerization (FRP). However, industrial adoption of RDRP has been minimal largely due to the significant economic barrier to commercialization, with complex synthesis of the mediating agents required and the necessary post polymerization processing to recover the mediating agent. In an effort to overcome this obstacle to industrial adoption, the mediating agent concentration can be significantly reduced, such as the copper level in activator regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET ATRP), or the mediating agent can be incorporated into the polymer as in nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), where no post polymerization processing is required other than removal of residual monomer. This thesis presents a study of these two chemistries towards industrially relevant conditions.&#xD;
To build upon recent developments of continuous ARGET ATRP, a systematic batch study is conducted to pursue decreased copper levels in the generation of short chain acrylic and methacrylic polymers of interest to the coatings industry. The limitations to reducing copper levels are understood with the development of a kinetic model, with the improved understanding of the ARGET ATRP system suggesting that a reduction in copper loading must be accompanied by an increase in reducing agent loading in order to maintain an appreciable polymerization rate.&#xD;
Alternatively, NMP does not require a reduction in mediating nitroxide level as it reversibly terminates the polymer chain end, and may present a smaller barrier to commercialization. Indeed, certain nitroxides are currently produced at pilot scale. However, limited research has been conducted into continuous operation which is commonly used in industry to improve productivity. A batch NMP study at elevated temperatures demonstrates the effectiveness of a novel alkoxyamine to mediate the polymerization of styrene and butyl acrylate under industrially relevant conditions. A kinetic study is developed to understand the novel system, and the polymerization is implemented in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), the first demonstration of NMP in an existing industrial process.</dcterms:abstract>
