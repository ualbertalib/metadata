      <dcterms:abstract>Waste stabilization pond (WSP) systems are a simple and low-cost form of wastewater treatment. Forecasting the treatment efficiency of these systems can be challenging given the complexity of their treatment processes and their dependence on changing climatic conditions. In WSP design, these treatment forecasting uncertainties are compounded by inaccuracies in population statistics. In this thesis, two studies were conducted to develop uncertainty-based methods of design for WSPs.&#xD;
In the first study, a simple uncertainty-based method of design for a facultative-maturation pond system was proposed based on the removal of biochemical oxygen demand and Escherichia coli. Removal of contaminants was modeled using first kinetics assuming a dispersed flow hydraulic regime with uncertainties propagated using Monte Carlo simulations. A sensitivity analysis method was also described for factor prioritization and factor fixing. The method’s use in practice was presented using a case study for the design of a pond system treating residential wastewater.&#xD;
The second study explores two approaches for the integration of a steady state temperature model (SSTM) and a transient bulk temperature model (TBTM) into an uncertainty-based WSP design method. The design method was based on the removal of biochemical oxygen demand using a first order kinetic model assuming a plug flow hydraulic regime. Uncertainties were propagated using Monte Carlo simulations. A case study with two design scenarios was conducted for the sizing of a standalone facultative pond treating residential wastewater. The first design scenario employed the uncertainty-based method with the SSTM approach while the second made use of the TBTM approach. The uncertainty-based method using the SSTM approach produced area requirements 76% larger than the TBTM approach. The significant difference in area requirement estimates of both approaches highlights a need for the accurate modelling of pond temperature and its uncertainty in uncertainty-based design.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess subjective changes in mood and anxiety symptoms before, during, and after administration of the microbial therapeutic. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess changes in diversity of gut microbiome, changes in peripheral blood biomarkers, repopulation of healthy gut bacteria, and safety and tolerability of therapeutic.&#xD;
Method: Twelve adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder were recruited from the Kingston area. Participants orally consumed once daily an encapsulated microbial therapeutic, containing 40 strains of bacteria purified and lab-grown from a single healthy donor stool, for 8 weeks. Participants underwent a series of clinical assessments measuring mood, anxiety, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms using validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Molecular data was collected from blood and fecal samples to assess metabolic changes, neurotransmitter, immunoglobulin, and inflammatory markers concentrations, and alpha diversity for fecal samples to predict outcomes in depression or anxiety. &#xD;
Results: Of the twelve individuals included in this study, nine have responded to treatment (50% improvement in MADRS and/or GAD-7 scores from baseline to week 8 visit). Over the course of 10 weeks MET-2 significantly decreased MADRS and GAD-7 scores, MADRS [F (5, 55) = 8.784, p&lt;0.001 and F(2.78,30.56) = 9.638, p&lt;0.01], respectively. This improvement may be mediated by the recolonization of the gastrointestinal tract with healthy bacteria resulting in increased bacterial diversity. Although increased bacterial diversity was seen in participants’ stool samples from baseline (3.62  0.20) to week 8 (3.69  0.13), this increase was not significant (p=0.104). Results for peripheral blood biomarkers showed a significant decrease in overall HDL, IgM, and IgG concentrations.No significant change was seen in alpha diversity during stool analysis. &#xD;
Conclusion: The findings of this study are the first to provide evidence for the role of microbial ecosystem therapy in treating depression and anxiety. However, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size is needed for more conclusive results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sport research intimates that the presence of subgroups within a superordinate team can vary from being facilitative to debilitative at both the individual and team levels (e.g., Martin et al., 2015). Interestingly, researchers have made limited progress in documenting the processes or mechanisms that shape athlete perspectives and experiences with subgroups. Specifically, how do athletes observe the smaller entities that emerge within their superordinate teams, and what is it about them that renders them more or less favorable? The purpose of this thesis was to advance a conceptualization of athlete experiences with subgroups in sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
A four-phase qualitative design rooted in critical realism was employed, whereby: (1) six focus group interviews (n = 28 interuniversity athletes) were conducted, (2) a preliminary conceptualization based on relevant theory and themes from Phase 1 was proposed, (3) group dynamics scholars (n = 5) took part in a conceptualization review process, and (4) a subsample of athletes from Phase 1 (n = 6) was reengaged for individual reflection interviews. All four phases contributed to the development of a conceptual sport subgroup framework that suggests athlete experiences with subgroups are based on the extent to which they recognize their presence (i.e., observability) and the associated behaviours (i.e., behavioural) demonstrated by the observed subgroups. These two dimensions subsequently inform individual athlete affective, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Herein, I summarize the relevant literature pertaining to subgroups, describe the methodological processes adopted for this study, advance the resulting subgroup conceptualization, discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings, and conclude by highlighting study strengths, limitations, and possible future directions, and provide a personal reflection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2018, Canada’s federal government legalized recreational cannabis, and an increase in cannabis production facilities appearing in Canadian communities warrants research on how to include cannabis production in land use planning policy. The province of Ontario has experienced a proliferation of cannabis production facilities more than any other province or territory, and this report focused on what actions the provincial government could take to assist municipal governments in planning for cannabis production. This research utilized a mixed-methods qualitative approach which included data from literature, municipal documents and key informants as well as provincial level data to depict the current state of land use planning with respect to cannabis production in Ontario. The overall objectives of this report were to identify challenges faced by Ontario municipalities in planning for cannabis production, and to provide recommendations for Ontario’s provincial government to help address municipal-level challenges. &#xD;
&#xD;
This research employed the use of four qualitative research methods: a case study, literature review, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The data that the research methods produced was analyzed and synthesized, which revealed seven overarching themes representing challenges and opportunities municipalities in Ontario experience in planning for cannabis production. Once the themes were identified, options for the provincial government to implement were outlined to address each of the seven overarching themes. The themes and their corresponding recommendations are as follows: &#xD;
&#xD;
Theme 1: Normal Farm Practices&#xD;
•	Recommendation: OMAFRA provides a clear position that cannabis production is an agricultural crop.&#xD;
•	Alternative Option: OMAFRA provides a clear position that cannabis production is not an agricultural crop.&#xD;
•	Alternative Option: Do not provide any position on cannabis as an agricultural crop.&#xD;
&#xD;
Theme 2: Types of Producers&#xD;
•	Recommendation: The provincial government takes on an advocacy role to the federal government for municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Theme 3: Comparing Cannabis Production to Other Land Uses&#xD;
•	Recommendation: Look to the Minimum Distance Separation document for the development of separation distance guidelines.&#xD;
•	Alternative Option: Look to the D-Series Guidelines for the development of separation distance guidelines or update Guidelines to include cannabis production facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Theme 4: Difficulty Striking a Balance&#xD;
•	Recommendation: Take on some responsibility for enforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
Theme 5: Unique Legislative Context&#xD;
•	Recommendation: Provide municipal planners with workshops or training opportunities that navigate the complexities of the legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Theme 6: Lack of Research and Best Practices&#xD;
•	Recommendation: Leverage and support research being conducted at academic institutions.&#xD;
•	Recommendation: Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, or Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks produce research.&#xD;
&#xD;
Theme 7: Public and Producer Input&#xD;
•	Recommendation: Incentivize a collaborative effort for mitigating cannabis-related impacts through local-level cannabis working groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
The scope of this research was limited to a high-level analysis of cannabis production as a land use for completion of a Master’s level report. Therefore, topics for future research should focus on evaluating future recorded impacts of cannabis production facilities, definitions of on-farm diversification, and value-adding and value-retaining activities as they relate to cannabis, how cannabis fits into greenbelt policies and plans, and industrial hemp and cross-pollination issues.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>North Americans and Western Europeans increasingly prefer “spirituality” to “religion.” In response to this “spiritual turn,” a voluminous literature has emerged across the human sciences. Yet the study of spirituality remains rife with discord and fragmentation. This study seeks to clarify the nature of these debates, as well as advance a substantive position within them. In Part I, following in the footsteps of contemporary cultural sociologists, I contend that the spiritual turn signals the ascent of an enduring cultural structure in Western modernity, which I call the religion of the heart. I draw from a wide array of sociological and historical studies, supplementing these with my own empirical research, in order to offer a brief history of this religious tradition, and delineate its core tenets. In Part II, I synthesize the existing scholarship on “spirituality,” advancing a genealogy of the spiritual turn since the 1960s. I maintain that the religion of the heart holds deep elective affinities with the romantic liberal social imaginary that crystallized in popular consciousness during this era and transformed the institutional spheres of Western liberal democracies, eventually giving birth to a new social order—romantic liberal modernity. In Part III, I illuminate the striking degree to which academic debates about the religion of the heart, or “spirituality,” track debates about romantic liberal modernity, delineating the social-cum-political theoretical traditions that scholars have drawn upon to criticize both. I then draw from the Durkheimian tradition in order to mount a defense of the animating ideals of romantic liberalism, challenge these traditions’ chief theoretical and normative presuppositions, and flag the concerns critics raise that warrant further empirical investigation. In Part IV, I advance institutional ethnographies of three sites where the religion of the heart is institutionalized in a specific discursive form as a means of assessing the validity of these concerns. I conclude that while critics may have reason to disparage both the religion of the heart, and romantic liberal modernity more generally, the reality is far more complex than their critiques suggest— and more importantly, far less hopeless.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As more actors embrace agroecology as an alternative to industrial agriculture, it is important to recognize that the ways in which agroecology are taught and learned have a profound effect on whether or not the spread of agroecology will align with the goals of food sovereignty. Campesino-a-Campesino (CaC), or peasant-to-peasant, is a horizontal, constructivist pedagogy responsible for spreading agroecology among Campesinos/as across Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s. CaC is characterized by knowledge exchange between peers—a process of collective reflection and action through which peasants share agroecological practices and innovative solutions to problems. The purpose of this study was to investigate both how CaC promotes peasant protagonism and what makes CaC a unique catalyst for spreading agroecology.&#xD;
Using critical educational ethnographic methods, this case study analyzed CaC in practice in five communities in Calakmul, Campeche, Mexico, supported by the NGO Fundo Para La Paz (FPP). Through in-depth interviews and member reflections with promoters, facilitators, coordinators and community group members, as well as observations of agroecology workshops, a case was formed to illuminate socio-cultural and socio-political conditions of engagement/disengagement, the motivations of Campesinos/as, and pedagogical tools of CaC which influence the adoption of agroecology practices.&#xD;
The data revealed that these communities were contributing to their food sovereignty by adopting agroecological practices learned through CaC processes. After a year as promoter guides, Indigenous women saw themselves as protagonists in their communities. Guiding principles that fostered a culture of participation countering the hegemony of paternalism included (a) promotion of Indigenous knowledge, languages and culture, (b) a focus on relationship and capacity building, and (c) a gradual transfer of responsibility toward community self-sufficiency. In the transition toward agroecology, hands-on workshops, on-farm exchanges of experience with knowledgeable peers, and promoter guide implementation of practices were important. These results point to CaC’s potential to destabilize the structures of development and agricultural education, and create decolonial action by changing who has the power to create goals and lead discourse. Based on this case study, it is recommended that actors promoting agroecology use CaC pedagogy as a way to foster food sovereignty in Campesino/a communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Equitable access to the social determinants of health, including adequate housing, is essential to the attainment of health equity goals. Concerted intersectoral action involving public health, social services, relevant non-profit and private sector entities, multiple levels of government, and community members is necessary to ensure that all people have the conditions necessary for health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation chronicles the development and field-testing of a novel approach to building stronger and more equity-focused approaches to intersectoral action towards health equity goals. Through a participatory action research project in the rural community of Owen Sound, Ontario, a team of academic and community-based researchers worked together from 2017-2019 to design and implement a methodology for Equity-focused Intersectoral Practice (EquIP) to support local response to an escalating housing crisis. Implemented as a series of Learning Exchanges followed by an immersive Intersectoral Retreat, the novel EquIP methodology created uncommon spaces for relationship-building and knowledge co-creation among diverse intersectoral actors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key to the methodology was the leadership of community members whose grounded expertise derives from their lived experience of housing inadequacy, poverty, and other dimensions of social marginalization.  Centering their grounded expertise served to catalyze professionals from relevant agencies and institutions to reflect on the structures, beliefs, and practices that perpetuate inequitable access to the social determinants of health and impede effective intersectoral response.&#xD;
&#xD;
The research demonstrated that this “reversing the gaze” to identify gaps and disconnects in the institutional realm can broaden the lens of intersectoral action to include contextual and upstream factors, such as racism, inadequate mental health supports, and the stigmatizing effects of neoliberal austerity in social welfare policy. The research suggests that investing in authentic relationship-building among diverse intersectoral actors can help bridge the social, cultural, and epistemic distances that can impede effective and sustained intersectoral action. &#xD;
&#xD;
Through its integration of critical social science perspectives with public health practice, the EquIP model holds promise as a practical means of re-orienting intersectoral efforts towards the structural drivers and socio-economic injustices that perpetuate health inequities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-MS) is a valuable technique for detecting larger biomolecules such as oligosaccharides, glycosides and glycoproteins. The reliability of nano-ESI-MS, however, depends largely on the spray emitter properties. Commercial single-aperture, tapered nano-ESI emitters are limited by poor robustness, high clogging tendencies and a limited range of experimental flow rates. In order to overcome these limitations and yield mass spectrometry (MS) methods with higher sensitivity, this thesis seeks to develop novel emitters capable of generating multiple electrosprays (MESs) from custom-designed microstructured fibers (MSFs). A wet chemical etching method with hydrofluoric acid (HF), previously established by Bachus in 2017, was employed to fabricate a series of MES emitters with different nozzle profiles. These emitters were then characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and image analysis with respect to their nozzle length, post angle and axicon angle values. By using an offline ESI setup, parameters including the hydrophobic coating, voltage, emitter- to-orifice distance, and solvent flow rate were all examined in order to identify the optimal conditions for nano-ESI-MS analysis and data acquisition. The performance of the MES emitters was then tested using these optimal parameter settings. Preliminary results show an enhanced ionization efficiency and robustness compared to single-channel, commercial alternatives. Moreover, this thesis confirms the MES emitters’ ability to guide and focus light, and thereby, operate similarly to optical axicon lenses. We then investigate whether near-infrared (IR) light, that co-propagates with the liquid flow and is focused in front of each axicon microlens, can further amplify the ion spray current. Most notably, the expected enhancement in ionization efficiency was realized by coupling 1064 nm radiation into the MES emitter using a class IIIB laser. This work demonstrates that higher sensitivity and lower detection limits in ESI-MS are achievable by using the MES emitter employed in this report in tandem with light-assisted desolvation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates optimization policies for resource distribution in network epidemics, using a model that derives from the classical Polya process. The basic mechanics of this model, called the network Polya process, are based on a modified urn sampling scheme that accounts for both temporal and spatial contagion between neighbouring nodes in a network. We present various infection metrics and use them to develop two optimization problems, one which takes place upon initialization and one which occurs continually as the network Polya process develops. We frame these problems as both one-sided and two-sided resource allocation problems with fixed budgets, and analyze a suite of potential policies. Due to the complexity of these problems, we introduce effective proxy measures for the average infection rate in each case. We also prove that the two-sided infection-curing game on the so-called expected network exposure admits a Nash equilibrium. In both the curing and initialization scenarios we introduce heuristic policies that primarily function on the basis of limiting the number of targeted nodes within a particular network setup. Simulations are run for large-scale networks to compare performance of our heuristics to provably convergent gradient descent algorithms run on the simplified proxy measures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Though enrollment rates into many of TE and BBT programs have seen some decline, mostly due to revised requirements for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), learners still stand to benefit from exposure and learning in both academic and TE learning streams. The TechnoMath program was a collaborative effort between the Ontario Ministry of Education and a school board in Southern Ontario to support integrated teaching and learning between TE and mathematics. In this program, TE and mathematics teachers were assigned to work collaboratively to develop and teach an integrated curriculum combining a TE subject area within Grade 10 mathematics. The purpose of this study was to examine how these teachers applied interdisciplinary teaching in their collaborative practice and how they navigated challenges throughout its implementation. A qualitative case study methodology was used to respond to the following research questions: (1) How do two teachers collaborate to deliver an integrated TE and academic mathematics program? (2) What challenges do teachers face during integrated teaching of the TechnoMath program, and how do they navigate these challenges? and (3) What perceived benefits and weaknesses do teachers identify in the TechnoMath program? &#xD;
 These research questions were explored using teachers’ perspectives as examined through participant-observations, document analysis (i.e., curricular materials), field notes, and semi-structured interviews. This case study described an integrated teaching model in which TE and academic subjects were delivered with consideration for how teachers navigated challenges to integrated teaching and learning.  &#xD;
Data were open-coded using NVivo software; the codes mapped onto seven themes after analysis. These themes were: (1) Teachers’ readiness; (2) Assessment; (3) Student experience and learning; (4) Subject integration; (5) Curricular content; (6) Collaborative practice: and, (7) Financial and planning challenges. Research found that collegial collaboration was present and essential in helping participants overcome challenges faced as a result of teaching an integrated program. TechnoMath also allowed teachers to deliver larger scale projects as a result of their collaboration, though student engagement was not as high as expected. Planning time, assessment strategies, and logistics surrounding procurement of project materials were the main challenges faced by teachers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation analyzes how negative conceptions of aging are weaponized against the bodies of female players in the eighteenth century, particularly when players are engaging in behaviour that society deems transgressive or inappropriate. While it considers accounts concerning the oppression of aging female bodies, it is more interested in how aging is negatively projected onto actresses, regardless of the woman’s chronological or physiological age. In the introduction, this dissertation establishes a foundation for this investigation by understanding the intersections of acting and aging in the eighteenth century: how aging affected an actor’s abilities and reception, and how acting was believed to prematurely age an actor’s body. As its evidence, the introduction analyzes newspaper advertisements for anti-aging products, pamphlets that promote anti-aging techniques, acting manuals, and the autopsy of an early eighteenth-century player, Barton Booth. The second chapter investigates the treatment of aging actresses by audiences, critics and managers, through an analysis of the work of prominent theatrical practitioners and critics, chiefly David Garrick, John Hill, W.R. Chetwood, and William Hazlitt. The chapter argues that actresses who remain onstage are depicted as losing their identity alongside their youth. The following two chapters consider comic actress Frances Abington’s successful mediations of her physical body in response to ageist critiques. Chapter three argues that Abington responded to critics by threatening to remove her supposedly “unattractive aging” body from view byway of a feigned retirement, while chapter four contends that her sartorial skill allowed her body to be viewed as consistently novel, if not specifically youthful. While Frances Abington is the primary case study for these chapters, the actress’ experiences are discussed in relation to those of other eighteenth-century actresses as well, namely Charlotte Charke, George Anne Bellamy, Mary Robinson, and Anne Oldfield. The final chapter analyzes the obituaries of Susannah Cibber and Sophia Baddeley as evidence for how theatrical and paratheatrical texts function as a form of social policing against immoral behaviour with punishments enacted on the physical female body. Overall, the dissertation is an examination of the ageist language that has been used in attempts to oppress women, and how actresses respond to these denigrations. This work connects eighteenth-century theatre history with the growing field of age studies by demonstrating how age intersects with narratives of gender performance and identity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Evaporative spray cooling is a technique that utilizes the latent heat of evaporation of a cold liquid spray to rapidly cool a hot gaseous source. During evaporation the liquid droplets are fixed at their boiling point, ensuring a large temperature differential between liquid and gas, and promoting high heat transfer rates. The application of note for this research is the infrared radiation (IR) suppression of naval vessel exhaust streams which have a distinctive radiative signature due to the hot carbon dioxide and water vapour within the exhaust. Cooling of the exhaust stream greatly reduces this signature and limits the possibility of tracking by hostile sources [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
Despite extensive and historical use in fields such as fire suppression, the detailed mechanics of evaporative sprays are incredibly complex and predictive simulation of these flows has only been made possible with the rapid increase in computational power over the last two decades [2]. This research presents a dual approach in which results from optical measurements of a scale naval vessel exhaust system equipped with evaporative spray cooling are compared with the findings of multi-phase spray flow computational fluid dynamics (CFD).&#xD;
&#xD;
Spray flow experiments were run at the Grant Timmins research facility on the Hot Gas Wind Tunnel (HGWT), a rig capable of emulating a scale naval vessel exhaust system. With previous research focussing on direct spray measurement, an optical approach was undertaken utilizing a laser sheet to produce overall spray images and high-speed droplet imagery. In conjunction with experimentation a spray flow CFD study was constructed within the ANSYS suite of software tools. Given the complexity of real-world spray mechanics, simplified models form the bulk of the droplet-gas interaction within CFD and ensuring these models perform well together forms the crux of these simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
The CFD results produced compare well with droplet velocity measurements, but spray spread and evaporation rates do not match experiment. Despite this, it is likely that a robust predictive CFD methodology may yet be created in the same software suite given further inquiry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The overall purpose of this doctoral thesis was to build an understanding of financial barriers faced by people with disabilities to pay for their prescription medications. The thesis was composed of four different studies that were designed and conducted logically to fulfill this objective. Study 1 was a scoping review that analyzed the type, extent, and quantity of research available on CRNA to prescription drugs in Canada. The study had three notable findings: first, between 4-36% of Canadians face CRNA to fulfill their medications; second, people between 18 and 64 years, with low income, poor health status, no insurance coverage, and high out-of-pocket cost on medications are at risk of facing CRNA; and third, CRNA to prescriptions may have an adverse effect on individuals’ health and may lead to other social consequences; however, the evidence for this is still underdeveloped. This research revealed an evidence gap that no studies are available to understand CRNA among people with disabilities. Study 2 was a theoretical paper that argued for the reconsideration of existing models on CRNA for application to people with disabilities. The study suggested an adapted model needed to examine CRNA within the context of disability. This adapted model served as a conceptual framework for study 3. Study 3 quantified the magnitude and risk factors of medication non-adherence among people with SCIs. The study revealed that the cost of prescribed medications spent by individuals with SCIs and the extent of CRNA is greater than that is reported for general Canadian households. Medication-related, disability-related, and socio-economic factors were the main influencers that determined the risk of facing CRNA among participants, parallel to what was proposed in the adapted model. Lastly, study 4 aimed to understand the processes underpinning medication cost burden through a qualitative inquiry. The study found five key strategies adopted by the participants to manage the burden of medication cost. From the overall findings of the thesis, I offer recommendations to improve financial access to medications among people with disabilities in general and people with SCIs in particular, within Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The costs of mental illness - economic, social, and human - are immense. However, the demand for evidence-based non-pharmaceutical therapies appears to exceed the availability of these services, and when therapy is available, sustained client engagement can remain a prominent issue. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been well-established as an effective form of psychotherapy in the treatment of mental illness. Low-intensity CBT evolved from standard CBT to address availability concerns while maintaining effectiveness, but issues of engagement remain. Music has the potential to be a popular and effective new medium for low-intensity CBT because of the positive emotional connection people have with it, the potential ease of adaptation to a low-intensity therapy format, and its non-verbal nature. &#xD;
The purpose of this project was to develop, and assess the feasibility of, two low-intensity CBT-based music group protocols, CBT-Music (Study 1, Chapter 2; for symptoms of depression and anxiety) and CBTp-Music (Study 2, Chapter 3; for symptoms of psychosis), for individuals in community mental health care. A randomised controlled trial (RCT - Study 1) and a pre-post trial (Study 2) were used. Measures of therapeutic acceptability (i.e. recruitment, attendance, &amp; client feedback) and clinical effectiveness (i.e. symptomology &amp; disability) were gathered in both studies. &#xD;
Development and provision of a standard CBT-based group protocol utilising music as a delivery medium was successful, as was recruitment from community mental health services. In both studies, there were high attendance rates and overall positive response from participants that showed acceptability of the group protocol. In Study 1, there was a significant decrease in measures of disability following treatment (compared to a control group), though there was no significant effect of symptom reduction. In Study 2, there was also a significant decrease in measures of disability following treatment, plus a significant reduction in the severity of delusional symptoms of psychosis.&#xD;
There have been no previous trials of a low-intensity CBT-based music group for mild-to-moderate symptoms of mental illness. The advantage of a CBT-based music group may be its potential for reaching a more comprehensive range of the general population, including individuals unsure about engagement with therapy. A CBT-based music group may help individuals with mild-to-moderate emotional and mental health difficulties, but also those at high risk of developing mental health problems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The growing use of nanoparticles in a wide variety of industries has facilitated an increasing need to detect, quantify, and size these materials. Quality control and detection of environmental contaminations are pressing areas of concern for nanoparticle analysis. A wide range of techniques promises the ability to achieve these goals; however, many struggle in certain key areas, namely reproducibility, expense, and time required to take measurements. A technique that is growing in popularity for nanoparticle analysis is single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICPMS) as it solves many of the issues that other techniques struggle with, namely reproducibility and time required for analysis. A new peak area calibration technique is shown for spICPMS and compared to the conventional average intensities approach. The peak area technique does not require measurement of the transport efficiency while still providing statistically similar results, thus eliminating one potential source of error. One area where spICPMS struggles is the sensitivity of the analysis. The sensitivity is limited by the transport efficiency of the spray chamber. To attempt to improve the sensitivity of the spICPMS method, this thesis examines modified sample introduction techniques. Flow injection and mono segmented flow analysis (MSFA) are both techniques where a discrete amount of sample is injected into a carrier stream for analysis. Additionally, infrared (IR) heating of the sample introduction system to create smaller droplets increasing the amount of sample that reaches the plasma is also examined. MSFA give similar size distributions to the conventional approach while improving the transport efficiency leading to improved precision for the measurement of nanoparticles as well as improved sensitivity and limits of detection for solution analysis. IR heating of the sample introduction system also improved the transport efficiency and therefore the sensitivity of the analysis; however, raising the temperature too high resulted in the background signal being increased. The optimal temperature that was found was 60°C. Calibrating spICPMS with the peak areas approach reduces the number of measurements required and lowers the error associated with the analysis, while using an MSFA approach as well as IR heating can increase transport efficiency and improve the sensitivity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Resonant DC-DC converters have been widely discussed with one of the most popular being the LCC topology. It’s application towards low to high voltage converters warrants the use of a capacitive output filter to limit the voltage stress on the rectifier. Designs with a high quality factor (Q) suffer from large resonant component sizes and stresses leading to power losses in the magnetic components. It is then desirable to design a low Q converter to minimize these stresses for compactness and efficiency. Previous time domain analysis shows the converter predominantly operates in one mode so a frequency domain analysis was possible. Due to the voltage charging and clamping action of the parallel resonant capacitor as a result of the capacitive output filter, enhanced fundamental harmonic approximation (FHA) models were used to analyze this topology. These were accurate for high Q designs with approximately sinusoidal waveforms but degraded for light load, low Q conditions. In this thesis, a frequency domain model considering higher order harmonics is presented for the LCC resonant converter with a capacitive output filter. This general model applies to the study of the converter under variable frequency and phase shift modulation control techniques. Converter characteristics can be studied using the provided generalized curves of voltage gain (Vo / Vi), phase shift (ϕ), and non-conduction angle (θ). Using the nth harmonic equivalent circuit, steady state performance is easily obtained. The model is verified against a 380V, 250W experimental prototype with 22-44V input and the commercial simulation software PSIM.  A simple design procedure is detailed focusing on low Q designs helping minimize the stress and size of the resonant components. An optimal parallel to series capacitance ratio (k) and Q selection helps reduce conduction and magnetic losses of the converter.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives: The first objective of this study is to describe measures of sleep in day and rotating shift workers. The second objective is to assess the bi-directional relationships between sleep and melatonin among: 1) female hospital day workers; and, 2) female rotating day/night shift workers, in two models:  Model A includes the assessment of sleep on work days on melatonin the following day and Model B includes the assessment of melatonin on work days on sleep the following day.  These models were determined in a stratified analysis based on shift work status and cumulative shift work duration in years. &#xD;
Methods:  In a cross-sectional study of female hospital employees (n=266), sleep parameters  were collected using Actical® accelerometers and assessed using the Cole-Kripke algorithm. Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations were collected over 24 hours and examined using cosinor analysis to obtain average concentrations (mesor) and time of peak concentration (acrophase time). All relationships were analyzed using multiple linear regression. &#xD;
Results: Day workers slept about seven hours per night in both temporal models, whereas rotating workers slept less than seven hours between two night shifts and more than seven hours following their second night shift. When sleep precedes melatonin, for every hour increase in main sleep time, a 13-minute decrease in melatonin acrophase time was observed among rotating shift workers (95% CI: -26.5– -0.3). Effect modification by cumulative shift work duration (&lt; 10 years vs. ≥ 10 years) was apparent in the relationship between main sleep time and mesor for the time period of Model A (p-value for interaction = 0.02). There were weak associations with sleep latency in both models. &#xD;
Conclusion: In comparison to day workers, rotating shift workers were more likely to not meet the recommended seven hours of sleep per night over the two temporal periods of interest, which is a public health concern. Sleep and melatonin may be related temporally in both directions in the relationship between main sleep time and melatonin acrophase time. The effect of sleep duration on melatonin may depend on the total length of exposure to shift work and not on current day or rotating shift status.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5 plays an important role in atrial repolarization and vascular tone of pulmonary arteries. Dysfunction of Kv1.5 channels can lead to atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension, both of which are associated with hypoxia. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on Kv1.5 channels. We induced hypoxia by culturing Kv1.5-expressing HEK 293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in hypoxic conditions (0.5% O2) and then recorded Kv1.5 current using whole-cell voltage clamp. We observed that 3 hours of hypoxic culture reduced current after 3 hours. Using immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis, we found that hypoxic culture-induced decrease in current was not caused by the internalization of mature Kv1.5 channels from the membrane. However, we found that hypoxia-induced current reduction is mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS). First, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment decreased current in a manner similar to hypoxic culture. Second, the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing agent, abolished the effects of hypoxia-induced current reduction. Therefore, our results demonstrate that disrupting ROS-mediated posttranslational modification abolishes the hypoxia-induced reduction in Kv1.5 current. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced reduction in Kv1.5 current required specific cysteine residues within the Kv1.5 channel; using point mutations, our results showed that mutation of Cys581 abolished hypoxia-induced current reduction. Therefore, we have demonstrated that hypoxia decreases IKv1.5 through the production of ROS and that the subsequent posttranslational modifications involve Cys581.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Photogrammetry has seen great technological advancements since its inception almost 150 years ago. Today digital cameras are being mounted to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and used for aerial surveying and photogrammetry. Within the past decade, consumer-grade multi-rotor UAVs have become viable platforms for performing low altitude aerial photogrammetry. Modern-day photogrammetric software has become so advanced that processing requires minimal intervention for the user to produce results. Although performing low altitude aerial photogrammetry can achieve a high ground sample distance, at these low altitudes, artifacts and inadequacies begin to appear within produced digital surface models and orthophotos. Additionally, many flight plan and post-processing software packages limit or even hide features that prevent users from fully taking advantage of photogrammetric practices and the capabilities of consumer multi-rotor UAVs. In this study, through the modification of flight plan CSV files, several different methods are explored to re-introduce photogrammetric practices to the multi-rotor UAV platform in an attempt to improve the production of digital surface models and orthophotos. Flight plans are modified to allow for images to be captured in portrait orientation using a fixed camera to achieve an improved project depth accuracy. By further modifying flight plan CSV files, automated aerial camera calibration flight plans are created while incorporating traditional terrestrial calibration techniques. The use of an automated camera pre-calibration flight plan is found to outperform auto-calibration workflows. Lastly, with the ability to modify a flight plans CSV file, the Maltese-cross camera network is simulated using a single camera onboard a consumer-grade multi-rotor UAV to achieve simultaneous horizontal and vertical mapping at low altitude. These approaches combine to allow for improved data acquisition and post-processing when using consumer-grade multi-rotor UAVs to produce high-quality digital surface models and orthophotos. Improving these photogrammetric products allows for users to take full advantage of the features of consumer multi-rotor UAVs while ensuring photogrammetric best practices are maintained. The ability to modify a flight plan introduces the possibility of creating more complex automated flight plans for improved workflows.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project analyzes the important and knotted interventions that hip hop artists bring to the Canadian academy. I think through how university institutions preserve white supremacist values alongside diversity mandates and show that the displacement of black histories and black knowledges—which in fact favour myths of a colour-blind and benevolent Canada—creates barriers to learning. This displacement is coupled with the ways many universities in North America often commit to teaching hip hop music on neoliberal terms; these institutions often put forth multicultural policies that centre normative ways of knowing and a politics of inclusion that undermines black intellectual work. This dissertation theorizes that the teachings of black popular culture and hip hop interrupt and recast these kinds of white supremacist educational practices. Hip hop pedagogies can and do restructure the classroom in the wake of ongoing antiblackness and colonialism. I address how black Canada is a contested historical site that informs learning practices and I think through radical classroom spaces that are founded on black activism. I pair these historical contestations and radical learning sites with analyses of the sub-discipline of Hip Hop Studies as well as the pedagogical underpinnings of hip hop. Interviews with faculty also comprise part of my research and uncover the complexities of teaching hip hop and black studies in North America. Points of my dissertation take up Canadian producer WondaGurl whose beats, flows, and samples allow me to engage the question of pedagogy through aesthetics and music-making and centre how music and music-making are connected to emancipatory practices.&#xD;
My dissertation ends with a syllabus designed for an upper year undergraduate course that focuses on WondaGurl. I imagine this course as a pedagogical moment for (co-)production, wherein the students listen to her work and position it in conversation with academic texts that centre black histories and radical imaginations. In this way, my dissertation concludes by enmeshing theory with practice, and highlighting the pedagogical and emancipatory possibilities of black popular cultures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Psychiatry faces epistemic problems because of its roughly dualist philosophy of mind. Theory and practice that implicitly or explicitly separate mind and body challenge psychiatry’s ability to describe, meet and treat its patients. This is particularly problematic because psychiatry has a tendency to reify diagnoses and over-medicalize patients. Reliance on inferential modes of knowing downplays the role of intuitions in the diagnostic process. Embodied cognition offers a theoretical remedy for psychiatry. The argument proceeds in three parts. The first part provides background, in the form of brief overviews of several relevant positions and issues. First is psychiatric theory’s dualism, and connected problems of epistemic access. Next, the roles of antirealism and realism are related to research trends and the political stance of psychiatry. Third, the current state of affairs is entrenched by psychiatric pedagogy and arises from psychiatric history. Last, the standard model of cognition used in psychiatry is described. The second part reviews work in embodied cognition, which rejects, or at least modifies, the standard view of cognition. Theories established by Michelle Maiese and Andy Clark are used to generate a concept of an agent as an affectively framed predictive processor. The third and final part of the argument illustrates how an embodied understanding of cognition informs the clinical work of the psychiatrist. Intersubjective knowing is defined and shown to reflect an embodied understanding, which privileges intuition as epistemically valuable. Adopting an embodied view of cognition changes the process of diagnosis in psychiatry, in particular by altering the definitions psychiatry employs for disorder and normality. On a deeper level, the etiology of psychiatric disorders is shown to be more causally embodied. Embodiment is posited as being a specific focus for psychiatric treatment, especially in the realm of psychotherapy. The argument demonstrates the theoretically narrow position of current standard psychiatry and presents an additive theoretical stance, in the form of embodied psychiatry. This stance opens up areas for practice and research that are likely to be beneficial to the treatment of patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spectral-correlation detectors are used to determine if a stochastic temporal process contains nonstationary components from both the classes of spectrally-correlated and generalized almost-cyclostationary processes. The established multitaper spectral-correlation detectors are derived using solely the like-taper, cross-frequency, rotational and reflectional correlations between the eignecoefficient variables for the discrete Fourier transform of the temporal process. While this assumption is reasonable for the null hypothesis of zero frequency-offset spectral correlation, it is shown in this work to be less reliable for an alternative hypothesis of nonzero frequency-offset spectral correlation. Novel spectral-correlation detectors are introduced which account for the cross-taper, frequency-offset correlations between the eigencoefficient variables as well as the total correlation between them. In the asymptotic limit of increasing record size, these detectors are invariant to linear transfer functions. The test power and the robustness of the asymptotic quantile estimates to the process finitedimensional distributions is explored. The voltage series of a relative ionospheric opacity meter is considered for analysis. This instrument is sensitive to opacity fluctuations in the ionospheric D-region, and so it is used to monitor and forecast space-weather conditions. Results suggest that a complex-Gaussian approximation for the eigencoefficient variables is accurate. In this work, novel theory is introduced to help justify this distributional behaviour. The theory reveals a class of processes which can be used to assess the model uncertainty of the different spectral-correlation detectors, but it does not provide convergence rates over the record size. Therefore, a simulation study has been carried out to determine possible record sizes for which holds the aforementioned complex-Gaussian behaviour. For the considered riometer voltage series, results of this simulation study suggest that a 54-day record length at 120-second sampling period might well be sufficient for the complex-Gaussian behaviour to hold. Throughout the analysis, interesting periodic components are found in the voltage process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are hyperabundant in parts of Thousand Islands National Park because of their ecological impact on its forests.  To manage the high number of deer on Hill Island, an annual population reduction occurs in the park.  This study is intended to inform managers on the seasonal habitat use of the island by deer, so they are better able to evaluate impacts on affected forests.  Winter aerial surveys (10 historical surveys from 1992-2006, supplemented by surveys in 2018 and 2019) and seasonal deer pellet counts (winter 2018, summer 2018, winter 2019) were conducted to estimate resource selection and habitat use on Hill Island in Thousand Islands National Park.  Recent aerial surveys were also used to test locational accuracy and detectability of observations during flights.  Relative predictive surfaces were generated in a geographic information system where they could be compared to seek patterns of deer use contingent on method or season.  Winter aerial surveys did not corroborate winter pellet surveys well.  Detectability of deer during aerial surveys varied by cover type, and biased model results towards less important habitats.  Model validation indicated that the selected aerial model had modest predictive capability at the scale used.  Conversely, hilltops and areas with a high probability of hemlock occurrence, concentrated on the centre of the island, were judged to be high relative use areas by deer in winter when using pellet counting.  Summer use was not well-predicted by any of the habitat variables tested, and spatial patterns were different than winter estimates.  The results suggest that forest restoration and monitoring efforts in the park might be best focussed on upper elevation, high hemlock content areas in the centre of Hill Island to account for concentrated winter use there. Results also point to the need for an assessment of habitat use at a broader spatial extent to examine seasonal deer movement within the entire Thousand Islands region.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, I investigate economic and policy issues presented in the Canadian mortgage market. In Chapter 2, I describe the institutional details and recent macroprudential regulations targeting the mortgage market--especially the mortgage stress tests. In Chapter 3, co-authored with Jason Allen, we develop a framework for investigating dynamic competition in markets where price is negotiated between an individual customer and multiple firms repeatedly. Using contract-level data for the Canadian mortgage market, we provide evidence of an “invest-then-harvest” pricing pattern: lenders offer relatively low interest rates to attract new borrowers and poach rivals' existing customers, and then at renewal charge interest rates which can be higher than what may be available through other lenders in the marketplace. We build a dynamic model of price negotiation with search and switching frictions to capture key market features. We estimate the model and use it to investigate (i) the effects of dynamic competition on borrowers' and banks' payoffs, (ii) the implications of dynamic versus static settings for merger-studies, and (iii) the impacts from stress tests on mortgage renewals. In Chapter4, co-authored with Robert Clark, we show that Canadian banks behaved strategically to limit the efficacy of the mortgage stress tests, which require borrower qualification based on the mode of 5-year rates posted by the Big 6 banks rather than negotiated transaction rates. The government aimed to cool credit markets, but since many mortgages are government-insured, Big 6 interests were not aligned. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing the change in 5-year spreads with the change in 3-year spreads, unaffected by the policy, we find benchmark qualifying rates were  lowered to encourage continued borrowing, muting the impact of the stress tests on borrower qualification.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is an established cause of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and moderate exposure is hypothesized to be protective against some non-cutaneous cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The first aim of this thesis was to estimate the current and future burden of melanoma and NMSCs associated with UVR and modifiable UVR behaviours in Canada. The second aim was to explore the relationship of time spent in the sun and the risk of NHL in a Canadian setting. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: The burden of skin cancer associated with UVR in 2015 was estimated by comparing 2015 rates of melanoma and NMSCs with estimated rates of a 1920 birth cohort for melanoma and with rates of less exposed body sites (trunk and legs) for NMSCs. Skin cancer attributable to modifiable UVR behaviours (indoor tanning, sunburn, and sunbathing) was estimated using relative risks relevant to Canada by conducting meta-analyses and prevalence of exposures from a nationally representative survey. A prospective cohort study examining the risk of NHL was conducted using self-reported questionnaire data from three Canadian cohorts that were linked to cancer incidence data. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, using age as the time-scale was employed to investigate this relationship with control for relevant confounders. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: For 2015, we estimated that 62.3% of melanomas, 80.5% of basal cell carcinomas (BCC), and 83.0% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) were attributable to UVR, while 29.7% of melanomas, 46.0% of BCCs, and 17.4% of SCCs were attributable to modifiable UVR behaviours. Compared to individuals spending &lt; 30 min/day in the sun the risk of developing NHL was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.55-1.28) for 30-59 minutes, 0.63 (95% CI: 0.40-0.98) for 1-2 hours, and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.61-1.36) for &gt; 2 hours. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Prevention efforts aimed at modifiable UVR behaviours are crucial for reducing the burden of skin cancer in Canada, while moderate exposure to the sun may reduce the risk of NHL. Further research is required to clarify the optimal UVR exposure patterns in terms of preventing the development of both cutaneous and non-cutaneous cancers, including NHL.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The perspectives of college students and teachers regarding academic literacy are largely absent from literature on literacy in higher education, particularly in Canada. This study addresses this gap by centering the perspectives of first-year college students and teachers from one college in southern Ontario. &#xD;
&#xD;
For the purposes of this research, I define academic literacy as the nuanced blend of critical attention, creative processes, and cognitive skills that are necessary to communicate successfully in school, across disciplines and levels of study. My research has been guided by the following questions: How do college students and teachers perceive academic literacy during the first year of college? What do the metaphors college teachers create about academic literacy reveal about their perceptions? What do the metaphors college students create about academic literacy reveal about their perceptions? And, how do these perceptions of academic literacy change over time, specifically in the context of the first-year experience? &#xD;

To answer these questions, I designed an artful, multi-phase metaphoric study consisting of three phases that was guided by a hermeneutic analysis approach. During Phase 1, I visited participating first-year college courses and delivered a creative writing workshop that guided participants through the process of creating their own metaphors for academic literacy. In Phase 2, I met one-on-one with participants for a think aloud task and a semi-structured interview. Finally, during Phase 3, I met with participants for member checking and a final conversational interview. &#xD;
&#xD;
This study theorizes four preliminary threshold concepts of academic literacy in the first-year college classroom in order to inform both research and praxis in this transitional space. These threshold concepts, combined with the academic literacy lenses Lea and Street proposed that I explore in Chapter 3, form the conceptual framework of this study. Based on this work, teachers, students, and researchers can approach transitional academic literacy as transdisciplinary, as tied to privilege and identity, as a tool for transformation, and as something deeply connected with a range of emotional responses. Further, this work contributes a new approach to academic literacy research through a multi-phase metaphoric study design.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In naturalistic scene processing, individuals adopt multiple resources to facilitate their object identification processes. For instance, scene context information contains many cues to facilitate recognition of an object, including the scene gist category and other semantically related objects. Similarly, individuals’ capacity to allocate attention independently from eye-movement suggests extrafoveal processing under circumstances where target objects are not in the center of fixation. Previous studies have shown that target-related objects or scene context, as well as extrafoveal processing of the object, may boost object perception. However, very few studies have examined the effect of multiple sources of information on object processing simultaneously.  In the present study, we investigated whether scene context and distance from fixation would interact and influence individuals’ object identification. Using a modified dot-boundary paradigm, we manipulated the distance of objects in relation to the fixation so that participants have varying difficulty in processing the objects with peripheral vision. Crucially, we examined whether individuals’ ability to extract extrafoveal information was modulated by a semantically related scene context. Our findings revealed a robust preview effect, although there was no scene context effect and nor a context-preview interaction. Altogether, our data suggest individuals may have chosen to rely on one route of facilitation when the other path is restricted.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Plants typically allocate axillary meristems to one of three principal fates: growth (G), reproduction (R), or inactivity (I). The latter is commonly enforced by ‘apical dominance’, promoting a growth form that favours vertical shoot extension — mediated by the effects of auxin produced in the shoot apical meristem. When the latter is removed however (e.g. by herbivores), meristem allocation may change, thus affecting plant architecture, biomass accumulation, and/or reproductive effort. Fecundity and/or plant mass may consequently suffer (under-compensate), remain unaffected (compensate), or increase (overcompensation). The latter signifies a ‘cost of apical dominance’, but one that may be outweighed by several potential benefits from having apical dominance intact. I removed the shoot apical meristem for replicate plants early in the growing season within natural populations of 22 herbaceous angiosperm species with a conspicuously vertical growth form commonly found in eastern Ontario to: (i) test for a cost of apical dominance; (ii) examine effects on leaf size and leafing intensity; and (iii) explore effects of between-species variation in leafing intensity on propensity for a cost of apical dominance. Clipped and unclipped plants had their near neighbours removed, and were harvested after flowering production had finished but before seed dispersal. Dry mass was measured separately for above-ground body size, leaves, seeds, and fruit; and counts were recorded for each type of meristem, and number of leaves, fruits, and seeds per plant. I predicted that: (i) species with a strong apically-dominant growth form would respond to shoot apical meristem removal with greater branching intensity, and thus over-compensation in terms of fecundity and/or biomass; and (ii) overcompensation is enabled by production of more but smaller leaves, and hence with a larger bank of axillary meristems available for deployment in branching and/or fruit production. Widely variable compensatory capacities were recorded, suggesting effects of uncontrolled between-species variation in phenology, life history traits, and natural susceptibility to herbivory. I also found no significant between-species relationships for compensatory response versus mean leaf size or leafing intensity. Overall, the results point to species-specific treatment effects on meristem allocation patterns, and no generalized ‘cost of apical dominance’ in herbaceous plants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Due to the complex nature of the wrist, we still do not fully understand how the healthy wrist functions. There are few muscle insertions at the wrist, so bone motion is induced by passive ligaments and bone to bone contact, making carpal bone kinematics challenging to understand and model. This challenge is magnified by subject-specific variation in ligament properties and bone shape. Previous work has linked variation in carpal bone motion to changes in wrist flexibility, but these investigations have focused on the radial side of the wrist. Thus, many potential causes of variation in carpal motion patterns have yet to be thoroughly explored. &#xD;
&#xD;
To further understand the causes and ramifications of variation in normal carpal kinematics, we performed two studies using a database of 3D in vivo carpal bone postures. For the first study, we investigated variation in carpal bone motion on the ulnar side of the wrist. Contrary to theories embedded in the literature, we found that the triquetrum and lunate did not move in synchrony across a variety of functional wrist movements. We also identified a relationship between motion of the triquetrum and wrist laxity during wrist movement from 20° of radial deviation to 20° of ulnar deviation. During this movement, the component of flexion-extension in the motion of the triquetrum increased with increased wrist flexibility. In our second study, we investigated the influence of scaphoid shape on wrist flexibility. We found that the first two principal components of scaphoid shape were correlated with wrist flexion and extension range of motion, respectively. We also found evidence that scaphoid posture may be independent of scaphoid shape. Scaphoid posture affected the amount of scaphoid rotation during wrist flexion and extension.&#xD;
Finally, we discuss how we can apply our findings to the development and evaluation iof surgical techniques through two ongoing projects: simulating wrist motion in cadaveric specimens, and investigating how scaphoid shape impacts screw placement following scaphoid fracture. The findings from this work provide insights about the intricacies of carpal bone motion, a step towards explaining differential responses to injury and treatments with the potential to inform targeted, patient-specific interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the past two decades, there has been a disturbing rise in the refugee population with over 65 million people displaced from their homes as of 2019. This alarming increase has been due to terrorist activities, civil war and drought which led to people seeking refuge in neighbouring countries or heading to Europe or North America for a better life. This along with the terrorist attack of September 11th, gave rise to the use of biometric technology as a means of population, security and migration control. It is considered by many in the security community as the most accurate means of determining a person’s identity and is the main mechanism used by most NGOs and governments when dealing with refugees, which has given rise to discussions surrounding its impact and efficacy. This thesis explores the debate surrounding the use of Biometric technology on such a vulnerable population and how the collection of such data impacts the lives of these people. &#xD;
To analyze this debate, articles from several academic researchers as well as documentation written by non-governmental organizations will be examined under the framework of documentary research. This study explores the issues surrounding the global refugee crisis and the rising expansion of biometric technology in various facets of the refugee migration process. It attempts to show the impact the collection of biometric data has on refugees and the refugee process as well as display the overall perceptions society has regarding biometrics and refugees. &#xD;
	This research finds that although the use of biometric technology is essential to the refugee process, there are several adverse effects with the use of such technology on a vulnerable population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Thermal management requirements in modern aircraft have been increasing over time, driven by the increase in the thermal loads generated by a variety of electronic components and hydraulic systems. A literature review has suggested that using the fuel, which is meant for propulsion, to collect the heat generated and reject part of it to the ambient is the most effective method to achieve thermal management in the current generation of aircraft. The analysis presented in this thesis thus focused on the performance of fuel thermal management systems (FTMS) for managing the various thermal loads in an aircraft. The FTMS model consisted of four major components including a fuel storage tank, high-temperature and low-temperature heat exchangers and bypass-loop with proportioning valve. To facilitate the analysis, the FTMS was numerically modelled using a “systems” approach based on the principles of conservation of mass and energy. From this theoretical model, a numerical model of the FTMS was developed in the MATLAB/Simulink programming environment. For the model, the system’s heat exchangers were simulated using a logarithmic-mean temperature-difference (LMTD) approach. The model also considered variation in air and fuel properties with temperature and altitude conditions. The numerical model was compared against values published in the literature and then used to perform parametric studies for both uniform (i.e., constant altitude and cruise speed) and non-uniform (i.e., variable altitude and cruise speed) flight conditions. The research considered three primary operational conditions for the FTMS, namely: (1) a specified operating temperature for heat-dissipating elements, (2) a specified heat removal rate, and (3) a specified fuel temperature. The performance of the FTMS was evaluated for these three operational modes during both uniform and non-uniform flight conditions. In each case, the variations in the heat transfer rates and temperatures at critical point in the FTMS were calculated for a variety of flight conditions. These conditions included variations&#xD;
iii&#xD;
in altitudes, cruise speeds, fuel burn rates, high-temperature and low-temperature heat exchanger capacities, fuel tank heat-losses and fuel recirculation rates. The results of this analysis indicated that when the heat source temperature was maintained at a constant value, the heated fuel temperature increased, and the heat removal capacity degraded over the duration of flight. Conversely, for a prescribed heat removal capacity, both the heat source temperature and heated fuel temperature increased during the flight. Lastly, when the desired heated fuel temperature was specified, it was observed that the heat source temperature and the heat removal rate both decreased over time. It was concluded that the optimum fuel recirculation rate was a complex function of variables, thus highlighting the need for a dynamic control strategy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We examine the role of marketing within the financial services sector by conducting three empirical examinations that involve pricing, sales force compensation, and targeting/positioning. Beginning with the first essay, we examine the profit implications of risk-based pricing, using the context of indirect lending, which involves a lender, sales agent, and customer. To account for the decisions made by each of these stakeholders, we develop a three-stage choice model that allows us to quantify the impact of various factors on each of these decisions. Using the estimates from this model, we optimize the customer rate and agent incentive for each risk segment, determining that risk-based pricing increases lender profitability by 26%. In the second essay, we examine the behaviour of external sales forces, again using the context of indirect lending. We find that commission impacts both the demand allocation and pricing decisions made by external sales forces, albeit to a larger extent for the pricing decision. Given the impact of commission on these decisions, we optimize the commission rate for each price on the focal lender’s menu of prices, finding that commission should exponentially increase with price to alleviate moral hazard concerns that arise when external sales agents select the lowest price to secure a sale. Optimizing commission in this way has a substantial impact on profitability, increasing return on adjusted capital by 1.33 percentage points. Finally, in essay three, we examine the motivational drivers behind customers’ decisions to use financial advisor services. A latent class choice model reveals two segments that differ in two important ways with respect to their motivations for seeking financial advice. First, although higher levels of trust, self-efficacy, and risk tolerance increase the probability of using financial advisor services for both segments, albeit to a larger extent for segment 1, personality only impacts segment 1. Second, we find that segment 1 is motivated by the extent of positive attitudes towards financial advisors (i.e. promotion focus) while segment two focuses on negative attitudes (i.e. prevention focus). Collectively, these essays increase our understanding of the role of marketing within the financial services sector, answering research questions that have gone unanswered by academics and providing practitioners with tools to improve marketing effectiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Urban agriculture is a growing trend in cities worldwide but there is concern in the literature that urban agriculture can contribute to the phenomenon of eco-gentrification. Eco-gentrification is the process whereby the environmental improvement of a neighbourhood increases land values, contributing to the gentrification process. When this occurs, urban agricultural projects increase land value and may attract new residents as part of the gentrification process, which can then displace older and less-affluent residences in the neighbourhood. Montréal, Québec is one such city where eco-gentrification may be occurring. Montréal is home to a rich history of urban agriculture and some of the world’s first rooftop gardens, and urban agriculture is only growing in popularity. My main research question asks whether the eco-gentrification process is occurring in Montréal through urban agriculture. I am particularly interested in knowing why developers might be interested in including urban agriculture and how the local city government is implicated in this process. To answers these questions, I drew on theoretical insights from urban political ecology and also grey literature from government, industry and non-profit sources. I also conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with key informants, including developers, urban planners, and community actors. I found that there was some interest from developers to include urban agriculture in their projects, but there were many challenges associated with them doing so, especially around cost and logistics. The push for urban agricultural integration into new developments was found to often be instigated through negotiated planning, and through community groups and residents in certain situations. In addition, this study showed significant concern from community residents about the possibility of urban agriculture exacerbating already existing gentrification problems in Montréal. However, there is a plethora of different forms of urban agriculture that exist in Montréal, all with different ii aims, levels of community involvement, and consequence. Prior research has demonstrated that intention and method matter when it comes to the consequences of individual projects. Future research should study the impacts on particular neighbourhoods particularly where public incentive through funding or bylaw amendment is offered.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Canada’s climate is warming and as a result the hydrological cycle is expected to become more intense, with rainfall concentrated in extreme events with longer dry spells. Consequently, dry tailings may be more likely to blow into nearby surface waters. This research is an investigation into the geochemical effects of tailings dust on nearby surface waters and evaluates dust sampling methods used to investigate seasonal trends. During this study, two abandoned mine sites in Nova Scotia, Canada were investigated: Stirling Zn-Pb and Goldenville Au mine. &#xD;
At Stirling, tailings were sieve to &lt;63μm as a proxy for dust and analyzed to determine metal concentrations and identify primary and secondary metal-bearing phases. Metal-hosting phases identified include sphalerite, smithsonite, aurichalcite, hydrohetaerolite, goethite. tennantite, galena, cerussite, Pb-Mn phases, and chalcopyrite. Shake flask tests were conducted to investigate dust solubility in simulated stream waters (pH=7). Results indicate that dust particles are partially water soluble in the shake flask test and that sphalerite, cerussite and chalcopyrite are likely the main sources of Zn, Pb and Cu in the shake flask leachate, based on calculated saturated indices and mass balance. Analyses of stream water indicate similar conditions (pH, Eh, etc.) and saturation indices compared to shake flask tests, and therefore provide reasonable insight for processes occurring the field. &#xD;
Dust was also sampled using a variety of different methods to identify the most suitable method for seasonal sampling. These included passive dry deposition collectors (PAS-DDs), high volume total suspended particle (TSP) sampler (HVAS), dust deposition gauges (DDGs), and lichen. Results indicate that Pas-DDs with a glass fiber filters (GFF) and dust deposition gauges likely underestimate dust deposition. In comparison, Pas-DDs with a polyurethane foam disk (PUF) efficiently accumulate dust. However, PUFs had additional challenges including metal(loid)s within the filters themselves, difficulty obtaining stable weights, and potential dust collection from the sides and bottom. Despite difference between dust sampling methods, it was observed that dust deposition was highest in the winter months due to higher wind speeds. Future dust generation remains difficult to predict due to the unknown combined effect of changes in temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and wind speed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arctic terrestrial carbon (C) budgets are shifting with respect to net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), and its component fluxes; i.e., gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) under amplified high latitude climate change. Determining whether Arctic ecosystems are behaving as net sinks or net sources is important as these scenarios are associated with various feedback mechanisms, either mitigating or enhancing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Given the vast C stores in Arctic soils and permafrost, these processes can have significant impacts on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This research investigates how growing season NEE has varied from 2008 to 2018 at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) (74.92˚N, 109.58˚W) on Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada. The eddy covariance technique and standardized processing tools were used to observe inter-annual variability of NEE, GPP, and Reco and the relative importance of environmental variables in explaining variability of growing season CO2 fluxes. Overall, this site showed strong inter-annual variability in growing season NEE (range of -46.01 g C m-2 to 11.25 g C m-2) with GPP the most likely source of this variability, i.e., GPP rates were more variable compared to Reco. Inter-annual variability of growing season NEE appeared to be strongly driven by growing degree days (GDD) in warmer years, suggesting that temperature must reach a threshold in order to drive photosynthesis sufficiently to offset respiration. This deviated slightly in 2014, the second strongest CO2 sink across observed years (-21.24 g C m-2), but with reduced cumulative GDD. This is believed to be a result of delayed ecosystem response to previous environmental conditions favorable for strong CO2 uptake. CO2 fluxes also showed varying importance in the context of environmental variables at different temporal aggregations, with the remote sensing vegetation index showing strong importance for Reco, compared to GPP and NEE, suggesting a significant contribution of autotrophic respiration to Reco at this mesic site.  This research reveals unique characteristics between inter-annual growing season CO2 flux patterns for a mesic tundra landscape and environmental drivers that overall, contribute to our understanding of High Arctic tundra CO2 dynamics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The SNO+ experiment is a large-scale liquid scintillator neutrino experiment with a wide range of physics objectives. SNO+ has adopted a staged approach where the detector was first filled with ultra-pure water before substituting with liquid scintillator and the target isotope $^{130}$Te for neutrinoless double beta decay. During the SNO+ water phase, an $^{241}$Am$^{9}$Be source is deployed across the detector volume to calibrate the detector's energy response and its response to neutrons. The $^{241}$Am$^{9}$Be source emits a unique coincidence signal with the prompt event being a 4.4 MeV $\gamma$ and the delayed a neutron capture signal (2.2 MeV $\gamma$).&#xD;
&#xD;
A novel, minimalistic, statistical analysis of the $^{241}$Am$^{9}$Be calibration data was designed and used to measure the capture time constant $\tau$, capture cross-section $\sigma_{H,t}$, and the neutron detection efficiency $E_{\textrm{center}}$ at the center of the detector:&#xD;
\begin{equation}&#xD;
\begin{aligned}&#xD;
&amp;\tau = 202.35 \pm 0.42\ (stat.)\ ^{+0.38}_{-0.31}\ (syst.)~\mu\textrm{s}, \\&#xD;
&amp;\sigma_{H,t} = 336.3 ^{+1.2}_{-1.5}~\textrm{mb}, \\&#xD;
&amp;E_{\textrm{center}} = (50.8 \pm 0.6)\%.&#xD;
\end{aligned}&#xD;
\end{equation}&#xD;
&#xD;
Additionally, with the help of Monte Carlo simulations, a volume-weighted neutron detection efficiency across the detector is evaluated to be $E_{\textrm{detector}} = (46.5 \pm 0.5\ (stat.\ only))\%$. The simulation is also central to an energy calibration using the 4.4 MeV $\gamma$ to measure the energy resolution and energy scale of the detector.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, with $\sim$115 days of early water data, an upper limit, $\hat{\Phi}_{\bar{\nu}_e, \textrm{ult}}$ = $(1.76 \pm 0.29) \times 10^6 \bar{\nu}/(\textrm{cm}^2\cdot\textrm{s})$, on the reactor antineutrino flux for SNO+ is obtained using a maximum likelihood approach. The limit is about a factor of 9 higher than the expected signal in SNO+, which can be calculated using available reactor output power data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic pelvic pain condition. An agreed-upon etiology for IC/BPS remains unspecified and medical treatment is often inadequate. Research has demonstrated the condition is associated with diminished quality of life (QoL), significant pain-related disability, greater pain catastrophizing, depressed mood, and decreased social support. Psychosocial treatments have been emphasized by health-care providers and researchers alike, but to date, no study has evaluated a psychosocial treatment program for this population. The literature suggests that online psychosocial treatments can effectively improve patient outcomes in various chronic pain samples.&#xD;
The present dissertation aimed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of an online psychosocial self-management treatment program for women with IC/BPS. Based on the literature on this population and evidence-based treatments, the program targeted psychosocial risk factors (pain catastrophizing, depression, social support, disability), with the aim of improving QoL. An expert review was conducted to gather feedback on program content. A pilot study assessed patient perceived usability of and satisfaction with the intervention, which was rated as satisfactory, useful, and valuable by patients. Improvements were made in accordance with patient feedback and the literature. Finally, a wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the efficacy of the online self-management treatment program. It was hypothesized that treatment group participants would obtain improvements on the primary outcome measures of physical and mental QoL, as well as secondary outcome measures of depression, disability, pain catastrophizing, and social support, when compared with control group participants. Although these hypotheses were not supported, treatment group participants’ 3-month follow-up pain catastrophizing scores were statistically lower than baseline, and there was a clinically meaningful reduction in pain catastrophizing scores for treatment group participants, when compared with control group participants, at study end. The program was deemed highly satisfactory to patients who completed it. &#xD;
	Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. Study results led to considerations for future research. Important limitations of the present study include a large attrition rate and threats to internal validity in follow-up period analyses. Overall, an online self-management treatment program may be a potentially useful intervention for women with IC/BPS, but further research is needed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, I examine high and low frequency price discovery for US equity markets. In Chapter 3, I propose a methodology to disentangle high frequency price jumps into a permanent and transitory component. Using a variance decomposition and realized estimates I show that while jumps are extremely rare events, jump contribution to intraday price discovery is large. In Chapter 4, co-authored with Ryan Riordan, we examine the market dynamics of price jumps. We find that jumps have a predictable component which is captured by the degree of fragmentation in liquidity in minutes leading up to price jumps. Applying the methodology of Chapter 3, we show that fragmentation predicts noisier jumps. Lastly, in Chapter 5, co-authored with Evan Dudley, Luke Phelps and Ryan Riordan, we use mutual fund fire sales to decompose low frequency quarterly stock prices into an efficient and noise component. We show that more than a quarter of variance in low frequency stock prices is attributable to noise. Overall, this thesis finds that noise is an important component of both high and low frequency stock price variation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Questions of who becomes a leader, and what predicts the quality of their leadership behaviors, have been of interest to scholars and the public for decades. Although most explorations of antecedents to leadership focus on individual differences, scholars have speculated on the role of social-interpersonal contexts as potentially influential in shaping various leadership outcomes. I set out to examine how one central relationship outside of work, namely romantic relationships, shape how people lead, and whether or not they become a leader in the first instance. Drawing on ten Brummelhuis and Bakker’s (2012) Work Home-Resources Model, I examine three ways in which romantic relationship experiences spillover into leadership outcomes via their effects on personal resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Study 1, I examine how current, personal romantic relationship behaviors indirectly influence leadership behaviors through resource gain and loss. Using a randomized-clustered experimental design (n = 93 couples), results show that for female partners, positive relational behaviors serve as a contextual resource that limits personal resource loss, resulting in more positive and less negative leadership behaviors. Negative relational behaviors are a contextual demand, increasing personal resource loss, and in turn, negative leadership behaviors. In Study 2, I consider how distal personal relationships affect leadership emergence, and specifically how adolescents’ experience of dating violence indirectly affects leadership role occupancy through depressive symptoms. Drawing on a longitudinal nationally representative sample (Add Health, n = 3277), results revealed that experiencing psychological aggression for females, and experiencing physical violence across genders, are contextual demands that independently result in depressive symptoms, in turn decreasing the leader role occupancy. In Study 3, I consider how distal and vicarious relationship experiences, namely adolescents’ observations of their parents’ domestic violence, indirectly affects leader emergence. Drawing on a nationally representative sample (NCS-R, n = 1701), I found that for females, witnessing interparental domestic violence in adolescence results in greater anxious and avoidant attachment, which in turn decreases leader role occupancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Together, results from these three studies point to the multiple ways in which romantic relationship behaviors influence leadership across the lifespan, and the critical role of gender in determining whether this spillover occurs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Streaming video services have been growing rapidly in the past decade due to the wide adoption of more capable mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, together with the deployment of higher capacity mobile networks and more efficient video compression and streaming techniques. Dynamic adaptive streaming over hypertext transfer protocol (DASH) can adapt bitrates to fluctuating network bandwidth. This makes measurement of perceived video quality a significant task. Therefore, there has been a strong demand for Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements and prediction models. The work in this thesis focuses on improving the performance of existing QoE prediction models that still have a few limitations. We propose a feature enhancement approach for QoE prediction using machine learning (ML) methods.  Given the need for an accurate and reliable data set to do our analysis, train and evaluate our machine learning models, we utilize the Waterloo Streaming QoE Database III (SQoE-III) that combines the effects of video compression, initial buffering, and stalling events along with the subjective user responses to them. Additionally, the database contains the results of implementing various objective video quality assessment (VQA) models. &#xD;
First, we perform an extensive data and correlation analysis to study the effects of the different QoE key influence factors (KIF) which account for the video quality degradation. We further study the effect of quality switching that includes switching up and down, switch magnitude, ratio/time spent on the highest quality level/layer, in addition to the effect of stalling expressed as the number of stalls and their duration and initial buffering time. We analyze the effect of various objective video quality assessment (VQA) models on the QoE. The results of the analysis reveal the dependency between objective VQA models features, playback stalling, and quality switching features that affect the QoE. Towards effectively predicting user QoE and based on the results of our analysis, we identify/introduce a new set of enhanced features that combine objective VQA features, playback stalling features, and quality switching features, as input to various machine learning models to predict the values of QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed models are in close agreement with subjective opinions and significantly outperforms existing QoE prediction models and can also provide a highly effective and efficient future for QoE prediction in video streaming services.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The neuroactive steroid hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) modulates synaptic activity and plasticity in both endocrine and non-endocrine forebrain regions of males and females of a variety of species. Research conducted in songbirds has established that E2 is rapidly synthesized in the auditory forebrain in response to salient auditory experience, and this locally-synthesized E2 contributes to auditory signal processing and learning. Despite the role of E2 in auditory processing and learning, together with its effects on synaptic activity and plasticity in non-sensory regions of the mammalian forebrain, particularly the hippocampus, the modulatory actions of E2 on synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory have not been directly investigated in the mammalian auditory forebrain. The studies described in this thesis examined the modulatory role of E2 in synaptic activity and plasticity in the rodent auditory forebrain. First, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to characterize neocortical expression of the estrogen synthetic enzyme aromatase in adult male rats. Aromatase was expressed by a large population of neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), primary auditory cortex (A1), and primary visual cortex (V1). Next, in vivo field recordings were used to determine the effects of acute, bidirectional E2 manipulations on short- and long-term synaptic plasticity (paired-pulse responses and long-term potentiation; LTP) in A1. E2 significantly reduced the threshold for LTP induction at layer IV, thalamocortical synapses, whereas suppression of local E2 production by aromatase inhibition significantly reduced LTP induction at layer II/III, intracortical synapses. Acute E2 manipulations did not significantly alter paired-pulse responses in A1, suggesting a postsynaptic locus of the modulatory effects of E2 on LTP. Finally, ex vivo whole-cell recordings were used to explore the mechanisms underlying the E2-dependent modulation of LTP in A1. Agonist-evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in A1 were sensitive to bidirectional E2 manipulations in a layer-specific manner, suggesting a role for E2 in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition in this region. These findings further our understanding of the modulatory role of E2 in sensory system function and plasticity and have broad implications for the study of learning and memory.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines experimentally the development lengths (Ld) of small diameter (db) (4 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm) basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) deformed bars embedded in concrete with compressive strength ranging from 41 to 70 MPa.

The compressive strength of the UHPC ranged from 87 MPa to 132 MPa.  Both studies used the notched beam testing method. &#xD;

For the first study investigating small diameter BFRP bars, embedment lengths varied from 5 to 109 db and the clear concrete cover was 30 mm. The 44 notched beam specimens measured 101 x 203 mm in cross-section and varied in length from 610 to 1980 mm to accommodate various embedment lengths.  The bar axial stress at failure was plotted against embedment length for each set and linear regression was used to establish Ld based on the guaranteed tensile strength.  It was shown that as concrete strength increased from 41 to 70 MPa, Ld reduced from 32 to 20 db for the 4 mm bar, from 30 to 25 db for the 6 mm bar and from 52 to 23 db for the 8 mm bar. ACI440.1R-15 and CAN/CSA S806-12 design guides overestimated Ld of these small diameter bars.  Alternative equations for splitting and pullout are proposed and explained herein.  &#xD;
&#xD;
For the second study investigating sand coated GFRP bars, the embedment length was varied from 4 db to 16 db and the clear concrete cover was kept constant at 1.0 db.  The specimens experienced splitting bond failure. The average bond strength (τu) was higher in UHPC with steel fibers than PVA fibers.  It also increased with fiber content but reduced with embedment length. Consequently, Ld was smaller in UHPC with steel fibers than PVA fibers and was also reduced as fiber content increased.  The Ld values for UHPC with 4% steel, 2% steel, 3% PVA and 2% PVA were 20 db, 29 db, 35 db and 55 db, respectively.  ACI440.1R-15 (2015) and CAN/CSA S806-12 (2012) design equations provided very conservative estimations for Ld by factors of 1.5-5.7.  An alternative simple equation has been suggested for Ld.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This doctoral research project addresses some of the fundamental aspects for blast design methods in rock salt mines. An experimental field work protocol was devised based on the use of  single hole blast (SHB) tests to quantify blasting characteristics  in rock salt. Terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) surveys were implemented to capture the shape of SHB craters and enhance objectivity of the reporting methodology. This was done through large scale field testing carried out at three underground rock salt mines. A crater shape model in the form of a power law equation is proposed to define crater breakouts measured through field work. Rock salt characteristic mechanical properties were further analyzed in light of observed field measurements. The analysis led to the definition of a complementary cratering mechanism, due to  the interaction between emitted and reflected pressure waves,  to describe rock salt blasting  behaviour. A semi-iterative procedural workflow is proposed to derive site specific blast design guidelines in rock salt mines.  Practical applications of this procedure are presented and discussed, together with a few additional aspects that can help develop a more systematic and global method for optimizing blast patterns in rock salt mines .</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The nineteenth century saw a significant shift in how books were produced. Industrialization and the emergence of a mass reading public, whose members also had increased leisure time and money, led to the need for less expensive books than those bound by individual readers. Publishers’ bindings, the specific design created to address this need, also created the modern book, the book as we know it today. These bindings flourished in Britain and the United States between 1820 and 1920, but not in Canada. &#xD;
This thesis will argue that while publishers’ bindings were not as extensive in English Canada between 1870 and 1920 as they were in Britain and the United States, they did exist, as evident in the three case studies: the individual binder James Barry, the businessman John Lovell, and the collection created by Lorne Pierce. Canada, to be sure, experienced the same changes that led to the need for less expensive books in Britain and the United States. Full of potential, a few circumstances unique to Canada nevertheless frustrated and delayed the development of a significant book publishing industry for several decades. Given the state of Canadian publishing circa the 1870s, Canadian authors were forced to seek external publishing outlets for their work. This, in turn limited the need for publishing innovations. Additionally, copyright laws provided further roadblocks to the publishing business in Canada, and subsequently affected the development of a national industry able to match the quantity and quality of its British and American counterparts. Through the use of three case studies, we will see that nonetheless bookbinders and publishers alike sought creative ways to circumvent the challenges and produce these uniform bindings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees describes a refugee as a person who "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted... is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. " (UNHCR web site). Every year, millions of people around the world are forced to leave their homes to save their lives. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR, 2019) points out that over 80 million people are currently displaced due to different reasons, such as armed conflicts, famine, diseases, and other natural disasters. Recently, the catastrophic wars in the Middle East obliged millions of people to flee their home countries and seek refuge in safer places. The purpose of this study is to explore the reasons and the effects of limited English literacy skills from the perspectives of the two groups of the study participants (the Syrian participants and the ESL teachers) on the Syrian participants' integration and the resettlement process. This research study follows a qualitative research design by conducting semi-structured one-on-one interviews with the eight adult male Syrian participants and the four ESL teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
The data analysis process started with open codes. Then, similar codes were grouped together to form themes and subthemes. The results indicated that all Syrian participants left their schools at an early age in Syria because they wanted to get a job to help their families. Secondly, they pointed out that their major challenge after moving to Canada was the English language which hinders their integration process. On the other hand, the ESL teachers pointed out that they need more training sessions on how to teach and deal with different refugee students coming from different parts of the world. Besides, they mentioned that the curriculum guidelines they use at their school do not meet the students' learning needs. The study concludes with recommendations for a better understanding of the urgent needs of the refugee students to help them understand the language as well as the culture of the host country.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Catecholamines are thought to have a major modulatory effect on cognition. However, there is only equivocal evidence that catecholamines have a direct impact on cognition. A body of research suggests that catecholamines influence motivation, through which they may have an indirect effect on cognition. Theories of motivation distinguish directional (behaviour toward or away from some stimuli) and activational aspects of motivation. The activational aspects of motivation (or behavioural activation) refer to the quantitative and qualitative features of motivated behaviour (speed, vigour and persistence) that enable organisms to overcome constraints that prevent them from obtaining a motivational stimulus. &#xD;
&#xD;
Here we investigated the contribution of catecholamines to cognition (using working memory as a cognitive model; working memory is a limited-capacity cognitive process that temporarily retains relevant information to guide thoughts and actions) and behavioural activation by augmenting catecholamine neurotransmission using the catecholamine reuptake inhibitors methylphenidate (MPH; 0.1-10 mg/kg) and atomoxetine (ATX; 0.01-1.0 mg/kg) in adult female Chinese rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We also tested the effects of diminishing catecholamine neurotransmission on working memory and behavioural activation using an acute tyrosine phenylalanine depletion (ATPD) method, which we developed and demonstrated its effectiveness at impairing brain catecholamine synthesis and function. A visual sequential comparison (VSC) task, which allows the systematic manipulation of working memory load was used to assess working memory. Behavioural activation was assessed using several measures: the animals’ reaction time (speed), saccade peak velocity (vigour), successful trial completion (persistence), successful trial initiation (persistence), trial initiation time (speed), and anticipatory trial initiation (vigour) in the VSC task. A visual progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement task was also used to assess behavioural activation; the PR breakpoint reflects persistence. The results of the MPH, ATX and ATPD studies showed that catecholamines have little to no impact on working memory but a significant influence on behavioural activation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My dissertation research undertakes an in-depth analysis of queer (anti)-racism in Toronto’s rainbow community. My study is informed by ethnographic research methods, including semi-structured interviews with those who self-identify as part of the rainbow community, and my own observations at queer-focused events in Toronto such as the Greenspace Festival by the 519 and Pride Toronto’s annual parade. My analysis and findings are presented in three publishable articles. This portfolio-style dissertation manuscript also includes photographic images from my field work, and the script from my stage production We without You, an original theatre project that I created to reflect, analyse and disseminate my ethnographic research. In the first article I discuss how languages of capital accumulation, white (homo)nationalism and safety, are mobilized in order to produce race and racism in queer politics. Within contexts of intersectional tension I analyse how self-identified white participants conceptualize anti-racism allyship. In my second article I explore how conflict and confusion about appropriate allyship produced self-exclusion from anti-racism efforts. I found that allies experience tension as to their roles and potential responsibilities in relation to anti-racism, which often results in being uninformed about race-related issues and/or in their non-participation in anti-racism. With data and analysis from my first two articles I wrote and produced a stage production entitled We without You. The production is a knowledge mobilization project that addresses gaps in public knowledge and informs audiences about a range of experiences in the rainbow community shaped by intersections of race and queerness. My experiences writing and producing We without You and the role of performance as critical resistance against polarizing politics is the subject of my third article. I argue that performance as knowledge mobilization plays a crucial role in bridging academic work with public engagement by positioning sociological inquiry as an important contributor to public life. As a whole, this dissertation explores how race is produced in the rainbow community, examines the tensions involved with anti-racism allyship, and demonstrates the power of performance as critical resistance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed women’s cancer in Canada. Average patient survival rates are high, but they are significantly reduced for those patients whose cancer reaches stage IV – metastatic disease. This study investigated the roles of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in metastatic breast cancer. Genetic knockout of CAPN1, CAPN2, and CAPNS1 genes allowed us to analyze the functions of these two calpain isoforms in the MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer model cell line and to determine which isoform is responsible for the CAPNS1-knockdown related cancer cell phenotypes seen previously. We used the panel of knockout and rescue cell lines for in vitro studies and showed that both calpain isoforms play roles in protective effects against select chemotherapeutics, suggesting that calpain inhibition could enhance the efficacy of these commonly used breast cancer therapeutics. We also showed that genetic disruption of calpain-1 reduces the in vitro cell migration rate on collagen substrates. Our in vivo studies provide evidence that calpain-1 and calpain-2 have essential non-redundant roles in the metastatic process, suggesting that inhibition of either isoform could have therapeutic benefits by reducing the metastatic potential of breast cancer. I also discuss future studies aimed at identification and characterization of calpain-1 and calpain-2 specific physiological substrates with mechanistic relevance to the observed phenotypes and describe a biosensor to screen for allosteric inhibitors of calpain-1 and calpain-2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Most Canadian adults do not meet current behaviour recommendations for physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep. Historically, movement behaviours were presented in isolation from one another, using complex and overwhelming thresholds outlining durations and intensity for optimal health. Generic messages encouraging small, but meaningful, behaviour change may be a better approach than thresholds through improving adults’ confidence to engage in optimal movement patterns. New integrated Guidelines providing evidence-based recommendations for Canadian adults’ movement behaviours over a 24-hour day are forthcoming. Public facing messages complementing the scientific recommendations to promote engagement amongst adults are needed, and generic messages may be a gateway to encourage adults’ confidence to meet the Guidelines. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, this thesis aimed to determine and experimentally test a generic tagline for the Guidelines and build support for generic messaging among health behaviour interventions. Two studies were completed online. In Study 1, Guideline end-users and stakeholders (NPhase1=774; NPhase2= 996) ranked a series of taglines based on whether the messages fostered Guideline self-efficacy beliefs. In Study 2, adult Guideline end-users (N=249) completed pre-, post- and two-week quantitative surveys following exposure to generic or threshold Guideline promotional materials. In the first study, a chi-squared test of independence confirmed the generic tagline “Move More. Sit Less. Sleep Better.” was favoured as self-efficacy boosting, χ2(1) = 142.4, p &lt; .001. In the second study, hierarchal linear regressions predicting adults’ confidence to meet the Guidelines revealed an activity status by experimental condition interaction, F(4, 192) = 52.14, p &lt; .05, ßGeneralTask = -.18,  F(4, 192) = 43.06, ßScheduling = -.15, p &lt; .05.  Post hoc analyses indicated low active adults exposed to generic messages had greater confidence to meet the Guidelines compared to low active adults exposed to threshold messages. Additionally, message processing was greater among adults exposed to the generic materials than the threshold materials, F(3, 243) = 3.34,  p &lt; .05. The findings emphasize that generic messages may be advantageous for promoting adults’ confidence to meet movement guidelines. This work presents considerations for researchers and health promoters aiming to develop appropriate messages for health behaviour engagement among Canadian adults.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Canada is currently operationalizing reconciliation efforts that stress the establishment of respectful and just relationships between Indigenous peoples and provincial and federal governments. British Columbia (BC) is unique among Canadian provinces and territories, given its lack of historical treaty agreements with Canadian governments. In April 2011, Huu-ay-aht First Nations joined four other Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations to begin implementation of the Maa-nulth Final Agreement (also known as the Maa-nulth Treaty) with BC and Canada, one of only three modern treaties that had been negotiated in the province at that time. Through narrative analysis of a case study using photovoice and participant observation involving 33 participants, I explore the experiences and perceptions of Huu-ay-aht citizens regarding the early years of treaty implementation. Modern treaties are often theoretically criticized for being extensions of assimilative and colonial processes. However, empirical findings from this community-engaged study exemplify positive change, or the potential for change, and enhanced community autonomy, as seen and experienced through increases in control over Treaty Lands. Participants’ data show that this control is effectively counteracting some of the impacts of dependency and suffering created by decades of destructive and racist Canadian federal and provincial government policies, structures, and services. Structural, environmental and health concerns that remain as treaty implementation continues are also discussed. This case study contributes to a better understanding of the experiences and perceptions of Indigenous peoples implicated in modern treaty relationships, experiences and perceptions that (as yet) are not adequately represented in the literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accurate registration of medical images is crucial to the successful deployment of computer assisted interventions or surgical navigation systems.  Nonrigid registration techniques are important when considering soft tissues or other deformable anatomies, inter-individual registration, or the use of atlases or template objects; however, nonrigid transformations must be constrained in order to ensure that the resulting mappings are anatomically feasible.  Application-specific models of deformation---designed to capture statistical relationships, or functional constraints of the anatomy of interest---are one way of constraining nonrigid deformations while maintaining the generalizability of the model.  In most cases however, the use of these application-specific models is complicated by the need for customized registration algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work facilitates the use of application-specific models of deformation by proposing a general algorithm to allow sets of points or oriented points to be registered through arbitrarily composed sets of transformations.  Simple transformations can, in principle, be combined into more complex models specific to the anatomy under consideration.  The algorithm is designed to be modular: by leveraging the power of modern statistical framings of the point set registration problem, arbitrarily composed sets of transformations can be optimized, requiring only that each transformation has a known solution to a particular standard form of equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The basic approach is developed first in the context of an actual medical imaging problem: the registration of intraoperative cardiac ultrasound, and preoperative CT scans.  The ultrasound images are processed by registering a model through a hierarchical transformation using a novel generalized expectation-maximization approach.  This approach is extended to a general algorithm for the registration of point or oriented point sets through arbitrarily composed transformations, and a class of heuristic modifications are proposed and experimentally examined.  The algorithm is shown to produce promising results in both synthetic data experiments examining robustness to noise and outliers, and in an application to actual cardiac imaging data.  Ultimately, it is hoped that this work can aid researchers in constructing application-specific solutions to the problems they face and help improve registration accuracy in a variety of difficult medical imaging problems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Theoretical and empirical work suggest that reactivity to stress and responsivity to reward are correlated domains of functioning, and that dysfunction in the stress and reward systems may underlie Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The goals of the current study are to examine: (1) the longitudinal stability of cortisol reactivity to stress and behavioural reward responsivity; (2) longitudinal changes in cortisol reactivity to stress and behavioural reward responsivity; (3) moderating variables (depression symptoms, anhedonia symptoms, sex, childhood maltreatment, and life stress) in the stability and change of cortisol reactivity to stress and behavioural reward responsivity; and (4) the co-variation of cortisol reactivity to stress and behavioural reward responsivity over time. The current study includes 77 adults (52 with a lifetime history of MDD, 25 never-depressed) who were well-characterized in terms of their diagnostic and symptom profiles, and who participated in a laboratory stress challenge (the Trier Social Stress Task; TSST) and a computerized Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) at two time points approximately six months apart. My results indicated that there was general stability in both cortisol reactivity to stress and reward responsivity over time (i.e., Time 1 scores significantly predicted Time 2 scores); however, stability was also associated with moderating variables. There were also changes in both cortisol reactivity and reward responsivity over time (i.e., increases or decreases at a group level); however, these changes were related to moderating variables. Finally, my results suggested that cortisol reactivity to stress and behavioural reward responsivity co-varied over time. This is the first study to examine the longitudinal stability of both cortisol reactivity to a social evaluative stress task and behavioural reward responsivity. Further, this study is the first to examine how cortisol reactivity and reward responsivity co-varied across two time points. My findings provided an important foundation in identifying factors that may be relevant in altering the stability of cortisol reactivity and reward responsivity, and suggested that changes in anhedonia symptomatology and exposure to stressful life events may be particularly relevant to the stability of the stress and reward systems over time.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Built around a collection of four manuscripts, this dissertation focuses on the collective organizing strategies of non-standard workers. Multiple chapters focus on a case study of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a union without collective bargaining rights, and its effort to improve working conditions in the for-hire transportation industry and to redistribute economic resources to drivers. Drawing on mixed methods including participant action research, interviews, and surveys, the research took place amidst industry transformation brought on by the introduction of app-based dispatching services, such as Uber and Lyft. Several of the manuscripts examine the effects that app-based dispatching services have on work quality, the for-hire vehicle industry generally, and on for-hire drivers’ collective organizing strategies. Engaging with disciplines including labour geographies and industrial relations, this dissertation presents local regulatory infrastructures as an adequate venue for traditional taxicab and app-based drivers to address their collective interests and to achieve enforceable improvements in working conditions and wages.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancerous hematological disorder originating in B-lymphoid progenitor cells. In 5% of ALL cases, the oncogenic transcription factor E2A-PBX1 is expressed as a result of the chromosomal translocation 1;19. E2A-PBX1 contains the activation domains of E2A and most of the PBX1 protein, including the DNA-binding homeodomain. These structural features suggest a hypothetical oncogenic model in which E2A-PBX1 binds DNA, recruits transcriptional co-activators by means of the activation domains and induces ALL through deregulation of PBX1 target genes. This transcriptional control is, in part, mediated by the recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300. Indeed, previous studies have shown that E2A-PBX1-mediated oncogenesis requires direct binding of E2A-PBX1 to CBP/p300. However, the transcriptional targets of this complex remain unknown. Additionally, as t(1;19)-mediated ALL is derived from B-lymphoid progenitors, we propose that E2A-PBX1 may be localizing to B-lymphopoietic enhancers bound by the master B-lymphopoietic transcription factors EBF1 and wild-type E2A, perturbing enhancer function and contributing to the development of ALL. The purpose of this thesis was to: 1) identify genomic regions where E2A-PBX1 binds; 2) assess whether other transcription factors are associated with the E2A-PBX1:CBP/p300 complex and further elucidate the structural and biophysical characteristics of those interactions; and 3) develop and characterize an inhibitor to the E2A-PBX1:CBP/p300 complex as a potential therapeutic for ALL. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified over 3700 E2A-PBX1 binding sites in an ALL-derived cell line. We show that E2A-PBX1 recruits CBP/p300 to roughly 50% of its binding sites and localizes with CBP/p300 to consensus sequences bound by EBF1 and wild-type E2A. Using structural and biophysical methods, we characterize interactions between the TAZ2 domain of CBP/p300 and the activation domains of E2A-PBX1 or E2A and EBF1. The structural and ChIP-seq data suggest an additional E2A-PBX1 binding model in which E2A-PBX1 localizes to B-lymphopoietic enhancers by indirectly interacting with EBF1 and wild-type E2A with CBP/p300 as a mediator. Lastly, we developed a disruptor peptide that can bind the KIX domain of CBP/p300 with nanomolar affinity which disrupts E2A-PBX1:CBP/p300 complex formation in ALL cells and downregulates E2A-PBX1 target genes in vivo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is widely accepted in education that self-assessment improves students’ learning and achievement, particularly in regard to foreign language acquisition. English curriculum standards for senior high school in China has been addressing the importance of cultivating students’ self-assessment ability since 2001. Although there is a robust research literature about self-assessment in other countries, the role that self-assessment plays in students’ learning has not been sufficiently investigated in the context of English teaching and learning in China. &#xD;
    To address this research challenge, this thesis investigated the relationships among Chinese high school students’ self-assessment of English skills, English proficiency and their perceptions towards self-assessment. &#xD;
    A self-assessment questionnaire was utilized in this research. As the indicator of students’ English proficiency, their English examination score, including the scores of listening and speaking, reading and writing, was also collected. Participants included 302 students from one high school in Guangzhou, China. Statistical analyses included One-Sample t-test, Pearson correlation analyses, One-way ANOVA, and multiple regression analyses. &#xD;
    The results of the research revealed four overarching findings. First, students were able to self-assess their strengths and weaknesses in reading, writing, and listening and speaking skills, and they perceived that self-assessment was a useful tool to help improve their English. Second, there was a significant and positive correlation between students’ self-assessment of English skills and their English proficiency, which only existed in high-level students, not in students of intermediate or low level. Third, there was a significant and positive correlation between students’ self-assessment of English skills and their perceptions towards self-assessment, with the variables of appraisal function and habitual action having the significant and positive power in predicting students’ self-assessment of English skills. Finally, a significant and negative correlation was found between students’ English proficiency and their perceptions towards self-assessment with only the variable of appraisal function having the significant and positive power in predicting students’ English proficiency.&#xD;
    This study could add empirical evidence to deepen educators and school teachers’ understanding on Chinese high school students’ self-assessment of English skills and their perceptions towards self-assessment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work concerns the planimetric evolution of free meandering rivers, whose associated riverbank erosion and channel changes notoriously pose a hazard to infrastructure within their vicinity as well as affect the health of the river ecosystem. It aims to address two research needs, those being (1) the lack of easy access to an ample number of experimental (i.e. laboratory and/or field) cases for which the hydraulic and geomorphic characteristics of the streams are detailed together with an account of their channel displacements over time, and (2) the shortage of zero-th order approximation models available to simulate and predict channel planimetric evolution. Based on the results of a rigorous literature review and survey of historical imagery archives, the former is addressed through the compilation of a database which couples the planimetric evolution of a river meander loop with its stream characteristics. The specific methodology used to extract the planimetric geometry from imagery is detailed, and if not specified in literature, the stream hydraulic characteristics are estimated using well established methods. The resulting graphical database includes information on 29 sites from 25 different sand and gravel rivers. The need for zero-th order models is addressed by focusing on eliminating the present limitations of the phenomenological planimetric evolution model by da Silva and Yalin (2017). A MATLAB computer program is introduced, which for the first time enables the automated application of the just mentioned model. A yet unknown multiplier-function embedded in the model is revealed on the basis of the computer program and field cases from the present database. The multiplier function was found to be a function of the width-to-depth ratio, in addition to stream sinuosity. The present applications of the model show that it can predict the spatial growth of meander bends of relatively symmetrical channels over several years not exceeding the development of a channel cut-off.</dcterms:abstract>
