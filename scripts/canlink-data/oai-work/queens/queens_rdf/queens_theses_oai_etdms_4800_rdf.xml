      <dcterms:abstract>Model Driven Engineering uses the principle that code can automatically be generated from software models which would potentially save time and cost of development. By this methodology, a systems structure and behaviour can be expressed in more abstract, high level terms without some of the accidental complexity that the use of a general purpose language can bring. Models are the actual implementation of the system unlike in traditional software development where models are often used for documentation purposes only. However once the code is generated from the model, testing and debugging activities tend to happen on the code level and the model is not updated. We believe that monitoring on the model level could potentially facilitate quality assurance activities as the errors are detected in the early phase of development. In this thesis, we create a Monitoring Configuration for an open source model driven engineering tool called PapyrusRT in Eclipse. We support the run-time monitoring of UML-RT elements with a tracing tool called LTTng. We annotate the model with monitoring information to be used by the code generator for adding tracepoint statements for the corresponding elements. We provide the option of a timing specification to discover latency errors on the model. We validate the results by creating and tracing real time models in PapyrusRT.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Modern software applications are becoming more dependent on database management systems (DBMSs). DBMSs are usually used as black boxes by software developers. For example, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is one of the most popular database abstraction approaches that developers use nowadays. Using ORM, objects in Object-Oriented languages are mapped to records in the database, and object manipulations are automatically translated to SQL queries. As a result of such conceptual abstraction, developers do not need deep knowledge of databases; however, all too often this abstraction leads to inefficient and incorrect database access code. Thus, this thesis proposes a series of approaches to improve the performance of database-centric software applications that are implemented using ORM. Our approaches focus on troubleshooting and detecting inefficient (i.e., performance problems) database accesses in the source code, and we rank the detected problems based on their severity. We first conduct an empirical study on the maintenance of ORM code in both open source and industrial applications. We find that ORM performance-related configurations are rarely tuned in practice, and there is a need for tools that can help improve/tune the performance of ORM-based applications. Thus, we propose approaches along two dimensions to help developers improve the performance of ORM-based applications: 1) helping developers write more performant ORM code; and 2) helping developers configure ORM configurations.&#xD;
&#xD;
To provide tooling support to developers, we first propose static analysis approaches to detect performance anti-patterns in the source code. We automatically rank the detected anti-pattern instances according to their performance impacts. Our study finds that by resolving the detected anti-patterns, the application performance can be improved by 34% on average. We then discuss our experience and lessons learned when integrating our anti-pattern detection tool into industrial practice. We hope our experience can help improve the industrial adoption of future research tools. However, as static analysis approaches are prone to false positives and lack runtime information, we also propose dynamic analysis approaches to further help developers improve the performance of their database access code. We propose automated approaches to detect redundant data access anti-patterns in the database access code, and our study finds that resolving such redundant data access anti-patterns can improve application performance by an average of 17%. Finally, we propose an automated approach to tune performance-related ORM configurations using both static and dynamic analysis. Our study shows that our approach can help improve application throughput by 27--138%. &#xD;
&#xD;
Through our case studies on real-world applications, we show that all of our proposed approaches can provide valuable support to developers and help improve application performance significantly.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Greenhouses have become an invaluable source of year-round food production. Further development of viable and efficient high performance greenhouses is important for future food security. Closing the greenhouse envelope from the environment can provide benefits in space heating energy savings, pest control, and CO2 enrichment. This requires the application of a novel air conditioning system to handle the high cooling loads experienced by a greenhouse. Liquid desiccant air-conditioning (LDAC) have been found to provide high latent cooling capacities, which is perfect for the application of a humid greenhouse microclimate. TRNSYS simulations were undertaken to study the feasibility of two liquid desiccant dehumidification systems based on their capacity to control the greenhouse microclimate, and their cooling performance. The base model (B-LDAC) included a natural gas boiler, and two cooling systems for seasonal operation. The second model (HP-LDAC) was a hybrid liquid desiccant-heat pump dehumidification system. The average tCOPdehum and tCOPtotal of the B-LDAC system increased from 0.40 and 0.56 in January to 0.94 and 1.09 in June. Increased load and performance during a sample summer day improved these values to 3.5 and 3.0, respectively. The average eCOPdehum and eCOPtotal values were 1.0 and 1.8 in winter, and 1.7 and 2.1 in summer. The HP-LDAC system produced similar daily performance trends where the annual average eCOPdehum and eCOPtotal values were 1.3 and 1.2, but the sample day saw peaks of 2.4 and 3.2, respectively. The B-LDAC and HP-LDAC results predicted greenhouse temperatures exceeding 30Â°C for 34% and 17% of the month of July, respectively. Similarly, humidity levels increased in summer months, with a maximum of 14% of the time spent over 80% in May for both models. The percentage of annual savings in space heating energy associated with closing the greenhouse to ventilation was 34%. The additional annual regeneration energy input was reduced by 26% to 526 kWhm-2, with the implementation of a heat recovery ventilator on the regeneration exhaust air. The models also predicted an electrical energy input of 245 kWhm-2 and 305 kWhm-2 for the B-LDAC and HP-LDAC simulations, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) isozymes occur in vascular plants and green algae: plant-type PEPC (PTPC) and bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC). PTPC polypeptides typically form a tightly regulated cytosolic Class-1 PEPC homotetramer. BTPCs, however, appear to be less widely expressed and to exist only as catalytic and regulatory subunits that physically interact with co-expressed PTPC subunits to form hetero-octameric Class-2 PEPC complexes that are highly desensitized to Class-1 PEPC allosteric effectors. Yeast two-hybrid studies indicated that castor plant BTPC (RcPPC4) interacts with all three Arabidopsis thaliana PTPC isozymes, and that it forms stronger interactions with AtPPC2 and AtPPC3, suggesting that specific PTPCs are preferred for Class-2 PEPC formation. In contrast, Arabidopsis BTPC (AtPPC4) appeared to interact very weakly with AtPPC2 and AtPPC3, suggesting that BTPCs from different species may have different physical properties, hypothesized to be due to sequence dissimilarities within their ~10 kDa intrinsically disordered region. Recent RNA-seq and microarray data were analyzed to obtain a better understanding of BTPC expression patterns in different tissues of various monocot and dicot species. High levels of BTPC transcripts, polypeptides and Class-2 PEPC complexes were originally discovered in developing castor seeds, but the analysis revealed a broad range of diverse tissues where abundant BTPC transcripts are also expressed, such as the developing fruits of cucumber, grape, and tomato. Marked BTPC expression correlated well with the presence of ~116 kDa immunoreactive BTPC polypeptides, as well as Class-2 PEPC complexes in the immature fruit of cucumbers and tomatoes. It is therefore hypothesized that in vascular plants BTPC and thus Class-2 PEPC complexes maintain anaplerotic PEP flux in tissues with elevated malate levels that would potently inhibit âhousekeepingâ Class-1 PEPCs. Elevated levels of malate can be used by biosynthetically active sink tissues such as immature tomatoes and cucumbers for rapid cell expansion, drought or salt stressed roots for osmoregulation, and developing seeds and pollen as a precursor for storage lipid and protein biosynthesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Largely due to low availability and uptake of screening in low- and middle-income countries, cervical cancer is the second ranked cancer among women in these countries. This is a tragedy because cervical cancer is one of the most preventable carcinomas. This thesis will investigate behaviour change methods, which capitalize on the recent exponential increase in ownership of mobile phones in Tanzania, to increase uptake of cervical cancer screening (CCS) in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. &#xD;
Objectives: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of behaviour change messages delivered via short message service (SMS) on the uptake of CCS in the Kilimanjaro region; 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of a transportation eVoucher on the uptake of CCS in the Kilimanjaro region; 3) to explore characteristics associated with CCS uptake in the Kilimanjaro region; and 4) to determine the attitudes towards and perceived benefit of behaviour change SMS messages and eVouchers intended to increase uptake of CCS. &#xD;
Methods: In the Kilimanjaro Region, 853 women participated in a randomized controlled trial. Baseline data was collected through self-report through systematic stratified random sampling. Participants were randomized to one of three groups: a control group, a group receiving behaviour change messages delivered via SMS, or a group receiving a travel eVoucher and identical SMS as the SMS group. A fieldworker recorded participants attending screening at the CCS clinics and administered a post-screening survey. The follow-up period was two months from the time of the participantâs enrolment. Logistic regression (both for the combined and stratified data sets) was used to determine associations between the behaviour change interventions, baseline characteristics and cervical cancer screening uptake.  &#xD;
Results: All participants receiving SMS messages (SMS or eVoucher group) were more likely to attend cervical cancer screening in comparison with the control group. 83% of participants who attended screening shared the information contained in the messages with others. &#xD;
Conclusions: Behaviour change messages delivered via SMS and transportation eVouchers have the potential to increase uptake of cervical cancer screening in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. Harnessing this potential will require implementing these interventions alongside other methods to achieve maximum impact.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Schedule-Induced Polydipsia (SIP) is an animal model of adjunctive drinking induced when a hungry rat receives food on a fixed interval of time. This model has been implemented as a model of compulsive behaviour and may represent a powerful tool to understand the neural mechanisms of compulsion. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is thought to translate challenges to energy homeostasis into consummatory behaviours, and is therefore likely to contribute to drinking behaviours displayed by food restricted rats in the SIP paradigm. Furthermore, the BNST seems implicated in various compulsive behaviors, including compulsive water drinking in rats. Therefore, the goal of this project was to determine whether compulsive drinking in the SIP paradigm was associated with alterations in transmission at oval BNST (ovBNST) synapses. Rats undergoing the SIP procedure had restricted food access (1-hours/day) for a total of 29 days. After 7 days of food restriction and for the next 21 consecutive days, the rats had daily 2-hour access to operant conditioning chambers where they were presented with a 45-mg food pellet every minute. Water consumed during these 2-hour sessions was measured and the rats that drank 15 ml or more water for a minimum of 3 consecutive days were considered High Drinkers (HD; n=17) or otherwise, Low Drinkers (LD; n=13). Brain slices whole-cell patch clamp recordings conducted 18-hours after the last SIP training showed that chronic food restriction changed low frequency stimulation (LFS) - induced long-term potentiation of ovBNST inhibitory synaptic transmission (iLTP) into LFS - induced long-term depression (iLTD) in a majority of neurons, regardless of drinking behaviours. However, ad libitum access to food between the last day of SIP training and brain slice recordings (18-hour refeed) rescued LFS-induced iLTP in LD but not in HD, suggesting that impaired bi-directional plasticity of ovBNST synapses may contribute to compulsive drinking in the SIP paradigm.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bitumen extraction from surface-mined oil sands results in the production of large volumes of Fluid Fine Tailings (FFT). Through Directive 085, the Province of Alberta has signaled that oil sands operators must improve and accelerate the methods by which they deal with FFT production, storage and treatment.&#xD;
This thesis aims to develop an enhanced method to forecast FFT production based on specific ore characteristics. A mass relationship and mathematical model to modify the Forecasting Tailings Model (FTM) by using fines and clay boundaries, as the two main indicators in FFT accumulation, has been developed. The modified FTM has been applied on representative block model data from an operating oil sands mining venture. An attempt has been made to identify order-of-magnitude associated tailings treatment costs, and to improve financial performance by not processing materials that have ultimate ore processing and tailings storage and treatment costs in excess of the value of bitumen they produce.&#xD;
The results on the real case study show that there is a 53% reduction in total tailings accumulations over the mine life by selectively processing only lower tailings generating materials through eliminating 15% of total mined ore materials with higher potential of fluid fines inventory.&#xD;
This significant result will assess the impact of Directive 082 on mining project economic and environmental performance towards the sustainable development of mining projects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study used a mixed methods approach to develop a broad and deep understanding of&#xD;
studentsâ perceptions towards creativity in engineering education. Studies have shown that&#xD;
studentsâ attitudes can have an impact on their motivation to engage in creative behavior. Using&#xD;
an ex-post facto independent factorial design, attitudes of value towards creativity, time for&#xD;
creativity, and creativity stereotypes were measured and compared across gender, year of study,&#xD;
engineering discipline, preference for open-ended problem solving, and confidence in creative&#xD;
abilities. Participants were undergraduate engineering students at Queenâs University from all&#xD;
years of study. A qualitative phenomenological methodology was adopted to study studentsâ&#xD;
understandings and experiences with engineering creativity. Eleven students participated in oneon-&#xD;
one interviews that provided depth and insight into how students experience and define&#xD;
engineering creativity, and the survey included open-ended items developed using the 10 Maxims&#xD;
of Creativity in Education as a guiding framework.&#xD;
The findings from the survey suggested that students had high value for creativity, however&#xD;
students in fourth year or higher had less value than those in other years. Those with preference&#xD;
for open-ended problem solving and high confidence valued creative more than their&#xD;
counterparts. Students who preferred open-ended problem solving and students with high&#xD;
confidence reported that time was less of a hindrance to their creativity. Males identified more&#xD;
with creativity stereotypes than females, however overall they were both low. Open-ended survey&#xD;
and interview results indicated that students felt they experienced creativity in engineering design&#xD;
activities. Engineering creativity definitions had two elements: creative action and creative&#xD;
characteristic. Creative actions were associated with designing, and creative characteristics were&#xD;
predominantly associated with novelty. Other barriers that emerged from the qualitative analysis&#xD;
were lack of opportunity, lack of assessment, and discomfort with creativity.&#xD;
It was concluded that a universal definition is required to establish clear and aligned&#xD;
understandings of engineering creativity. Instructors may want to consider demonstrating value&#xD;
by assessing creativity and establishing clear criteria in design projects. It is recommended that&#xD;
students be given more opportunities for practice through design activities and that they be&#xD;
introduced to design and creative thinking concepts early in their engineering education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multi-frequency Eddy Current (EC) inspection with a transmit-receive probe (two horizontally offset coils) is used to monitor the Pressure Tube (PT) to Calandria Tube (CT) gap of CANDUÂ® fuel channels. Accurate gap measurements are crucial to ensure fitness &#xD;
of service; however, variations in probe liftoff, PT electrical resistivity, and PT wall thickness can generate systematic measurement errors. Validated mathematical models of the EC probe are very useful for data interpretation, and may improve the gap measurement under inspection conditions where these parameters vary. As a first step, exact solutions for the electromagnetic response of a transmit-receive coil pair situated above two parallel plates separated by an air gap were developed. This model was validated against experimental data with flat-plate samples. Finite element method models revealed that this geometrical approximation could not accurately match experimental data with real tubes, &#xD;
so analytical solutions for the probe in a double-walled pipe (the CANDUÂ® fuel channel geometry) were generated using the Second-Order Vector Potential (SOVP) formalism. All electromagnetic coupling coefficients arising from the probe, and the layered conductors were determined and substituted into Kirchhoffâs circuit equations for the calculation of the pickup coil signal. The flat-plate model was used as a basis for an Inverse &#xD;
Algorithm (IA) to simultaneously extract the relevant experimental parameters from EC data. The IA was validated over a large range of second layer plate resistivities (1.7 to 174 Âµâ¦âcm), plate wall thickness (~1 to 4.9 mm), probe liftoff (~2 mm to 8 mm), and plate-to plate gap (~0 mm to 13 mm). The IA achieved a relative error of less than 6% for the extracted FP resistivity and an accuracy of Â±0.1 mm for the LO measurement. The IA was able to achieve a plate gap measurement with an accuracy of less than Â±0.7 mm error over &#xD;
a ~2.4 mm to 7.5 mm probe liftoff and Â±0.3 mm at nominal liftoff (2.42Â±0.05 mm), providing confidence in the general validity of the algorithm. This demonstrates the potential of using an analytical model to extract variable parameters that may affect the gap measurement accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Loss of limb results in loss of function and a partial loss of freedom. A powered prosthetic device can partially assist an individual with everyday tasks and therefore return some level of independence. Powered upper limb prostheses are often controlled by the user generating surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals. The goal of this thesis is to develop a virtual environment in which a user can control a virtual hand to safely grasp representations of everyday objects using EMG signals from his/her forearm muscles, and experience visual and vibrotactile feedback relevant to the grasping force in the process. This can then be used to train potential wearers of real EMG controlled prostheses, with or without vibrotactile feedback. To test this system an experiment was designed and executed involving ten subjects, twelve objects, and three feedback conditions. The tested feedback conditions were visual, vibrotactile, and both visual and vibrotactile. In each experimental exercise the subject attempted to grasp a virtual object on the screen using the virtual hand controlled by EMG electrodes placed on his/her forearm. Two metrics were used: score, and time to task completion, where score measured grasp dexterity. It was hypothesized that with the introduction of vibrotactile feedback, dexterity, and therefore score, would improve and time to task completion would decrease. Results showed that time to task completion increased, and score did not improve with vibrotactile feedback. Details on the developed system, the experiment, and the results are presented in this thesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examines how one secondary school teacherâs use of purposeful oral mathematics language impacted her studentsâ language use and overall communication in written solutions while working with word problems in a grade nine academic mathematics class.  Mathematics is often described as a distinct language.  As with all languages, students must develop a sense for oral language before developing social practices such as listening, respecting others ideas, and writing. Effective writing is often seen by students that have strong oral language skills.   &#xD;
Classroom observations, teacher and student interviews, and collected student work served as evidence to demonstrate the nature of both the teacherâs and the studentsâ use of oral mathematical language in the classroom, as well as the effect the discourse and language use had on studentsâ individual written solutions while working on word problems.  Inductive coding for themes revealed that the teacherâs purposeful use of oral mathematical language had a positive impact on studentsâ written solutions.  The teacherâs development of a mathematical discourse community created a space for the students to explore mathematical language and concepts that facilitated a deeper level of conceptual understanding of the learned material.  The teacherâs oral language appeared to transfer into students written work albeit not with the same complexity of use of the teacherâs oral expression of the mathematical register. Students that learn mathematical language and concepts better appear to have a growth mindset, feel they have ownership over their learning, use reorganizational strategies, and help develop a discourse community.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis engages black critical thought on the human and its contemporary iterations in posthumanism and transhumanism. It articulates five categories of analysis: displace, interrupt, disrupt, expand, and wither. Each is meant to allude to the generative potential in different iterations of black thought that engages the human. Working through Sylvia Wynterâs theories of the rise of Man-as-human in particular, the project highlights how black thought on the human displaces the uncritical whiteness of posthumanist thought. It argues that Afrofuturism has the potential to interrupt the linear progression from human to posthuman and that Octavia Butlerâs Fledgling proffers a narrative of race as a technology that disrupts the presumed post-raciality of posthumanism and transhumanism. It then contends that Katherine McKittrickâs rearticulation of the Promise of Science can be extended to incorporate the promise of science fiction. In so doing, it avers that a more curated conversation between McKittrick and Wynter, one already ongoing, and Octavia Butler, through Mind of My Mind from her Patternist series, expands our notions of the human as a category even at the risk of seeing it wither as a politic or praxis. It ends on a speculative note meant to imagine the possibilities within the promise of science fiction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Breast and ovarian cancers are among the leading causes of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. In a subset of these cancers, dysregulation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) leads to overexpression of the receptor on the cell surface. Previous studies have found that these HER2+ cancers show high rates of progression to metastatic disease. Metastasis is driven by cytoskeletal rearrangements that produce filamentous actin (F-actin) based structures that penetrate and degrade extracellular matrix to facilitate tumour invasion. Advancements in targeted therapy have made F-actin an attractive target for the development of new cancer therapies. In this thesis, we tested the actin-depolymerizing macrolide toxin, Mycalolide B (MycB), as a potential warhead for a novel antibody drug conjugate (ADC) to target highly metastatic HER2+ breast and ovarian cancers. We found that MycB treatment of HER2+ breast (SKBR3, MDA-MB-453) and ovarian (SKOV3) cancer cells led to loss of viability (IC50 values â¤ 64 nM). Sub-lethal doses of MycB treatment caused potent suppression of leading edge protrusions, migration and invasion potential of HER2+ cancer cells (IC50 â¤ 32 nM). In contrast, other F-actin based processes such as receptor endocytosis were less sensitive to MycB treatment. MycB treatment skewed the size of endocytic vesicles, which may reflect defects in F-actin based vesicle motility or maturation. Given that HER2+ cancers have been effectively targeted by Trastuzumab and Trastuzumab-based ADCs, we tested the effects of a combination of Trastuzumab and MycB on cell migration and invasion. We found that MycB/ Trastuzumab combination treatments inhibited motility of SKOV3 cells to a greater degree than either treatment alone. Altogether, our results provide proof-of-principle that actin toxins such as MycB can be used as a novel class of warheads for ADCs to target and combat highly metastatic cancers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The endothelium is the inner most layer of cells that lines all arteries. A primary function of endothelial cells is to regulate responses to increased blood flow and the resulting frictional forces or shear stress by producing factors such as nitric oxide that mediate arterial dilation (flow mediated dilation (FMD)).  Menstrual cycle variations in estrogen (E2) have been shown to influence brachial artery (BA) FMD in response to transient increases in shear stress brought about by the release of a brief forearm occlusion (reactive hyperemia (RH)).  FMD can also be assessed in response to a sustained shear stress stimulus such as that created with handgrip exercise (HGEX), and studies have shown that RH- and HGEX stimulated FMD provide unique information regarding endothelial function. However, the impact of menstrual phase on HGEX-FMD is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of cyclical changes in E2 levels on HGEX-FMD over two discrete phases of the menstrual cycle. FMD was assessed via ultrasound.  12 subjects (21 Â± 2yrs) completed two experimental visits: (1) low estrogen phase (early follicular) and (2) High estrogen phase (late follicular). In each visit both RH- and HGEX-FMD (6 min handgrip exercise) were assessed. Results are mean Â± SD.  E2 increased from the low to the high estrogen phase of the menstrual cycle (low: 34 Â± 8, high: 161 Â± 113pg/mL, p = 0.004).  There was no change in mean FMD between phases (RH-FMD: 7.7 Â± 4.3% vs. 6.4 Â± 3.1%, p = 0.139; HGEX-FMD: 4.8 Â± 2.8% vs. 4.8 Â± 2.3%, p = 0.979). The observation that both RH- and HGEX-FMD did not differ between phases indicates that menstrual cycle fluctuations in estrogen may not universally impact endothelial function in young, healthy premenopausal women. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie variability in the impact of menstrual phase on both transient and sustained FMD responses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The pharmaceutical industry wields disproportionate power and control within the medical economy of knowledge where the desire for profit considerably outweighs health for its own sake. Utilizing the theoretical tools of political philosophy, this project restructures the economy of medical knowledge in order to lessen the oligarchical control possessed by the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, this project argues that an economy of medical knowledge structured around communitarian political theory lessens the current power dynamic without taking an anti-capitalist stance. Arising from the core commitments of communitarian-liberalism, the production, distribution, and consumption of medical knowledge all become guided processes seeking to realize the common good of quality healthcare. This project also considers two other theoretical approaches: liberalism and egalitarianism. A Medical knowledge economy structured around liberal political theory is ultimately rejected as it empowers the oligarchical status quo. Egalitarian political theory is able to significantly reduce the power imbalance problem but simultaneously renders inconsequential medical knowledge; therefore, it is also rejected.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>New immigrants to Canada are generally in similar or better physical and mental health than people born in Canada, however, many studies suggest that their health tends to decline quickly after immigration. Lower physical activity levels among new immigrants might be contributing to this phenomenon.  There is a paucity of information regarding the physical activity behaviour of the Canadian immigrant population in general and of West Asian women, such as Iranians (Persians), in particular. Given that this group is characterised by an increasing population growth and lower rates of physical activity, it is critical to understand how best to address physical activity promotion in this population. Purpose: To understand the physical activity experiences of Persian women recently immigrated to Toronto, Canada in order to develop recommendations for the design and implementation of tailored physical activity programs.  Methods: A qualitative interpretive description approach was chosen to collect and describe ideas, experiences, and perceptions of physical activity within 10 new immigrant women. Using an inductive approach, two fundamental techniques of immersion and crystallization were used throughout the analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted by performing a sequential process of open and axial coding. Emerged themes were further conceptualized through a socio-ecological lens. Results: The facilitators and barriers to physical activity among the women were situated within five overarching categories, 1) Perceptions about physical activity, 2) New physical environment and social structure, 3) Cultural heritage values, 4) Settlement and immigration factors, and 5) Physical activity program features. Discussion: Findings revealed that Persian new immigrant womenâs engagement in physical activity after immigration is influenced by factors across the individual, sociocultural, environmental, institutional, and policy levels. Newcomer womenâs physical activity was influenced by their transition from their society of origin to the host society and the challenges and successes experienced throughout the settlement and acculturation process. The most noticeable barrier to physical activity in Canada for the women emerged as the lack of communication of physical activity information to newcomers. A set of recommendations is provided for developing efficient physical activity programs for Persian immigrant women, which may also be relevant for other immigrant groups in Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To reach for a target, we must formulate a movement plan - a difference vector of the target position with respect to the starting hand position. While it is known that the medial part of the intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) and the dorsal premotor (PMd) activity reflects aspects of a kinematic plan for a reaching movement, it is unclear whether or how the two regions may differ.&#xD;
We investigated the functional roles of the mIPS and PMd in the planning of reaching movements using high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and examined changes in horizontal endpoint error when participants were subjected to anodal and cathodal stimulation. The left mIPS and PMd were functionally localized with fMRI in each participant using an interleaved center-out pointing and saccade task and mapped onto the scalp using Brainsight. We adopted a randomized, single-blind design and applied anodal and cathodal stimulation (2mA for 20 min; 3cm radius 4x1 electrode placement) during 4 separate visits scheduled at least a week apart. Each participant performed 250 baseline, stimulation, and post-stimulation memory-guided reaches starting from one of two initial hand positions (IHPs) to one of 4 briefly flashed targets (20 cm distant, 5 cm apart horizontally) while fixating on a straight-ahead cross located at the target line. &#xD;
Separate 2-way repeated measures ANOVAs of horizontal endpoint error difference after cathodal tDCS at each stimulation site revealed a significant IHP by target position interaction effect at the left mIPS, and significant IHP and target main effects at the left PMd. Behaviorally, these effects corresponded to IHP-dependent contractions after cathodal mIPS tDCS and IHP-independent contractions after cathodal PMd tDCS.&#xD;
These results suggest that the movement vector is not yet formed at the input level of mIPS, but is encoded at the input of PMd. These results also indicate that tDCS is a viable, useful method in investigating movement planning properties through temporary perturbations of the system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the various ways in which Canadian historical researchers confronted the âCanada question,â namely the challenge of defining the basis of a unified national community. In doing so, it follows the scholarship and activities of a network of historians and intellectuals centred on the Canadian Historical Review, a quarterly publication founded in 1920. This study examines their scholarship with the aim of identifying not only the various solutions they posed to the problem, but also the philosophical undercurrents that informed their reasoning in the process. It also traces the rise of a rival network in the Revue dâhistoire de lâAmÃ©rique franÃ§aise, a French-language historical publication founded in 1947 that by its very existence posed a significant challenge to the definition of the nation at the core of the Canadian Historical Review. This dissertation argues that the network bound together by the Review was engaged in a hegemonic project, one that sought to present a particular definition of Canada through a historical narrative that rested upon a liberal logic. Yet the greatest sustained challenge they faced in this endeavour emerged from Francophone historical scholars, who, although proposing vastly different Canadas to those imagined at the Canadian Historical Review, came under the sway of a number of liberal currents of thought as well. A detailed summary of the key traits of these liberal Canadas is found in the conclusion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication that is new-onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. However, subclinical renal dysfunction may be apparent earlier in gestation prior to the clinical presentation of PE. Although the maternal syndrome of PE resolves early postpartum, women with a history of PE are at higher risk of renal dysfunction later in life. Mineral metabolism, such as phosphate balance is heavily dependent on renal function, yet, phosphate handling in women with a history of PE is largely unknown.&#xD;
To investigate whether women with a history of PE would exhibit changes in phosphate metabolism compared to healthy parous women, phosphate loading test was used. Women with or without a history of PE, who were 6 months to 5 years postpartum, were recruited for this study. Blood and urine samples were collected before and after the oral dosing of 500mg phosphate solution. Biochemical markers of phosphate metabolism and renal function were evaluated. In order to assess the difference in renal function alteration between first trimester women who were or were not destined to develop PE, plasma cystatin C concentration was analysed.  &#xD;
After phosphate loading, women with a history of PE had significantly elevated serum phosphate at both 1- and 2-hour, while controls had higher urine phosphate:urine creatinine excretion ratio at 1-hour than women with a history of PE. Women with a history of PE had no changes in intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentration throughout the study period, whereas controls had elevated iPTH at 1-hour from baseline. In terms of renal function in the first trimester, there was no difference in plasma cystatin C concentration between women who were or were not destined to develop PE.&#xD;
The elevation of serum phosphate in women with a history of PE could be due to the delay in phosphate excretion. Prolong elevation of serum phosphate can have serious consequences later in life. Thus, oral phosphate challenge may serve as a useful method of early screening for altered phosphate metabolism and renal function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The strained relationship between pedagogy and self-cultivation is often overlooked in favour of more pressing and profitable concerns within educational institutions. However, the end of education is not a well-paying job. It is often thought that education will produce a certain type of learned individual. Students are entered into educational institutions from a very young age and spend most of their youth within them, subsequently forming a part of themselves, their self-identify and agency, through these institutions. A significant amount of trust is placed in the hands of educators not only to impart information about various subject matters but to teach students how to think. This, however, is a difficult task which cannot be completely accomplished; thinking is a skill which an educator can promote but only the individual can cultivate. If self-cultivation is not the end of pedagogical practice and education, there is something deeply contradictory between the theoretical and practical values and aims of educational institutions.This thesis will address the problems caused by the neglect of self-cultivation within the pedagogical practices of contemporary educational institutions. I argue that self-cultivation, existential learning and flourishing should be the focus of these institutions. Educational institutions can make alternative efforts not only to improve the learning environment for these students but to prepare them to cope with existential questions. By acknowledging and focusing on the significance of self-cultivation, educational institutions can and should make efforts not only to teach useful, marketable skills and information but to also nurture the agency and mental well-being of the student him- or herself. My hope is that this thesis will be the first step towards answering a larger concern: How can educational institutions alleviate the struggles of students, particularly the seemingly growing number who are suffering from depression, by appealing to notions of self-cultivation?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Indigenous ways of knowing are dependent on an inheriting process both amongst humans and between human and non-human being.  These multi-relationships cross material and immaterial borders as sites of knowledge production. This manuscript will interrogate how three particular Indigenous cosmological relationships have been purposefully re-meaninged by colonial institutions: 1) How Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee origin stories have been abstracted into a distinctive epistemological versus ontological site; 2) How Anishnaabe spirit worlds are impacted by colonial relations, and how state institutions benefit from the re-meaning of these worlds; and 3) How Indigenous sovereignty in Canada is imagined from a statist perspective, and how these polices have re-meaninged the sacred relationships within a cosmological understanding of Haudenosaunee governance. The re-meaning of sacredly-held Indigenous relationships is both accelerated by, and contributes to, a practice of reducing upon Indigenous and non-human societies.  Throughout expressions of colonialism on Indigenous territories (the academy, the state, Indian policy), Indigenous knowledge is consistently either dismissed or appropriated. This reduction of Indigenous knowledge continues to bolster functions of the state as related to the elimination of the âIndian Problemâ via reducing the âIndianâ to an adaptive subject.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the rise and decline of the New Left in Toronto from 1958 to 1985. It argues that New Leftism â whose three leading ideals were self-management, national liberation, and community â arose as much from the Old Left as it did from the peace movement. In contrast to earlier readings that interpret the New Left narrowly â essentially, as the combined forces of the white student and peace movements evident mainly on university campuses â this thesis documents the extent to which New Leftism, interpreted as a political formation, provided a framework for a diversity of radical social movements, especially feminism, Black Power, gay liberation, resistance to the capitalist redevelopment of the city, and transnational solidarity. It also questions a declensionist narrative that adopts a âdecadalâ approach to the radicalism of the sixties, according to which 1970 spelled the end of â60sâ radicalism. Quite the contrary, this thesis argues: in Toronto, it would be truer to say that 1970s were âthe sixties,â in that only in this later decade did many New Left movements attain their full maturity. New Leftists successfully challenged a host of institutions, sometimes with permanent effects. The educational system was transformed. Cultural institutions and practices were revolutionized. Questions of race and gender, once peripheral to the left, were made central to it. Democratic community institutions became far more powerful. A token of the strength and durability of the New Left in Toronto was the extent to which it remained the bÃªte noir of a series of other radical groups upholding the model of the vanguard communist party â which challenged the New Leftistsâ prominence but many members of which often wound up agreeing with their positions. It was only in the early 1980s, with the ascent of a new right, that Torontoâs New Left unmistakably entered a period of decline. Yet, even then, many of its key themes were picked up by fast-growing anarchist and socialist feminist currents. Far from constituting a minor phenomenon, Torontoâs New Left, one of the largest movements for social justice in Canadian history, bequeathed to its progressive successors an imposing legacy of struggle and cultural achievements. It is the purpose of this thesis to evaluate, both critically and sympathetically, the extent to which the New Left attained its radical ambition.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
This thesis examines one of the most sensitive challenges facing contemporary democracies: the accommodation of Muslim minorities in public institutions and services. It focuses on the field of education, and on two particular issues: the public funding of Islamic schools and the accommodation of Muslim needs in public secular schools. The analysis is based on an examination of outcomes in four jurisdictions that differ significantly in the level of accommodation that has emerged: England, Scotland, Ontario, and Quebec. I seek to explain why such variation in outcomes exists among these four cases. I draw on four bodies of literature to underpin the theoretical framework: historical institutionalism, political mobilization by civil society, political parties, and ideationalism. My argument can be summarized simply; historic church-state settlements, unique in each case, are the most important factor explaining the variation in outcomes in England, Scotland, Ontario, and Quebec. In some cases, the historic church-state template is incrementally adapted to accommodate Muslim minorities. In other cases, relatively little accommodation occurs and the path-dependent trajectory of church-state relations remains entrenched. While the historic church-state template is a necessary factor in the explanation, it does not fully account for the variation. For a more complete picture, I demonstrate that there are several additional key factors that also shape the outcomes: first, national identity and public attitudes towards immigration and immigrants; second, the extent of mobilization by political agents, such as civil society organizations and historic churches; and third, the response of political parties to demands by Muslims for institutional accommodation. Ultimately, I conclude that Muslims in these jurisdictions are receiving some accommodation, but the process is slow and partial. &#xD;
This thesis makes important theoretical and empirical contributions to the discussion of Muslim integration in liberal democratic states. First, a framework has yet to be developed that considers the theoretical implications of institutional accommodation of Muslims; I address this gap. Second, this research demonstrates the utility of historical institutionalism in explaining the adaptation of church-state templates to accommodate Muslimsâ demands. Last, this study makes an original contribution by comparing the cases of England, Scotland, Ontario, and Quebec in the accommodation of Muslims in education. A comparison of Canada with the United Kingdom has not yet been done. &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the origins of filial responsibility laws in Canada and the United States, laws which prescribe that adult children have an obligation of support which is owed to their parents. Filial responsibility laws enable an indigent parent, or an institution providing medical treatment and care to an indigent parent, to seek financial support from that parentâs adult children through the use of litigation. While those who favour these rarely-used laws claim that they bring many benefits to both the family and the state, there is little evidence to suggest that such benefits are actualized. The development and use of the laws in Canada and the United States make it clear that the limitation of the expenditure of government funds was the primary motive for these laws and the support of families a distant secondary motive.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although persuasion often occurs via oral communication, it remains a comparatively understudied area. This research tested the hypothesis that changes in three properties of voice influence perceptions of speaker confidence, which in turn differentially affects attitudes according to different underlying psychological processes that the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM, Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1984), suggests should emerge under different levels of thought. Experiment 1 was a 2 (Elaboration: high vs. low) x 2 (Vocal speed: increased speed vs. decreased speed) x 2 (Vocal intonation: falling intonation vs. rising intonation) between participants factorial design. Vocal speed and vocal intonation influenced perceptions of speaker confidence as predicted. In line with the ELM, under high elaboration, confidence biased thought favorability, which in turn influenced attitudes. Under low elaboration, confidence did not bias thoughts but rather directly influenced attitudes as a peripheral cue. Experiment 2 used a similar design as Experiment 1 but focused on vocal pitch. Results confirmed pitch influenced perceptions of confidence as predicted. Importantly, we also replicated the bias and cue processes found in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 investigated the process by which a broader spectrum of speech rate influenced persuasion under moderate elaboration. In a 2 (Argument quality: strong vs. weak) x 4 (Vocal speed: extremely slow vs. moderately slow vs. moderately fast vs. extremely fast) between participants factorial design, results confirmed the hypothesized non-linear relationship between speech rate and perceptions of confidence. In line with the ELM, speech rate influenced persuasion based on the amount of processing. Experiment 4 investigated the effects of a broader spectrum of vocal intonation on persuasion under moderate elaboration and used a similar design as Experiment 3. Results indicated a partial success of our vocal intonation manipulation. No evidence was found to support the hypothesized mechanism. These studies show that changes in several different properties of voice can influence the extent to which others perceive them as confident. Importantly, evidence suggests different vocal properties influence persuasion by the same bias and cue processes under high and low thought. Evidence also suggests that under moderate thought, speech rate influences persuasion based on the amount of processing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I distinguish two ways that philosophers have approached and explained the reality and status of human social institutions. I call these approaches ânaturalistâ and âpost-naturalistâ. Common to both approaches is an understanding that the status of mind and its relation to the world or ânatureâ has implications on a conception of the status of institutional reality. Naturalists hold that mind is explicable within a scientific frame that conceives of mind as a fundamentally material process. By proxy, social reality is also materially explicable. Post-naturalists critique this view, holding instead that naturalism is parasitic on contemporary scienceâit therefore is non-compulsory and distorts how we ought to understand mind and social reality. A comparison of naturalism and post-naturalism will comprise the content of the first chapter. The second chapter turns to tracing out the dimensions of a post-naturalist narrative of mind and social reality. Post-naturalists conceive of mind and its activity of thought as sui generis, and it transpires from this that social institutions are better understood as a rational mindâs mode of the expression in the world. Post-naturalism conceives of social reality as a necessary dimension of thought. Thought requires a second person and thereby a tradition or context of norms that come to both structure its expression and become the products of expression. This is in contrast to the idea that social reality is a production of minds, and thereby derivative. Social reality, self-conscious thought, and thought of the second person are therefore three dimensions of a greater unity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis describes the preparation of polymersomes from poly(ethylene glycol)-block-polycarbonate (PEG-PC) copolymers functionalized with pendant coumarin groups. Coumarin groups undergo photo-reversible dimerization when irradiated with specific ultraviolet wavelengths, so they can be used to prepare polymers with photo-responsive properties. In this case, the pendant coumarin groups enable stabilization of the polymersome membrane through photo-crosslinking of the hydrophobic block.&#xD;
Initially, several novel cinnamoyl and coumarin functionalized cyclic carbonate monomers were synthesized using ester, ether, or amide linkages. While the homopolymerization of these functionalized monomers proved challenging due to their high melting points, both cinnamoyl and coumarin functionalized monomers were successfully copolymerized with trimethylene carbonate (TMC) at 100 â using a catalyst-free melt polymerization process where the TMC doubled as a solvent for the higher melting point monomer. Using this system, polycarbonate copolymers with up to 33% incorporation of the functionalized monomers were prepared. In addition, an investigation of some anomalous polymerization results identified previously unreported triethylamine-based catalysts for the melt polymerization of carbonate monomers. These studies also demonstrated that the catalyst-free polymerization of TMC occurs faster and at lower temperatures than previously reported.&#xD;
Subsequently, the photo-crosslinking of cinnamoyl and coumarin functionalized polycarbonates was compared and coumarin was identified as the more effective crosslinking agent when using 300-400 nm UV. An investigation of the photo-reversibility of the coumarin dimerization revealed no discernible change in the properties of crosslinked networks, but rapid photo-reversion in dilute solutions. The photo-crosslinking and photo-reversion kinetics of the coumarin functionalized polycarbonates were determined to be second-order in both cases.&#xD;
Finally, the self-assembly of PEG-PC diblock copolymers functionalized with coumarin was examined and both reverse solvent evaporation and solvent displacement were found to induce self-assembly, with hydrophilic mass fractions (f-factors) of 12-28% resulting in the formation of solid microparticles and nanoparticles and f-factors of 33-43% resulting in the formation of polymersomes. The stabilization of these polymersome membranes through photo-initiator-free photo-crosslinking was demonstrated with the crosslinking allowing polymersomes to withstand centrifugation at 12,000 x g. In addition, the encapsulation of calcein, as a model small molecule drug, in the stabilized polymersomes was successfully demonstrated using confocal microscopy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Electron beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) methods were developed in house to fabricate nanocrystalline nickel micro/nanopillars so to compare the effect of fabrication on plastic yielding. EBL was used to fabricate 3 Î¼m and 5 Î¼m thick poly-methyl methacrylate patterned substrates in which nickel pillars were grown by electroplating with height to diameter aspect ratios from 2:1 to 5:1. FIB milling was used to reduce larger grown pillars to sizes similar to EBL grown pillars. X-ray diffraction, electron back-scatter diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and FIB imaging were used to characterize the nickel pillars. The measured grain size of the pillars was 91Â±23 nm, with strong &lt;110&gt; and weaker &lt;111&gt; and &lt;110&gt; crystallographic texture in the growth. Load-controlled compression tests were conducted using a MicroMaterials nano-indenter equipped with a 10 Î¼m flat punch at constant rates from 0.0015 to 0.03 mN/s on EBL grown pillars, and 0.0015 and 0.015 mN/s on FIB-milled pillars. The measured Youngâs modulus ranged from 55 to 350 GPa for all pillars, agreeing with values in the literature. EBL grown pillars exhibited stochastic strain-bursts at slow loading rates, attributed to local micro yield events, followed by work hardening. Sharp yield points were also observed and attributed to the gold seed layer de-bonding between the nickel pillar and substrate due to the shear stress associated with end effects that arise from the substrate constraint. The onset of yield ranged from 108 to 1800 MPa, which is greater than bulk nickel, but within values given in the literature. FIB-milled pillars demonstrated stochastic yield behaviour at all loading rates tested, yielding between 320 and 625 MPa. Deformation was apparent at FIB-milled pillar tops, where the smallest cross-sectional area was measured, but still exhibited superior yield strength to bulk nickel. The gallium damage at the outer surface of the pillars likely aids in dislocation nucleation and plasticity, leading to lower yield strengths than for the EBL pillars. Thermal drift, substrate effects, and noise due to vibrations within the indenter system contributed to variance and inconsistency in the data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An investigation into karst hazard in southern Ontario has been undertaken with the intention of leading to the development of predictive karst models for this region. The reason these are not currently feasible is a lack of sufficient karst data, though this is not entirely due to the lack of karst features. Geophysical data was collected at Lake on the Mountain, Ontario as part of this karst investigation. This data was collected in order to validate the long-standing hypothesis that Lake on the Mountain was formed from a sinkhole collapse. Sub-bottom acoustic profiling data was collected in order to image the lake bottom sediments and bedrock. Vertical bedrock features interpreted as solutionally enlarged fractures were taken as evidence for karst processes on the lake bottom. Additionally, the bedrock topography shows a narrower and more elongated basin than was previously identified, and this also lies parallel to a mapped fault system in the area. This suggests that Lake on the Mountain was formed over a fault zone which also supports the sinkhole hypothesis as it would provide groundwater pathways for karst dissolution to occur. Previous sediment cores suggest that Lake on the Mountain would have formed at some point during the Wisconsinan glaciation with glacial meltwater and glacial loading as potential contributing factors to sinkhole development.&#xD;
A probabilistic karst model for the state of Kentucky, USA, has been generated using the Weights of Evidence method. This model is presented as an example of the predictive capabilities of these kind of data-driven modelling techniques and to show how such models could be applied to karst in Ontario. The model was able to classify 70% of the validation dataset correctly while minimizing false positive identifications. This is moderately successful and could stand to be improved. &#xD;
Finally, suggestions to improving the current karst model of southern Ontario are suggested with the goal of increasing investigation into karst in Ontario and streamlining the reporting system for sinkholes, caves, and other karst features so as to improve the current Ontario karst database.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Larger lineups could protect innocent suspects from being misidentified; however, they can also decrease correct identifications. Bertrand (2006) investigated whether the decrease in correct identifications could be prevented by adding more cues, in the form of additional views of lineup membersâ faces, to the lineup. Adding these cues was successful to an extent. The current series of studies attempted to replicate Bertrandâs (2006) findings while addressing some methodological issuesânamely, the inconsistency in image size as lineup size increased. First, I investigated whether image size could affect face recognition (Chapter 2) and found it could, but that it also affected previously-seen (âoldâ) versus previously-unseen (ânewâ) faces differently. Specifically, smaller image sizes at exposure lowered accuracy for old faces, while these same image sizes at recognition lowered accuracy for new faces. Although these results indicate that target recognition would be unaffected by image size at recognition (i.e., during a lineup), lineups are also comprised of previously-unseen faces, in the form of fillers and innocent suspects. Because image size could affect lineup decisions, as it could become more difficult to realize fillers are previously-unseen, I decided to replicate Bertrand (2006) while keeping image size constant in Chapters 3 (simultaneous lineups) and 4 (simultaneous-presentation, sequential decisions). In both Chapters, the integral findings were the same: correct identification rates decreased as lineup size increased from 6- to 24-person lineups, but adding cues had no effect. The inability to replicate Bertrand (2006) could mean that the original finding was due to chance, but alternate explanations also exist, such as the overall size of the array, the degree to which additional cues overlap, and the length of the target exposure. These alternate explanations, along with directions for future research, are discussed in the following Chapters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sensors for real-time monitoring of environmental contaminants are essential for protecting ecosystems and human health. Refractive index sensing is a non-selective technique that can be used to measure almost any analyte. Miniaturized refractive index sensors, such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microring resonators are one possible platform, but require coatings selective to the analytes of interest.&#xD;
A homemade prism refractometer is reported and used to characterize the interactions between polymer films and liquid or vapour-phase analytes. A camera was used to capture both Fresnel reflection and total internal reflection within the prism. For thin-films (d = 10 Î¼m - 100 Î¼m), interference fringes were also observed. Fourier analysis of the interferogram allowed for simultaneous extraction of the average refractive index and film thickness with accuracies of ân = 1-7 Ã10-4 and âd &lt; 3-5%.&#xD;
The refractive indices of 29 common organic solvents as well as aqueous solutions of sodium chloride, sucrose, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and dimethylsulfoxide were measured at Î» = 1550 nm. These measurements will be useful for future calibrations of near-infrared refractive index sensors. &#xD;
A mathematical model is presented, where the concentration of analyte adsorbed in a film can be calculated from the refractive index and thickness changes during uptake. This model can be used with Fickian diffusion models to measure the diffusion coefficients through the bulk film and at the film-substrate interface.&#xD;
The diffusion of water and other organic solvents into SU-8 epoxy was explored using refractometry and the diffusion coefficient of water into SU-8 is presented. Exposure of soft baked SU-8 films to acetone, acetonitrile and methanol resulted in rapid delamination. The diffusion of volatile organic compound (VOC) vapours into polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethyl-co-polydiphenylsiloxane polymers was also studied using refractometry. Diffusion and partition coefficients are reported for several analytes. &#xD;
As a model system, polydimethyl-co-diphenylsiloxane films were coated onto SOI microring resonators. After the development of data acquisition software, coated devices were exposed to VOCs and the refractive index response was assessed. More studies with other polymers are required to test the viability of this platform for environmental sensing applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background and Objectives: Mobility limitations are a prevalent issue in older adult populations, and an important determinant of disability and mortality. Neighborhood conditions are key determinants of mobility and perception of safety may be one such determinant. Women have more mobility limitations than men, a phenomenon known as the gender mobility gap. The objective of this work was to validate a measure of perception of safety, examine the relationship between neighborhood perception of safety and mobility limitations in seniors, and explore if these effects vary by gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: This study was cross-sectional, using questionnaire data collected from community-dwelling older adults from four sites in Canada, Colombia, and Brazil. The exposure variable was the neighborhood aggregated Perception of Safety (PoS) scale, derived from the Physical and Social Disorder (PSD) scale by Sampson and Raudenbush. Its construct validity was verified using factor analyses and correlation with similar measures. The Mobility Assessment Tool â short form (MAT-sf), a video-based measure validated cross-culturally in the studied populations, was used to assess mobility limitations. Based on theoretical models, covariates were included in the analysis, both at the neighborhood level (SES, social capital, and built environment) and the individual level (age, gender, education, income, chronic illnesses, depression, cognitive function, BMI, and social participation). Multilevel modeling was used in order to account for neighborhood clustering. Gender specific analyses were carried out. SAS and M-plus were used in this study. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: PoS was validated across all sites. It loaded in a single factor, after excluding two items, with a Cronbach Î± value of approximately 0.86. Mobility limitations were present in 22.08% of the sample, 16.32% among men and 27.41% among women. Neighborhood perception of safety was significantly associated with mobility limitations when controlling for all covariates, with an OR of 0.84 (CI 95%: 0.73-0.96), indicating lower odds of having mobility limitations as neighborhood perception of safety improves. Gender did not affect this relationship despite women being more likely to have mobility limitations and live in neighborhoods with poor perception of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: Neighborhood perception of safety affected the prevalence of mobility limitations in older adults in the studied population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two novel studies examining the capacity and characteristics of working memory for object weights, experienced through lifting, were completed. Both studies employed visually identical objects of varying weight and focused on memories linking object locations and weights. Whereas numerous studies have examined the capacity of visual working memory, the capacity of sensorimotor memory involved in motor control and object manipulation has not yet been explored. In addition to assessing working memory for object weights using an explicit perceptual test, we also assessed memory for weight using an implicit measure based on motor performance. The vertical lifting or LF and the horizontal GF applied during lifts, measured from force sensors embedded in the object handles, were used to assess participantsâ ability to predict object weights. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with sets of 3, 4, 5, 7 or 9 objects. They lifted each object in the set and then repeated this procedure 10 times with the objects lifted either in a fixed or random order. Sensorimotor memory was examined by assessing, as a function of object set size, how lifting forces changed across successive lifts of a given object. The results indicated that force scaling for weight improved across the repetitions of lifts, and was better for smaller set sizes when compared to the larger set sizes, with the latter effect being clearest when objects were lifting in a random order. However, in general the observed force scaling was poorly scaled. In Experiment 2, working memory was examined in two ways: by determining participantsâ ability to detect a change in the weight of one of 3 to 6 objects lifted twice, and by simultaneously measuring the fingertip forces applied when lifting the objects. The results showed that, even when presented with 6 objects, participants were extremely accurate in explicitly detecting which object changed weight. In addition, force scaling for object weight, which was generally quite weak, was similar across set sizes. Thus, a capacity limit less than 6 was not found for either the explicit or implicit measures collected.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spectral unmixing (SU) is a technique to characterize mixed pixels of the hyperspectral images measured by remote sensors. Most of the existing spectral unmixing algorithms are developed using the linear mixing models. Since the number of endmembers/materials present at each mixed pixel is normally scanty compared with the number of total endmembers (the dimension of spectral library), the problem becomes sparse. This thesis introduces sparse hyperspectral unmixing methods for the linear mixing model through two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the library of spectral signatures is assumed to be known and the main problem is to find the minimum number of endmembers under a reasonable small approximation error. Mathematically, the corresponding problem is called the $\ell_0$-norm problem which is NP-hard problem. Our main study for the first part of thesis is to find more accurate and reliable approximations of $\ell_0$-norm term and propose sparse unmixing methods via such approximations. The resulting methods are shown considerable improvements to reconstruct the fractional abundances of endmembers in comparison with state-of-the-art methods such as having lower reconstruction errors. In the second part of the thesis, the first scenario (i.e., dictionary-aided semiblind unmixing scheme) will be generalized as the blind unmixing scenario that the library of spectral signatures is also estimated. We apply the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) method for proposing new unmixing methods due to its noticeable supports such as considering the nonnegativity constraints of two decomposed matrices. Furthermore, we introduce new cost functions through some statistical and physical features of spectral signatures of materials (SSoM) and hyperspectral pixels such as the collaborative property of hyperspectral pixels and the mathematical representation of the concentrated energy of SSoM for the first few subbands. Finally, we introduce sparse unmixing methods for the blind scenario and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methods via simulations over synthetic and real hyperspectral data sets. The results illustrate considerable enhancements to estimate the spectral library of materials and their fractional abundances such as smaller values of spectral angle distance (SAD) and abundance angle distance (AAD) as well.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To study the dissipation of heat generated due to the formation of pinholes that cause local hotspots in the catalyst layer of the Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell, a two-phase non-isothermal model has been developed by coupling Darcyâs law with heat transport. The domain under consideration is a section of the membrane electrode assembly with a half-channel and a half-rib. Five potential locations where a pinhole might form were analyzed: at the midplane of the channel, midway between the channel midplane and the channel wall, at the channel or rib wall, midway between the rib midplane and the channel wall, at the midplane of the rib.   In the first part of this work, a preliminary thermal model was developed. The model was then refined to account for the two-phase effects. A sensitivity study was done to evaluate the effect of the following properties on the maximum temperature in the domain: Catalyst layer thermal conductivity, the Microporous layer thermal conductivity, the anisotropy factor of the Catalyst layer thermal conductivity, the Porous transport layer porosity, the liquid water distribution and the thickness of the membrane and porous layers. Accounting for the two-phase effects, a slight cooling effect was observed across all hotspot locations. The thermal properties of the catalyst layer were shown to have a limited impact on the maximum temperature in the catalyst layer of new fuel cells without pinhole. However, as hotspots start to appear, thermal properties play a more significant role in mitigating the thermal runaway.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The thesis focuses on a central theme of the epidemiology and health economics of ankle sprains to inform health policy and the provision of health services. It describes the burden, prognosis, resource utilization, and costs attributed to these injuries.&#xD;
The first manuscript systematically reviewed 34 studies on the direct and indirect costs of treating ankle and foot injuries. The overall costs per patient ranged from $2,075- $3,799 (2014 USD) for ankle sprains; $290-$20,132 for ankle fractures; and $6,345-$45,731 for foot fractures, reflecting differences in injury severity, treatment methods, and study characteristics.&#xD;
The second manuscript provided an epidemiological and economic profile of non-fracture ankle and foot injuries in Ontario using linked databases from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. The incidence rate of ankle sprains was 16.9/1,000 person-years. Annually, ankle and foot injuries cost $21,685,876 (2015 CAD). The mean expenses per case were $99.98 (95% CI, $99.70-100.26) for any injury. Costs ranged from $133.78-$210.75 for ankle sprains and $1,497.12-$1,755.69 for dislocations.&#xD;
The third manuscript explored the impact of body mass index on recovery from medically attended grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score. Data came from a randomized controlled trial of a physiotherapy intervention in Kingston, Ontario. At six months, the odds ratio of recovery for participants with obesity was 0.60 (0.37-0.97) before adjustment and 0.74 (0.43-1.29) after adjustment compared to non-overweight participants.&#xD;
The fourth manuscript used trial data to examine the health-related quality of life among ankle sprain patients using the Health Utilities Index version 3 (HUI-3). The greatest improvements in scores were seen at one month post-injury (HUI-3: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.86-0.90). Individuals with grade 2 sprains had significantly lower ambulation scores than those with grade 1 sprains (0.70 vs. 0.84; p&lt;0.05). &#xD;
The final manuscript used trial data to describe the financial burden (direct and indirect costs) of ankle sprains. The overall mean costs were $1,508 (SD: $1,452) at one month and increased to $2,206 (SD: $3,419) at six months. Individuals with more severe injuries at baseline had significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) costs compared to individuals with less severe injuries, after controlling for confounders.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the reasons for long-term population change in a species requires an evaluation of ecological variables that may account for the observed dynamics. In this study, long-term changes in indices of Smallmouth Bass condition and population levels were examined for eastern Lake Ontario and the Bay of Quinte. Smallmouth Bass are an extremely important recreational fish species native to Lake Ontario. They have experienced numerous changes in their environment through direct human impacts, climate change, predation, and habitat sharing with non-native species. Smallmouth Bass have experienced an increase in body length and weight likely due to a diet shift from crayfish to predominantly Round Gobies which has allowed them to increase their growth rate. According to existing assessment data however, this increase in body size has not been associated with an increase in abundance. Long-term data from gill net sampling shows that Smallmouth Bass populations have been declining since the late 1980s with no indication of recovery. This could be due to a variety of factors, but it is most likely due to a change in the selectivity of gill nets because of the change in body size as well as a habitat shift away from gill net sampling sites. Adjusting for gill net selectivity has revealed that sub-adult bass abundance is currently greater than it was historically, and that very large bass are likely not being retained within the gill nets that are currently used. The use of a long-term data set in this study has led to a much better understanding of Smallmouth Bass abundance and ecology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Genetic and environmental factors interact to influence vulnerability for internalizing psychopathology, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The mechanisms that account for how environmental stress can alter biological systems are not yet well understood yet are critical to develop more accurate models of vulnerability and targeted interventions. Epigenetic influences, and more specifically, DNA methylation, may provide a mechanism by which stress could program gene expression, thereby altering key systems implicated in depression, such as frontal-limbic circuitry and its critical role in emotion regulation. This thesis investigated the role of environmental factors from infancy and throughout the lifespan affecting the serotonergic (5-HT) system in the vulnerability to and treatment of depression and anxiety and potential underlying DNA methylation processes.&#xD;
First, we investigated the contributions of additive genetic vs. environmental factors on an early trait phenotype for depression (negative emotionality) in infants and their stability over time in the first 2 years of life. We provided evidence of the substantial contributions of both genetic and shared environmental factors to this trait, as well as genetically- and environmentally- mediated stability and innovation. Second, we studied how childhood environmental stress is associated with peripheral DNA methylation of the serotonin transporter gene, SLC6A4, as well as long-term trajectories of internalizing behaviours. There was a relationship between childhood psychosocial adversity and SLC6A4 methylation in males, as well as between SLC6A4 methylation and internalizing trajectory in both sexes. Third, we investigated changes in emotion processing and epigenetic modification of the SLC6A4 gene in depressed adolescents before and after Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). The alterations from pre- to post-treatment in connectivity between the ACC and other network regions and SLC6A4 methylation suggested that MBCT may work to optimize the connectivity of brain networks involved in cognitive control of emotion as well as also normalize the relationship between SLC6A4 methylation and activation patterns in frontal-limbic circuitry. Our results from these three studies strengthen the theory that environmental influences are critical in establishing early vulnerability factors for MDD, driving epigenetic processes, and altering brain processes as an individual undergoes treatment, or experiences relapse.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In geotechnical engineering, the stability of rock excavations and walls is estimated by using tools that include a map of the orientations of exposed rock faces. However, measuring these orientations by using conventional methods can be time consuming, sometimes dangerous, and is limited to regions of the exposed rock that are reachable by a human. This thesis introduces a 2D, simulated, quadcopter-based rock wall mapping algorithm for GPS denied environments such as underground mines or near high walls on surface. The proposed algorithm employs techniques from the field of robotics known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and is a step towards 3D rock wall mapping. Not only are quadcopters agile, but they can hover. This is very useful for confined spaces such as underground or near rock walls. The quadcopter requires sensors to enable self localization and mapping in dark, confined and GPS denied environments. However, these sensors are limited by the quadcopter payload and power restrictions. Because of these restrictions, a light weight 2D laser scanner is proposed. As a first step towards a 3D mapping algorithm, this thesis proposes a simplified scenario in which a simulated 1D laser range finder and 2D IMU are mounted on a quadcopter that is moving on a plane. Because the 1D laser does not provide enough information to map the 2D world from a single measurement, many measurements are combined over the trajectory of the quadcopter. Least Squares Optimization (LSO) is used to optimize the estimated trajectory and rock face for all data collected over the length of a light. Simulation results show that the mapping algorithm developed is a good first step. It shows that by combining measurements over a trajectory, the scanned rock face can be estimated using a lower-dimensional range sensor. A swathing manoeuvre is introduced as a way to promote loop closures within a short time period, thus reducing accumulated error. Some suggestions on how to improve the algorithm are also provided.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Quantitative methods can help us understand how underlying attributes contribute to movement patterns. Applying principal components analysis (PCA) to whole-body motion data may provide an objective data-driven method to identify unique and statistically important movement patterns. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to determine if athletesâ movement patterns can be differentiated based on skill level or sport played using PCA.&#xD;
Motion capture data from 542 athletes performing three sport-screening movements (i.e. bird-dog, drop jump, T-balance) were analyzed. A PCA-based pattern recognition technique was used to analyze the data. Prior to analyzing the effects of skill level or sport on movement patterns, methodological considerations related to motion analysis reference coordinate system were assessed. All analyses were addressed as case-studies.&#xD;
For the first case study, referencing motion data to a global (lab-based) coordinate system compared to a local (segment-based) coordinate system affected the ability to interpret important movement features. Furthermore, for the second case study, where the interpretability of PCs was assessed when data were referenced to a stationary versus a moving segment-based coordinate system, PCs were more interpretable when data were referenced to a stationary coordinate system for both the bird-dog and T-balance task. &#xD;
 As a result of the findings from case study 1 and 2, only stationary segment-based coordinate systems were used in cases 3 and 4. During the bird-dog task, elite athletes had significantly lower scores compared to recreational athletes for principal component (PC) 1. For the T-balance movement, elite athletes had significantly lower scores compared to recreational athletes for PC 2. In both analyses the lower scores in elite athletes represented a greater range of motion. Finally, case study 4 reported differences in athletesâ movement patterns who competed in different sports, and significant differences in technique were detected during the bird-dog task.&#xD;
Through these case studies, this thesis highlights the feasibility of applying PCA as a movement pattern recognition technique in athletes. Future research can build on this proof-of-principle work to develop robust quantitative methods to help us better understand how underlying attributes (e.g. height, sex, ability, injury history, training type) contribute to performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The southeastern coast of South Australia contains a spectacular and world-renown suite of Quaternary calcareous aeolianites.  This study is focused on the provenance of components in the Holocene sector of this carbonate breach-dune succession.   Research was carried out along seven transects from ~30 meters water depth offshore across the beach and into the dunes.  Offshore sediments were acquired via grab sampling and SCUBA.  Results indicate that dunes of the southern Lacepede and Otway coasts in particular are mostly composed of modern invertebrate and calcareous algal allochems.  The most numerous grains are from molluscs, benthic foraminifera, coralline algae, echinoids, and bryozoans.  These particles originate in carbonate factories such as macroalgal forests, rocky reefs, seagrass meadows, and low-relief seafloor rockgrounds.  The incorporation of carbonate skeletons into coastal dunes, however, depends on a combination of; 1) the infauna within intertidal and nearshore environments, 2) the physical characteristics of different allochems and their ability to withstand fragmentation and abrasion, 3) the wave and swell climate, and 4) the nature of aeolian transport.  Most aeolian dune sediment is derived from nearshore and intertidal carbonate factories.  This is particularly well illustrated by the abundance of robust infaunal bivalves that inhabit the nearshore sands and virtual absence of bryozoans that are common as sediment particles in water depths &gt; 10mwd.  Thus, the calcareous aeolianites in this cool-water carbonate region are not a reflection of the offshore marine shelf factories, but more a product of shallow nearshore-intertidal biomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines a process of indigenous accumulation among Tonga farmers in Zambiaâs Southern Province. In the 1970s multiple authors concluded that capitalist farmers had emerged among Tonga agro-pastoralists, predominantly within private titled holdings. Relying on archival research, newspapers, secondary sources and extensive oral testimony this thesis fills a 35-year gap on the topic, providing insights into the social and environmental impacts of neoliberal policy among African peasants and capitalist farmers. In contrast to dominant narratives of the post-independence period, this study argues that Zambia did experience a developmental process post-independence, which saw significant achievements made in the agricultural sector, including the doubling of national cattle stocks. The data reveals a painful process of disarticulation beginning in the late 1980s. Following neoliberal adjustment, we observe significant heterogeneity in production systems, some regional specialization, and processes of migration. Most importantly, the thesis uncovers processes of overwhelming ecosystemic change that contributed to livestock epidemics of severe scale and scope. Amazingly, this went largely undocumented because of the simultaneous crisis of the state, which left the national statistics office and other state bodies incapable of functioning from the late 1980s into the 2000s. In response, the Zambian state has introduced a number of neodevelopmental initiatives in the sector, yet the lack of animal traction remained up to 2008 and agricultural production declined, while more capitalized farmers (largely white, and/or with foreign direct investment) have become more significant players in the country. This thesis provides compelling evidence to challenge dominant economic thinking of the Washington institutions as well as many of the common Marxian formulations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sexual scriptsâthe definitions and expectations that individuals hold for sexual interactionsâare thought to play an important role in the maintenance of sexual well-being. Sexual scripts can be rigid or flexible, and they can be concordant or discordant between members of a couple. Sex therapists support sexual script flexibility for maintaining sexual and relationship satisfaction when couples are navigating sexual issues. However, empirical research examining the role of sexual script flexibility and the degree of script concordance/discordance in couplesâ sexual well-being has been limited, due in part to the limited measures available. Furthermore, within the existing research, there has been an unfortunate tendency to exclude individuals in same-gender relationships â perpetuating the long-standing knowledge gap in the literature on positive sexuality in diverse relationships. To address these gaps in the literature, we conducted a series of online studies that recruited individuals in diverse relationships. A measure of individual sexual script flexibility in response to sexual issues was developed (Chapter 2); in addition, the structure of an existing measure assessing couple sexual scripts in response to a sexual issue was evaluated (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 examined how individuals in diverse relationships compared on measures of individual sexual script flexibility and on couple sexual scripts. Findings suggest that there are more similarities than differences across diverse couples. Chapter 5 explored how flexibility in an individualâs approach to sexual issues relates to sexual well-being, specifically by assessing sexual communication and partner responses as mediators. Results suggest that individual sexual script flexibility relates to sexual well-being through reciprocal partner processes. Collectively, this research program suggests that more similarities than differences exist between individuals in same- and mixed-gender relationships, and that partners are important to consider in the relationship between individual sexual script flexibility and sexual well-being. These findings have implications for sex and couple therapy; these results emphasize the importance of interventions that target both members of the couple, and further our understanding of sexuality in same- and mixed-gender relationships.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) behaviour and phenotypic modulation is critical to vessel repair following damage, and the progression of various cardiovascular diseases. The second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphosphate (cAMP) plays a key role in VSMC function under the synthetic/activated phenotype, which is typically associated with unhealthy cell behaviour. Consequently, cAMP signaling is often targeted in attempts to impact several pathological diseases, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) catalyze hydrolysis of cAMP to an inactive form, and therefore directly regulate cAMP signaling. The PDE4D family dominates in synthetic VSMCs, and there is considerable interest in determining how distinct PDE4D isoforms affect cell function. Specifically, we are interested in the potential link between short isoforms of PDE4D and VSMC desensitization to pharmacological agents that impact cardiovascular disease via cAMP signaling. This study extends on previous work that assessed the expression of PDE4D splice variants in rat aortic VSMCs following prolonged challenge with cAMP-elevating agents. It was determined that PDE4D1 and PDE4D2 were uniquely expressed in synthetic VSMCs incubated with these agents, and that this upregulation impacted PDE activity and cAMP accumulation in these cells. Here, we report that PDE4D1 and PDE4D2 are markedly upregulated in synthetic human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) following prolonged challenge with cAMP-elevating agents. Using a combination of RNAi-based and pharmacological approaches, we establish that this upregulation is reflected in levels of cAMP PDE activity, and restricted to the cytosolic sub-cellular compartment. Our results suggest a role for localized PDE4D1 and PDE4D2 activity in regulating cAMP-mediated desensitization in HASMCs, and highlight their therapeutic potential in treating various cardiovascular diseases.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Healthcare is unacceptably error prone.  The question remains why, with 20 years of evidence, is error and harm reduction not being effective?  While precise numbers may be debated, all stakeholders recognize the frequency of healthcare errors is unacceptable, and greater efforts to ensure safety must occur.  In recent years, one of these strategies has been the inclusion of the patient and their family as partners in safety, and has been a required organizational practice of Accreditation Canada in many of their standard sets.   Existing patient advisories created to encourage engagement, have typically not included patient perspectives in their development or been comprehensively evaluated.  There are no existing tools to determine if and how a patient wants to be involved in safety engagement.  As such, a multi-phased study was undertaken to advance our knowledge about the clientâs and familyâs role in promoting safety.   &#xD;
Phase 1 of the study was a scoping review to methodically review the existing literature about patientsâ and familiesâ attitudes, beliefs and behaviours about their involvement in healthcare safety.  Phase 2 was designed to inductively explore how a group of patients in an Ontario, Canada, community hospital, describe healthcare safety and see their role in preventing error.  &#xD;
The study findings, which include the narratives of 30 patients and 4 family members, indicate that although there are shared themes that influence a patientâs engagement in patient safety, every individual has unique, changing beliefs, experiences and reasons for involvement.  Five conceptual themes emerged from their narratives: Personal Capacity, Experiential Knowledge, Personal Character, Relationships, and Meaning of Safety.  These study results will be used to develop and test a pragmatic, accessible tool to enable providers a way to collaborate with patients for determining their personal level and type of safety involvement.                                                      &#xD;
The most ethical and responsible approach to healthcare safety is to consider every facet and potential way for improvement.  This exploratory study provides fundamental insights into the complexity of patient engagement in safety, and evidence for future steps.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this project, I defend a restorative theory of criminal justice. I argue that the response to criminal wrongdoing in a just society should take the form of an attempt to heal the damage done to the community resulting from crime. I argue that the moral responsibilities of wrongdoers as wrongdoers ought to provide the framework for how a just society should respond to crime. Following the work of R.A. Duff, I argue that wrongdoers incur second-order duties of moral recognition. Wrongdoers owe it to others to recognize their wrongdoing for what it is, i.e. wrongdoing, and to shoulder certain burdens in order to express their repentant recognition to others via a meaningful apology. In short, wrongdoers owe it to their victims and others in the community to make amends. What I will deny, however, is the now familiar claim in the restorative justice literature that restoring the normative relationships in the community damaged by criminal forms of wrongdoing requires retributive punishment. In my view, how we choose to express the judgement that wrongdoers are blameworthy should flow from an all things considered judgment that is neither reducible to the judgement that the wrongdoer is culpably responsible for wronging others, nor the judgement that the wrongdoer in some basic sense âdeserves to sufferâ (or âdeserves punishment,â etc.).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2016 physicians in Ontario will be granted the authority to refer patients with gender dysphoria for sex reassignment surgery. In order to be granted this authority physicians must be trained in the World Professional Association for Transgender Healthâs Standards of Care, which outlines healthcare procedures for the treatment of gender dysphoria and provides background information concerning transgender health. The Standards of Care require that patients undergo a process of 12 months of continuous living in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity prior to being given access to sex reassignment surgery. While this requirement can sometimes be helpful it can also cause more harm than benefit. This paper argues that the requirement is strongly paternalistic in its current form and should no longer be mandatory in most cases.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The problem of decentralized sequential detection is studied in this thesis, where local sensors are memoryless, receive independent observations, and no feedback from the fusion center. In addition to traditional criteria of detection delay and error probability, we introduce a new constraint: the number of communications between local sensors and the fusion center. This metric is able to reflect both the cost of establishing communication links as well as overall energy consumption over time. A new formulation for communication-efficient decentralized sequential detection is proposed where the overall detection delay is minimized with constraints on both error probabilities and the communication cost. &#xD;
&#xD;
Two types of problems are investigated based on the communication-efficient formulation: decentralized hypothesis testing and decentralized change detection. In the former case, an asymptotically person-by-person optimum detection framework is developed, where the fusion center performs a sequential probability ratio test based on dependent observations. The proposed algorithm utilizes not only reported statistics from local sensors, but also the reporting times. The asymptotically relative efficiency of proposed algorithm with respect to the centralized strategy is expressed in closed form. When the probabilities of false alarm and missed detection are close to one another, a reduced-complexity algorithm is proposed based on a Poisson arrival approximation.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, decentralized change detection with a communication cost constraint is also investigated. A person-by-person optimum change detection algorithm is proposed, where transmissions of sensing reports are modeled as a Poisson process. The optimum threshold value is obtained through dynamic programming. An alternative method with a simpler fusion rule is also proposed, where the threshold values in the algorithm are determined by a combination of sequential detection analysis and constrained optimization. In both decentralized hypothesis testing and change detection problems, tradeoffs in parameter choices are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the last several decades, human activities have resulted in environmental changes that have increased the number of stressors that can act on a single environment. In Canadian Shield lakes, two recent stressors, the invasion of Bythotrephes longimanus and calcium decline, have been documented. Widespread acidification of hundreds of North American lakes has resulted in the precipitous decline of lake water calcium concentration. Crustacean zooplankton with high calcium demands are likely to be vulnerable to calcium decline, especially &lt;1.5 mg Ca/L, where survival and reproduction rates are reduced. These taxa are also vulnerable to predation by Bythotrephes that has been implicated in the loss of pelagic biodiversity in soft water lakes. Despite laboratory and field studies aimed at understanding the independent impact of these stressors, it is unclear how their co-occurrence will influence community response. Using a combination of data from a large regional lake survey and field experiments, I examined the individual and joint effects of Bythotrephes and calcium decline on native zooplankton community structure.	&#xD;
	Results demonstrated that much is known about Bythotrephes and our findings of reduced total zooplankton and species richness, due to the loss of Cladocera, are consistent with field surveys and other experimental studies. While we did not detect strong evidence for an effect of calcium on zooplankton using the lowest calcium concentration among invaded lakes (1.2 mg Ca/L), there is evidence that, as lake water calcium concentrations fall &lt;1 mg Ca/L, per capita growth rates of a broad variety of taxa are expected to decline. At the regional scale, negative effects of Bythotrephes and calcium on abundances of small cladocerans and Daphnia pulicaria, respectively, were in agreement with my experimental observations. We also observed significant interactions between Bythotrephes and calcium for a broad variety of taxa. As Bythotrephes continues to spread and invade lakes that are also declining in aqueous calcium, both stressors are likely to amplify negative effects on Cladocera that appear the most vulnerable. Loss of these important zooplankton in response to both Bythotrephes and calcium decline, is likely to lower zooplankton productivity, with potential effects on phytoplankton and higher trophic levels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The work presented in this thesis examines the properties of BPEs of various configurations and under different operating conditions in a large planar LEC system. Detailed analysis of time-lapsed fluorescence images allows us to calculate the doping propagation speed from the BPEs. By introducing a linear array of BPEs or dispersed ITO particles, multiple light-emitting junctions or a bulk homojunction have been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
In conclusion, it has been observed that both applied bias voltages and sizes of BPEs affected the electrochemical doping from the BPE. If the applied bias voltage was initially not sufficiently high enough, a delay in appearance of doping from the BPE would take place. Experiments of parallel BPEs with different sizes (large, medium, small) demonstrate that the potential difference across the BPEs has played a vital role in doping initiation. Also, the p-doping propagation distance from medium-sized BPE has displayed an exponential growth over the time-span of 70 seconds. Experiments with a linear array of BPEs with the same size demonstrate that the doping propagation speed of each floating BPE was the same regardless of its position between the driving electrodes. Probing experiments under high driving voltages further demonstrated the potential of having a much more efficient light emission from an LEC with multiple BPEs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The chemical compositions, modal mineralogy, and textural variability of interstitial minerals in sandstones of the Athabasca Group strata in the vicinity of the McArthur River unconformity-related uranium deposit were characterized using a combination of short wave infrared spectroscopy (SWIR), lithogeochemistry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and laser ablation mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to determine the residence sites of pathfinder trace elements. The importance of integrating in-situ mineral chemistry with whole-rock analyses resides in the possibility to establish the mineralogical and paragenetic context of geochemical signatures in defining the footprint of the deposit. Located in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada, the deposit is situated below ~550 m of quartz arenitic sandstones that are strongly silicified between depths of approximately 200-400 m. The silicified layer exhibits significant control on the distribution of alteration minerals, and appears to have restricted both the primary and secondary dispersion of pathfinder trace elements, which include U, radiogenic Pb isotopes, V, Ni, Co, Cu, Mo, As, Zn, and REEs. Diagenetic background sandstones contain assemblages of illite, dickite, aluminum-phosphate-sulfate (APS) minerals, apatite, and Fe-Ti oxide minerals. Altered sandstones contain assemblages of Al-Mg chlorite (sudoite), alkali-deficient dravite, APS minerals, kaolinite, illite, and oxide minerals. Throughout the sandstones, APS minerals account for the majority of the Sr and LREE concentrations, whereas late pre-ore chlorite, containing up to 0.1 wt.% Ni, accounts for the majority of Ni concentrations. Cobalt, Cu, Mo, and Zn occur predominantly in cryptic sub-micron sulfide and sulfarsenide inclusions in clay mineral aggregates and in association with paragenetically-late Fe-Ti oxides. Uranium occurs predominantly in cryptic micro-inclusions associated with pyrite in late-stage quartz overgrowths, and with paragenetically late Fe-Ti oxide micro-inclusions in kaolinite. Additionally, up to 0.2 wt.% U is cryptically distributed in post-ore Fe-oxide veins. Early diagenetic apatite, monazite and apatite inclusions in detrital quartz, and detrital zircon also contribute significant U and HREE to samples analyzed with an aggressive leach such as Aqua Regia. Detailed LA-ICP-MS chemical mapping of interstitial assemblages, detrital grains, and cements provides new insights into the distribution and inventory of pathfinder elements in the footprint of the McArthur River uranium deposit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the effects of rehabilitation on the structural performance of corrugated steel culverts. A full-scale laboratory experiment investigated the effects of grouted slip-liners on the performance of two buried circular corrugated steel culverts. One culvert was slip-lined and grouted using low strength grout, while the other was slip-lined and grouted using high strength grout. The performances of the culverts were measured before and after rehabilitation under service loads using single wheel pair loading at 0.45m of cover. Then, the rehabilitated culverts were loaded to their ultimate limit states. Results showed that the low and high strength grouted slip-liners provided strength well beyond requirements, with the low strength specimen failing at a load 2.4 times the fully factored service load, while the high strength specimen did not reach an ultimate limit state before bearing failure of the soil stopped testing. Results also showed that the low strength specimen behaved rigidly under service loads and flexibly under higher loads, while the high strength specimen behaved rigidly under all loads. A second full-scale experiment investigated the effect of a paved invert rehabilitation procedure on the performance of a deteriorated horizontal ellipse culvert. The performance of the culvert before and after rehabilitation was examined under service loads using tandem axle loading at 0.45m of cover. The rehabilitated culvert was then loaded up to its ultimate limit state. The culvert failed due to the formation of a plastic hinge at the West shoulder, while the paved invert cracked at the invert. Results showed that the rehabilitation increased the structural performance of the culvert, increasing the system stiffness and reducing average strains and local bending at critical locations in the culvert under service loads. A sustainability rating tool specifically for the evaluation of deteriorated culvert replacement or rehabilitation projects was also developed. A module for an existing tool, called GoldSET, was created and tested using two case studies, each comparing the replacement of a culvert using a traditional open-cut method with two trenchless rehabilitation techniques. In each case, the analyses showed that the trenchless techniques were the better alternatives in terms of sustainability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis compares John Deweyâs philosophy of experience and Maurice Merleau-Pontyâs phenomenology, and illustrates how Merleau-Pontyâs phenomenology can strengthen and further Deweyâs philosophy of education.  I begin by drawing the connection between Deweyâs philosophy of experience and his philosophy of education, and illustrate how Deweyâs understanding of growth, and thinking in education, is rooted in and informed by his detailed philosophy of experience.  From there, I give an interpretation of Merleau-Pontyâs phenomenology with a focus on his descriptions of subjectivity that he presents in the Phenomenology of Perception.  Following this, I outline some of the implications Merleau-Pontyâs phenomenology has on our understanding of rationality, expression and existence.  In the final chapter, I make the comparison between Deweyâs philosophy of experience and Merleau-Pontyâs phenomenology.  After demonstrating how these two philosophies are not only similar but also complementary, I then look to Merleau-Pontyâs phenomenology to provide insight into and to advance Deweyâs philosophy of education. I will illustrate how Merleau-Pontyâs understanding of subjectivity helps to support, and reinforce the rationale behind Deweyâs inquiry-based approach to education.  Furthermore, I will show how Merleau-Pontyâs phenomenology and its implications for rationality, expression and existence support Deweyâs democratic ideal and add a hermeneutical element to Deweyâs philosophy of education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Centennial deposit is a high grade (~8% U3O8), deeply buried (~950m), unconformity-related U deposit located in the south-central region of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.  The mineral chemistry of fine fractions (&lt;63 Î¼m) of soils from grids above the Centennial deposit were examined to understand possible controls on the geochemistry and radiogenic 207Pb/206Pb ratios measured in the clay-size (&lt;2 Î¼m) fractions used for exploration. Soil samples distal and proximal to the deposit projection to the surface and geophysically defined structures were selected. Mineral abundances were determined using the scanning electron microscope and Mineral Liberation Analysis.&#xD;
	Zircon was the only U-rich mineral identified with modal abundances &gt;0.02% by weight. Monazite, which can be U-rich, was identified, but not in significant abundances. The source of the zircon and other heavy minerals is interpreted to be from sub-cropping sources that are &gt;100 km up-ice from Centennial. Trace element analysis using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of hydroseparated zircon grains indicate that zircon abundances and zircon Pb concentrations in surficial samples have minimal effect on the radiogenic 207Pb/206Pb ratios in the clay-fraction of the samples, with the dominant source of radiogenic Pb being clay mineral surfaces that trapped Pb during secondary dispersion from the Centennial uranium deposit through faults and fractures to the surface. The REE patterns indicate HREE enrichment in the clay-fractions of samples that have higher abundances of zircon in the &lt;20 Î¼m fraction. Immobile elements such as HREE that are concentrated in zircon can be used as indicators of radiogenic Pb being sourced from minerals at the surface rather than being sourced from secondary dispersion from deeply buried U deposits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The commodification of natural resources and the pursuit of continuous growth has resulted in environmental degradation, depletion, and disparity in access to these life-sustaining resources, including water. Utility-based objectification and exploitation of water in some societies has brought us to the brink of crisis through an apathetic disregard for present and future generations. The ongoing depletion and degradation of the worldâs water sources, coupled with a reliance on Western knowledge and the continued omission of Indigenous knowledge to manage our relationship with water has unduly burdened many, but particularly so for Indigenous communities. The goal of my thesis research is to call attention to and advance the value and validity of using both Indigenous and Western knowledge systems (also known as Two-Eyed Seeing) in water research and management to better care for water. To achieve this goal, I used a combined systematic and realist review method to identify and synthesize the peer-reviewed, integrative water literature, followed by semi-structured interviews with first authors of the exemplars from the included literature to identify the challenges and insights that researchers have experienced in conducting integrative water research. Findings suggest that these authors recognize that many previous attempts to integrate Indigenous knowledges have been tokenistic rather than meaningful, and that new methods for knowledge implementation are needed. Community-based participatory research methods, and the associated tenets of balancing power, fostering trust, and community ownership over the research process, emerged as a pathway towards the meaningful implementation of Indigenous and Western knowledge systems. Data also indicate that engagement and collaborative governance structures developed from a position of mutual respect are integral to the realization of a given project. The recommendations generated from these findings offer support for future Indigenous-led research and partnerships through the identification and examination of approaches that facilitate the meaningful implementation of Indigenous and Western knowledge systems in water research and management. Asking Western science questions and seeking Indigenous science solutions does not appear to be working; instead, the co-design of research projects and asking questions directed at the problem rather than the solution better lends itself to the strengths of Indigenous science.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Tribbles Homologues are a family of three eukaryotic pseudokinases (Trb1, Trb2, Trb3) that act as allosteric inhibitors and regulatory scaffold sites in pathways governing adipogenesis, cell proliferation and insulin signaling. The Tribbles Homologues have the same overall tertiary structure of the eukaryotic protein kinase domain, but lack multiple residues necessary to catalysis in the nucleotide-binding P-loop and the Mg2+-coordinating DFG motif. Trb1 has been shown conclusively to be incapable of binding ATP, whereas a recent study presents evidence that Trb2 autophosphorylates independently of Mg2+ in vitro. This finding is surprising given the high degree of sequence similarity between the two proteins (71%), and suggests unique nucleotide binding and phosphotransfer mechanisms. The goal of this project was to investigate whether Trb2 possesses kinase activity or not and determine its structural basis. A method for the high-yield recombinant expression and purification of stable Trb2 was developed. Trb2 nucleotide binding and autophosphorylation could not be detected across multiple experimental approaches, including thermal shift assays, MANT-ATP fluorescence, radiolabeled phosphate incorporation, and nonspecific ATPase activity assays. Further characterization also revealed that Trb2 forms homomultimers with possible functional consequences, and extensive crystallization screening has yielded multiple promising conditions that could produce diffraction-quality crystals with further optimization. This project explores the difficulties in functionally characterizing putatively active pseudokinases, and proposes a structural basis for the conserved pseudokinase features of the Tribbles homologues.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study explores the âchilling effectâ of national security measures, in particular security certificates, on the Canadian Muslim male population. While the constitutionality and use of certificates have been widely debated, few studies have explored the impact of security certificates and other national security measures on the Muslim/Arab population in particular.  Using explanatory mixed methods I explore the perceptions of surveillance experienced by this group and note significant quantitative and qualitative differences on Muslim men compared to non-Muslim men. Survey data (50n) illustrate a âchilling effectâ among Muslim men in my study, who are significantly less likely to exercise their civil liberties. Through open ended interviews, Muslim male respondents (20n) describe the consequences of the âchillâ in their daily lives, on their religious identity, practices, and perceptions of belonging. These consequences, according to participants, lead to feelings of insecurity, vulnerability, disenchantment, and possibly even to radical views. This research offers suggestions in understanding Muslim subjectivity and the role of dialogue to contribute meaningfully to the stateâs efforts in understanding and countering terror.   Findings and implications from this research offer practical and timely insight to an issue that is confronting Western liberal democracies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Non-cognitive skills have caught the attention of current education policy writers in Canada.  Within the last 10 years, almost every province has produced a document including the importance of supporting non-cognitive skills in K-12 students in the classroom.  Although often called different names (such as learning skills, cross curricular competencies, and 20th Century Skills) and occasionally viewed through different lenses (such as emotional intelligence skills, character skills, and work habits), what unifies non-cognitive skills within the policy documents is the claim that students that are strong in these skills are more successful in academic achievement and are more successful in post-secondary endeavors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Though the interest from policy-makers and educators is clear, there are still many questions about non-cognitive skills that have yet to be answered.  These include: What skills are the most important for teacherâs to support in the classroom?  What are these skillsâ exact contributions to student success?  How can teachers best support these skills?  Are there currently reliable and valid measures of these skills?  These are very important questions worth answering if Canadian teachers are expected to support non-cognitive skills in their classrooms with an already burdened workload.  As well, it can begin to untangle the plethora of research that exists within the non-cognitive realm.  Without a critical look at the current literature, it is impossible to ensure that these policies are effective in Canadian classrooms, and to see an alignment between research and policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Upon analysis of Canadian curriculum, five non-cognitive skills were found to be the most prevalent among many of the provinces: Self-Regulation, Collaboration, Initiative, Responsibility and Creativity.  The available research literature was then examined to determine the utility of teaching these skills in the classroom (can students improve on these skills, do these skills impact other aspects of studentsâ lives, and are there methods to validly and reliably assess these skills).  It was found that Self-Regulation and Initiative had the strongest basis for being implemented in the classroom.  On the other hand, Creativity still requires a lot more justification in terms of its impact on studentsâ lives and ability to assess in the classroom.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Failures in large-scale software systems are often associated with performance issues. Therefore, performance testing has become essential to ensure the problem-free operation of these systems. Performance analysts must understand how their system behaves during performance testing and how such behaviour differs from its historical behaviour (i.e., the system's behaviour during a previous performance test or in the field). However, documentation describing the historical behaviour of a system is rarely up-to-date. Fortunately, execution logs, which record notable events at runtime, are readily available in most large-scale software systems to support remote monitoring, issue resolution and legal compliance. However, execution logs are typically treated as a sequence of events without fully leveraging additional sources of valuable information associated with such events (e.g., the dynamic information within the execution logs and performance counters that are collected during the system's execution). Therefore, in this thesis, we propose approaches for enriching execution events with additional sources of valuable information to compare a system's current behaviour against its historical behaviour. Through case studies on large-scale software systems, including open-source and enterprise systems, we show that our approaches are scalable and can help performance analysts to 1) detect and diagnose performance regressions and 2) improve their performance tests to be more representative of the field.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The languages of Indigenous peoples are threatened with disappearance worldwide, and Canada is no exception. Of the fifty or so Aboriginal languages still spoken in Canada today, only three can be considered relatively safe. In Canada, as in many other countries, this situation directly results from colonial policies intended to eradicate these languages and assimilate their speakers into the dominant society; policies which have been termed âcultural genocideâ. To redress this imbalance and avert the loss of these languages, their proper place in our constitutional order must be recognized. The author argues that Aboriginal languages in Canada already possess constitutional status, a status which has three main aspects. First, these languages are protected as Aboriginal rights under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Second, that this protection, when examined in the light of important constitutional principles and Canadaâs colonial past, imposes a corresponding duty on Canadian governments to support the revitalization, protection, and promotion of Aboriginal languages. And third, that the constitutional status of Aboriginal languages, as the languages of founding peoples of Canada, mandates their recognition as official languages, and that failure to do so would violate the equality rights of Aboriginal peoples, as well as amount to interference with their protected Aboriginal rights. The author concludes that the constitutional status of Aboriginal languages must be recognized and enhanced in order to enable the possibility of meaningful reconciliation between Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian state.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Oxygen delivery (O2D) is an important factor for maintaining intracellular homeostasis during exercise.  Disruptions in intracellular homeostasis increase fatigue progression and the perception of exercise.  The presence of inter-individual differences in the mechanisms governing O2D : demand matching during small and large muscle exercise remains unknown.  Preliminary evidence from our laboratory, as well as investigations from decades ago that received surprisingly little attention, suggest these differences are of particular importance. &#xD;
Purpose: 1) To identify and characterize cardiovascular response phenotypes during perfusion pressure induced compromises to exercising forearm skeletal muscle perfusion and establish an intervention to mitigate the adverse effects associated with non-compensation.  2) To determine the effects of differences in cardiac output (CO) on submaximal exercise tolerance and explore the efficacy of sprint interval training in augmenting the submaximal cardiac response. &#xD;
Methods:  Cardiovascular response phenotypes were assessed in healthy, young, recreationally active male participants during moderate intensity forearm exercise with a sudden perfusion pressure induced compromise to skeletal muscle perfusion. Those who responded without compensatory vasodilation completed the same experimental protocol after nitrate rich and nitrate depleted beetroot juice in an effort to restore compensation.  In a similar group of individuals, CO, perceived exertion and skeletal muscle properties were assessed during progressive cycling.  The same test was completed after 4 weeks of training to determine if submaximal cardiac responses are augmented following exercise training. &#xD;
Results: 1) Individuals presented either with (n = 13) or without (n = 8) compensatory vasodilation.  2) Non-compensation compromised O2D and exercise performance.  3) Nitrate rich beetroot juice restored compensatory vasodilation in previously identified non-compensators (n=6), which abolished perfusion pressure induced reductions in O2D and exercise performance. 5). Cardiac responses differed by up to five liters per minute and were not explained by arterial oxygen content or skeletal muscle properties. 6) Submaximal CO did not predict exercise tolerance, but was increased following training in low, but not high cardiac responders.  &#xD;
Conclusion: Differences in the mechanisms governing O2D : demand matching are present within a healthy, young, otherwise similar group of individuals.  These differences have real and functional impacts on O2D and exercise performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Model-Driven Development (MDD) is used for reducing the complexity of a software development process. One of the principal features of MDD which can make it very effective is the support for automatically generating code from the modeling artifacts. An example of MDD is the development of complex real time embedded software systems using the real time profile of UML (UML-RT). Development of this software is difficult mainly due to the requirement to satisfy timing constraints in a resource-constrained environment. Determining the correctness of this requirement is very important for ensuring the integrity and reliability of a real time software system. This research focuses on examining the correctness of timing information related to UML-RT models. The Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation (LTTng) is used for monitoring an executable real-time application, where the code is generated from UML-RT models using the open-source Papyrus-RT tool. Some of the key research outcomes include the ability to trace a user application, to read a trace file, display the trace results on the model level and display associated timestamps in textual form through the implementation of an Eclipse plugin. In addition, support is also provided to verify the actual timing information of a trace file against the desired user input. This feature enables users to find out the occurrence of any timing delay. Finally, three case studies are conducted using the prototype Eclipse plugin.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There are over 40 000 different types of rice, several of which are known to contain significant amounts of inorganic arsenic (As), i.e. the most toxic form of As.  Because rice requires water for cultivation, groundwater has a great impact on riceâs toxic content. Given that over 3 billion people share a diet consisting mainly of rice, risk assessment of toxic species of As, chromium (Cr) and selenium (Se), is important.&#xD;
This thesis investigates both toxic and essential elements in both cooked and uncooked rice, as previous studies have shown that cooking may in fact convert the species of As in rice to the most toxic species. This thesis focuses on organic white and brown rice, basmati rice and baby rice cereal.  Baby rice cereal has not been studied previously, despite the fact that itis one of the first foods given to infants, who are at greater risk because of their small weight.  &#xD;
Speciation analysis of the bio-accessible fraction was conducted on As, Cr and Se to determine which portion was actually toxic, as some species of these elements are non toxic.  To this end, ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) was used to separate the various species of the elements monitored, which were then quantified by performing on-line inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the effluent, i.e. using ICP-MS as a detector for IEC. Electrothermal vaporization (ETV) coupled to ICP optical emission spectrometry (OES) was also used to study glutinous rice that is commonly consumed in Asian countries.  The ability to conduct total analysis of the solid without the need for an acid digestion is beneficial in providing a quick and simple screening through determination of the total amount of toxic, potentially toxic and essential elements present in the solid sample. This study focuses on various rice-based samples and the potential risk they pose to human consumption on a regular basis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Adverse environmental effects caused by diluted bitumen (dilbit) spills have led to serious public concern. Compared to marine systems, the cleanup of oil-contaminated sediment in rivers is more difficult. Hyporheic flow, where surface water flows through the streambed, is one of the contributing factors for sediment contamination, which has received little research attention. Therefore, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in this study: to quantify the mass of dilbit droplets that get trapped in the sediment in gravel-dominated rivers by hyporheic flow; to investigate the effects of velocity, gravel size and clean water wash on the interaction between dilbit droplets and gravel porous media; and to determine the predominant droplet retention mechanism. Dilbit droplets were generated in a mixing reactor and transported through a one-dimensional gravel-packed aluminum column. Gravel sizes of 3 mm and 8 mm, and flow velocities of 0.09 cm/s and 0.35 cm/s were investigated to identify the impacts of these influential parameters on the trapping of dilbit droplets in gravel. Clean water wash after the completion of droplet transport was also applied to some experiments to examine whether droplet trapping is reversible. In addition, mathematical models that included attachment and straining filtration mechanisms used in colloid transport were employed to fit the experimental data. Results showed that trapped dilbit droplets in gravel follows a hyperexponential (not log-linear) profile. Smaller gravel size (3 mm) or higher flow velocity (0.35 cm/s) led to a greater mass of dilbit retained in the gravel-packed column, especially near the pack inlet. Clean water wash was shown to remove part of the trapped dilbit droplets, especially near the gravel pack inlet. A filtration model that considered straining instead of attachment was able to better match the observations, which indicates that straining is more likely to be the primary mechanism for the trapping of dilbit droplets in gravel.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>South Africa has the continentâs most sophisticated banking and credit systems with approximately 19 million credit-active consumers.  Their credit profiles are based on automated algorithmic assessments that generate data about their creditworthiness.  While the precise methods of assessment are corporate secrets, consumer credit scoring is constitutionally prohibited from being designed on grounds of âunfair discriminationâ.&#xD;
&#xD;
Against this backdrop, I show in this dissertation that credit scoring, as it is currently constituted in South Africa, offers more to the reproduction of social disadvantage â characterized by interconnected forms of class, gender and race â than to its alleviation.  As a tool of the African National Congress (ANC) governmentâs policy of âsocial transformationâ, designed to address inherited forms of social disadvantage, credit scoring is promoted by the state and credit bureaus as non-discriminatory and objective.  I test the validity of the main argument by identifying the social categories and social outcomes of credit financing in historical perspective, and comparing these with the contemporary social categories and social outcomes of credit financing, legislation and scoring.  This task is divided into four parts.  Firstly, to assess social disadvantage as a reproduction, I develop a theoretical framework that allows for the expansion of âapartheid-as-time-periodâ to âapartheid-as-social-conditionâ.  Secondly, I examine the ways in which social categories of disadvantage in credit legislation, policy and scoring under the ANC government (1994-present) share similarities with the social categories that shaped access to credit under the National Party government (1948-1991).  Thirdly, I repeat this examination but from the perspective of the social consequences that stem from social categories.  Fourthly, by drawing on open-ended interviews with corporate professionals, students loan holders and mortgage holders, I provide three case studies to examine the extent of similarity between social categories and social consequences in historical and contemporary perspectives: Durbanite consumersâ social experiences with credit scoring, racialized access to higher education, and credit-scored mortgages in Durban.  By demonstrating that credit scoring, in particular, is biased and subjective, and that it decontextualizes social circumstance, I conclude not only that there is a disconnect between credit scoring and the overarching policy of social transformation, but that the social condition of apartheid characterizes reproductions of social disadvantage.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is an iterative and incremental software development process. Supporting the analysis and the verification of software systems developed following the MDE paradigm requires to adopt incrementality when carrying out these crucial tasks in a more optimized way.&#xD;
&#xD;
Communicating State Machines are one of the various formalisms used in MDE tools to model and describe the behavior of distributed, concurrent and real-time reactive systems (e.g., automotive and avionics systems). Modeling the overall behavior of such systems is carried out in a modular way and on different levels of abstraction (i.e., it starts with modeling the behavior of the individual objects in the system first then modeling the interaction between these objects). Similarly, analyzing and verifying the correctness of the developed models to ensure their quality and their integrity is performed on two main levels. The intra-level is used to analyze the correctness of the individual models in isolation of the others, while the inter-level is used to analyze the overall interoperability of those that are communicating with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
One way to facilitate the analysis of the overall behavior of a system of communicating state machines is to build the global state space (also known as the global reachability tree) of the system. This process is very expensive and in some cases it may suffer from the state explosion problem. Symbolic execution is a technique that can be used to construct an abstract and a bounded version of the system global state space that is known as a symbolic execution tree (SET), yet the size of the generated trees can be very large especially with big and complex systems that are composed of multiple objects. As the system evolves, one way to avoid regenerating the entire SET and repeating any SET-based analyses that have been already conducted is to utilize the previous SET and its analysis results in optimizing the process of generating the SET of the system after the change. In this thesis, we propose two optimization techniques to direct the successive runs of the symbolic execution technique towards the impacted parts of an evolving state machine model using memoization (MSE) and dependency analysis (DSE), respectively. The evaluation results of both techniques showed significant reduction in some cases compared with the standard symbolic execution technique.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis consists of work investigating the causes of and solutions to elevated pH in secondary facultative wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs). Loyalist Township, Ontario, operates a water pollution control plant that employs three facultative WSPs that have experienced elevated pH levels in the summer months due to excessive algae growth. In efforts to comply with a regulated effluent pH of 9.5, the township commissioned this research group at Queenâs University to provide a scientifically proven solution to address this issue. Three studies are presented in this thesis that contribute to interventions that address the elevated pH. &#xD;
The first study examined the feasibility of using WSP sediments already present at the WPCP as a planting substrate for a proposed free water surface constructed wetland. Lab-scale experiments conducted under continuous and batch flow conditions demonstrated that the sediments were able to provide pH attenuation of domestic and synthetic wastewater without causing effluents to exceed regulatory compliance for other water quality parameters. &#xD;
The second study involved a 29-day field scale monitoring program that examined spatial and temporal water quality patterns in the first WSP at the WPCP. Results demonstrated that NO3- and PO43- were removed within the WSP, and that pH, DO, alkalinity, and total NH3 increased within the WSP. It was found that spatial heterogeneity in temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen exists within the pond, possibly due to the presence of epipelic filamentous algae (Oedogonium) and submerged macrophytes (Myriophyllum, Potamogeton. &#xD;
The third study presented a novel approach to numerically model WSPs that attempted to reproduce the pH, DO, NO3-, total alkalinity, and PO43- observations taken in 2014. The model was the first of its kind to model pH dynamics in a WSP in the presence of filamentous algae and submerged macrophytes. The calibrated model was used to test the effect of increased NH4+ loading, organics loading, the removal of macrophytes, and the removal of the baffle to seasonal effluent pH levels. Increased loading of NH4+ and organics to the system was shown to produce the largest reduction in seasonal pH levels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Given the significance afforded to career guidance as public policy within compulsory education, increasing our understanding of the role of policy documents in the enactment of career guidance programing is fundamental. Through a qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study, I explored how different levels of policy actors interpreted policy documents to make sense of career guidance as public policy and enacted their interpretations into career guidance programing. The 2014 revised policy for career guidance (first implemented in 2012/2013) in secondary schools in England, where I lived and worked for the first 43 years of my life, and the simultaneous introduction of a new policy and program for education and career/life planning in secondary schools in Ontario, where I now reside, provided logical locations for this study. By purposefully including a variety of levels of job roles, this study acknowledged Ball et al.âs (2011a) assertion that policy actors undertake complex and differentiated activity during policy implementation. Document analysis revealed the Ontario Creating Pathways to Success (2013) policy included the most far-reaching contributory content, outlining a comprehensive education and career/life planning program for Kâ12 students, that must be delivered through classroom instruction linked to the broader school curriculum. By contrast, the England Statutory Guidance and Non-Statutory Guidance (2013) policies consisted of guidance that schools must have regard to when providing advice and guidance to their students. The contextual policy landscape of each jurisdiction situated these interpretations, and clearly contributed to a number of challenges that needed navigation, as part of the interpretive process and decision-making regarding provision. The data collected from 25 policy actors underlined nuanced individual definitions of career guidance and interpretations of policy documents, that supported decision-making in all sample schools. The study examined the intersection of document analysis, sensemaking, and policy implementation; and provided rich descriptions of situated policy contexts and nested working practices that were peppered with learning, labour market, and social equity related terminology. Implications for future conceptual and empirical work include, reaching consensus in defining career guidance and associated terms, roles of external stakeholders as policy actors, and opportunities for learning conversations to build policy legacy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mechanochemistry, i.e. the application of external forces at the molecular level, has emerged as a significant area of research in recent years. This emergence can be attributed to the development of experimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy, molecular force probes, optical and magnetic tweezers, and sonication. The application of such techniques has rendered it possible to activate chemical reactions along particular pathways. Theoretical models have been reported in the literature to account for experimental outcomes and to understand the interplay between mechanical stress and chemical reactivity. The work in this thesis uses quantum chemical calculations to examine reaction barriers, ÎEâ¡âs, under mechanochemical conditions for a set of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions.First, a code is written to predict changes in ÎEâ¡âs under mechanochemical conditions. The code is used to select two atoms that a force, F, is applied along, which are termed pulling points. The predicted ÎEâ¡âs are consistent with those calculated using quantum chemical methods at low values of F, in which the reactants or transition state (TS) structures are not significantly altered.  The structural changes are prevented by applying constraints of varying size and chemical composition. The nature of the constraint plays a significant role in activating or deactivating a particular reaction. This result may be of value in the area of mechanoselectivity, in which the application of F can either activate or deactivate a reaction along a particular pathway. Substituents of varying size are added to bimolecular reactions to investigate the underlying energetics associated with ÎEâ¡âs under mechanochemical conditions. Increasing the sterics of the substituents increases the mechanical work contribution to the reduction in the force-dependent ÎEâ¡âs.The differences in the abilities to mechanically eliminate ÎEâ¡âs in unimolecular and bimolecular reactions are identified in this thesis. In unimolecular reactions, ÎEâ¡ can be rendered to zero if the reactant or TS is shifted along the zero-F reaction coordinate, S0. The ÎEâ¡âs for bimolecular reactions can only be rendered to zero if there is sufficient coupling between F and other nuclear degrees of freedom in the reactants that shift the reactants along S0 toward the TS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, the procedure of conducting magnetic surveys from a UAV platform is investigated. In the process of evaluating UAVs for such surveys, magnetic sensors capable of operating on a UAV platform were tested using a terrestrial survey, as well as on a UAV-platform. Results were then compared to a model of the area generated using a proton precession magnetometer. &#xD;
Magnetic signature of the UAVs are discussed and impact values are calculated. For a better understanding of the magnetic fields around UAVs some micro-surveys were conducted with the help of a fluxgate magnetometer around two UAVs. Results of such surveys were used to determine a location to mount the magnetometer during the survey.&#xD;
A test survey over a known anomaly (a visible chromite outcrop in Oman) is conducted in order to determine the feasibility of using UAV-based magnetometry for chromite exploration. Observations were taken at two different elevations in order to generate a 3-D model of the magnetic field. Later, after applying upward continuation filters and comparing the calculated results to the real values, the reliability and uncertainty levels of such filters were investigated.&#xD;
Results show that magnetometery on UAV platforms is feasible. Unwanted signals can be noticeable and produce fake anomalies by the end of each line because of the swinging effect of the suspended magnetometer below the UAV. This should be reduced by hardware and software modifications i.e. applying non-linear filters and mounting the sensor on a rigid rod. Also, it was derived that the error level associated with upward continuation filters exceeds 45% and thus, using such filters instead of actual observations is not suggested in gradiometry. Moreover, 3-D magnetic gradient surveys can be beneficial for future inversion problems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research presents a diesel-fed steam reformer and solid oxide fuel cell stack system Honeywell UniSimÂ® Design Suites model and a two-dimensional diesel-fed steam reformer ANSYS Fluent model. The performance of the reformer and fuel cell system was compared to the performance of diesel generators in Canadian remote communities to illustrate the environmental and economic advantages that reformer and fuel cell systems have over typical diesel generation setups. The results show that, despite current solid oxide fuel cell technology being economically unfeasible, technology that is nearing commercialization could present substantial environmental and economic savings opportunities for diesel-based distributed generation projects. &#xD;
The UniSimÂ® model relied on several assumptions, one of which was the full conversion of the fuel feed within the steam reformer. A two-dimensional steam reformer model was therefore created in ANSYS Fluent to more accurately model the reforming process. Parameter studies on the reformer catalyst layer showed that reducing catalyst layer porosity along the length of the reformer results in improved reformer performance because of increased catalyst mass and higher reaction rates downstream that help push the reforming reaction towards equilibrium.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The transition metal-catalyzed allylic substitution reaction is a particularly versatile method for the construction of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds.  Furthermore, owing to a number of developments over the past few decades, highly regio- and stereoselective reactions are now attainable with a variety of stabilized and unstabilized nucleophiles.  In this regard, the rhodium-catalyzed allylic substitution reaction has been shown to be highly regio- and stereospecific, thus providing a complementary method to the asymmetric metal-catalyzed allylic substitution reaction.  The following thesis is divided into three key chapters, which encompass a literature review followed by two research chapters, further divided based on the type of transformation discussed. &#xD;
Chapter 1 commences with a discussion of the mechanism of the transition metal-catalyzed allylic substitution reaction, with a particular focus on the factors that control the regio- and stereoselectivity, which is followed by a detailed account of the discovery and development of the rhodium-catalyzed variant.&#xD;
Chapter 2 highlights the development of the regio- and stereospecific rhodium-catalyzed allylic substitution reaction with an acyl anion equivalent.  Following a brief introduction, our work with alkenyl cyanohydrins and tertiary allylic carbonates for the construction of Î±-quaternary Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketones shall be described.  The last section in Chapter 2 will outline the development of a divergent allylic alkylation of aryl cyanohydrins with secondary allylic carbonates to furnish Î±-ternary ketones or trisubstituted enones. &#xD;
Chapter 3 will discuss our efforts toward using nitrile-stabilized carbanions in the enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed allylic substitution reaction.  In this regard, the reaction of Î±-alkyl benzyl nitrile pronucleophiles with allyl benzoate has been shown to afford homoallylic nitriles bearing a quaternary carbon center in high enantioselectivity using a chiral complex derived from a cationic rhodium(I) complex and a chiral monodentate phosphite.  Finally, our initial progress toward the development of an enantioselective allylic alkylation with a homoenolate equivalent shall be discussed.  This approach offers a fundamentally novel method for the construction of acyclic Î²-functionalized carboxylic acids, which should provide the impetus for future advances in this area.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As nuclear energy systems become more advanced, the materials encompassing them need to perform at higher temperatures for longer periods of time. In this Masterâs thesis we experiment with an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) austenitic steel that has been recently developed. ODS materials have a small concentration of nano oxide particles dispersed in their matrix, and typically have higher strength and better extreme temperature creep resistance characteristics than ordinary steels. However, no ODS materials have ever been installed in a commercial power reactor to date. Being a newer research material, there are many unanswered phenomena that need to be addressed regarding the performance under irradiation. Furthermore, due to the ODS material traditionally needing to follow a powder metallurgy fabrication route, there are many processing parameters that need to be optimized before achieving a nuclear grade material specification. In this Masterâs thesis we explore the development of a novel ODS processing technology conducted in Beijing, China, to produce solutionized bulk ODS samples with ~97% theoretical density. This is done using relatively low temperatures and ultra high pressure (UHP) equipment, to compact the mechanically alloyed (MA) steel powder into bulk samples without any thermal phase change influence or oxide precipitation. By having solutionized bulk ODS samples, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of nano oxide precipitation within the steel material can be studied by applying post heat treatments. These types of samples will be very useful to the science and engineering community, to answer questions regarding material powder compacting, oxide synthesis, and performance. Subsequent analysis performed at Queenâs University included X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Additional TEM in-situ 1MeV Kr2+ irradiation experiments coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques, were also performed on large (200nm+) non-stoichiometric oxides embedded within the austenite steel grains, in an attempt to quantify the elemental compositional changes during high temperature (520oC) heavy ion irradiation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Extending work that examines Somali female identity, this thesis addresses how gendered subjectivity is articulated and performed within the Somali social imaginary vis-Ã -vis notions of âtradition,â modernity, colonialism, and post-colonialism. The project starts with the construction of an idealized Somali womanhood (what I refer to as gabar xishood leh, a modest girl), the affective pull and attachment of this identity formation, and the compulsion to perform it. In part, I illustrate how this gendered paradigm lays the conditions for being and belonging within the Somali collectivity. As the gabar xishood leh discourse is embedded with a particular conception of modesty, female desire and agency is bracketed outside the gabar xishood leh ideal. As such, this distancing precludes collective belonging and opens up real possibilities of unbelonging. The negotiation of modesty and female sexual desire is the focus of this project. I ask: how do women exert sexual agency, âvoice,â and modesty in ways that allow them to participate fully in the (various but often silenced) performances of Somali womanhood? In looking at classical Somali female poets (1899-1944 in pastoral lands of Northern Somalia) and modern Somali female poets (1969-1989 in the urban centre of Mogadishu, Somalia), I argue these poets have hybrid subjectivities that allow the expression of sexual desire thorough the subversion of normative codes of modesty. In addition to re-signified codes, specific spaces such as alternative publics, and the agentive acts of speaking through codes and performative listening, open up the different trajectories of how classical and modern Somali female poets creatively, socially, and politically participate in the Somali public sphere. Using theories of affect, hybridity, in-between space, and public culture, among others, I question how the nexus of modesty, sexual desire, and Somali femininity not only exposes lacunae in the Somali collective imagination but creates an unconventional map of Somali womanhoodâa map that re-imagines gabar xishood leh in its complexity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Both ludic and macabre, the theatrical works of Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet are a paradox to behold. Indeed, as this thesis seeks to illustrate, despite their vastly differing aesthetics, at the core of each playwrightâs stage productions is a tension between the charactersâ yearning for silence and invisibility, and the continual creation of an often humorous, chaotic, exaggerated or theatrical image that depicts this very longing. Seeking an impossible intersection between their image and their death, they are trapped in a double bind that guarantees aesthetic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
In order to grasp the close, yet delicate, relationship between the image of death and the death of the image, as presented in the plays of Beckett and Genet, we will explore how the charactersâ creative processes deflate the very images â both visual and auditory â that they create. More specifically, we will examine how mimesis both liberates and confines the characters; while the symbolic realm provides the only means of self-representation, it is also a source of profound alienation and powerlessness, for it never adequately conveys meaning. Thus, body, gesture, language and voice are each the site of simultaneous and ceaseless reappearance and disappearance, for which death remains the only (aporetic) cure. Struggling against theatrical form, which demands the actorsâ and the audienceâs physical presence, both playwrights make shrewd use of metatheatre to slowly empty the stage and thereby suggest the impending, yet impossible, erasure of their characters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Speech perception routinely takes place in noisy or degraded listening environments, leading to ambiguity in the identity of the speech token. Here, I present one review paper and two experimental papers that highlight cognitive and visual speech contributions to the listening process, particularly in challenging listening environments.  First, I survey the literature linking audiometric age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline and review the four proposed causal mechanisms underlying this link. I argue that future research in this area requires greater consideration of the functional overlap between hearing and cognition. I also present an alternative framework for understanding causal relationships between age-related declines in hearing and cognition, with emphasis on the interconnected nature of hearing and cognition and likely contributions from multiple causal mechanisms. I also provide a number of testable hypotheses to examine how impairments in one domain may affect the other. In my first experimental study, I examine the direct contribution of working memory (through a cognitive training manipulation) on speech in noise comprehension in older adults. My results challenge the efficacy of cognitive training more generally, and also provide support for the contribution of sentence context in reducing working memory load. My findings also challenge the ubiquitous use of the Reading Span test as a pure test of working memory. In a second experimental (fMRI) study, I examine the role of attention in audiovisual speech integration, particularly when the acoustic signal is degraded. I demonstrate that attentional processes support audiovisual speech integration in the middle and superior temporal gyri, as well as the fusiform gyrus.  My results also suggest that the superior temporal sulcus is sensitive to intelligibility enhancement, regardless of how this benefit is obtained (i.e., whether it is obtained through visual speech information or speech clarity).  In addition, I also demonstrate that both the cingulo-opercular network and motor speech areas are recruited in difficult listening conditions. Taken together, these findings augment our understanding of cognitive contributions to the listening process and demonstrate that memory, working memory, and executive control networks may flexibly be recruited in order to meet listening demands in challenging environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Suggesting that the political diversity of American science fiction during the 1960s and early 1970s constitutes a response to the dominance of social liberalism throughout the 1940s and 1950s, I argue in Making the Men of Tomorrow that the development of new hegemonic masculinities in science fiction is a consequence of political speculation.  Focusing on four representative and influential texts from the 1960s and early 1970s, Philip K. Dickâs The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch and Ubik, Robert A. Heinleinâs The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, and Ursula K. Le Guinâs The Dispossessed, this thesis explores the relationship between different conceptions of hegemonic masculinity and three separate but related political ideologies: the social ethic, market libertarianism, and socialist libertarianism.  In the first two chapters in which I discuss Dickâs novels, I argue that Dick interrogates organizational masculinity as part of a larger project that suggests the inevitable infeasibility of both the social ethic and its predecessor, social liberalism.  In the next chapter, I shift my attention to Heinleinâs The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress as a way of showing how, unlike Dick, other authors of the 1960s and early 1970s sought to move beyond social liberalism by imagining how new political ideologies, in this case market libertarianism, might change the way men see themselves.  Having demonstrated how the libertarian potential of Heinleinâs novel is ultimately undermined by its insistent and uncompromising biological determinism, I then discuss how Le Guinâs The Dispossessed uses the socialist libertarianism of the moon Anarres to suggest a more egalitarian form of masculinity, one that makes possible, to some extent at least, a future in which men might embrace not only the mutual aid of socialism, but also the primacy of individual rights that is at the heart of all forms of libertarianism and liberalism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Positive Youth Development (PYD) perspective is a strength-based conceptualization of youth. It highlights the importance of mutually beneficial relationships between youth and their environment to develop the âFive Csâ, key assets that include character. Character has long been a subject of programming due to its focus on helping children lead moral, empathic, and prosocial lives. There are, however, many limitations in character research, including poorly operationalized definitions of character; a failure to examine the developmental and broader social context in which character exists; and a lack of evaluation of more practical character programming. The goal of this dissertation was to address these gaps in knowledge and inform the character education programming literature. The first study examined the relationships among age, gender, the school social context, and character. Moral character was negatively associated with grade, and being a girl was positively associated with moral character. The relationships between positive peer interactions at school and character (fairness, integrity) were stronger among students who reported low initial moral character when positive peer interactions was high. In the second study, the Build Character: Build Success Program, a character education program, was evaluated over six months to examine its effects on character behaviours, victimization, and school climate. No program effects were found for students in grades 1 to 3, but a slight decrease in victimization in one experimental school was found for students in grades 4 to 8. This lack of general program effects may be due to the short-term nature of the intervention, which may not have been long enough to result in measurable behaviour change. Implementation data indicated that teachers did not teach all program elements, which also may have influenced the results of the program evaluation. The present dissertation contributes to knowledge about character and its programming by: introducing new measures to operationalize character, discovering developmental patterns in character in school-aged children, highlighting gender differences in character, examining character within its broad social context, and evaluating short-term character education programming.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) sources can pose a significant threat to indoor air through vapour intrusion (VI). Most conceptual and numerical models of VI assume that the transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a diffusion-limited process. Recently, alternate conditions have been identified that could lead to faster transport, including the presence of preferential pathways and methanogenic gas production. In this study, an additional mechanism that could lead to faster transport was investigated: bubble-facilitated VOC transport from LNAPL smear zones. A laboratory investigation was preformed using pentane in one-dimensional laboratory columns and two-dimensional visualization experiments. &#xD;
Results of the column experiments showed that average VOC mass fluxes in the bubble-facilitated columns were over two orders of magnitude greater than in the diffusion-limited columns. In addition, the flux signal was intermittent, consistent with expectations of bubble-facilitated transport as bubbles expand, mobilize and are released to the vadose zone at various times during the test. The results from the visualization experiments showed gas fingers growing and mobilizing over time, which supports the findings of the column experiments. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the potential for bubble-facilitated VOC transport to affect mass transfer in LNAPL smear zones, and lead to increased indoor air concentrations by VI.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prostate cancer is the most common non-dermatological cancer amongst men in the developed world. The current definitive diagnosis is core needle biopsy guided by transrectal ultrasound. However, this method suffers from low sensitivity and specificity in detecting cancer. Recently, a new ultrasound based tissue typing approach has been proposed, known as temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS). In this approach, a set of temporal ultrasound frames is collected from a stationary tissue location without any intentional mechanical excitation.&#xD;

The main aim of this thesis is to implement a deep learning-based solution for prostate cancer detection and grading using TeUS data. In the proposed solution, convolutional neural networks are trained to extract high-level features from time domain TeUS data in temporally and spatially adjacent frames in nine in vivo prostatectomy cases. This approach avoids information loss due to feature extraction and also improves cancer detection rate. The output likelihoods of two TeUS arrangements are then combined to form our novel decision support system. This deep learning-based approach results in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80 and 0.73 for prostate cancer detection and grading, respectively, in leave-one-patient-out cross-validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Recently, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) has been utilized to improve detection rate of aggressive prostate cancer. In this thesis, for the first time, we present the fusion of mp-MRI and TeUS for characterization of prostate cancer to compensates the deficiencies of each image modalities and improve cancer detection rate. The results obtained using TeUS are fused with those attained using consolidated mp-MRI maps from multiple MR modalities and cancer delineations on those by multiple clinicians. The proposed fusion approach yields the AUC of 0.86 in prostate cancer detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
The outcomes of this thesis emphasize the viable potential of TeUS as a tissue typing method. Employing this ultrasound-based intervention, which is non-invasive and inexpensive, can be a valuable and practical addition to enhance the current prostate cancer detection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the ongoing European sovereign debt crises that began with Greece in 2009, in the wake of the US subprime mortgage crisis. Through the application of a historical materialist approach, I attempt to understand the on-going crisis in the European Monetary Union (EMU) by investigating root causes of sovereign debt crises, relations of power, and main beneficiaries of the policy responses. My theoretical framework hinges on three contradictions in capitalism: the tendency towards overaccumulation, the tension between fictitious capital and the productive base, and the contradiction inherent in capitalist states between their role as a national state and as a class state. In contrast to the dominant positions that locate the cause of the crisis within either: debtor states; creditor states; or the framework at the EMU, I argue that these sovereign debt crises are actually a broader crisis of crisis of capitalism within the EMU itself. In order to do so, I trace the evolution of the political economy of the Eurozone in the post-Bretton woods era, with a particularly focus on the credit system. More specifically, I argue that these crises are the result of an interaction between three meso-level contradictions that have developed within the EMU region: 1) Germanyâs postwar accumulation regime, which has produced a deep crisis of overaccumulation; 2) the contradictory processes associated with the neoliberal logic of the EMU, by which I mean the rush to lower barriers to credit and finance at the expense of all else; and 3) credit-fueled, consumption-based EMU integration in the periphery; and. These three contradictions came together in the wake of the 2007-2008 US subprime crisis to form an overall crisis of capitalism in the Eurozone, expressed, as I suggest, as a crisis of fictitious capital. This dissertation aims to contribute to the ongoing project among critical political economists to de-naturalize and re-politicize money, while challenging the hegemony of monetarism within neoliberalism. Second, there has yet to be a comprehensive study that examines the EMU, Germany, and the crises in the periphery from a holistic, historical materialist analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This community-based research project, in collaboration with the Gananoque and Area Food Access Network (GAFAN), gathered data from self-reported food insecure residents of Gananoque and area to determine how to improve their access to healthy, personally acceptable food. In March 2016, I recruited 14 participants for three focus groups and one personal interview with those struggling to put food on the table for themselves and others in the household. Participants were single parents, adults over the age of 50, and adults who could benefit from improved access to healthy food but do not currently use existing services. Health issues, social isolation, scraping by, and lack of income were four themes that underscored the impact of poverty on the lives of participants. Lack of income, transportation, cost of food, lack of affordable or accessible childcare, and inadequate access to support services proved to be major barriers to food security: strongly influenced by the impact of rurality.  The results of this research have the potential to help GAFAN improve food access for those living in this community. It may also have implications for enhancing food security in other rural Canadian communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries have got attention in recent decades because of their undisputable advantages over other types of batteries. They are used in so many our devices which we need in our daily life such as cell phones, lap top computers, cameras, and so many electronic devices. They also are being used in smart grids technology, stand-alone wind and solar systems, Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV), and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). &#xD;
Despite the rapid increase in the use of Lit-ion batteries, the existence of limited battery models also inadequate and very complex models developed by chemists is the lack of useful models a significant matter. A battery management system (BMS) aims to optimize the use of the battery, making the whole system more reliable, durable and cost effective. Perhaps the most important function of the BMS is to provide an estimate of the State of Charge (SOC). SOC is the ratio of available ampere-hour (Ah) in the battery to the total Ah of a fully charged battery.&#xD;
The Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) of a fully relaxed battery has an approximate one-to-one relationship with the SOC. Therefore, if this voltage is known, the SOC can be found.  However, the relaxed OCV can only be measured when the battery is relaxed and the internal battery chemistry has reached equilibrium.&#xD;
This thesis focuses on Li-ion battery cell modelling and SOC estimation. In particular, the thesis, introduces a simple but comprehensive model for the battery and a novel on-line, accurate and fast SOC estimation algorithm for the primary purpose of use in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, and microgrid systems. The thesis aims to (i) form a baseline characterization for dynamic modeling; (ii) provide a tool for use in state-of-charge estimation. &#xD;
The proposed modelling and SOC estimation schemes are validated through comprehensive simulation and experimental results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Microwave reduction testing using activated charcoal as a reducing agent was performed on a sample of Black Thor chromite ore from the Ring of Fire deposit in Northern Ontario. First, a thermodynamic model was constructed for the system. Activity coefficients for several species were found in the literature. The model predicted chromium grades of 61.60% and recoveries of 93.43% for a 15% carbon addition. Next, reduction testing on the chromite ore was performed. Tests were performed at increasing power levels and reduction times. Testing atmospheres used were air, argon, and vacuum. The reduced product had maximum grades of 72.89% and recoveries of 80.37%. These maximum values were obtained in the same test where an argon atmosphere was used, with a carbon addition of 15%, optimal power level of 1200 W (actual 1171 W), and a time of 400 seconds. During this test, 17.53% of the initial mass was lost as gas, a carbon grade of 1.95% was found for the sintered core product. Additional work is recommended to try and purify the sintered core product as well as reduce more of the initial sample. Changing reagent schemes or a two step reduction / separation process could be implemented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Humour production and showing mirth (i.e., smiling and laughing) confer prosocial advantages. However, there is a paucity of literature evaluating how humour manifests in psychopathology. Humour and mirth may be especially relevant in depression, wherein profound impairments are evident in emotional and social functioning. Chapters 2 and 3 present correlational and predictive relations of depressive, social anxiety, and social anhedonia symptoms with humour styles, and consider the role of motivational systems and expressivity of positive affect as they relate to humour. As expected, symptoms and avoidance-based motivation were positively related to maladaptive humour styles and negatively related to adaptive humour styles. Interestingly, the pattern of relations shifted when considered among individuals in a depressive episode; acutely depressed individuals generally shy away from any humour style rather than gravitating toward specific styles. In a mediation model, the inverse relation between depressive symptoms and affiliative humour was fully mediated by approach-based motivation and expressivity of positive emotions. Chapters 4 and 5 examined subjective and observed mirth responses (facial affect and laughter) demonstrated by depressed and healthy comparison groups. Relative to non-depressed individuals, depressed persons reported less enjoyment, lower ratings of funniness, and fewer instances and shorter durations of positive facial affect and laughter when viewing humourous videos. There was no significant change in retrospective ratings of enjoyment and funniness at a one-week follow-up. The pattern of responsivity by depressed persons shifted when they viewed humourous videos while hearing others laughing. Both groups demonstrated more mirth when hearing others laugh; there were no differences between groups on mirthful behaviours. The one exception was that the total duration of laugher produced by depressed individuals was shorter than that produced by individuals in the healthy comparison group. This research project demonstrates that facets of depressive symptomatology are differentially associated with humour use and depressed individuals show blunted emotional responsivity to humourous stimuli. However, the pattern of reduced affective responsivity is context specific in that it fluctuates in response to hearing othersâ laughter. These findings have important implications for the conceptualization of depression and the subsequent avenues for the treatment of individuals with depression.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arctic regions are expected to experience an increase in both temperature and precipitation over the coming decades, which is likely to impact vegetation dynamics and greenhouse gas exchange. To test this response, an experiment was installed at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory, on Melville Island, NU, in 2008 as part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). Snow fences and open top chambers (OTCs) were used to manipulate snow depth and air temperature, respectively. Unlike most ITEX sites to date, enhanced temperature and snowfall were combined here in a factorial design with eight replicates. As an added control, four plots were established well outside the enhanced snow area. Senescence date was recorded at the end of the season, and at the peak of the growing season a vegetation survey was conducted within each plot in order to determine the total percent cover of each plot, as well as the percent cover of individual species. Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange was also measured within each plot throughout the growing season. &#xD;
The date of senescence occurred significantly earlier in plots which had not been manipulated in any way, compared to all other treatments for all species. Salix arctica showed the greatest increase in cover over time at the species level. Lichen cover increased significantly in the deepened snow plots, and in general there were significant increases in percent cover in some functional groups over time. &#xD;
During June and into July the net CO2 flux was to the atmosphere. It was not until July 27 that these ecosystems became net carbon sinks. However, warming alone resulted in the ecosystem acting as a significant net carbon sink for the entire growing season. Plots exposed to warming alone were estimated to have removed approximately 19.94 g C m-2 from the atmosphere, whereas all other treatments were very similar to one another and estimated to have added approximately 3.12 g C m-2 to the atmosphere. Active layer depth and soil temperatures suggest that plots within the ambient snow zone may be receiving some additional snow due to their proximity to the fences. CO2 fluxes measured within the outer control plots suggest that the effect of warming alone could lead to this ecosystem being an even stronger net C sink under truly ambient snow conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A subfilter-scale (SFS) stress model is developed for large-eddy simulations (LES) and is tested on various benchmark problems in both wall-resolved and wall-modelled LES. The basic ingredients of the proposed model are the model length-scale, and the model parameter. The model length-scale is defined as a fraction of the integral scale of the flow, decoupled from the grid. The portion of the resolved scales (LES resolution) appears as a user-defined model parameter, an advantage that the user decides the LES resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
The model parameter is determined based on a measure of LES resolution, the SFS activity. The user decides a value for the SFS activity (based on the affordable computational budget and expected accuracy), and the model parameter is calculated dynamically. Depending on how the SFS activity is enforced, two SFS models are proposed. In one approach the user assigns the global (volume averaged) contribution of SFS to the transport (global model), while in the second model (local model), SFS activity is decided locally (locally averaged). The models are tested on isotropic turbulence, channel flow, backward-facing step and separating boundary layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
In wall-resolved LES, both global and local models perform quite accurately. Due to their near-wall behaviour, they result in accurate prediction of the flow on coarse grids. The backward-facing step also highlights the advantage of decoupling the model length-scale from the mesh. Despite the sharply refined grid near the step, the proposed SFS models yield a smooth, while physically consistent filter-width distribution, which minimizes errors when grid discontinuity is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally the model application is extended to wall-modelled LES and is tested on channel flow and separating boundary layer. Given the coarse resolution used in wall-modelled LES, near the wall most of the eddies become SFS and SFS activity is required to be locally increased. The results are in very good agreement with the data for the channel. Errors in the prediction of separation and reattachment are observed in the separated flow, that are somewhat improved with some modifications to the wall-layer model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Code patterns, including programming patterns and design patterns, are good references for programming language feature improvement and software re-engineering. However, to our knowledge, no existing research has attempted to detect code patterns based on code clone detection technology. In this study, we build upon the previous work and propose to detect and analyze code patterns from a collection of open source projects using NiPAT technology. Because design patterns are most closely associated with object-oriented languages, we choose Java and Python projects to conduct our study. The tool we use for detecting patterns is NiPAT, a pattern detecting tool originally developed for the TXL programming language based on the NiCad clone detector. We extend NiPAT for the Java and Python programming languages. Then, we try to identify all the patterns from the pattern report and classify them into several different categories. In the end of the study, we analyze all the patterns and compare the differences between Java and Python patterns.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to explore new and improved methods for greater sample introduction efficiency and enhanced analytical performance with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Three projects are discussed in which the capabilities and applications of ICP-OES are expanded:&#xD;
1.	In the first project, a conventional ultrasonic nebuliser was modified to replace the heater/condenser with an infrared heated pre-evaporation tube. In continuation from previous works with pre-evaporation, the current work investigated the effects of heating with infrared block and rope heaters on two different ICP-OES instruments. Comparisons were made between several methods and setups in which temperatures were varied. By monitoring changes to sensitivity, detection limit, precision, and robustness, and analyzing two certified reference materials, a method with improved sample introduction efficiency and comparable analytical performance to a previous method was established.&#xD;
2.	The second project involved improvements to a previous work in which a multimode sample introduction system (MSIS) was modified by inserting a pre-evaporation tube between the MSIS and torch. The new work focused on applying an infrared heated ceramic rope for pre-evaporation. This research was conducted in all three MSIS modes (nebulisation mode, hydride generation mode, and dual mode) and on two different ICP-OES instruments, and comparisons were made between conventional setups in terms of sensitivity, detection limit, precision, and robustness. By tracking both hydride-forming and non-hydride forming elements, the effects of heating in combination with hydride generation were probed. Finally, optimal methods were validated by analysis of two certified reference materials. &#xD;
3.	A final project was completed in collaboration with ZincNyx Energy Solutions. This project sought to develop a method for the overall analysis of a 12 M KOH zincate fuel, which is used in green energy backup systems. By employing various techniques including flow injection analysis and standard additions, a final procedure was formulated for the verification of K concentration, as well as the measurement of additives (Al, Fe, Mg, In, Si), corrosion products (such C from COâÂ²Â¯), and Zn particles both in and filtered from solution. Furthermore, the effects of exposing the potassium zincate electrolyte fuel to air were assessed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rapid socioeconomic development in Saudi Arabia, as a result of oil revenues, has had profound effects on peopleâs lifestyles, including the transformation of peopleâs dietary habits. Such dietary transformations, known as the nutrition transition, are common in countries undergoing rapid socioeconomic changes. This transition is significant in Saudi Arabia as the traditional Saudi diet is considered a healthy one. Adoption of the Western diet has had negative health effects on the Saudi population, especially adolescents. As evidenced in many studies, adolescents are the most affected population when it comes to changes in dietary habits and physical activity. Adolescence is a vulnerable stage of life when dietary habits are developed, often lasting into adulthood, and may not be easily changed. In the case of Saudi Arabia, youth or adolescents represent almost 60% of the population; therefore, the eating habits they develop now could have profound consequences for population health in the future. To develop effective health promotion strategies, it is important to understand the sociocultural factors that influence the dietary habits and food choices of Saudi teens. I conducted two semi-structured, open-ended interviews, using photo-elicitation techniques, with 12 Saudi girls, aged 15-16 years. Analysis of the data shows four factors that pulled the participants toward eating home cooked traditional food and five factors that pushed participants away from eating home cooked traditional foods. The research suggests that despite the attractiveness of modern, Western ways of eating for Saudi teen girls, parents still play a key role in encouraging and supporting them to eat healthy food.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Power system policies are broadly on track to escalate the use of renewable energy resources in electric power generation. Integration of dispersed generation to the utility network not only intensifies the benefits of renewable generation but also introduces further advantages such as power quality enhancement and freedom of power generation for the consumers. However, issues arise from the integration of distributed generators to the existing utility grid are as significant as its benefits. The issues are aggravated as the number of grid-connected distributed generators increases. Therefore, power quality demands become stricter to ensure a safe and proper advancement towards the emerging smart grid. In this regard, system protection is the area that is highly affected as the grid-connected distributed generation share in electricity generation increases. Islanding detection, amongst all protection issues, is the most important concern for a power system with high penetration of distributed sources. Islanding occurs when a portion of the distribution network which includes one or more distributed generation units and local loads is disconnected from the remaining portion of the grid. Upon formation of a power island, it remains energized due to the presence of one or more distributed sources.&#xD;
This thesis introduces a new islanding detection technique based on an enhanced multi-layer scheme that shows superior performance over the existing techniques. It provides improved solutions for safety and protection of power systems and distributed sources that are capable of operating in grid-connected mode. The proposed active method offers negligible non-detection zone. It is applicable to micro-grids with a number of distributed generation sources without sacrificing the dynamic response of the system. In addition, the information obtained from the proposed scheme allows for smooth transition to stand-alone operation if required. The proposed technique paves the path towards a comprehensive protection solution for future power networks. The proposed method is converter-resident and all power conversion systems that are operating based on power electronics converters can benefit from this method. The theoretical analysis is presented, and extensive simulation results confirm the validity of the analytical work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the post-Enlightenment period, Anglo-American criminal law has been applied with increased force, and an ever expanding scope, to collective actors like corporations and other organizations.  Recent scholarship has focused on developing âtruly organizationalâ bases of liability that break with the conventional approach of imputing individual conduct to an organization and instead analyze culpable conduct and intent in a way that reflects the distinct and independent capacity of organizations to pursue their interests or goals collaboratively.  In 2004, Canada enacted amendments inspired by these ideas in the hope they would lead to more effective criminal enforcement against organizations. Twelve years later, however, the promise of Bill C-45 is largely unfulfilled.  In this thesis, I explore how much of this failure of law reform to deliver transformational change is attributable to an individualist bias that permeates how we think about what it means to be responsible and how this then shapes the responsibility ascription process.  Using an analytical framework that combines criminal law theory with selected aspects of rational-structural theory and organization culture, I suggest that a promising way forward may lie in reframing the essential qualities required to be a subject of the criminal law in a way that captures the unique attributes that make organizations different from individuals.  The resulting organizational concept of responsible agency allows for an integration of organizational reality into how we assess organizational culpability while keeping the ambit of criminal liability within the limits of what is practicable and fair.  This better aligns with the spirit of Bill C-45: to impose criminal liability in a way that takes organizations â and their crimes â seriously.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: Osteophytes are osteo-cartilaginous metaplastic tissue outgrowths of bone capped by cartilage usually found in degenerative and inflammatory joint disease. The presence and degree of maturity of osteophytes, along with joint space narrowing, are the main radiographic criteria for diagnosis and grading osteoarthritis (OA). Although osteophytes are known for being anatomic signs of advanced OA, they can occur in non-symptomatic joints, in joints with no other observable alterations, and in early stage OA. It remains unclear if they develop from molecular, physiological and/or mechanical stimuli. We hypothesized that mechanical strains play a role in osteophyte development. The overall objective of this thesis was to find evidence that osteophytes are influenced by mechanical strains. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: The first project was to develop a mechanically-induced osteophyte animal model. One single impact load that was reported to induce moderate joint damage was applied to the periosteum of the rat knee. Animals were sacrificed at four time points to characterize the evolution of damaged tissue and the joint by histology. A second study using human mature hip osteophytes was conducted to evaluate if mature osteophyte presented histological signs of proliferating and developmental processes. The histological characterization of mature osteophyte was used to compare findings of the mechanically-induced osteophyte in the animal model to validate the use of this rodent model in studying some aspect of osteophyte development of human. Lastly, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) radiological morphometric analysis was performed on microscopic computed tomography (ÂµCT) scanned femoral heads collected from total hip arthroplasty patients presenting mature hip osteophytes. Quantitative morphometric measures of osteophytes internal structure was compared to three regions of the femoral head of known quality of organisation and mechanical constraint.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Results and Conclusion: Osteophyte can be mechanically induced by a single load impact to the joint periosteum, indicating that a moderate trauma to the periosteal layer of the joint may play a role in osteophyte development. Mature osteophytes have proliferation, developing and remodelling zones and have trabecular structures. Mechanically-induced osteophytes and mature osteophytes presented similar histological composition. Mature osteophytes have organized internal structure. These results provide evidence that mechanical strain can influence osteophyte development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The question that I will explore in this research dissertation is whether one can defend the rights of homeland minorities as a progressive extension of the existing norms of human rights. This question calls for several deeper inquiries about the nature, the function and the underlying justifications for both human rights and minority rights. In particular, this research project will examine the following issues: on what normative grounds the available norms of human rights and minority rights are justified; if there is any methodic way to use the normative logic of human rights to support substantial forms of minority claims, such as the right to self-determination; whether human rights can take the form of group rights; and finally, whether there is any non-sectarian basis for justifying the minority norms, which can be acceptable from both liberal and non-liberal perspectives.&#xD;
This research project has some implications for both theories of minority rights and human rights. On the one hand, the research employs the topic of minority rights to shed light on deficiencies of the existing political theories of human rights. On the other hand, it uses the political theory to shed light on how existing theories of minority rights could be improved and amended. The inquiry will ultimately clarify how to judge the merit of the claim that minority rights are or should be a part of human rights norms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objectives of this thesis were to study specific Canadian populations in order to examine; (1) relationships between the neighbourhood-level social capital and injuries in youth, as well as (2) falls in older adults, and; (3) to address methodological issues relevant to the study of such relationships. &#xD;
The thesis is comprised of four manuscripts. The first addresses methodological issues surrounding the validation of neighbourhood-level variables for the study of adolescent health, and demonstrates the existence of structural confounding in the study of related etiological relationships. Informed by the latter, the second manuscript examines the association between neighbourhood-level social capital and injuries in youth, and demonstrates that lower levels of social capital are protective factors for girls but not for boys. &#xD;
Manuscript 3 uses an international database focused on older adults, and shows that our existing measure of social capital is valid at neighbourhood levels, but also that there is a high possibility for the existence of structural confounding among Canadian older adults. The fourth manuscript then examines the association between neighbourhood-level social capital and the occurrence of falls in older adults and determines that differences between neighbourhoods are important factors in the occurrence of falls, and that higher levels of social capital are a risk factor for falls. &#xD;
Taken together, results from this thesis provide a better understanding of the role of neighbourhood-level social capital on the occurrence of injuries in Canadian youth and on the occurrence of falls in older adults. Our contributions were important both methodologically and etiologically.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In modern power electronics equipment, it is desirable to design a low profile, high power density, and fast dynamic response converter. Increases in switching frequency reduce the size of the passive components such as transformers, inductors, and capacitors which results in compact size and less requirement for the energy storage. In addition, the fast dynamic response can be achieved by operating at high frequency. However, achieving high frequency operation while keeping the efficiency high, requires new advanced devices, higher performance magnetic components, and new circuit topology. These are required to absorb and utilize the parasitic components and also to mitigate the frequency dependent losses including switching loss, gating loss, and magnetic loss. Required performance improvements can be achieved through the use of Radio Frequency (RF) design techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
To reduce switching losses, resonant converter topologies like resonant RF amplifiers (inverters) combined with a rectifier are the effective solution to maintain high efficiency at high switching frequencies through using the techniques such as device parasitic absorption, Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS), Zero Current Switching (ZCS), and a resonant gating.  Gallium Nitride (GaN) device technologies are being broadly used in RF amplifiers due to their lower on- resistance and device capacitances compared with silicon (Si) devices. Therefore, this kind of semiconductor is well suited for high frequency power converters.&#xD;
&#xD;
The major problems involved with high frequency magnetics are skin and proximity effects, increased core and copper losses, unbalanced magnetic flux distribution generating localized hot spots, and reduced coupling coefficient. In order to eliminate the magnetic core losses which play a crucial role at higher operating frequencies, a coreless PCB transformer can be used. Compared to the conventional wire-wound transformer, a planar PCB transformer in which the windings are&#xD;
laid on the Printed Board Circuit (PCB) has a low profile structure, excellent thermal characteristics, and ease of manufacturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Therefore, the work in this thesis demonstrates the design and analysis of an isolated low profile class DE resonant converter operating at 10 MHz switching frequency with a nominal output of 150 W. The power stage consists of a class DE inverter using GaN devices along with a sinusoidal gate drive circuit on the primary side and a class DE rectifier on the secondary side. For obtaining the stringent height converter, isolation is provided by a 10-layered coreless PCB transformer of 1:20 turnâs ratio. It is designed and optimized using 3D Finite Element Method (FEM) tools and radio frequency (RF) circuit design software. Simulation and experimental results are presented for a 10-layered coreless PCB transformer operating in 10 MHz.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Process systems design, operation and synthesis problems under uncertainty can readily be formulated as two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear and nonlinear (nonconvex) programming (MILP and MINLP) problems. These problems, with a scenario based formulation, lead to large-scale MILPs/MINLPs that are well structured.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first part of the thesis proposes a new finitely convergent cross decomposition method (CD), where Benders decomposition (BD) and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD) are combined in a unified framework to improve the solution of scenario based two-stage stochastic MILPs. This method alternates between DWD iterations and BD iterations, where DWD restricted master problems and BD primal problems yield a sequence of upper bounds, and BD relaxed master problems yield a sequence of lower bounds. A variant of CD, which includes multiple columns per iteration of DW restricted master problem and multiple cuts per iteration of BD relaxed master problem, called multicolumn-multicut CD is then developed to improve solution time. Finally, an extended cross decomposition method (ECD) for solving two-stage stochastic programs with risk constraints is proposed. In this approach, a CD approach at the first level and DWD at a second level is used to solve the original problem to optimality. ECD has a computational advantage over a bilevel decomposition strategy or solving the monolith problem using an MILP solver.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second part of the thesis develops a joint decomposition approach combining Lagrangian decomposition (LD) and generalized Benders decomposition (GBD), to efficiently solve stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear nonconvex programming problems to global optimality, without the need for explicit branch and bound search. In this approach,&#xD;
LD subproblems and GBD subproblems are systematically solved in a single framework. The relaxed master problem obtained from the reformulation of the original problem, is solved only when necessary. A convexification of the relaxed master problem and a domain reduction procedure are integrated into the decomposition framework to improve solution efficiency. Using case studies taken from renewable resource and fossil-fuel based application in process systems engineering, it can be seen that these novel decomposition approaches have significant benefit over classical decomposition methods and state-of-the-art MILP/MINLP global optimization solvers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Heat management in mines is a growing issue as mines expand physically in size and depth and as the infrastructure grows that is required to maintain them.  Heat management is a concern as it relates to the health and safety of the workers as set by the regulations of governing bodies as well as the heat sensitive equipment that may be found throughout the mine workings.  &#xD;
&#xD;
In order to reduce the exposure of working in hot environments there are engineering and management systems that can monitor and control the environmental conditions within the mine.  The successful implementation of these methods can manage the downtime caused by heat stress environments, which can increase overall production.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis introduces an approach to monitoring and data based heat management.  A case study is presented with an in depth approach to data collection.  Data was collected for a period of up to and over one year. Continuous monitoring was conducted by equipment that was developed both commercially and within the mine site.  The monitoring instrumentation was used to assess the environmental conditions found within the study area.   Analysis of the data allowed for an engineering assessment of viable options in order to control and manage the environment heat stress.  An option is developed and presented which allows for the greatest impact on the heat stress conditions within the case study area and is economically viable for the mine site.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Because males and females of a species express many homologous traits, sex-specific selection on these traits can shift the opposite sex away from its phenotypic optimum. This mode of sexually antagonistic selection, known as intralocus sexual conflict (IaSC), arises when the evolution of sexual dimorphism is constrained by the two sexes sharing a common gene pool. As IaSC has been historically overlooked, many outstanding questions remain. For example, what is its contribution in maintaining genetic variation for fitness in populations? What characters underlie this variation in fitness? How does the selection history of the population influence the standing genetic variation? I used the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to attempt to resolve some of these questions. The first part of my Masterâs project involved assessing the detectability of sexually antagonistic alleles in populations at different stages of adaptation to the laboratory. For the second part of my Masterâs project, I looked for evidence of conflict during the development of body size, a well-known sexually dimorphic trait. While the first part of my thesis proved inconclusive, the second part revealed a surprising source of sexual conflict in pre-adult stages of D. melanogaster.</dcterms:abstract>
