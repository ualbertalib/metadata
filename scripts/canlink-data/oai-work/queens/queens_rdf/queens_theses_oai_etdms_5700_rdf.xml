      <dcterms:abstract>Mathematical models are developed for arborescent polyisobutylene (arbPIB) production in continuous-stirred-tank and semi-batch reactors. The objective of the research is to assess how reactor type influences final polymer properties and to use the new semi-batch model for parameter estimation with existing literature data. A multidimensional method-of-moments technique is used to predict number and weight-average molecular weights and branching levels. &#xD;
	The continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model developed is used to simulate arbPIB polymerization over a range of different residence times and inimer feed concentrations. It is shown that polydispersity and average branching level are higher for polymer produced in a CSTR compared to polymer produced in batch. It is also shown that operating a CSTR at long residence times and/or high inimer feed concentrations will result in an inability to reach steady-state operation due to the weight-average molecular weight increasing indefinitely. This range of instability for CSTR operation is larger for SCVCP than for inimer homopolymerization because of the relatively high apparent rate constant associated with the isobutylene comonomer reacting with an inimer branching agent. &#xD;
	In addition, a semi-batch model is developed that incorporates a material balance on Lewis-acid concentration. Lumped parameters (containing true rate constants and equilibrium constants) are estimated using literature batch and semi-batch data for arbPIB. Two attempts are made to fit these data by applying different mechanistic assumptions. Unfortunately, parameters estimated from these studies are unable to provide simulation results that accurately fit the experimental data. It is recommended that additional experimental data be collected at various reaction conditions, including replicate semi-batch data, before improved modeling assumptions are developed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many antiepileptic drugs on the market, including valproic acid (VPA), have a wide range of therapeutic effects in addition to treating epilepsy. In recent years, the use of VPA in the treatment of psychiatric conditions has been on the rise. However, studies have shown that in utero exposure to VPA can have detrimental effects on embryonic development. Specifically, in utero exposure to VPA has been associated with a higher risk of congenital heart defects. In spite of this, expectant mothers are advised to continue taking it throughout pregnancy to prevent seizures. One proposed mechanism of VPA-initiated teratogenicity is the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC), which is involved in the regulation of transcription factors associated with cardiogenesis. Myocyte enhancing factor 2C (Mef2c), a transcription factor involved in development of cardiac structure and cardiomyocyte differentiation, has been shown to increase in response to in utero VPA exposure. Furthermore, this increase in gene expression has been associated with contractile dysfunction and myocardial disorganization. To characterize the effects of VPA on murine heart development, pregnant CD-1 mice were dosed with 400 mg/kg of VPA on gestational day (GD) 9 and ultrasounds were performed on GD 14 to 18, prior to harvesting the fetal hearts on GD 19. Using high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) technology, we examined the effects of VPA on cardiac contractile function, followed by histology to evaluate the effects of VPA on myocardial organization and ventricular lumen diameter.  Lastly, we conducted qRT-PCR to measure the relative Mef2c gene expression in GD 16 murine hearts. Qualitative analysis of the murine hearts at GD 19 showed structural anomalies only in the hearts of VPA-treated mice. Additionally, our results showed a decrease in contractile ability of VPA-treated mice compared to the control group on GD 18 and an increase in both anterior and posterior myocardial wall contraction on GD 14 and GD 15. We did not find any effects of VPA on the gene expression of Mef2c. Together these results further characterize the effects of VPA on heart development and suggest that increased Mef2c gene expression, at least on GD 16, does not mediate VPA-induced cardiotoxicity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Preeclampsia (PE) is a common pregnancy complication and may result in fetal stress with lifelong consequences for cognition. Offspring cognitive alterations are associated with distorted neuroanatomy and cerebrovasculature. Although the pathophysiology is complex, reduced expression of pro-angiogenic factors may result in impaired fetal vascularization, altered brain structure and impaired cognition. In particular, low concentrations of placental growth factor (PGF) may alter neural development. Pgf -/- mice were used to interrogate the role of PGF in central nervous system vascularization, appropriate neuroanatomy and behaviour. Subsequently, Pgf -/- mice were used to investigate the postnatal period as a window for intervention. Pgf -/- mice were hypothesized to have impaired cerebrovascular development with permanent deviations of the cerebrovasculature, neuroanatomy and behaviour. Adult deficits were hypothesized to be correctable with an early postnatal PGF treatment. Whole-mount immunofluorescence of the brain and retina examined vascularization and circle of Willis connectivity. Micro-CT imaging visualized the entire cerebrovasculature in adult mice. Magnetic resonance imaging determined the volume of 62 unique structures in the adult mouse brain. Behavioural testing of adult mice examined spatial learning, object recognition, depressive-like behaviour and anxiety-like behaviour. As a postnatal treatment, recombinant PGF was administered to Pgf -/- mice from postnatal day 1-10 before examination of the cerebrovasculature, neuroanatomy and behaviour in adulthood. Pgf -/- mice exhibited delayed vascularization of the hindbrain, less connectivity of the circle of Willis and altered arteriovenous organization in the retina. In adulthood, more small-diameter cerebral vessels were present and 10/62 structures in the brain had smaller volume. On behavioural testing, Pgf -/- mice exhibited poorer performance on spatial learning tests but better performance on depressive-like behaviour and object recognition tests relative to Pgf +/+ controls. Postnatal PGF treatment altered adult neuroanatomy and behaviour but not the cerebrovasculature. In particular, treatment with 70 pg/g PGF partially corrected alterations seen in Pgf -/- mice. Overall, PGF is important for cerebrovascular development, adult neuroanatomy and cognitive behaviour in mice. PGF deficiency may be one factor in a PE-gestation that leads to altered offspring brain development. Finally, the postnatal period is a potential time for intervention in offspring after PE-impacted gestation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Decline is a real and protracted issue that has taken shape and form in different ways across Northern Ontario. While not all municipalities have been hit equally hard by the effects of industry flight, an aging population, and youth out-migration, the general trend is one of, at best, stagnation and slow growth. While the Province implemented the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario in 2011 to try and address these issues, it has been limited in its capacity to effect much change. The Growth Plan for Northern Ontario generally fails to address the needs and priorities of all communities, large or small, diversified economy or single-industry town. The smallest of the small feel left behind, while the largest municipalities are left wondering what the GPNO really does for them at all when the province fails to follow through on its promises or provide the resources to back up its policies.&#xD;
Following a comprehensive review of demographics, policy, case studies, and content and validation interviews, this report provides ten next step recommendations. These next steps are addressed to various levels of government and are not an exhaustive list of the various policies and initiatives that could be undertaken to address the issues of decline in Northern Ontario. However, what they do accomplish is presenting high-level directions for each level of government that prioritize local knowledge and decision-making. By empowering local communities, and listening so that they can be provided with the tools they know they need to succeed, provincial influence and investment can be applied in a much more directed and meaningful manner.&#xD;
This research presents ideas for how this can be realized, and hopefully inspires and initiates a conversation regarding how the implementation of these next step recommendations could benefit the North.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In my thesis, I investigate the career transitions of auditors. In the first study, I explore students’ experience going through the recruitment process in public accounting. I conducted 51 interviews with undergraduate students and I performed observations of 14 recruitment events in Canada, in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. At the theoretical level, my analysis builds on Bourdieu’s scholarship. I find that students’ construct the desire to work for Big Four firms, and learn to develop the proper habitus—a way of conducting oneself—and to convert their cultural capital into social capital—a network of relationships. However, several students expressed a sense of dissonance following the process because their expectations about the nature of the job and the lifestyle were not met. &#xD;
&#xD;
My second and third studies are based on 37 semi-structured interviews conducted with ex-auditors in Canada. In the second study, I investigate auditors’ exit from accounting firms and their identity reconstruction in a new position. My empirical analysis was guided by key insights from the literature on memory and auditors’ social identity. I find that ex-auditors, while remembering the wrong of the past, primarily about their treatment by the firms, also attempt to restore their professional self after leaving accounting firms. They reinvent a positive identity and a glorious period during which they forged invaluable connections, earned high recognition for their expertise, and became part of a professional elite.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the third study, I investigate former auditors’ enactment of their role of auditees. I use theories of expert knowledge and social capital. I find that auditees with a working experience in auditing influence auditors’ work by using three different strategies: 1) Setting the ground by filtering in advance the production of auditing information while bonding socially and emotionally with the audit team; 2) Training staff auditors by teaching them technical knowledge and developing coaching-style relationships; and 3) Regulating staff auditors’ professional judgments by questioning their opinions and monitoring their conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
Overall, my dissertation contributes to our understanding of three major themes in the accounting literature: auditors’ identity, auditors’ social capital and the commercialization of the profession.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Experimental modal testing using an impact hammer is a commonly used method for obtaining the modal parameters of any structure for which the vibrational behavior is of interest. Natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of the structure can be extracted directly from measured FRFs (Frequency Response Functions) through various curve fitting procedures. This thesis provides an overview of the modal testing conducted on various scaled aerospace components. These components are part of a half-scale model rear twin-engine mounted aircraft fuselage tail section which is being constructed in order to provide relevant vibrational and dynamic trends to a leading Canadian aerospace manufacturer. The experimental modal results were used to validate the associated computational modal data. It is this initial validation step which forms the foundation of the research project presented herein and which will allow for future modal testing work to be conducted on the half-scale assembly once completed. Testing set-up, experimental equipment and the methodology employed are all described in detail.  Furthermore, a series of validity checks were done by ensuring that the experimental results satisfy the requirements inherent to linear modal analysis including repeatability, reciprocity and linearity. This provided confidence in the employed testing procedure. Recorded natural frequencies (eigenvalues), mode shapes (eigenvectors), coherence plots and other important experimental data are presented along with notable trends. Finally, key literature has been referenced where appropriate and important concepts to modal analysis are expanded upon. This thesis, then, demonstrates that experimental modal analysis can be successfully implemented into a testing methodology that helps establish vibrational trends and, thus, better understand and help resolve vibro-acoustic issues on aircraft.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL16 gene is conserved throughout the Herpesviridae and the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) UL16 protein forms complex with another virus protein called UL21. Previous studies demonstrated that, unlike HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) UL21 was essential for virus propagation and the translocation of capsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm - a critical process in virus morphogenesis called nuclear egress. We hypothesized that if a UL16/UL21 complex were required for nuclear egress then HSV-2 lacking UL16 would have a similar phenotype as HSV-2 lacking UL21. Deletion of HSV-2 UL16 resulted in a 200 to 4,000-fold reduction in virus propagation, depending on the cell type, and like UL21, UL16 was critical for the nuclear egress of capsids.&#xD;
 Our findings related to HSV-2 UL16 were in stark contrast to what has been observed with UL16 mutants of HSV-1 and pseudorabies virus (PRV) where roughly 10-fold replication deficiencies were reported that were accompanied by defects in the secondary envelopment of cytoplasmic capsids. To resolve these discrepancies, multiple UL16 null mutants were constructed in different HSV strains and their phenotypes characterized side-by-side. This analysis showed that all the HSV-2 UL16 mutants had 50 to 100-fold replication deficiencies that were accompanied by defects in the nuclear egress of capsids as well as defects in the envelopment of cytoplasmic capsids. By contrast, most HSV-1 UL16 mutants had 10-fold replication deficiencies that were accompanied by defects in envelopment of cytoplasmic capsids. These findings indicated that UL16 has HSV species-specific functions. &#xD;
Nuclear egress requires the disruption of the nuclear lamina and proper localization of nuclear egress complex (NEC) components, UL31 and UL34. To investigate the requirements for UL16 and UL21 in nuclear egress we examined the disruption of the nuclear lamina and the localization of NEC in infected cells. Similar to UL21, UL16 was not involved in the disruption of nuclear lamina integrity. Interestingly, HSV-2 UL21 is required for proper localization of the NEC while UL16 is not, suggesting that UL16 and UL21 play distinct roles in the nuclear egress of HSV-2 capsids.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the big data era, big data frameworks play a vital role in storing and processing large amounts of data, providing significant improvements in performance and availability. Spark is one of the most popular big data frameworks, providing high scalability and fault-tolerance with its unique in-memory engine. To hide the complex settings from users, Spark has approximately 200 configurable parameters in the execution engine. Default values assigned to the parameters provide initial ease of use. However, the default values are not the best setting for all workloads. In this work, we propose a general tuning algorithm named QST, Queen’s Spark Tuning, to help users with tuning Spark and to improve overall performance. First of all, we study Spark performance for a variety of workloads and identify 9 tunable parameters among more than 200 parameters that have significant impact on performance. Then, we propose QST, a general greedy iterative tuning algorithm for our set of 9 key parameters. By classifying Spark workloads as memory-intensive, shuffle-intensive or all-intensive, QST configures the parameters for each type of workload. We perform an experimental evaluation of QST using benchmark workloads and industry workloads. In our experiments, using QST significantly improves Spark performance. Overall, using QST yields an average speedup of 65% for our benchmark evaluation workloads and 57% for our industry evaluation workloads.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Cardiac ischemia  accounts for approximately 50% of all cardiovascular-related deaths. Cardiac ischemia is associated with high incidence of QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypoxia is a common pathophysiological factor experienced during cardiac ischemia. Inflammation and leukocyte infiltration is also enhanced during ischemic insults. Additionally, the activation, upregulation and secretion of several different proteases occur during cardiac ischemia. The mechanisms surrounding ischemia-induced QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias are not fully understood. The aim of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ischemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. &#xD;
Dysfunction of cardiac ion channels is directly responsible for the generation of cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, loss of function of the potassium channel, hERG, leads to QT interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. The hERG potassium channel has also been suggested to be uniquely susceptible to extracellular proteases. Thus, we hypothesized that hERG dysfunction due to protease cleavage of the channel during cardiac ischemia plays a role in ischemia-induced QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. We observed that proteases selectively cleaved hERG/IKr extracellularly in the S5-pore linker of the channel. We demonstrated that glycosylation which occurs in the S5-pore linker of hERG, as well as the BeKm-1 scorpion toxin, which binds to the S5-pore linker of hERG, protects the channel from protease cleavage. To determine whether proteases upregulated, activated and secreted during cardiac ischemia affect hERG, coronary ligation of the circumflex artery was performed on a rabbit model. Among the proteases shown to be upregulated during ischemia, calpain-1, which was secreted to the extracellular milieu, cleaved hERG in the S5-pore linker. Consistent with a decrease in hERG function in ischemic conditions, a calpain-mediated reduction of hERG was also observed in hypoxic conditions. The effect was abrogated with the treatment of BeKm-1 and calpain inhibitors.&#xD;
In summary, proteases upregulated and secreted, cleave hERG during ischemic and hypoxic insults, which can be prevented with protease inhibitors and hERG targeting peptides. The present work extends our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie cardiovascular disease-related mortality while revealing potential preventative treatment options to combat ischemia-induced arrhythmogenesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For the last 20-30 years, new discovery of pharmacological treatment for psychiatric disorders has been stagnant despite a pressing need to find alternative therapies for patients that are treatment-resistant to the current medication. Neuropeptides are powerful modulators of neural activity that robustly influence a wide-range of behaviours. Notably, their expression profiles and subsequent function can be altered in some mental health illnesses such as anxiety disorders. However, neuropeptides are rarely studied in clinically relevant contexts. Consequently, there is currently a lack of understanding of how they may predict or contribute to certain pathological states. Pre-clinical models in rodents are useful tools to investigate this. The chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) is one model that mimics the every day stressors that can lead to pathologies in humans. Here, we hypothesize that neuropeptide modulation will be altered after male rats are exposed to CUS resulting in changes in behaviour. Specifically, we look at the effect of neuropeptides in the oval bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST), a brain area sensitive to energy homeostasis and the anticipation of aversive stressors. We found that endogenously released neuropeptides robustly modulate both excitatory and inhibitory transmission. Interestingly, CUS altered neuropeptides regulation of synaptic transmission whereby one neuropeptide (neurotensin (NT)) became the dominant modulator of inhibitory transmission. To investigate whether this had behavioural consequences, we pharmacologically blocked NT in the ovBNST and tested rats in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST). We observed changes only in exploratory behaviour in the CUS rats where blockage of NT increased time spent in the open arm suggesting a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour. Lastly, knowing that modulation of inhibitory transmission is specifically changed with CUS, we examined how neuropeptides may influence the main inhibitory inputs to the ovBNST: the central amygdala (CeA). We found that NT and dynorphin antagonistically modulate CeA-to-ovBNST inputs. Whether this modulation changes in different conditions or animal state remains elusive. Overall, multiple neuropeptides regulate the activity of ovBNST neurons that is dysregulated following a chronically stressful experience (i.e., CUS) but whether these changes observed are adaptive or maladaptive has yet to be determined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The scatter of the spatially-resolved star formation main sequence (SFMS) is investigated in order to reveal signatures about processes of galaxy formation and evolution. We have assembled a sample of 355 nearby galaxies with spatially-resolved Hα and mid-infrared fluxes from the Survey for Ionized Neutral Gas in Galaxies and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, respectively. We examine the impact of various star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass transformations on the observed SFMS. Ranging from 10^6 to 10^11.5 M⊙ and derived from colour to mass-to-light ratio methods for mid-infrared bands, the stellar masses are internally consistent within their range of applicability, given the systematic errors inherent to such transformations; a constant mass-to-light ratio (M∗/L_3.4μm = 0.5) also yields representative stellar masses. The various SFR estimates show intrinsic differences and produce noticeable vertical shifts in the SFMS, depending on the timescales and physics encompassed by the corresponding star formation tracer. SFR estimates appear to break down on physical scales below 500 pc. We examine the various sources of scatter in the spatially- resolved SFMS and find that morphology plays little or no role. We identify three unique tracks across the spatially-resolved SFMS by individual galaxies, demarcated by a critical stellar mass of log( M∗/ M⊙)∼8.5. Below this scale, the spatially-resolved SFMS shows no clear trend and is likely driven by local, stochastic internal processes. Above this scale, galaxies have comparable spatially-resolved SFMS slopes but exhibit two different behaviours, likely resulting from the mass accretion rate and/or quenching at the center of the galaxy. The effect of a bulge or AGN on these types must be considered. Additionally, we contrast these observational results with the study of 58 galaxy simulations by the NIHAO (Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects) project. We uncover the three unique tracks also in simulations, though they are not as prominent. While the local simulated SFMS matches observations fairly well, some of our more detailed comparisons point to deficiencies in the underlying physics that regulate the evolution of NIHAO galaxies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Adeno associated virus (AAV) is proving to be a powerful tool for gene therapy. However, a drawback of this tool reported in experimental studies is that a small percentage of the administered virus can integrate into host deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences, sometimes resulting in oncogenesis. Suicide gene therapy (SGT), a strategy for the gene-directed killing of cells, is one of the approaches that could be well utilized to augment existing gene therapies by providing a safety element in the event of tumor development. This technique has not been used in AAV based gene therapy experiments. One of the successful SGT systems utilizes Herpes Simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSVtk) which confers ganciclovir (GCV) sensitivity to the transduced cells. We hypothesized that placing HSVtk/GCV under the control of the HSP70 (Heat Shock Protein 70) promoter will results in apoptosis of HSVtk expressing cells, only when heat is applied.&#xD;
	We developed a dual promoter-transgene AAV viral construct (AAV-70-tk-CAG-GFP) carrying an inducible HSP70 promoter for the expression of HSVtk and chicken β-actin (CAG) (a ubiquitous promoter), driving green fluorescent protein (GFP). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) were stably transfected with the study plasmid and analyzed for protein expression. The experimental and control cells were exposed to normal (37°C) and high temperature (41°C) to measure cell survival at different concentrations of GCV.&#xD;
	The survival of stably transfected cells was markedly reduced with GCV treatment at 41°C, compared to untransfected HEK 293 cells. However, an unexpected decrease in cell survival was also noted at 37°C, indicating the promoter was also active at normal temperature. In summary, our experiment was the first step to test cell killing with SGT under the control of an inducible promoter in an AAV construct. The results showed cell killing both at high and normal temperatures. This provides a preface for future research exploring HSP70 induction physiology and use of other inducible promoters in the HSVtk/GCV suicide gene system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A superhydrophobic (SH) surface is characterized by a water contact angle of &gt;150 and a sliding angle &lt;10. The water fearing properties result from significantly stronger cohesive forces of the resting liquid compared to weak adhesive forces with the surface material. Microfluidics is a discipline in which minute liquid volumes (10–9 to 10–18 litres) are actuated, mixed, merged, split, and/or analyzed on uniquely engineered devices. SH surfaces have aided digital microfluidics by facilitating magnetic actuation of droplets and the spontaneous formation of droplet microarrays. SH surfaces offer low friction between a liquid droplet and the surface itself, allowing for actuation using minimal force. Magnetically susceptible material (paramagnetic salts or superparamagnetic particles) can be added to the droplet, making it possible to manipulate the liquid droplet with an external magnetic field. &#xD;
This thesis focuses on the magnetic actuation performance of aqueous droplets on different SH coatings including Ultra-Ever Dry, (a commercial coating), fluorine-containing and more environmentally friendly “fluorine-free” SH porous polymer monolith (PPM). Droplet kinematic parameters are explored (e.g. volume, acceleration/deceleration, particle concentration etc.) SH surfaces can be patterned with hydrophilic regions to create surface energy traps (SETs). In this way, the liquid can be pinned to the SETs for small volume deposition and droplet anchoring, respectively. We utilize the contrasting wetting behavior to conduct a droplet-based quantitative DNA assay using fluorescence detection. Furthermore, we examine the use of patterned hydrophobic PPM surfaces to conduct an ice recrystallization inhibition assay that allows the side-by-side comparison of up to a dozen samples treated in an identical, higher throughput manner. A novel method of droplet manipulation is explored termed biologically-driven magnetic actuation (BDMA), which uses magnetotactic bacteria (MTB). BMDA is used to transport droplets along various trajectories (e.g. square and eight-shaped tracks). We further demonstrate the use of BMDA for sequential merging and mixing of multiple droplets. SH surfaces are typically limited to aqueous droplet manipulation.	Alternatively, slippery liquid-infused porous (SLIPS) surfaces have been shown to exhibit low friction for both organic and aqueous droplets. We demonstrate the magnetic actuation of aqueous and organic (hexadecane) droplets on SLIPS using paramagnetic particles. The sixth chapter of the thesis demonstrates the proof of principal application involving functionalized superparamagnetic particles for the extraction of asphaltenes from crude oil on omniphobic surfaces. This thesis successfully explains different ways (super)hydrophobic and SLIPS surfaces can be used for performing different DMF operations on aqueous and organic droplets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The growing use of the Internet in community planning has created enormous opportunities to improve community participation in Indigenous planning, overcome constraints associated with face-to-face based participation, and enhance the planning process. Understanding some of the potential barriers and challenges unique to using online participation is a critical step in moving towards establishing new best practices in Aboriginal community development across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
The study was guided by a fundamental question: “How are First Nations communities using online tools to enable residents to more actively participate in the planning of their community?” The following are more specific research objectives set in the study: (a) to examine, through an extensive review of the relevant literature, the role that on-line tools can play in facilitating greater participation of First Nations residents in their community development; (b) to explore the various aspects of ICT that are relevant within the context of Indigenous land use planning; (c) to assess, through an examination of five case studies, the extent to which on-line tools are currently being utilized by First Nation residents in planning their communities; and (d) to suggest how on-line tools can be improved to enable First Nations residents to more actively participate in the planning of their community. Case studies included: Fort Severn First Nation, Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, Whitefish River First Nation, and Shawanaga First Nation, all in Ontario; as well as Nak'azdli Whut'en First Nation in British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
A working conceptual framework was developed to explore the role that ICT plays in planning in First Nations communities. In addition, challenges and opportunities associated with an evident “digital divide” (the economic and social inequality with regards to access to and use of ICT) was identified between First Nations and other communities in Canada, providing further constraints to the Indigenous planning process. Findings from the study show clear evidence that ICT played a positive role in enabling citizen participation in public engagement. However, it was found that First Nations residents were not fully involved in the decision-making process and were not fully empowered in making any final decisions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful diagnostic and research tool, used extensively in diagnoses of brain diseases, musculoskeletal disorders or damage, and an- giography. A persistent issue with MRI machines is inadequate vibration isolation. The vibration isolation issue is two-faceted. First, the scanner produces significant noise and vibrations during operation which, when transmitted to the machines environment, have negative repercussions such as the production of acoustic noise. Second, any motion of the scanner due to environmental factors will produce noise in the image, thereby limiting the resolution that can be achieved by the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
The objective of the present work is to implement passive vibration isolation in the base structure of a prototype MRI scanner. The first step to accomplishing this is the creation and validation of a finite element (FE) model of the MRI base, which requires computational and experimental modal analysis. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of a model of the MRI base up to 600 Hz were calculated computationally using ANSYS and experimentally with a shaker modal test. Seven mode pairs were visually correlated between experimental and computational data. Thus far, subjectively good correlation has been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
Following this, the model is used to simulate isolator performance in conjunction with further experimental testing of vibration isolator alternatives. A small scale test of the pneumatic isolator demonstrates that the specific isolator type performs well under the MRI loading conditions, and establishes a testing protocol for future testing. Furthermore, on-site testing that compares the performance of the full-sized pneumatic isolator installed on a scanner against a scanner mounted on aluminium blocks. The isolators were found to perform well, but do not meet the design requirements. Lastly, the pneumatic isolators are modelled in ANSYS to evaluate their performance in the worst case scenario (isolator resonance). A Matlab script and the ANSYS model are used in conjunction to calculate optimal stiffness and damping coefficients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A key challenge to the wide-scale implementation of photovoltaic solar panels (PV) in cold and remote areas, is dealing with the effects of snow and ice buildup on the panel surfaces. However there currently is no practical mechanism to remove snow-cover from PV surfaces and long shut-down periods occur for plant operators. The objective of this study is to evaluate different types of heating snow removal systems for PV modules and to present methodologies and tools to improve PV systems modelling and output prediction.&#xD;
A numerical model is presented to predict thermal snow removal from a PV panel. The model can predict snow melting or snow sliding from horizontal and inclined panels. A set of experiments was conducted using a small-scale PV panel in a freezer to provide a correlation for snow sliding from the panel. The correlation was implemented in the model to predict snow sliding situations. &#xD;
To validate the model and study thermal snow removal from a full scale PV panel, outdoor tests were conducted under natural conditions including different snowfall conditions. Two heating methods were investigated: embedding an electrical resistance heater to the back of the panel and imposing a reverse current through the solar cells. The results showed that ice dam and icicles formation at the bottom of the panel prevented the snow cover from sliding off the panel. In addition, the effect of heating the entire panel surface or partially heating the panel was investigated. &#xD;
An insulation equipped with a venting channel were proposed to use for the PV panels. This insulation improves the performance of snow removal from the panels, while having a minimum effect on the panel performance during a regular sunny day. To enhance the snow removal from the panel, the vents would be closed while opening the vents enhance the heat transfer from the panel during a sunny day. Radiation heat transfer between the panel and the insulation was also improved by coating the insulation. Outdoor tests were conducted under natural condition to study the performance of the proposed insulation during hot summer days. In terms of panel temperature and power output, the results showed promising improvement compared to using a single insulation without any modifications and especially without vents. &#xD;
Finally, it was proposed to remove snow from photovoltaic-thermal panels (PV/T) by circulating hot fluid through the back of a panel. Conducting outdoor tests revealed that this method can clean the panel from snow in a short period of time. The experimental results were compared with the results given by the numerical model presented in this study. To compare the required energy for snow removal with the amount of energy generated by the panel after snow removal during a day, a non-dimensional number was proposed. Using this number and conducting a case study showed that this snow removal method can be beneficial for the PV and PV/T systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Seniors represent the fastest growing demographic in Canada. Internationally, it is projected that the world’s senior population will continue to increase over the next several decades. Thus, more research is needed in order to better understand the specific needs and motives of this important age group. The present research documents how the concept of time influences the thoughts, preferences, and behavioral intentions of older and younger adults. Study 1 reported that older adults devoted significantly more attention towards the present compared to the past and future, while younger adults showed a small preference towards the future. Moreover, older adults’ reduced sense of time remaining in life led to them devoting less time to the future. Surprisingly, sense of time remaining in life also significantly suppressed the relationship between age and present temporal focus. That is, an increased sense of time remaining in life was actually associated with more present focus among seniors. Study 2 investigated the downstream consequences of temporal focus by examining older and younger adults’ motivation for present- and future-focused jobs in the organizational behavior context. Findings revealed that older adults showed a distinct preference for present-focused job opportunities over future-focused ones, whereas younger individuals reported the opposite pattern. In Studies 3 and 4, we moved beyond mental investment in different temporal periods and examined how older and younger adults’ views towards the past and the future influenced their preferences and choices in a consumer behavior context. Results from Study 3 indicated that older adults responded more favorably to persuasive advertisements presented with a past focus compared to future-focused and control ads (i.e., no temporal focus), while younger adults actually rated the control ads higher than both the past- and future-focused ones. Furthermore, positive general views of the past mediated the relationship between age and preferences past-focused advertisements. Finally, Study 4 reported that the findings observed in Study 3 were associated with overt differences in behavioral intentions within a hypothetical purchasing scenario. Specifically, older adults opted for a past-focused product more frequently (68%) than a future-focused product (32%), with younger adults showing no distinct pattern in their choices.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: This study examined the association between established colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factors and LINE-1 DNA methylation in healthy colon tissue, and whether genes involved in one-carbon metabolism modify relationships between established CRC risk factors and LINE-1 DNA methylation. This study was undertaken in order to inform on the role of LINE-1 DNA methylation as a mechanism by which established risk factors may lead to carcinogenesis. Reduced LINE-1 DNA methylation and one-carbon metabolism-related gene variants are both shown to increase CRC risk. Exposures related to LINE-1 DNA methylation may have a greater effect on methylation levels for individuals already susceptible to reduced methylation due to possession of a genetic variant. When considered together, these effects may impact methylation patterns in individuals beyond what would be expected if effects were purely additive. &#xD;
Methods: The study population consisted of 317 individuals scheduled for a routine colonoscopy. Multivariable linear regression was used to study the associations of alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption with LINE-1 DNA methylation. Product terms between MTHFR 677C&gt;T (rs1801133), MTR 2756A&gt;G (rs1805087), and MTRR 66A&gt;G (rs1801394) genotypes and exposures of interest were used to examine effect modification by genotype. &#xD;
Results: There were no statistically significant relationships observed between each risk factor of interest and LINE-1 DNA methylation. Statistically significant interactions between alcohol consumption and MTHFR and MTR genotypes were observed (p-value interaction=0.009, 0.003) in relation to LINE-1 DNA methylation. &#xD;
Conclusion: This thesis presents novel results on the relationships between a comprehensive set of CRC risk factors and LINE-1 DNA methylation in healthy colon tissue. We observed significant interactions by gene variants in the relationships between CRC risk factors and LINE-1 DNA methylation in the healthy colon. Although effects were not consistently in hypothesized directions, they suggest that one-carbon metabolism-related gene status is an important effect modifier in the relationship between alcohol consumption and LINE-1 DNA methylation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Drawing on ten interviews, this thesis explores the perspectives and practices of women with breast cancer in contemporary Turkey. My analysis focuses on two key areas: the gendered nature of intimate and family relationships, embodiment, and work during the breast cancer experience; and the formation of new patient identities as the Turkish breast cancer “regime” shifted from the 1990s/early 2000s to the 2010s. My overall argument in this thesis is that the maintenance of a normative gender identity, “staying a woman”, and the navigation of a changing healthcare system, “becoming a patient,” play a crucial role in how women experience breast cancer in a neoliberal environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Preeclampsia (PE), a hypertensive complication of pregnancy, is one of the leading causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The etiology of PE is not well-understood, however it is widely accepted to occur in two stages: poor uteroplacental perfusion and placental ischemia, which subsequently leads to a systemic maternal inflammatory response and multi-organ effects. Although cigarette smoking during pregnancy is known to cause aberrant placental development and adverse pregnancy outcomes, smoking reduces the risk of PE by 33% in a dose-dependent manner. The same risk reduction does not hold true for users of smokeless tobacco products. This has lead to the notion that carbon monoxide (CO), one of the byproducts of cigarette combustion, may confer this decrease in PE risk. Endogenously, CO is produced through the degradation of heme by heme oxygenase (HO), and it has been suggested that modulation of the HO/CO system may attenuate the development or progression of PE. &#xD;
The studies presented herein demonstrate that low doses of CO, delivered through gaseous CO or CO donor molecules, may exhibit physiological benefits and have therapeutic potential during complicated pregnancies. Firstly, the challenges associated with reproducing the AdsFlt-1-induced mouse model of PE for studying the effects of CO in complicated pregnancies were investigated. Clinically, inhaled CO was shown to moderately increase biological CO above endogenous levels, and increase vascular responses in the cutaneous microvasculature. In mice, it is demonstrated that the CO-releasing molecule (CORM-A1) is able to transiently increase biological CO levels. CORM-A1 delivered in mid-gestation, resulted in increased CO, without adverse maternal or fetal effects, indicating the potential for CORM-A1 as a novel method to deliver CO during pregnancy. Collectively, the data presented in this thesis verify that low dose CO may have therapeutic properties to improve endothelial dysfunction, increase placental perfusion, and reduce progression of the clinical signs of PE.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Animal rights have become a mainstream part of philosophy since the 1970s, but liminal animals are still ignored by most animal studies scholars. Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka address the rights of liminal animals in Zoopolis assigning denizenship to them as they are considered to be neither wild (sovereignty) nor domesticated (citizenship). The problem with their approach is that they address the possibility for liminal animals to become citizens without explaining how this can happen. Combining Kendra Coulter’s care work approach with Karl Marx’s definition of production labour I argue that liminal animals are entitled to labour rights under certain circumstances. The strength of acknowledging that liminal animals can acquire labour rights is that their contribution to a community becomes formally acknowledged and protected, which I argue to be a possibility for a liminal animal to become a citizen.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives. Canadian military and Veteran family life is characterized by frequent relocation, regular familial separation due to training or deployment, and living with the risk of injury or death of a military family member. Most Canadian health care providers lack knowledge and skills to address these issues. Therefore, the purpose of the thesis was to develop and validate a cultural competency model for health care providers working with military and Veteran families. &#xD;
Methods. The thesis consisted of three phases. Phase One was a scoping review of health care literature to identify commonalities in the content, structure, and development of cultural competency models. Phase Two used competency framework development methodology to create a military and Veteran family model and framework. Data collection included interviews with military and Veteran family members (n=17) and health care providers (n=9). In Phase Three, a validation study was conducted of the proposed model using focus groups and interviews with military subject matter experts (n=12) and health care providers (n=8). &#xD;
Results. Based on population-specific data, the Military and Veteran Family Cultural Competency Model and framework was created that includes 24 cultural competencies articulated across four cultural competency domains. &#xD;
Conclusion. The thesis has identified and validated cultural competencies for health care providers working with military and Veteran families within the Canadian health care landscape. This validated model may help inform health provider education and professional development programs to increase awareness, knowledge, and skills to enhance the health experiences and health outcomes of military and Veteran families.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pyrometallurgy is not the most sustainable option for enargite concentrate treatment due to the environmental limitations on arsenic release. Therefore, developing an effective hydrometallurgical process is a promising solution for enargite treatment. Most hydrometallurgical processes proposed in literature have not reached commercial utilization because of common issues such as slow dissolution rate of the mineral, incomplete copper or precious metals recovery, sulfate generation, arsenic fixation problems, and high capital and operating costs. &#xD;
In this thesis, the atmospheric leaching of enargite in chloride media was investigated in the presence of activated carbon (AC) and AF 5, a novel carbon based catalyst. Both catalysts were found to be very effective in facilitating the enargite leaching process and improved the oxidation and copper recovery from 65% to 92% (AC) or 96% (AF 5) after 96 hours. The best leaching condition was found to be: ferric and cupric concentrations greater than 5 g/L, concentrate to catalyst mass ratio of 1:2, and a 90 °C working temperature or higher. The elemental sulfur product of the leach reaction did not coat the surface of the partially leached mineral particles. When AF 5 was used as the catalyst in the leaching process, it collected the generated elemental sulfur. The arsenic also precipitated in the form of scorodite, one of the most stable forms of arsenic, during the leaching in chloride media at temperatures higher than 80 °C. The catalytic properties of the carbon-base catalysts (CBC) was due to the oxidation via oxygen functional groups on their surfaces, which were detected by XPS analysis. &#xD;
The results showed that the chemical pre-treatment of CBC can be effective in increasing its catalytic effect on enargite leaching. The comparison between the chloride and sulfate media showed that the sulfate media has better copper and iron dissolution kinetics and promotes sulfur collection, whereas the remediation of arsenic in the form of scorodite can be superior in chloride media.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Calpains are a family of calcium activated cysteine proteases. Calpain-1 and calpain-2 are obligate heterodimers composed of isoform specific catalytic subunits (encoded by capn1 and capn2, respectively) coupled with the common, shared regulatory subunit calpain small subunit 1 (encoded by capns1). Here, we report a role for these calpains in promoting spontaneous tumor onset in a model of human HER2+ breast cancer, as well as a requirement for these calpains for tumor viability in an orthotopic engraftment model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockout of capns1 correlated with enhanced sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, and sustained MAPK signaling in response to EGF. In a model of triple-negative breast cancer we demonstrate that CRISPR/CAS9-mediated knockout of calpain-1 (capn1) or calpain-2 (capn2) independently attenuated metastatic colonization in vivo, and that knockout of either isoform was associated with attenuated production of MMP-9. Collectively, our results suggest a pro-tumorigenic role for calpain-1/2 in both HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer, which provides preclinical evidence in support of combining calpain inhibitors with commonly used therapeutic drugs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In Lake Ontario, Alewife are the primary prey for salmonids, which provide a popular and socio-economically important recreational fishery. There is concern with regards to whether the Alewife population has the ability to support the predatory demand in Lake Ontario after a crash in the Alewife and predator populations occurred in Lake Michigan. To avoid such a crash, it is imperative that agencies working on Lake Ontario have accurate methods of assessing fish populations. Mobile hydroacoustic surveys of the lake began in 1991 as a method to assess the Alewife population, however, there is growing concern about the accuracy of these estimates. Fish in hydroacoustic surveys can appear to be smaller when oriented off-axis, as is common with fish displaying boat avoidance behaviour. The mobile assessment estimates are made using size thresholds to classify targets in the survey and Alewife which are diving may be appearing too small to be correctly classified. Using information from mobile, as well as stationary up-looking surveys, this study assesses how Alewife react to the survey vessel, and how the reactions may be impacting their observed target strength. The results indicate that Alewife are observed at smaller sizes in the mobile survey than would be expected. The mobile survey observed fish at deeper depths and the behaviour of the fish was indicative of boat avoidance. Fish from the mobile survey swam faster and more linearly than fish from the stationary survey. Consecutive targets in tracks from the mobile survey also increased in depth with a more negative track tilt. There were no strong predictors of changes in target strength tested with linear models which could be used as correction factors in the current dataset. In future studies, analysis of variables such as the true orientation of the fish may provide appropriate correction factors for this type of data. The current survey approach provides a valuable index of “relative” Alewife abundance from year to year, however, additional research will be required to provide more accurate estimates of the absolute abundance of Alewife in Lake Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis mainly concerns: (1) developing new borylation strategies for heterocycles through addition of a B-E σ bond (E = H, N) across internal alkynes; (2) synthesizing BODIPY derivatives with interesting properties via “pre-functionalization” strategy; (3) preparing boron-based stimuli-responsive compounds for fluoride sensing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The hydroboration of alkynes is known to proceed in a cis-fashion. Catalytic trans-hydroboration has been established in the past decade while catalyst-free trans-hydroboration was unknown. In the study of hydroboration reactions, an unexpected pyridine-directed trans-hydroboration of internal alkynes was disclosed and presented. This transformation could serve as a facile method to construct novel luminescent N,C-chelate organoboron compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the study of the amine directed hydroboration reaction, a facile dehydrogenative coupling between alkynyl aryl amines and 9-BBN was discovered. Based on the dehydrogenated products, a catalytic trans-aminoboration of internal alkynes was designed to give borylated indole derivatives. The reaction scope to different boranes and anilines was surveyed to generate a variety of borylated indoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
The dehydrogenative coupling of arylamines with 9-BBN described above represents a convenient method to construct a B-N covalent bond. By switching 9-BBN to monosubstituted boranes, a family of novel azaborabenzofulvenes was obtained by exploiting sequential dehydrogenative hydroboration of alkynyl arylamines. Both the reaction scope and the properties of the products were studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
Boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) and derivatives are excellent luminophores with bright emission in dilute solutions. However, they are rarely emissive in the solid state. In chapter 5, several spiro-BODIPYs with the “pre-functionalization” strategy were prepared. The spiro-structure successfully precludes the formation of π-stacking and leads to efficient solid state emissions. More interestingly, the spiro-BODIPYs formed J-aggregates in methanol-water mixed solvents.&#xD;
&#xD;
With the same strategy, a ferrocene functionalized BODIPY featuring direct Fc-B bond was prepared. Detailed studies on the novel compound and its analogues indicate the importance of ferrocenyl substituents and the bridge on their excited-state properties of BODIPY molecules. &#xD;
&#xD;
Trivalent organoboranes have been explored as fluoride sensors by monitoring fluorescence change, which is inconvenient in practical applications. In chapter 7, a family of boron functionalized poly-ferrocene compounds were prepared and some of these molecules can be used for colorimetric fluoride sensing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this thesis was to study quadrupolar nuclei using solid-state 17O NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and computational methods. This thesis reports the successful synthesis and characterization of three 17O-labelled epoxides, [17O]-(2S*,3S*)-2,3-bis(4-nitrophenyl)oxirane, [17O]-(2S*,3R*)-2,3-bis(4-nitrophenyl)oxirane, and [17O]-2,2,3-triphenyloxirane. The 17O NMR tensors (measured using solid-state 17O NMR spectroscopy and calculated using computational methods) and structural parameters (measured using single crystal X-ray crystallography and calculated using computational methods) of the three epoxides were compared. The dependence of ethereal 17O NMR tensors on bond geometry was computationally analyzed. A new model for visualizing quadrupolar coupling tensor components using valence p-orbital population anisotropies was also developed. This model is a simple adaption to the Townes-Dailey method that allows for the visualization of each quadrupolar coupling tensor component (χii ii = xx, yy, zz) using only a single parameter (ΔPii), whereas the traditional Townes-Dailey method requires three parameters. This new model was demonstrated to deliver comparable quadrupolar coupling tensor components to those calculated using direct g09 NMR calculation methods for 14N, 17O, and 127I. Finally, iodosylbenzene, a candidate for containing the strongest halogen bonds, was studied using solid-state 17O NMR and computational methods. Using computational methods, its σ-hole was quantified and its magnitude was compared to that of other halogen bond donors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The way children move over the entire 24-hour day influences their health. The purpose of this study was to determine which intensities, patterns, and types of 24-hour movement behaviours are most strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors among children. Methods: A total of 369 children aged 10-13 years were studied. Participants wore an Actical accelerometer, a Garmin Forerunner 220 GPS logger, and completed an activity and sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Data from these instruments were combined to estimate the average minutes/day spent in 14 intensities, 11 types, and 14 patterns of movement while sleeping and engaging in sedentary behaviour and physical activity. Body mass index, resting heart rate, and systolic blood pressure values were combined to create a cardiometabolic risk factor score. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to examine associations between the 39 movement behaviour characteristics and the cardiometabolic risk factor score. The variable importance in projection (VIP) values were used to determine and rank important movement behaviour characteristics. There was evidence of interaction by biological maturity and analyses were therefore conducted separately in the 50% least and 50% most mature participants. Results: For the least biologically mature participants, 15 of the 39 movement behaviour characteristics had important VIP value scores; eight of these reflected movement intensities (particularly moderate and vigorous intensities), six reflected movement patterns, and one reflected a movement type. For the most biologically mature participants, 13 of the 39 movement behaviour characteristics had important VIP value scores, with five reflecting intensities (particularly moderate and vigorous intensities), five reflecting patterns, and three reflecting types of movement. Conclusion: These findings suggest several different movement behaviour characteristics are associated with children’s cardiometabolic health. Time spent in movement intensities within the moderate and vigorous intensity ranges appear to be the most important movement behaviour characteristics for cardiometabolic risk factors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Deterioration and rehabilitation impacts on buried infrastructure were explored using experimental methods. Deterioration studies included the effects of erosion voids (in the immediate backfill) on steel and reinforced concrete pipe behaviour. Additionally, the voids were rehabilitated using simple trenchless solutions and the impact on pipe capacity was explored. Furthermore, rehabilitation is also commonly performed on access structures (i.e. maintenance holes) to restrict leaks rather than restore structural capacity; and this ability of the repaired system to sustain further leaks was also explored.&#xD;
A corroded steel pipe buried with an erosion void simulated on one side, was tested under simulated service loads. This revealed that the void appeared to compromise the stability of the structure. Rehabilitation of the culvert with a high density polyethylene slip liner and a low density, low strength grout lowered the strains in the host pipe. Strains measured before 300 kN applied load suggests that the grout had not fractured, and the steel pipe, liner, and grout responded as a composite system. After 300 kN, the grout appeared to fracture, and the strains in the steel pipe and liner accelerated with applied load.&#xD;
The impact of erosion voids and rehabilitated voids (filled with low strength, low density grout), of varying sizes, on the live load responses of reinforced concrete pipes were also studied. The changing pipe responses were quantified using modified bedding factors (Bf). Erosion voids increased the overall pipe bending moments, especially at the invert; grouting both the larger and smaller voids reduced the increases in invert moment.&#xD;
For sprayed liners installed within maintenance holes, the primary loads result from groundwater infiltration. Testing protocols and equipment were developed to monitor leakage resistance of the sprayed liners, simulating different sized areas with poor bond between the liner and the substrate. For the specific liner system investigated, circular zones with poor bond resulted in water loss after ‘peeling’ failure (water pressure acted to lift the circular zone with poor bond off the substrate around its circumference). The peeling per unit circumference was found to be a constant, independent of the diameter of the circular area with poor bond.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Hippocratic Oath was written in the fourth or fifth century BCE and was an esoteric document until hundreds of years after its creation. Physicians were not required to be familiar with this document in the ancient world, and its prominence in later history was mainly due to its association with Hippocrates, though the famous doctor is likely not its author. The document was adopted in the medieval and renaissance periods, however, and adapted to conform to Christian ideals that physicians were expected to abide by. In present-day society the oath has been used in legal trials such as Roe versus Wade, and continues to be used by many pro-life associations to argue that abortion should not be permitted under any circumstances. It is the purpose of this essay to examine the oath’s stance on abortion in the context in which it was written, to reinforce the fact that it largely disagreed with moral and medical standards which existed prior to the rise of Christianity. This is demonstrated through an examination of the use of the oath by physicians in antiquity as well as the medieval period, changing moral and religious concerns with induced miscarriage, and laws associated with abortion throughout the procedure’s history in relation to changing cultural norms. Though the intended meaning of the line in question may be uncertain, it is clear that abortion was an accepted procedure in medical circles in antiquity, and that the adoption and use of the Hippocratic Oath to advance pro-life argumentation was aided by changing social, moral, medical, and religious beliefs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Processing large graphs provides invaluable insights for the industry and research alike. The applications range from e-commerce, web, and social networking to analyzing gene expressions and cellular signaling. While numerous graph processing solutions have been developed with the capability to process graphs at the scale of a trillion edges, the ability to maintain and process a real-time graph still far from being handled. Processing data streams in real-time requires the graph to change over time which introduces several new challenges. First, the graph needs to be updated from the data stream efficiently. At the same time, applying these changes should not add an unacceptable overhead to graph queries. In addition, these changes need to be reflected in the new analytical insights, otherwise the value of the insights degrades with time.&#xD;
In this work, we investigated the problem of dynamic graph processing over data streams. We started by studying the feasibility of maintaining a dynamic graph on top of Apache Spark, a data processing engine. The chosen solutions included RDDs, IndexedRDDs, and Redis. Results from our experimental indicated that Redis performed the best, and thus we concluded that storing the graph in an external big data store besides Spark is the best approach in terms of performance and practicality. After that, we designed and developed Sprouter, a streaming data analytics framework which utilizes Apache Spark for dynamic graph processing. The framework enables storing enormous graph data, allows real-time graph updates, and supports efficient complex analytics and OLTP queries. Experiments showed that the system is able to support the above mentioned properties and update graphs with up to 100 million edges in under 50 seconds in a moderate underlying cluster. Finally, we selected community detection as a case study of incremental graph analytics with Sprouter. We proposed the Incremental Distributed Weighted Community Clustering (IDWCC), a novel algorithm that optimizes the Weighted Community Clustering metric to detect communities in unweighted undirected node-grained dynamic graphs. We validated the algorithm against the static centralized and distributed versions of WCC optimization. The experiments showed that the performance of IDWCC surpasses the static distributed version by up to three times while maintaining the same accuracy or better.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In light of the direction set by the 2014 Ontario Provincial Policy Statement, the historical lack of involvement of First Nations and Métis peoples in planning decisions in Ontario is a major topic of discussion from both an Indigenous rights and environmental justice perspective. The lands governed by the Greenbelt Plan are both culturally and environmentally significant and range from rural to urban, giving the province an opportunity to set wide precedents for the planning profession with this plan. Using the review of the Greenbelt Plan through the Coordinated Land Use Planning Review as a case study, this research acts to draw a connection between the Crown efforts in relationship building and reconciliation with the Indigenous peoples of Canada and the role of local planning authorities. Though the body of academic work exploring this topic is growing, there remains a lack of case studies that hold government bodies accountable and that adequately incorporate the perspectives of a diversity of players, most importantly those of the affected Indigenous groups. This work aims to contribute to filling that void.&#xD;
          The purpose of this research is to critically analyze the 2005 and 2017 versions of the Ontario Greenbelt Plan in order to (1) determine the extent to which First Nations and Métis peoples are included in the land use planning processes and (2) determine whether improvements are evident in the updated version. This forward-looking process ultimately answers the question: what are the next steps to better involve First Nations and Métis peoples in land use planning in Southern Ontario? Thus, the analysis culminates in the development of clear, specific, and targeted recommendations for three audiences: those responsible for the next Coordinated Land Use Planning Review, the Government of Ontario, and the Municipalities of Ontario. These recommendations, if embraced, will help to improve the involvement of First Nations and Métis communities in land use planning processes and, ultimately, strengthen the Indigenous-governmental relationships that exist or are being established in Ontario. All of the conclusions and recommendations that have been formed from this work were done so in collaboration with both First Nation, Métis, and non-Indigenous representatives who are involved with or impacted by the Greenbelt Plan.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The human-ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel (IKr), which is important for the repolarization phase of ventricular cardiac action potentials. A reduction in IKr due to a loss of hERG function can lead to long QT syndrome (LQTS). As such, there are a variety of hERG mutations known to cause LQTS. The majority of these mutations are thought to be trafficking deficient, including the G601S mutation. It has been shown that the plasma membrane (PM) expression of the G601S hERG mutant can be rescued by reduced-temperature culture. Additionally, it has been shown that hERG channels undergo rapid internalization in 0 mM K+o culture conditions, but this can also be prevented by reduced-temperature culture. Thus, the hypothesis of this thesis is that certain hERG mutants, including G601S, can traffic to the plasma membrane where they internalize due to impaired stability, similar to WT hERG channels in 0 mM K+ conditions. To test this hypothesis, a secondary mutation, S624T, which does not require K+o for stable PM expression, was added to the G601S mutant hERG channel. The addition of S624T intragenically suppressed the loss-of-function G601S phenotype and significantly rescued G601S expression and current. The addition of S624T also rescued LQTS-causing hERG mutants T474I and P596R. These data reveals the most effective intragenic rescue of LQTS-causing hERG mutants to date and lends insight into the mechanisms underlying the loss-of-function phenotype of certain LQTS-causing hERG mutants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Current design codes do not account for effects such as arching and membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs, which can increase capacity, and allow for a reduction of construction materials to be used. Research conducted to date has been unable to measure stress distribution throughout reinforced concrete slabs to fully understand the impact of arching and membrane action, because a method for capturing distributed strains was previously unavailable. One solution is to use distributed monitoring technologies to evaluate slab behaviour. Distributed fibre optic sensors (FOS) based on measuring Rayleigh backscatter provide strain measurement along the full length of the fibre up to 70 m. An experimental study using this technology was undertaken to investigate the behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs subjected to axial restraint. &#xD;
In the first test series, eleven one-way reinforced concrete slabs with varying depths, reinforcement ratios, and boundary conditions were instrumented with nylon coated FOS and tested in three-point bending to investigate the effects of axial restraint on slab behaviour. It was found that axial restraint increased the load carrying capacity of the specimens up to 45% and reduced reinforcement strains at a given applied load prior to yielding. An increase in capacity and decrease in reinforcement strains at a given load were also seen as reinforcement ratios and slab depths were increased. All specimens failed in flexure. &#xD;
In the second test series, four two-way reinforced concrete slabs with varying reinforcement ratios and boundary conditions were instrumented and tested under a central point load. Increasing the reinforcement ratio led to an increase in slab capacity up to 45%. Two specimens failed in flexure and two failed due to punching shear. &#xD;
Finite-element models were created for the one-way specimens to evaluate the accuracy of the models for use in structural assessment with distributed sensing. Plastic collapse analysis was completed for the two-way specimens in order to determine the accuracy of the analyses. Results from the FE model were accurate for the control specimens but showed stronger and stiffer responses compared to the restrained specimens. The plastic collapse analyses estimated the experimental control capacity within 13%.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cervical cancer screening detects cancer at early stages and is available to Ontario women ages 21 to 69 years of age. Notwithstanding cancer screening initiatives, sub-groups of Ontario women are under-screened based on current literature.  The most common primary health care delivery system in Ontario are patient enrolment models (PEMs) which allows for physician-incentives when rostering and cancer screening benchmarks are met. Notwithstanding, little is known about the effect of PEM enrolment and other socioeconomic (SES) factors, such as income, on screening uptake. This study considered differences in cervical screening uptake by PEM status and neighbourhood income levels by women residing in the Central East Local Health Integration Network (CELHIN).&#xD;
&#xD;
A descriptive, comparative study using record level, administrative data from Cancer Care Ontario of eligible CELHIN women between January 1, 2012 and June 30, 2015 was conducted (N=490, 574). The variables of interest were cervical screening uptake (dependent variable), PEM status (primary exposure variable), neighbourhood income quintile (independent variable) and controlled for age and rurality. &#xD;
&#xD;
Using logistic regression, it was determined non-enrolled women were more likely not to be screened (OR =6.98, 95% CI, 6.87-7.08) compared to enrolled women, representing the strongest association.  Given heterogeneous effects in odds ratios, multivariate stratified logistic regression analyses were undertaken for PEM enrolled and non-enrolled women separately. A significant association was found between older, non-enrolled women (ages 60-69) and not being screened (OR=1.87, 95% CI, 1.78-1.96). Unexpectedly, enrolled women in the lowest neighbourhood income quintile were more likely to not be screened (OR=1.49, 95% CI, 1.46-1.53) compared to their non-enrolled counterparts (OR=1.20, 95% CI, 1.14-1.25).  Urban dwellers were slightly less likely to be screened (enrolled women: OR=1.10, 95% CI, 1.07-1.12; non-enrolled women, OR=1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) relative to rural women.&#xD;
&#xD;
As older women have the greatest risk of high-grade invasive cervical cancer and PEM status is not protective for women living in lower SES, the priority for the CELHIN should be addressing barriers to cervical screening uptake, regardless of PEM status, for marginalized at-risk women including older women, and women living in lower SES environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The works described herein are broadly concerned with exploring the interactions between light and boron-containing π-conjugated systems in order to build a complete understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and reactivity. Despite rapid progress in the field of N,C- and C,C-chelate organoborate photochemistry over the past ten years, only the effects of different π-conjugated backbones have been well documented, with the impact of the aryl substituents being virtually unknown. To remedy this deficiency and harness the full potential of this class of photochromic materials, methodologies for obtaining prochiral organoboranes and their respective chiral N,C- or C,C-chelate organoborates have been developed in order to investigate the influence of boron substitution on their excited-state reactivity. Chiral N,C-chelate organoboron compounds bearing two different aryl groups at the boron center have been found to undergo regioselective photoisomerization involving the less bulky substituent exclusively, generating various highly colored base-stabilized boriranes with an H-atom on the three-membered ring. These species thermally isomerize to 4bH-azaborepins via direct H-atom transfer from boracycle to pyridine with concomitant ring expansion. Furthermore, appropriate functionalization with mesityl/heterocycle substituents (thienyl, furyl and derivatives) enables quantitative phototransformations yielding rare, chiral N,B,X-embedded heterocycles (e.g. base-stabilized 1,2-thiaborinines and 1,2-oxaborinines), which display strong blue-green to orange-red emission in the solid state. Mechanistic insights on these highly regioselective transformations were obtained via kinetic data and computational investigations on their excited-states. The effect of charge-transfer character on the photoreactivity of this class of photochromic molecules was also investigated by substituting the aryl groups of N,C-chelate organoborates with varying amine-donors. These compounds possess bright and tunable charge-transfer luminescence depending on the donor strength of the amine functionality, as well as donor-dependent photochromic switching. These new findings help elucidate the influence of electronic structure on the photoreactivity of N,C-chelate organoborates. Lastly, combining a three-coordinated boron (BMes2) moiety with a four-coordinated photochromic organoboron unit leads to a series of new diboron compounds that undergo four-state reversible color switching in response to stimuli of light, heat, and fluoride ions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This report focuses on urban intensification policy in the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) and evaluates the intensification policy of select municipalities in the GGH. Urban intensification is advocated in Ontario through a series of documents such as the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2017) in order to limit detrimental impacts on the environment and to prevent unsustainable urban growth. As a result, municipalities in the area are required to adopt urban intensification practices and policies. The purpose of this research was to understand how urban intensification policy is framed in the GGH, to identify areas of strength and weakness, and to outline recommendations for strategic, efficient, and sensitive intensification policy. The official plans of ten municipalities within the Greater Golden Horseshoe were evaluated using a set of criteria developed for this research. From these results, the strengths and weaknesses of intensification policy were identified and case study analyses of four municipalities (Peel Region, Mississauga, Toronto, and Barrie) were completed to develop a set of recommendations to improve intensification policy in the GGH.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the most outstanding mysteries in the Universe is the nature of dark matter. In this thesis, two unique projects that focus on understanding dark matter are presented. First, Machine Learning is used to detect background signals in the DEAP-3600 direct detection dark matter experiment. Machine Learning algorithms are found to achieve a near order of magnitude improvement on discrimination of surface backgrounds ove a standard position reconstruction algorithm. To ward against over-fitting, the algorithms are fit to real data before being tested on simulated data. Validation is done by modifying the detector simulation and recording the change in performance. It is found that the Machine Learning algorithms are robust to small changes in the optics of the detector and so would be stable for use on the real data. The second project is a study of the intrinsic scatter of a scaling relation and its potential tension with the dark matter hypothesis. The Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) relates the observed radial acceleration in a galaxy to that expected from a purely baryonic mass distribution. Lelli et al. (2017) have suggested that the RAR may have zero intrinsic scatter. If true, this would be inconsistent with the Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) paradigm, but a natural prediction of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). A large sample of galaxies is collated from six independent samples, representing over an order of magnitude increase in the amount of data available to examine this scaling relation. To test the zero scatter hypothesis, a Monte-Carlo simulation with a zero intrinsic scatter assumption is constructed; observational uncertainties are then re-introduced to the data. This technique shows observational uncertainties are too small to account for the observed scatter in the relation. It is found that the RAR is consistent with standard ΛCDM models and that it has an intrinsic scatter of order 0.13 dex (∼ 50 % of observed). Further tests show that these results cannot be explained with non-circular motions or correlations with other galaxy parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 1927, Emil Artin conjectured that for any integer a other than -1 or squares, the set of primes p for which a is a primitive root modulo p has positive density in the set of all primes. This was proven subject to the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH) by Hooley in 1967. In 2002, P. Moree and P. Stevenhagen formulated an analogous two-variable conjecture, and used a result of Stephens on binary recurrence sequences to prove the conjecture conditionally on GRH. In this thesis, we show unconditional lower bounds for this two-variable conjecture. In particular, we obtain a result about general binary recurrence sequences that can be applied to this problem. We also formulate an analogue of the two-variable conjecture in the context of elliptic curves, and prove an unconditional lower bound for elliptic curves of rank 1. Finally, we obtain some results about the largest prime factor of the nth cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a fixed integer, and where we let n vary.</dcterms:abstract>

For such a context, a recent result in the literature established convergence to person-by-person-optimal policies (and a class of Nash equilibrium policies in the game theoretic setup). Our main theorem is a convergence result to global optimality in a team-theoretic setup, and not only person-by-person optimality, with arbitrarily high probability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to explore how video-informed feedback supported embedded educator professional learning (EPL) between middle leader (ML) facilitators and teachers, addressing gaps in EPL literature pertaining to the role of feedback and video in embedded, ML-facilitated EPL. Two research questions guided my study: How does a video-informed feedback model support embedded EPL between ML facilitators and teachers? and How do video-informed feedback dialogues between ML facilitators and teachers evolve to support EPL over time? &#xD;
An embedded multiple case study design was used to study video-informed feedback between ML facilitators and teachers over one academic year in the context of a regional, math-based EPL initiative. A total of seven educators participated in this study: two ML facilitators and five teachers from two rural district school boards. Each facilitator represented a case; embedded units consisted of facilitator-teacher pairs. Primary data sources included semi-structured individual and dyadic interviews with participants and audio recordings of ML facilitator-teacher pairs’ feedback dialogues. &#xD;
Data were analyzed using inductive descriptive and deductive provisional coding techniques to develop within case themes. Within case themes were further analyzed to develop four cross-case assertions in response to how video-informed feedback supported embedded EPL between ML facilitators and teachers. Cross-case assertions pertained to interrelated learning goals, video-informed feedback dialogues, responsive collaboration, and video-informed praise. &#xD;
Key contributions of this research include my conceptual feedback model of embedded, ML-facilitated EPL as well as the importance of: (a) more knowledgeable-other support of both ML facilitators’ and teachers’ learning and practices—especially their data literacy; (b) setting and working toward interrelated goals for teachers and students to enhance EPL outcomes; (c) explicitly leveraging multi-source feedback models that incorporate diverse classroom data, including video, to help ML facilitators and teachers co-construct practice-based evidence to inform EPL; and (d) video-informed praise from ML facilitators to teachers which enables ML facilitators’ subsequent coaching feedback and teachers’ self-regulation. More broadly, this study highlights the importance of trusting professional relationships coupled with a focus on diverse sources of practice-based evidence to enable meaningful, constructive dialogues in the context of embedded, ML-facilitated EPL and to support desired outcomes for educators and students.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The majority of matter in the Universe is non-luminous, non-baryonic, and as of yet undiscovered. The SuperCDMS experiment searches for this "dark matter" in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), operating semiconducting detectors at cryogenic temperatures to measure energy deposits from dark matter interactions. These efforts have resulted in world leading limits on the interactions of dark matter with ordinary matter.  The next phase of SuperCDMS is under construction at SNOLAB near Sudbury, ON. &#xD;
    &#xD;
Interaction of cosmic rays with detector material can result in the production of radioactive isotopes, the decay of which results in background in the measured energy spectrum. Tritium is expected to be the limiting background for SuperCDMS SNOLAB. Production rates of tritium and other cosmogenic isotopes are not well known, with a wide spread in theoretical calculated rates and only a single measurement previously published for tritium. The work in this thesis details the measurement of cosmogenic production rates using low energy spectra measured by SuperCDMS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Phoenixin (PNX) is a recently discovered neuropeptide that was initially determined to positively contribute to reproductive functioning. Since its discovery, however, PNX has been implicated in a diverse range of physiological activity, including anxiety-like behavior, nociception, memory retention, and food intake. With a robust pattern of expression to compliment these physiological actions, it is clear that PNX plays a pleiotropic role. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), a critical autonomic integrating center in the hindbrain, is one of the many areas with dense expression of both PNX and its receptor, GPR173. Using both extracellular and whole-cell current clamp recording techniques in a coronal NTS slice preparation, this study characterized the effects of PNX on both spike frequency and membrane potential of NTS neurons in order to determine neuronal effects of the peptide. Extracellular recordings demonstrated that PNX increased firing frequency in 32% of male rat NTS neurons, and patch clamp recordings indicated that this effect also existed for membrane potential, with 50% of NTS neurons depolarizing in response to application of the peptide. Our study took an abrupt turn when total responsiveness to PNX in NTS neurons declined suddenly to 9%. This effect was subsequently attributed to construction in our laboratory facility after rats were relocated to a construction-free facility and PNX responsiveness was recovered. Rats were then placed on a corticosterone (CORT)-stressor treatment that replicated the decreased PNX responsiveness within 2 weeks and had no effect on the responsiveness of neurons to another neuropeptide, Angiotensin II (ANG). These results implicate PNX in the central integration of stress and potentially provide new insight into a factor of stress-related infertility.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Approximately 5% of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) harbor a somatic 1;19 chromosomal translocation which generates a fusion gene coding for TCF3-PBX1. Recent studies have shown that leukemic progenitors with t(1;19) occur in a distinct subset of B-ALL cases that often express a functional pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR). It is hypothesized that TCF3-PBX1 drives the leukemogenesis of these cells by promoting aberrant pre-BCR signaling through transcriptional activation of genes encoding pre-BCR components (IGHM, CD79A, CD79B, IGLL1, VPREB1 and VPREB3). To test this hypothesis, we have established short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown models in two different t(1;19) B-ALL cell lines (RCH-ACV and 697). Expression of the knockdown shRNA against the TCF3-PBX1 transcript considerably reduced cell culture-initiation and proliferation. We then performed RNA-Seq in both of our knockdown models and determined that TCF3-PBX1 knockdown surprisingly activates, rather than represses, the expression of IGHM, CD79A, CD79B, IGLL1, VPREB1 and VPREB3. Despite this, we observed a marked reduction in phosphorylation and activation of AKT and ERK in ¬TCF3-PBX1-silenced cells. Additionally, TCF3-PBX1 knockdown had no effect on SYK phosphorylation.  Altogether, our results suggest that TCF3-PBX1 promotes t(1;19) B-ALL proliferation by activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling in a pre-BCR independent manner. In considering alternative mechanisms by which TCF3-PBX1 promotes cell proliferation, TCF3-PBX1 activates the expression of genes encoding key downstream pre-BCR signaling molecules such as the Src-family kinase BLK and the atypical protein kinase C PKCζ either of which could promote pro-survival signaling pathways. Alternatively, we propose that TCF3-PBX1 promotes Notch or Rho signaling and that these pathways might crosstalk with the pre-BCR.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Acute hyperglycemia transiently impairs endothelial function in healthy males when assessed via flow-mediated dilation (FMD). However, research in female participants is lacking and the impact of menstrual phase (early follicular (EF) and late follicular (LF)) on vulnerability to acute hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction is unknown. It is hypothesized that hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction will be attenuated in the LF phase. Seventeen healthy, naturally menstruating women (21 ± 1 years [mean ± SD]) participated in three experimental visits. During two visits (one EF phase, one LF phase), endothelial function was assessed via brachial artery FMD before and 60-, 90-, and 120-min after an oral glucose challenge (75g glucose/300mL solution). Blood samples were taken to assess blood glucose, insulin, estradiol, progesterone and viscosity. During a third visit in the EF phase, participants ingested 300mL of water as a time-control for FMD. Blood samples were only taken for blood glucose and viscosity during this visit. Additionally, ovulation testing was used to confirm the LF phase. Data are [mean ± SD]. Glucose and insulin levels increased 30min post-glucose ingestion, with no difference between visits (p &lt; 0.001). FMD was reduced 90min post-glucose ingestion (Post90) during the EF glucose visit (Pre: 8.7 ± 2.9%, Post90: 6.2 ± 2.8%, p = 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.864). FMD-impairment during LFGlucose was not significant (Pre: 8.4 ± 2.4%, Post120: 6.8 ± 2.7, p = 0.089; d = 0.649). A direct comparison of EF and LFGlucose delta-FMD did not reach significance (p=0.117) revealing a small effect of phase (d = 0.431) on vulnerability to hyperglycemia-induced FMD impairment. These results suggest that the cyclic elevation in estrogen that occurs during the menstrual cycle confers a small degree of protection from acute hyperglycemia-induced impairment in endothelial function. In order to fully characterize the impact of acute stimuli on vascular function in premenopausal women, it is essential to examine responses across multiple phases of the menstrual cycle.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis was to further the nascent paradigm on team-level voice, specifically voice climate and team voice. First, in Study 1, I examined how and why voice climate emerges in teams. In particular, I proposed that leaders stimulate shared perceptions of voice climate depending on how they previously responded to voice (i.e., voice acceptance or rejection). In turn, I proposed that voice climate enhances teams’ subsequent voice, as mediated by team risk, fear, efficacy, and vitality. I tested these propositions with a between-subjects team experiment, in which I manipulated a confederate leader’s responses to their team’s voice, and assessed its effects on team affect, cognitions, and subsequent voice.&#xD;
Next, in Study 2, I conducted a multi-wave training experiment to explore whether we can train leaders to successfully encourage their teams to speak up. First, I developed a one-hour training program that focussed on leader openness and responsiveness to voice, based on insights from the voice and leadership training literatures. Next, I randomly divided 65 students into either a 1-hour voice or control condition, and administered the training. Finally, approximately one week later, these students participated in a 1-hour team task, after which their team members rated leaders’ openness and responsiveness to voice, as well as voice climate and team voice.&#xD;
Finally, in Study 3, I investigated whether, how, and why voice climate ultimately affects team functioning by focussing on the mediating mechanisms that link voice climate to team learning and performance. In particular, I proposed that voice climate enhances team effectiveness through its sequential effect on negative and positive team affect (i.e., fear and vitality), cognitions (i.e., risk and efficacy), and voice (i.e., quantity and quality). I assessed these propositions with multi-sourced field surveys with 59 teams from 8 Canadian companies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Resting-state functional MRI examines activity of the central nervous system in the absence of a specific task or stimulus, and has been used to investigate coordinated activity within the cerebral hemispheres, as well as the brainstem and spinal cord. While previous research has shown coordinated resting-state BOLD fluctuations in the brainstem and cord, the extent of resting-state networks (RSNs) and their function are still unclear. Characterizing these networks is an important step towards understanding the complex processing that occurs in the spinal cord and brainstem outside of a reaction to a stimulus. &#xD;
The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the function of spinal cord and brainstem RSNs, by examining how these networks change when participants are experiencing different cognitive states. If a person’s cognitive/emotional state can be shown to influence resting-state BOLD signal fluctuations in the brainstem/cord, then we can infer that a function of these RSNs is to modulate the excitability of spinal cord neurons. We first aimed to confirm the presence of RSNs in the brainstem and spinal cord. After doing so, we present evidence that, while RSNs are largely consistent across 3 conditions (a resting-state condition, an audio presentation, and a video), watching a video or listening to an audio presentation alters these networks in specific ways. Combined with prior evidence, these results show that the observed networks likely help integrate homeostatic autonomic functions. &#xD;
Building on this evidence, we investigated how connectivity in the previously-identified networks is altered when a participant is specifically expecting pain. We provide evidence that coordinated brainstem and spinal cord networks are affected by the expectation of pain differently than by other distracting situations such as focusing on a video. We conclude that these networks may serve to integrate autonomic regulatory functions with pain processing. Linking the function of these networks to homeostatic autonomic control and pain modulation is an important step in understanding the complex brainstem/spinal cord activity that occurs aside from a reaction to a painful stimulus. Findings of this thesis will help provide a deeper understanding of pain modulation and subjective experiences of pain, such as placebo/nocebo effects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent literature suggests that passive prosthetic foot-ankle devices, when optimized, may provide similar energy performance as the natural foot, but this has yet to be realized with current designs. Of concern is the inconsistency between biomechanical and structural measures of device performance. Biomechanical studies of energy performance rely on estimating power based on the deformation velocity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached regarding its definition and interpretation, due, in part, to a lack of clarity regarding the nature of deformation in these devices. Specifically, a majority of analyses use rigid body assumptions to estimate the angular velocity of these deformable systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
An extension of current methods is developed, termed the Deformable Link Segment (DLS) model, in which the deformation velocity is estimated using a series of instantaneous equivalent linkages. The novelty of the approach is that an estimate of the angular velocity is not required and the deformation velocity can be calculated without rigid body assumptions. Practical application of the DLS model is demonstrated for biomechanical analyses with a small cohort of prosthesis users. DLS deformation velocity and deformation power of prosthetic foot-ankle devices are calculated and results are compared to current methods in the literature. These models are distinguished by the reference points and segment angular velocity. Comparison indicates that the DLS model produces results that are distinct, yet similar in general trend to estimates in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
A mechanical testing method to characterize prosthetic foot deformation is developed based on a simplification of the DLS model. Structural properties are measured from a series of force-deflection curves at specific loads and shank angles. Five prosthetic feet with differing designs and structural properties are analysed to provide the predicted vertical deflection throughout simulated stance. A method is proposed to estimate foot-ankle deformation velocity from these measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
The framework established will further enable researchers in the design and optimization of the energy performance of prosthetic foot-ankle devices and inform clinicians in the selection of patient-specific prosthetic systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Tensegrity (tensional integrity) is a structural principle where rigid elements (struts) under compression are held together by a network of elastic elements (cables) under tension. Tensegrity structures have many applications in modelling the natural world. Tensegrity research has been applied to fields including robotics, art, architecture, and biology. In recent years, computer simulation has been introduced as a tool to allow researchers to design, build, and simulate tensegrity structures. Structures designed both as physical models and in simulation software can require several iterations of fine adjustments. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we develop a form-finding application to reduce the iterative adjustments required when designing a tensegrity structure. Form-finding is the process of finding a structural configuration capable of a state of self-stressed equilibrium – when tension and compression stabilize the structure. Our form-finding application uses a tensegrity structure that is not necessarily in an equilibrium state represented as a graph as input, and produces either (a) failure when no equilibrium state is possible, or (b) a fully attributed labeled graph of a tensegrity structure in an equilibrium state. In this thesis, we use an efficient fitness function and genetic algorithms to find the stable state of a tensegrity structure. Through our form-finding application, we aim to promote the use of computer simulation, and collaboration between tensegrity researchers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>IBD is an inflammatory disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract, encompassing two conditions (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). IBD negatively affects patients in a physical and psychosocial manner, which significantly impacts their quality of life. Related to quality of life is disability, which is an under-researched topic in the IBD literature. Models theorize that disability is the result of a disease and its related impairments, limitations, and restrictions it causes to an individual and their life. Environmental and psychosocial factors are also theorized to affect this process of disablement. Biopsychosocial factors such pain, depression, pain catastrophizing, and social support have all been linked to IBD disability-related outcomes, but no multivariate research has examined all of these factors simultaneously. This study aimed to elucidate the role of psychosocial factors in the process of disablement in an outpatient tertiary care IBD sample. Depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and perceived social support were examined as mediators in the relationship between pain and pain-related disability cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Alternate models exploring feedback effects amongst disability and pain, and potential moderators (gender, disease type) of the mediation relationships were also tested. Cross-sectionally, depressive symptoms and pain catastrophizing, but not perceived social support, were significant mediators in the relationship between pain and pain-related disability. Support was found for feedback effects, such that disability predicted pain both cross-sectionally (through depressive symptoms as a mediator) and longitudinally (directly). These findings augment the research supporting a biopsychosocial model of IBD disability. Further, these results highlight the importance of targeting psychological factors such as depressive symptoms and pain catastrophizing in the treatment of individuals with IBD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In response to microbial stimuli, innate myeloid cells are potent producers of cytokines that function to mediate inflammation. This thesis investigates two related cytokines, IL-27 and IL-30, to identify novel proinflammatory mechanisms to improve treatments for bacterial infections. IL-27 is comprised of IL-27p28 and EBI3 subunits; the IL-27p28 subunit, also named IL-30, can also signal independently of EBI3. To date, most studies on IL-27 have focused on its role in CD4+ T cell differentiation. IL-30 has been recognized as an antagonist of IL-6, IL-11, and IL-27 in CD4+ T cells. In primary monocytes, IL-27 promotes proinflammatory cytokine production and TLR4 expression in monocytes for a potent inflammatory response to bacterial endotoxin, LPS. Barring these studies, functions of IL-27 and IL-30 in human myeloid cells have not been well described, and therefore are the focus of this thesis. Specifically, this thesis compares IL-27 and IL-30 signaling in human monocytes and explores novel proinflammatory effects of IL-27 and IL-30 on cytokine production in response to either Gram-negative bacteria or bacterial components in myeloid cells. The effects of IL-27 are explored in Salmonella enterica infection, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and induction of endotoxin (LPS) tolerance in human monocytes and macrophages, while the effects of IL-30 are defined in human monocytes. IL-27 and IL-30 induce IP-10 production in human monocytes in a STAT-dependent manner. Furthermore, pre-treatment with IL-6 interferes with IL-27 and IL-30 functions in human monocytes. Similarly to TLR4, IL-27 treatment also enhances TLR5 expression in human monocytes and macrophages, inducing cytokine production in response to TLR agonists LPS and flagellin or S. enterica infection. IL-27 also increases LPS/ATP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in human monocytes via upregulated TLR4 and P2X7 expression. Comparing human THP-1 monocytes and PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages, CD14 expression plays a role in LPS and IL-27 responsiveness, whereby IL-27-mediated inhibition of LPS tolerance is greater in CD14low THP-1 monocytes compared to CD14high PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Overall, this thesis demonstrates novel proinflammatory roles for IL-27 and its subunit IL-30 in innate immune responses and may serve as novel adjuvant candidates for vaccine design against Gram-negative bacterial infections.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Breast cancer will be diagnosed in over 26,500 Canadians this year. Despite advances, identifying who will develop aggressive breast tumours or who will respond to treatment remains a clinical challenge. This dissertation aimed to delineate novel genetic and microRNA (miRNA) regulatory mechanisms that may contribute to metastases and poor clinical outcomes among patients with aggressive subtypes of breast cancer; those overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The first component of my thesis focuses on the study of miRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level to function as both oncogenes and tumour suppressors in breast cancer. We used next generation sequencing to define miRNA expression profiles that correlate with clinical outcomes among a local TNBC patient cohort. My data unveiled new prognostic and predictive miRNA biomarkers significantly correlated with improved overall, relapse-free survival and treatment response among TNBC patients. The second component of my thesis focuses on the study of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR)g, a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes essential for normal metabolism of fats and sugars in the body. This study used unique in vitro and in vivo models to assess the effects of targeted PPARg deletion in the same HER2+ transformed mammary epithelial cells that drive breast tumour progression. My data are the first to suggest PPARg loss enhances the initiation but not the progression of HER2+ breast cancer, while PPARg ligand treatment decreases these effects. Together, my research elucidates new signaling pathways and therapeutic strategies that may reduce deaths and improve clinical outcomes for HER2+ and TNBC patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) regulate their phenotype in response to the frictional force exerted by the flowing blood, fluid shear stress (FSS). The hemodynamics dictating this force determine, to a large extent, the likelihood that a given region of a blood vessel will develop atherosclerotic plaque. In linear arterial segments, VECs are exposed to high laminar unidirectional FSS (15-20 dyne/cm2), whereas in bifurcations, arches and branch points, VECs encounter low magnitude/oscillating or otherwise disturbed FSS (0-4 dyne/cm2). High laminar FSS promotes establishment of an adaptive VEC phenotype, characterized by the expression of anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti- atherogenic genes. Conversely, low and oscillating flow causes VECs to express pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic genes and adopt an athero-prone phenotype. Previous studies have identified mechanosensory signalling molecules that allow VECs to sense and respond to FSS, which include vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM- 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Research conducted by our group has previously shown that exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC1) and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) populate a multi-protein signalling complex along with VE- cadherin. These proteins function together to regulate VEC barrier function, cell morphology and gene expression of in response to FSS. Now, we have investigated this compartmentalized signalling complex in greater detail, and have identified that one splice variant, namely phosphodiesterase 4D7 (PDE4D7), controls VEC gene regulation in response to FSS, while another, PDE4D5, does not. Indeed, we show that PDE4D7 silencing with siRNA attenuates the upregulation of krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and thrombomodulin (TM) in VECs exposed to FSS. This work identifies a potential novel specific therapeutic target for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis and improves our understanding of mechanosensory signal transduction in the vascular endothelium.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A coupled model was created that linked the mass transport mechanisms of the channel and the Porous Transport Layer of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell. A Volume of Fluid solver in the open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics software, openFOAM, was used to model the two-phase flow in the channel. A Pore Network Model designed for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells and found in literature was implemented into openFOAM to model the two-phase flow in the Porous Transport Layer. The Pore Network Model was recast into a form suitable for the Finite Volume Method used in openFOAM allowing for coupling between these two components. A coupling strategy called Dirichlet-Neumann partitioning was used for pressure on the boundary that separates the two domains. A Neumann boundary condition for pressure was applied in the channel and a Dirichlet boundary condition for pressure was applied in the Pore Network Model. The value of pressure was passed from the channel to the Pore Network iteratively until convergence was achieved. It was determined that the air pressure in the Porous Transport Layer remains constant before breakthrough therefore allowing for the Pore Network Model only to be solved before breakthrough using a linear pressure distribution along the channel boundary to capture the convective effects of the channel. The effects of convection on water transport in the Porous Transport Layer was investigated and the convective effects were significant enough to cause mass conservation violations when the air inlet velocity was altered from 5-10 m/s. It was determined that the domain widths often used in literature are too small to conserve mass and near wall effects permeate towards the domains center. Two common Porous Transport Layer materials were recreated and it was determined that within the expected range of pressure gradients significant movement of water downstream was observed for the SGL10BA material with less significant movement for the Toray090 sample. It was determined that for post-breakthrough simulations water is needed in the channel to properly set the injection velocity. The numerical stability of these post-breakthrough simulations proved to be extremely fragile.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The most recent prevalence rates from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National ASD Surveillance System (NASS) (PHAC, 2018) indicate that 1 in 66 children and youth (i.e., 15.2 per 1000) 5-17 years of age were diagnosed with ASD in 2015 across seven provinces and territories. The Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS) states that there are an estimated 40,000 children and youth with ASD in the province (“Newsroom: Ontario Providing More Supports for Children with Autism,” 2016). Specifically, in the context of Ontario’s education system, and in light of the current study, there is a rapid increase of students with exceptionalities no longer being isolated to special education classrooms, as a result, general education teachers are increasingly teaching the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) student population (Wilczynski et al., 2011). A large number of studies determine that general education teachers do not support an inclusive model of teaching as they lack adequate training in teaching inclusively, as well, they voice concerns about their lack of confidence, feelings of low self-efficacy, and have expressed a shortage of continuing education opportunities (Finke, McNaughton &amp; Drager, 2009; Lindsay et al., 2013; McCray &amp; McHatton, 2011; Ross-Hill, 2009; Scruggs et al., 2007). This study aimed to fill in the gap by exploring the experiences of specialist teachers who have worked more extensively with students with ASD.&#xD;
Specifically, this qualitative descriptive study describes effective strategies used by four specialist teachers that support the inclusion of students with ASD. In talking to specialist teachers about effective strategies they use, I hoped to gain an in-depth understanding of their attitudes and beliefs towards including students with ASD, and learn how teachers create a safe and accepting environment within their classrooms through the use of different tools, resources and practices.&#xD;
The findings of this study suggest that it is important that educators who work with students with ASD be highly committed; in that, they are driven to find resources and tools, willing to adapt their classroom routine/instruction, and demonstrate resiliency when faced with challenges. Furthermore, the specialist teachers stressed the importance of tailoring instruction to suit the individualized functional needs of students, as opposed to a sole focus on curriculum and diagnosis. This study also suggests that a structured but flexible learning environment is fundamental to teaching inclusively (i.e., teaching content using multiple modes and in different settings based on student needs). Most importantly, this study provides an overview of a number of strategies deemed successful in supporting the inclusion of students with autism spectrum disorder and provides detailed descriptions and explanations of how and why each strategy is used in practice. This study provides useful information for individuals at all levels of education, from government policy makers to front-line teachers by making classroom-validated resources, practices and affective factors transparent and scalable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation contributes to literatures of postcolonial and critical geographies of development by documenting a landscape of violence that shapes processes of how people make place at the local level in response to extractive resource development in Guatemala. Three case studies of the Fénix, Marlin, and El Escobal mines offer context when situating the fourth and lesser known El Tambor mine. Transnational mining companies and the Guatemalan government are intent on exploiting natural resources in order to fuel economic development. In response, residents of the municipalities of San José del Golfo and San Pedro Ayampuc joined together to form La Puya, a community situated at the entrance of the Canadian, and later American-owned and operated El Tambor mine.&#xD;
Using feminist and activist methodologies as a framework to guide fieldwork in Guatemala and Canada, the dissertation focuses on the voices of community members from La Puya as a means to challenge mainstream ideas about mining as an appropriate method of development. Interviews conducted in the summers of 2012 and 2013 asked community members about their experiences opposing the operations of transnational mining companies and the policies and actions of the Guatemalan government. Engaging a critical geographic approach, analyses found that individuals who take up opposition to neoliberal development face daily forms of direct and indirect violence that negatively impact their lives and communities. Additionally, the dissertation explores the foundations of structural violence created in Canada through on site observations in 2016 and 2017 at the annual conference of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC), an Access to Information (ATI) request, and public letters and press releases from transnational mining companies operating in Guatemala. Absent from these latter fora are the experience of violence that affect the lives of those living with problematical development. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to amplify the voices of La Puya in direct opposition to the actions of foreign companies and government officials who dominate discussions of development.&#xD;
The dissertation concludes that disputes between transnational companies, local communities, and the Guatemalan government derive from lack of meaningful consultation, failure by the state to protect the rights of Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, and environmental degradation as a result of extractive operations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is a 190 kDa ATP-binding cassette transporter which effluxes xeno- and endobiotic organic anions including estradiol glucuronide (E217βG) and the pro-inflammatory leukotriene C4 (LTC4). MRP1 also confers multidrug resistance by reducing intracellular drug accumulation through active efflux. MRP1 has three membrane spanning domains (MSD), two of which form the solute translocation pathway, and two functionally asymmetric nucleotide binding domains (NBD) which bind and hydrolyze ATP. MSD1/2 are linked to NBD1/2 by connecting regions (CR) 1 (aa 600-642) and CR2 (aa 1249-1291), respectively. To test the hypothesis that the CRs are functionally distinct, eight CR residues (four in CR1: S612A, R615A, H622A, E624A and four in CR2: T1270A, P1275A, W1287A, G1291A), were targeted for Ala substitution based on sequence conservation and structural location of the residue, and their phenotypes investigated. Cellular levels of three of four CR1 mutants (S612A, R615A, E624A) were substantially lower than wild-type MRP1 (by 60%, 95%, 95%, respectively; p&lt;0.05). Of the four CR2 mutants, only W1287A levels were markedly reduced (by 80%; p&lt;0.05) and more conservatively substituted mutants (W1287F, W1287Y) remained &lt;65% of wild-type MRP1levels (p&lt;0.05). Analyses of apo bMrp1/MRP1 cryo-EM structures and models suggested that some of these mutation-sensitive residues might participate in stabilizing interactions. However, this idea was not supported by double exchange mutations which all failed to improve MRP1 levels. Immunofluorescence showed that while CR1-H622A localized to the plasma membrane like wild-type MRP1, the poorly expressing CR1 mutants (S612A, R615A, E624A) were retained intracellularly. In contrast, all four CR2 mutants, including the poorly expressing W1287A, localized exclusively to the plasma membrane. For CR mutants expressed at levels comparable to wild-type MRP1 (H622A, T1270A, P1275A, G1291A), only CR2-G1291A exhibited a substrate selective change in [3H]LTC4 transport (reduced by 40%; p&lt;0.05) whereas [3H]E217βG and estrone sulphate transport were largely unaffected. Together these results support the hypothesis that CR1 and CR2 play important, but distinct, roles. CR1 may be more important for the plasma membrane expression of MRP1 whereas CR2 may play a larger role in transport activity. The mechanisms underlying these functional differences should be investigated further.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite the accumulating evidence to warrant the deliberate consideration of femininity, there has been a continued neglect of femininity as an important intersectional axis. In addition, despite the numerous manifestations of oppression based in femininity (e.g. slut-shaming, sissyphobia, effemamania, femiphobia, misogynoir, trans-misogyny), there has yet to be an examination and application of how these systems relate and inform one another. This collection of articles argues that these sources of oppression are different symptoms of the same underlying social prejudice: the devaluation of femininity. Consequently, over the course of the three iterative chapters, I establish Femme Theory as a theoretical framework that requires bringing feminine multiplicities and feminine devaluation into focus within interdisciplinary and intersectional research. In so doing, this dissertation proposes and facilitates the growth of Critical Femininities as an emergent field of inquiry in which feminine intersections are central to understanding the ebbs and flows of power, particularly in relation to social inequalities. This dissertation contributes to the growth of a field of Critical Femininities through the development of Femme Theory, its subsequent illumination and refinement using a qualitative approach, to finally applying Femme Theory using quantitative methodologies. Consequently, this dissertation develops a theoretical framework that makes central the roles of femininity and femmephobia in making sense of social realities, while highlighting the importance of an intersectional approach that not only includes race, gender, class, and sexuality, but also gender expression and, more specifically, femininity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With climate change being arguably the most important problem of this century, solutions must be researched, developed and implemented across the globe. Canada has shown progress over time in the electricity sector to implement renewable energy sources and limit the impact of climate change, however there is still substantial work to be done in both the transportation and energy export sectors. Research into each sector is conducted as two separate studies; one comparing the impact of battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the Ontario energy generation system, and the other showing the required renewable energy systems necessary to transition the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to using hydrogen fuel instead of diluted bitumen. In the case of the first study, the electrical demand pro le in the province in any given season is able to be level when fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen generation are introduced. Conservatively only 3,000 MW of clean, base-load generation would have to be added in order to entirely eliminate the need for oil and gas in the province, and this required capacity becomes less as the e ciency of electrolysis improves over time. In the case of the second study, it is shown that with the large scale development of renewable energy systems (mostly wind generation), the need for oil and gas in the energy export sector can be transitioned to a cleaner alternative in hydrogen, whether it be the present-day exports to the United States of America or the future exports to the Asia-Pacific region by means of the new Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. In each case, overwhelmingly positive environmental and economic impacts are evident for specific provinces, and Canada as a whole.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis we present two projects investigating the evolution and quenching of cluster galaxy star formation (SF) activity. Leveraging a sample of 36 galaxy clusters, we measure the level of member SF activity. Over the 7.5 billion years spanned by our clusters, from z=1.5 to z=0.15, the SF activity of cluster galaxies decreases by a factor of 11. This is much larger than the three-fold decline experienced by star-forming galaxies (SFGs), or the factor of four drop for quiescent galaxies, which have SF activity more than an order of magnitude lower than SFGs. The overall evolution of cluster member SF activity is driven not by the decline of either subset, but instead by the transitioning of galaxies from star-forming to quiescence. Indeed, from z=1.5 to z=0.15, the fraction of quiescent galaxies rises from 28% to 88%.&#xD;
&#xD;
To investigate the impact of strangulation, a long timescale quenching mechanism, we determine whether 58 members of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 1795 possess hot halos. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to fit surface brightness profiles (SBPs) of stacked X-ray images with models that account for the dominant X-ray emission in and around cluster members. Hot gas halos around outer Abell 1795 members are detected, in a statistical sense. Inner cluster hot halos, however, remain undetected, with a luminosity upper limit six times lower than the hot halo luminosity in the outer cluster. This suggests that Abell 1795's intracluster medium is likely stripping the hot gas halos of infalling members.&#xD;
&#xD;
To further test our modeling technique we apply it to five additional clusters. Combining their data, we generate profiles and retrieve a good fit to the inner cluster SBP. Due to a relative lack of data in the clusters' outskirts, we are unable to provide much constraint on hot halo presence. We propose stacking a greater number of outer cluster members, which would necessitate acquiring additional X-ray data, likely through a more targeted search of the Chandra Data Archive.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Empirical interest in alternative treatment options for major depression has been on the rise, in part because of the shortcomings of conventional approaches. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the use of various alternative treatments as either stand-alone or adjunctive therapies for depression (Ravindran et al., 2016), methodological limitations have plagued numerous individual trials. The current study aimed to examine the antidepressant effects of yoga in a study design that made several methodological improvements over previous trials. Bikram yoga was used as the yoga intervention because it is a standardized style of yoga that is readily available, thus lending itself well to subsequent replication. In addition to comparing its effects to those of no treatment, Bikram yoga was compared to an aerobic exercise intervention, as the latter has been well-supported for its mood-enhancing benefits and has even been incorporated into treatment guidelines for depression. &#xD;
&#xD;
Participants were 53 adult women who met diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. They were randomized to one of three 8-week conditions: Bikram yoga, aerobic exercise, or waitlist control. Results from an intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated response rates (i.e., &gt;50% reduction on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; HAM-D; Hamilton, 1960) of 61.1%, 60.0%, and 6.7%, respectively, for the yoga, exercise, and waitlist groups. When considering the sample of completers, 73.3% and 80.0% of participants in the yoga and exercise groups, respectively, achieved remission (i.e., no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for depression and HAM-D≤7) compared to only 8.3% in the waitlist condition. &#xD;
&#xD;
A secondary objective of this study was to examine relevant physiological and psychological variables that may underlie the antidepressant effects of Bikram yoga and aerobic exercise. Physiological variables included pre- to post-treatment changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol response to a psychological challenge test. Psychological variables were changes in level of perceived hassles, rumination, and mindfulness. Although these variables have been linked to depression and have also been found to be influenced by yoga and exercise, their role in mediating the antidepressant effects of yoga and exercise have gone largely unexplored. Rumination emerged as a significant mediator for both active treatment conditions. Acceptance, which is a component of mindfulness, also mediated the antidepressant effects of exercise. Possibly owing to methodological issues and extraneous factors that may have been inadequately controlled for, none of the physiological variables emerged as significant mediators. Suggestions for future research, including other potential mechanisms of action that may help better understand the mental health benefits of yoga and exercise, are highlighted.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Separation of rare earth elements (REE) is often achieved by acid leaching of mineral concentrates followed by subsequent solvent extraction, to produce individual rare earth metals. Cerium, the most abundant of these elements, is usually the largest component of commercial ores. Demand for less prevalent REE, such as neodymium and dysprosium; have led to a market saturation and price collapse of cerium. One method of improving the economics of REE separation is to remove cerium from solution prior to solvent extraction. This is accomplished via the oxidation of cerium (III) to cerium (IV), which precipitates as cerium hydroxides. In general this process is undertaken at basic pH, however this requires large quantities of base to raise the solution of leach liquors to levels suitable for these processes. Oxidation in acidic solutions would allow for savings on reagents as well as lower water use, increasing the financial viability and environmental profile of rare earth purification processes. This study probes the efficacy of four oxidants; hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, and Caro’s (peroxymonosulfuric) acid in this endeavor. Cerium oxidation was tested using these oxidants at varying stoichiometry, a pH range of 1.0 to 4.0, temperatures of 25, 45, and 65 °C, varying cerium concentrations, and in the presence of other REE. Kinetic constants were calculated from time-sampled data. 99.9% cerium removal is achievable using potassium permanganate and Caro’s acid in the absence of other REE. The greatest cerium removal, 98.4%, was achieved using permanganate in multi REE solutions leaving a product with a cerium to total REE (Ce/TREE) quiotient of 0.62. Varying levels of cerium removal were achieved with lower selectivity using the other oxidants. To investigate adsorption of other REE to cerium, adsorption isotherms of neodymium and terbium were created using ceric hydroxide and fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The cerium solids produces were examined using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravemetric analysis, and x-ray diffraction to gain a better understanding of their form.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dark matter is currently a topic at the frontier of astroparticle physics research. Its discovery or refutation would have profound implications for particle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. There are numerous experiments trying to detect potential dark matter interactions with ordinary matter. The experiment at the focus of this thesis is the Dark matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape discrimination (DEAP). The DEAP collaboration has built a tonne-scale detector, dubbed DEAP-3600, which is part-way through its three-year data acquisition run. The detector utilizes roughly 3300 kg of liquid argon as a scintillating medium in order to detect potential dark matter interactions, which are expected to be in the form of rare elastic collisions with argon nuclei. The detection instrumentation comprises an array of 255 photomultiplier tubes, which can turn trace amounts of light into measurable electrical signals. In addition to these devices which generate the signals, DEAP-3600 has a data acquisition stream which includes a signal shaping/amplification stage and a digitization stage. The signal generation and digitization stages are especially prone to saturation effects which are associated with large electrical currents. These effects manifest themselves in data to varying degrees, depending on event energy, position, and how "prompt" the light is. What follows is a detailed overview of an algorithm devised to correct signal saturation in all forms of data collected by the detector.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We introduce a new symmetric Gaussian rearrangement that applies to sets and functions which are invariant with respect to a given finite subgroup of the orthogonal group. The properties of this rearrangement are developed, connecting it with the existing theory, and we show that the Hardy--Littlewood inequality holds for this rearrangement. As an application, certain integrals involving the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup are shown to be non-decreasing under rearrangement of their initial data. This in turn demonstrates a new form of Borell's inequality: the (positive correlation) Gaussian noise stability of a set is non-decreasing under appropriate symmetric Gaussian rearrangement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is growing recognition that Transformational Leadership (TFL; Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006) may hold significant potential for exploring coaches’ influence on athlete development (Vella, et al., 2013a).  Although previous research demonstrates that transformational coaching behaviours may have important implications for athlete outcomes (Arthur et al., 2011; Charbonneau, et al., 2001), studies examining how these behaviours can be developed through coach education programs are limited.  Recent reviews on coaching education reveal that there is need for programs that (a) focus on coaches’ interpersonal knowledge/behaviours (Lefebvre et al., 2016), (b) integrate behaviour change theories into their design (Allan et al., 2017), and (c) are systematically designed and evaluated (Evans et al., 2015).  To address these limitations, the purpose of this study was two-fold: First, to explore the factors that influence coaches’ perceptions of their capability, opportunity, and motivation to execute TFL behaviours (COM-B model; Michie et al., 2014), and second, to obtain recommendations from coaches, using the RE-AIM framework, for a future interpersonal coach education program.  The goal of this study was to provide pragmatic results to aid in the development of an interpersonal focused coach development program grounded in TFL theory.  Using a mixed methods design, one-on-one interviews were conducted with 20 youth sport coaches.  Coaches’ perceptions of their capability, opportunity, and motivation to perform TFL behaviours were assessed using both Likert-scale and open-ended questions.  Results indicated that coaches perceived opportunity as the most noteworthy barrier to executing TFL behaviours, followed by capability, F(1, 18) = 18.55, p &lt; 0.05, and motivation, F(1, 18) = 18.55, p &lt; 0.01.  Thematic analysis of the open-ended questions revealed a myriad of enablers and barriers to the execution of TFL behaviours such as time, (opportunity), experience (capability), and coaches’ roles (motivation).  Lastly, coaches &#xD;
recommendations for a future workshop revealed themes that were mapped onto the domains of the RE-AIM framework.  Recommendations included using reputable sources (reach), adopting a person-centered approach (effectiveness), establishing credibility (adoption), using qualified educators (implementation), and creating sustainable connections (maintenance).  These findings offer insight into youth sport coaches’ use of TFL and provide practical recommendations for future interpersonal coach education programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Precision medicine is an emerging field in critical care research where treatments are individualized, ensuring the right patient receives the right medication at the right time. In this work, the focus is on the data analytics, however, interpreting and understanding biomedical data is challenging due to the heterogeneity, noise, potential interrelationships, and dynamic nature that makes the data complex. Computer science is needed to help organize and utilize this data. &#xD;
Exploratory data analysis is an approach to research that combines computing power and human involvement, to enable the interactive exploration of data through visualization with the goal of generating new hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Intensive care units (ICUs) are becoming a popular setting for precision medicine and exploratory data analysis due to the abundance and complexity of the data collected. One specific area of interest is in physiologic waveform monitoring and the responsiveness of these waveforms to treatment with vasoactive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis we first investigate statistical techniques for analyzing physiological waveform data. Problems with this approach are discussed, including the preponderance of significant p-values, and the obscuring of important relationships between data types. Due to these problems, time series analysis and machine learning methods including clustering are explored. We undertake a prospective observational study which generated a novel multi-modal dataset of waveform data with associated clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data from this study led to the development of EVENTIVe, an exploratory event-based interactive data visualization platform. EVENTIVe provides an efficient and user-directed means of investigating complex physiological and clinical time series. An event-based data structure is described, including semi-structured document-style storage formats. Time series changepoint detection, hierarchical clustering, and K-Means clustering are included as exploration options. EVENTIVe encourages users to review individual data points through visualization, in addition to measures of central tendency and dispersion. Through EVENTIVe insights into the effects of vasoactive interventions in the ICU on physiological parameters were explored with new hypotheses generated. This work sets the stage for many future studies into the short-term physiological disturbances occurring in critically ill patients, helping the progression towards the use of precision medicine in these settings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Limited research attends to the quality of participation in sport for persons with disabilities (i.e., disability sport), or the role of coaches in shaping the quality of athletes’ disability sport experiences. To address these knowledge gaps, this dissertation examined quality participation and coaching effectiveness in disability sport. Guided by the Knowledge to Action framework, the knowledge created in Manuscripts 1-3 contributed to the development of a learning tool for disability sport coaches in Manuscript 4. &#xD;
Manuscript 1 (Chapter 3) explored the meanings that athletes with physical disabilities attribute to their participation in disability sport over time. Two-part life history interviews were conducted with 21 athletes with a physical disability and narratively analyzed. Five distinct narrative types were identified, representing differential developmental trajectories and meanings of participation in disability sport. &#xD;
Manuscript 2 (Chapter 4) examined athletes’ perceptions of effective disability sport coaching throughout development. A subset of the data collected for Manuscript 1 focused on athletes’ experiences with disability sport coaches. These data were separated and thematically analyzed. Two overarching themes reflected patterns in coaches’ knowledge, beliefs, and behaviours related to (a) positive and negative experiences in disability sport, and (b) the context. &#xD;
Manuscript 3 (Chapter 5) investigated how effective (i.e., model) disability sport coaches shape successful programs for athletes with disabilities. A collective case study of six disability sport programs was performed, including document review, mobile interviews, and semi-structured interviews with coaches and athletes. Cases were independently analyzed and compared. The beliefs and vision of each coach corresponded to the implementation of core values that translated into quality experiences for athletes across four layered themes. &#xD;
Manuscript 4 (Chapter 6) produced an evidence-informed learning tool for disability sport coaches. The findings of Manuscripts 1-3 were synthesized alongside other relevant sources of knowledge to identify target behaviours and behavioural determinants. Following stakeholder review, an ethnographic creative nonfiction was crafted to demonstrate and provide information about coach behaviours that facilitate quality experiences for athletes with a disability. &#xD;
Overall, this dissertation contributes toward deepening our understanding of athlete development, quality participation, and coaching effectiveness in disability sport. These findings may be used by researchers and practitioners to create, deliver, and promote quality programs for athletes with a disability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Transition metal-catalyzed higher-order carbocyclization reactions provide a versatile and atom-economical approach to the construction of carbo- and heterocyclic ring systems.  The ability to efficiently assemble complex and often functionalized (poly)cyclic molecules from relatively simple starting materials in a highly regio-, diastereo- and/or enantioselective manner, depending on the substrate(s) and metal catalyst employed, provides an attractive method for target-directed synthesis.  In this regard, rhodium-catalyzed cyclocarbonylation reactions afford a convenient route to the synthesis of various cyclic ketone derivatives, and the utility of these transformations is emphasized by the number of natural product syntheses incorporating this transformation as a key ring-forming step.  The following thesis is divided into three key chapters, encompassing a literature review followed by two research chapters, further divided according to the type of transformation discussed.&#xD;
Chapter 1 commences with an overview of transition metal-catalyzed higher order carbocyclization reactions and an introduction to the Pauson–Khand reaction, which is followed by a detailed account of various rhodium-catalyzed semi-intermolecular [(m+n)+1] cyclocarbonylation processes.  The final section in this chapter presents the application of rhodium-catalyzed cyclocarbonylation reactions to the total synthesis of several complex natural products.&#xD;
Chapter 2 describes the development of the rhodium-catalyzed [(3+2)+1] carbocyclization reaction of alkylidenecyclopropane (ACP) derivatives with carbon monoxide (CO).  Following a brief introduction on the chemistry of three-carbon components in metal-catalyzed carbocyclization processes, our work on the carbocyclization reaction of ACPs with CO for the construction of bicyclic phenols will be presented.  The last section in Chapter 2 will discuss the development of the cyclocarbonylation reaction of ACPs containing tetrasubstituted olefins with CO to provide bicyclohexa-2,5-dienones.&#xD;
Chapter 3 begins with an introduction to the enantioselective Pauson–Khand-type (PK-type) reaction of various 1,6-enyne derivatives with CO.  The remainder of Chapter 3 is given to the discussion of our efforts towards the enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed PK-type reaction of 1,6-chloroenynes containing trisubstituted olefins for the preparation of bicyclopentenones containing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers.  The preliminary scope and some of the limitations of this process will be outlined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Geographies of everyday life intersect diabetes in interesting ways with emotional and physical consequences. How do those with diabetes seek and create spaces of freedom from these consequences in everyday life? Looking to archival materials and social media discourse, I use a geographical, feminist lens to argue that the diabetic body is a place, a site, for historical and current applications of biomedical technologies that have embodied, emotional consequences for lifeworlds of people with diabetes. Before the discovery of insulin, everyday life with diabetes consisted of persistent high blood glucose levels, starvation diets, calorie counting, hopelessness, diminished lifeworlds, and early death. Now, nearly a century later, for those with access, treatment of diabetes may include the use of an increasing number of pharmaceutical innovations and technological devices to quantify and manage life with diabetes. These pro- grammed/programmable devices are interfaced with human flesh, described as part of an individual’s body and identity, creating diabetic cyborgs. Those embodying these devices seek liberation from negative consequences by hacking them, meaning to use or program the devices in ways not intended or against medical advisement, in order to individualize improvements to the device’s function. Management of diabetes produces personal biomedical waste from daily use of ‘disposable’ items. I use Reddit data to show how some seek freedom from the burden of waste management, while others seek freedom from guilt within a framework of biocitizenship.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research aims to examine the Greek tholoi of the Classical and Hellenistic period focusing on the monuments from Olympia, Delphi, Epidauros, Samothrace, Cyrene, Limyra, and Knidos. These buildings have been examined separately and the similarities of each structure and the influences they may have had upon the others have been stressed. Comparing information from primary sources (literature and inscriptions) and archaeological evidence it seems that the round shape of these buildings is related to the heroic and dynastic cult, which started with Philip II and Alexander the Great and was later continued by the Ptolemies. I believe that the antecedent to the tholos used as a building for the dynastic cult may be identified in the heroon dedicated to Herakles Patroos (Fatherly) in the Macedonian Palace at Verghina. The Macedonian Royal House believed that Herakles was an ancestor of them and worshipped him as such.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The moduli spaces parametrizing isomorphism classes of vector bundles are poorly understood. For certain choices of the first Chern class and a suitable second Chern class, we show that there exists an ample line bundle on a smooth complete toric surface for which the moduli space of rank two vector bundles is isomorphic to projective space. For the other choices of the first Chern class, we demonstrate with an example that the moduli space can still be isomorphic to projective space. To compute the topological Euler characteristic of a moduli space of rank two vector bundles, we look at its set of torus-fixed points and give it an interpretation in terms of the torus-equivariant vector bundles. Using a correspondence between collections of filtrations and torus-equivariant vector bundles given in [Kly89], we interpret the torus-fixed points of the moduli space as configurations of points on the projective line. We use this configuration to compute Euler characteristics of moduli spaces on a Hirzebruch surface.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Drawing on Canada’s abundant forest resources, the Canadian pulp and paper industry has long been a significant contributor to GDP and a major consumer of industrial energy. In recent years, however, the industry has faced declines due to declines in paper consumption and increased overseas competition. Our study seeks to examine how the industry can be revitalized through the exploitation of waste residue streams for chemical and energy production.&#xD;
The Millar Western BCTMP mill at Whitecourt, AB and the Tembec (now Rayonier) sulphite mill in Temiscaming, PQ were examined, and flow streams and waste residue generation were identified and quantified. At the Tembec mill, daily flow data was used to make predictions on quantities and consistencies of various residual streams. The potential of these flows to support chemical and energy production at the mills was explored. Using natural gas cost as a proxy for price, the economic value of residual biomass as energy was determined and contrasted against potential value from chemical products. Although limited by lack of compositional analyses of residue streams and incomplete economic data, use of pilot plant examples facilitated this comparison.&#xD;
Waste residue streams were identified at both sawmill and pulping phases. Sludge flow was recognized as having the greatest potential for exploitation; it was the largest stream producing on average between 260 and 440 tonnes per day, and currently not being used at either mill for economic gain. Analysis of Tembec data displayed that daily flow streams were highly variable in their values. Correlation analyses, however, suggested that practices such as stockpiling could be exploited to decrease this variability in daily quantity.&#xD;

It was found that the value of biomass as energy was highly volatile, fluctuating from C$ 34-153/ tonne of biomass during the study period. Such value was additionally seen to be highly sensitive to the heating value of the biomass, which can be expected to change with the moisture content and type of residue. Similarly, based on literature reviews, exploitation of residues for chemical production of NCC and isolated lignin was determined to plausible, and quantities from sludge were deemed capable of meeting pilot scale levels. Further compositional analyses, investigation into dewatering processes, and research into the economics is needed to consider scaling these chemical productions to a larger level.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis considers Megan Boler’s proposal for a pedagogy of discomfort, an approach to social justice education that harnesses students’ emotional responses of felt discomfort, such as anger or guilt, in order to prompt them to critically interrogate their existing beliefs, assumptions, and ways of seeing. Upon highlighting critiques of politicized curricula, I consider one potential objection that may be levelled against a pedagogy of discomfort, namely, that this pedagogy constitutes an imposition on students by the educator, infringing on students’ freedom to hold certain beliefs, assumptions, and ways of seeing. I argue that in cases where the would-be participants in a pedagogy of discomfort are the beneficiaries of the particular unjust social structure under scrutiny, this imposition is justified as a lesser evil.&#xD;
&#xD;
I then address some of the challenges that may arise from implementing a pedagogy of discomfort in classrooms in which some individuals are harmed by the particular unjust social structure under scrutiny. I suggest that two tensions arise from imposing this pedagogy on these individuals. First, subjecting these individuals to the process of critical inquiry appears to reproduce the conditions whereby they are denied status as epistemic agents. Second, the act of collective witnessing through which the process of critical inquiry takes place requires that all participants recognize one another as epistemic agents. However, I argue that this mutual recognition may not be present in classrooms in which some individuals are harmed by the particular unjust social structure under scrutiny. I argue that the presence of these two tensions gives reason for caution when imposing a pedagogy of discomfort on students who are harmed by the particular unjust social structure under scrutiny.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the last decade of the sixth century CE, the baptistery of the Episcopal Basilica at &#xD;
Stobi, presently located in the Republic of Macedonia, collapsed, which destroyed the roof and the interior support structure of the baptistery. When the building was excavated in 1971, the stratigraphy was difficult to interpret; scholars originally believed that the baptistery had been undisturbed, even though there was no evidence of the roof present in the stratigraphy. To date, two very different reconstructions have been made. The first (figs. 7-8), made by William Dinsmoor in 1975, was disproved by subsequent archeological discoveries. A second reconstruction (fig. 9) was published in 2006 by James Wiseman, but failed to include any supporting evidence from comparanda. Since no adequate reconstruction attempt has been made, this paper will put forth a new reconstruction for the baptistery, supported by a photogrammetry-derived 3D model and evidence of similar baptisteries from the same period.  Additional research topics which have not been addressed in the existing scholarship of the baptistery will also be discussed, including the provenance of the kantharos and the function of the structure found underneath the baptistery.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the last decade, the democratic failure that appeared in parliamentary democracies in parts of post-communist Europe defies earlier expectations about democratic consolidation in that region. This doctoral dissertation develops an explanation for the question of why and how some new parliamentary democracies regress into authoritarianism. It analyzes the autocratization of two countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Hungary and Macedonia, that had previously been cited as “success stories” in their respective sub-regions. The question is addressed through a structured comparative analysis of post-communist political development in Hungary and Macedonia. The main argument developed in this study is two-fold. First, the analysis explains the way in which a democratic parliamentary system can transform itself into a particular form of authoritarianism—competitive authoritarianism. Second, it offers an explanation about the conditions under which autocratization occurred in the two countries. Autocratization transpired through both institutional and extra-institutional mechanisms. The institutional mechanisms included targeted legislative changes that undermined the democratic checks on executive power in the parliamentary system, without completely dismantling democratic institutions. The extra- institutional mechanisms included a targeted dismantling of civil society checks on executive power—through the co-optation or elimination of free and independent media, reconfiguration of the non-governmental sector and independent civil associations, as well as the take-over of business by the inner circles of the prime ministers. These cases demonstrate that a parliamentary democracy can transition into a non-democratic form of governance, regardless of the degree of its prior democratic consolidation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Discontinuities (joints, fractures, faults, bedding planes etc.) in rockmasses are an important mechanical component of a rockmass.  In low to moderate in situ stress conditions where gravity-driven failure dominates, these discontinuities act as planes of weakness and govern the material response.  Discontinuity behaviour can have a large impact in geotechnical design, and therefore it is essential to determine their geomechanical properties in order to predict rockmass behaviour and prevent any potential failure that would pose a threat to personnel safety or damage property.  A common method of determining the mechanical properties (e.g. stiffness, strength, and dilation) of rockmass discontinuities, which are used as inputs for numerical geotechnical design, is through laboratory direct shear testing. Direct shear testing is typically conducted using two different boundary conditions: constant normal stress (CNL*) and constant normal stiffness (CNS). The CNL* boundary condition represents fracture behaviour in slopes and near surface conditions where gravity loading dominates, while the CNS boundary condition is considered to better reflect behaviours of fractures in underground excavations where in situ and induced stresses control rockmass stability and joint opening (dilation) is suppressed during shear.  &#xD;
This research addresses the further refinement of direct shear laboratory testing protocols (sample selection, test program creation, and test procedure) and understanding of the behaviour of rock joints under constant normal stiffness boundary conditions.  Furthermore, a machine normal stiffness estimation tool for CNS testing is developed in order to improve the reliability and applicability of CNS direct shear testing programs for tunneling applications.  Finally, intact geomechanical laboratory testing was completed (unconfined compressive strength and Brazilian indirect tensile strength testing) was completed to determine intact geomechanical properties.  A new secant dilation angle is created to characterize the post-yield behaviour of rock joints to be used an input to account for post-yield behaviour in numerical models. Measured geomechanical properties (fractures and intact rock) were then used to complete a preliminary numerical modelling program of laboratory scale direct shear tests.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Narrative messages are effective health promotion tools when the plot evokes positive feelings and when viewers identify with the characters; however, the dominant narrative of parasport participation currently circulated in the media (i.e., the performance narrative) likely perpetuates psychosocial barriers to parasport participation (e.g., low self-efficacy). The performance narrative is defined by its focus on athletic ability and overcoming disability. Alternative parasport narratives (i.e., relational, discovery) exist but are seldom used in parasport media. Guided by the Extended Elaboration Likelihood Model and the Health Action Process Approach as theoretical bases, this thesis aimed to explore whether (a) the type of parasport narrative and (b) identification with characters influence parasport participation. This online, longitudinal randomized controlled trial was completed by 194 Canadian adults with a physical disability who currently do not participate in parasport. Participation entailed completing quantitative surveys pre, post, and two weeks following three consecutive days of viewing a set of media messages capturing one of the three parasport narratives or control messages and completing thought listing tasks. The findings suggest that the discovery narrative may have an advantage in promoting parasport participation. Most participants (45%) preferred the discovery narrative, and chi-square analyses and repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed that the discovery narrative encouraged more positive thinking about the self (X2=6.32, p=.042) and about parasport (X2=5.95, p=.05), and led to increased barrier self-efficacy (F=6.89, p=.002). Intentions, risk perceptions, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity increased regardless of narrative viewed (p&lt;.05). Identification with characters was revealed as an important component of parasport behaviour change with task self-efficacy (R2=0.17) and outcome expectancies (R2=0.19) mediating the relationship between identification with characters and intentions to participate in parasport. Despite the importance of identification with characters, participants in all intervention groups expressed feeling dissimilar to the characters in the messages in terms of their competitiveness, elite status, and body types. This finding emphasizes the importance of including characters who persons with physical disabilities can identify with in parasport media. This work presents important considerations for researchers and parasport communicators who aim to develop inclusive messaging that facilitates parasport participation among persons with physical disabilities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: The food environment has changed over the last few decades with a sharp rise in individuals eating outside of the home and the availability of packaged and ultra-processed products. These types of foods are desirable because they are convenient and also very palatable (Monteiro, et al., 2013; Slater, 2017). They are also branded and marketed intensely. As a consequence of this, we tend to over-consume them (Slater, 2017). Not surprisingly, young people’s diets have been adversely affected and many scholars have noted a “de-skilling” trend, such that young people’s food and cooking skills have deteriorated (Scrinis, 2007; Slater, 2017). However, the physical health, well-being, and food skills of adolescents can be positively impacted by food literacy, defined as the scaffolding that empowers individuals, communities, and nations through knowledge and skills that protect diet quality (Vidgen &amp; Gallegos, 2014). Purpose: This study sought to understand key informants’ perspectives on food literacy goals and objectives, as well as the process by which food literacy might become a mandated component of Ontario secondary school curriculum. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 key informants from three groups of Ontario-based participant pools: experts in the field of food literacy; experts in the curriculum process; and current high school teachers. Results: Thematic analysis was utilized to analyze participant transcripts. The goals and learning objectives of a food literacy component as well as five major themes were identified that pertain to the research questions. These themes are: need for a common definition of food literacy; changing perceptions of food literacy; need for collaboration; need for resources; and lobbying the government. Discussion: Participants had similar responses to most questions. There are several strategies food literacy advocates must consider to overcome the barriers preventing a mandatory food literacy component in Ontario secondary school curriculum. These strategies include utilizing collaborative work efforts in order to come to an agreed upon definition of food literacy and the use of advocacy strategies to change perceptions and lobby the government.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In visual search, top-down task knowledge and bottom-up stimulus salience interact to determine where observers are most likely to attend. Past research has demonstrated that during search tasks, scene regions with a high probability of containing the target (spatially relevant regions) are more likely to be attended than regions with low target-probability (spatially irrelevant regions; Chastain &amp; Cheal, 1997; Pereira &amp; Castelhano, 2018; Travis, Mattingley, &amp; Dux, 2013). Pereira and Castelhano (2018) demonstrated that abrupt-onset distractors are more likely to be fixated when they appear within spatially relevant regions; however, the attentional mechanisms underlying this differential processing are not fully understood. Two hypotheses could explain the attentional mechanisms involved: firstly, information in spatially relevant regions may be enhanced, such that distractors in this area are more likely to capture attention. Secondly, information in spatially irrelevant regions may be inhibited, such that distractors in spatially irrelevant regions are actively suppressed. The present study assessed these two possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive.&#xD;
Here, we aimed to assess three classic ERP components – two associated with attentional capture (the P1 and the N2pc), and one with active suppression (the PD). There were two types of searches: object search, wherein scene context was relevant, and letter search, wherein context was not relevant.  We found that overall task engagement was low, as reflected in both ERP data and accuracy scores. As such, we were unable to perform statistical comparisons on our ERP results; however, qualitative analyses suggest that attentional distributions did not vary depending on the spatial relevance of distractor positioning. This is more likely to reflect limitations of our paradigm than the nature of attentional deployment during visual search. We conclude with recommendations for future paradigms that concentrated on strengthening task engagement as well as distractor saliency.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The decans were a set of thirty-six stars or constellations selected by the Egyptians in the First Intermediate Period as a means of marking the progression of the hours during the night.  The rising of each decan on the horizon would mark the beginning of a new hour. The decans were depicted most often by the Egyptians in a funerary context, which led scholars to believe their initial function was not just astronomical but deeply religious as well. Once Egypt became colonized by Hellenistic rulers, the decans were adapted into the imported Babylonian zodiac. Once incorporated into the Hellenistic astrological system, which synthesized elements of both Egypt and Mesopotamia, the decans were believed to influence human health through the bonds of cosmic sympathy – the idea that all celestial bodies impacted human life in one way or another. The decans were each assigned to various sub-sections of the human body in a practice called melothesia. Once this assignment was established, a tradition of creating medical amulets emerged, allowing individuals to create folk remedies to alleviate disease and injury. The purpose of this paper is to review, synthesize, and contextualize the existent research on the decans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The early twentieth century was a time of high-profile commentary in the U.S. regarding new roles for women, the convention-defying “New Woman,” and adolescence in the context of girls’ lives. Girls’ fiction included family-oriented texts, as well as, to borrow from Nancy Tillman Romolav, “series books” that “did not attempt to woo the adult through their language, subject or pedagogical value . . .” (90). This study explores major books (from both kinds of girls’ fiction, namely Wiggin’s Rebecca books and the Stratemeyer Syndicate’s Ruth Fielding series, along with, to a lesser extent, its first Dorothy Dale text) concerned with “New Girls” as they grow from their pre-teen/early-teen years to young womanhood; I examine whether differences relating to whether adult readership is sought affect how the books compare in terms of addressing adult-imposed impediments that the girls face. &#xD;
&#xD;
I argue that, underneath such differences, the books share the assumption that young-girl readers—as imagined by the texts—are not the right audience, or at least not the right primary audience, for a comprehensive look at the mixture of ageism and patriarchy. The books assume that outright dislodging adult-imposed limitations is beyond what young-girl readers can do. This assumption constitutes a unifying feature of major American coming-of-age “New Girl” fiction for girls of the time. At a broader political level, in lacking signs of a belief that the imagined girl readers deserve to be fully aware of their social situation, the texts themselves actually confirm the pervasiveness in their society of a lamentable adult conservative attitude towards girls. &#xD;
&#xD;
This finding is relevant to discussing the social context and this genre in 1900-1920, and should also matter more generally to scholars of American girls’ fiction (including works of our era, given how girls and women are still oppressed), as well as to critics who might pursue cross-national comparisons. Crucially, this study is not about what actual child readers know, think, or understand; rather, it discusses how the texts imagine girl readers. As Lukens, Smith, and Coffel note, “Children’s literature is written by adults for children as adults imagine children to be” (6).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction:&#xD;
Feedback about intraoperative performance remains a cornerstone of surgical training, and yet perceptions of feedback quality by supervising surgeons and surgical residents differ. Video playback offers one potential method for more effective feedback to surgical residents. More research is needed to better understand this tool. This study explores the nature of instructional interactions and feedback in the operating room and when using video playback during post-operative review.&#xD;
Methods:&#xD;
Three surgical residents and five supervising surgeons were involved in six laparoscopic cases. Data collected included the intraoperative and video playback conversations between the resident and supervising surgeon and semi-structured interviews exploring the resident and supervising surgeon experience of using video playback as a feedback tool. A combination of deductive, inductive and hermeneutic analytic approaches was used. Data was triangulated to develop the big ideas.&#xD;
Results:&#xD;
Analysis of the intraoperative verbal interactions identified that the majority of these interactions (48%) were instrumental and didactic in nature. By contrast, most interactions during video playback were teaching in nature (65%) and the sessions were dialogic. Video playback was perceived as a valuable tool by residents and supervising surgeons for feedback on surgical performance. Participants valued the exact visual representation of the surgical performance provided by the video as it provided cues for specific feedback. They also perceived the video playback environment to be calm and lower in cognitive load, allowing for optimized learning. Both the residents and supervising surgeons found the video was a useful tool to self- reflect on their own performance. These results were further explored through the lenses of social cognitive theory and cognitive load theory.&#xD;
Conclusions:&#xD;
The two big ideas which emerged from this research were: the environment in which video playback occurred contributed positively to the feedback experience, and feedback using video playback is a dialogic critical visual review of the performance. Video playback provided a surgical learning opportunity outside of the operating room which maintained the contextual verity of the surgical case performed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Organizations and health resources or products with strong brands can augment interventions encouraging people to move more, sit less, and sleep better. This manuscript-based dissertation is composed of four studies that were designed with the purpose of enhancing our understanding of what makes a strong brand for promoting the full continuum of movement behaviours from sleep to vigorous physical activity.&#xD;
Study 1 examined a physical activity organization brand to test the brand equity pyramid. Participants were a large, representative sample of Canadian adults. The analyses indicated that there was a five-factor brand equity framework (i.e., brand identity, brand meaning, brand responses, brand resonance, and intentions), and that each factor positively predicted the next.&#xD;
Study 2 examined a product brand to test the brand equity pyramid. Participants were a representative sample of Canadian parents with a child 5-12 years of age. The study demonstrated a four-factor brand equity framework in this case (i.e., brand identity, brand meaning [performance beliefs and imagery beliefs], and brand resonance), and that brand identity predicted performance and imagery, and performance and imagery predicted resonance.&#xD;
Study 3 also explored the brand of a product to test the brand equity pyramid. This study was an experiment comparing a brand intervention group to a control group. Participants in this study were similar in make-up to those in Study 2. Most importantly, the intervention group displayed a more positive attitude toward reducing their child’s sedentary behaviour and this effect was mediated by product credibility, warmth, and fun.&#xD;
Finally, Study 4 investigated determinants of attitude toward an organization’s promotion of a behaviour (i.e., brand extension attitude) to their child. Participants in this study were similar to individuals in Studies 2 and 3. The results generally indicated that participants were most amenable to the organization’s promotion of more light and moderate to vigorous physical activity, more sleep, and less sedentary behaviour when participants had a positive organizational attitude and when the participants perceived strong fit between the organization and the behaviour.&#xD;
This dissertation demonstrated that branding matters in the promotion of optimal movement patterns. The results identify brand equity variables that organizations can target to enhance their interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Autonomous vehicles’ positioning and navigation (POS/NAV) systems provide drivers with route guidance information relying mostly on the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The GNSS–based POS/NAV systems suffer from satellite signal blockage, interference and multipath usually experienced by land vehicles in urban areas. The integration with vehicle motion sensors enhances the overall performance for a short period of time. Autonomous land vehicles are now equipped with cameras, radars, and laser ranging devices utilized for blind spot display, collision avoidance, and lane departure warning. The availability of these systems provides an attractive opportunity to increase the POS/NAV system accuracy.&#xD;
This research focuses on the development of an integrated multi-sensor POS/NAV system capable of offering seamless positioning at meter level accuracy for autonomous land vehicles. To bridge the GNSS outages a multi-sensor system utilizing magnetic azimuth from a calibrated magnetometer is developed to enhance the performance of the overall POS/NAV solution by limiting the gyroscope bias drift over time. A new calibration technique is developed to reduce the errors associated with the magnetometer measurements and produce a robust azimuth. Furthermore, a new algorithm is developed to obtain robust positioning information from the adaptive cruise control frequency modulated continuous wave (ACC-FMCW) radar which is used to update the navigation system during GNSS outages.&#xD;
The proposed system is further improved by augmenting magnetic-azimuth update to limit the position drift for long GNSS outages. A further enhancement is added to the system by utilizing fast orthogonal search (FOS) to provide nonlinear error modeling of the residual errors associated with the ACC-FMCW radar positioning solution in order to reduce the error growth over extended and frequent GNSS outages.&#xD;
The proposed system is evaluated on several real road test trajectories involving different types of land vehicles experiencing different motion dynamics. GNSS outages of up to 10 minutes were intentionally introduced to examine the performance. The results show that the proposed method has resulted in a significant performance improvement in the positioning accuracy that can reach more than 80% if compared to the present methods that rely only on integrating the inertial sensor technology with GNSS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Non-aqueous poly(acrylic) dispersions (NADs) used in automotive coating formulations are heterogeneous high-solids suspension of polymeric nano-size particles (&lt; 200 nm) produced by radical polymerization in organic hydrocarbon medium. An important component of the system is the low molecular weight (MW) reactive polymeric dispersant (5000-6000 Da), which stabilizes the particles formed. A vinyl-terminated butyl methacrylate (BMA) macromonomer dispersant (type A) has been shown to be more effective at stabilizing the nanoparticles formed during the NAD synthesis than a BMA based grafted dispersant with vinyl groups attached at random positions along the backbone. However, incorporating 10 mol% 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as a functional comonomer in the macromonomer dispersant, a necessary addition for end-use properties, caused the final dispersion to lose stability.  A series of experiments was conducted to show that the particle size distribution, viscosity and stability of the final dispersion can be correlated to the thermodynamic solubility distances among the dispersant, solvent and polymer particle compositions. The investigation led to the use of ethylhexyl methacrylate (EHMA) as the main component of the macromonomer, with a stable NAD system achieved even with 28 mol% HEMA added to the macromonomer composition. &#xD;
  The macromonomer, although having controlled double-bond placement through catalytic chain transfer chemistry, still has a molecular weight dispersity of close to two. Thus, a low dispersity P(BMA) macromonomer was synthesized by sequential atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and catalytic chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) to achieve a similar number-average MW and terminal double bond functionality. Using both methyl acrylate homopolymerization and methyl methacrylate/methyl acrylate (70/30 w/w) copolymerization to produce NADs, the lower dispersity P(BMA) macromonomer provides better stabilization per dispersant chain, as characterized by smaller average particle size and higher weight fraction of incorporated dispersant. A model was developed in the Predici® software package (Version 11) to improve the understanding of the sequential ATRP-CCTP process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous scholarship on women in Etruscan tomb painting has grounded its conclusion on a number of select, well distinguished tombs that have been used to support or disprove the claim that women held a prominent position in Etruscan society. This research paper aims to expand the literature by compiling an extensive catalogue of tomb paintings at the Etruscan site of Tarquinia, to examine the representation and iconography of women between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE. Of the 135 painted tombs known in the Monterozzi necropolis of Tarquinia, there are 62 tombs that contain the depiction of women in various settings, including scenes of dance, athletics, the journey to the afterlife, and most frequently, the banquet. By analyzing the 24 tombs that contain scenes of the banquet where women are present, through their positioning, attire, and iconography, it is evident that the elite women in Etruscan society played an important role in the family. In comparison to scenes of the banquet in Greek art, as well as the accounts from ancient authors who comment on the scandalous actions of Etruscan women, a different picture emerges. The women depicted on the walls of these Etruscan tombs are not entertainers or subordinate companions. They are wives and mothers who, as members of the aristocracy, were essential figures in maintaining the family lineage and as such held greater authority and power. It is within these family tombs that they were honored and respected in this role.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Temporal enhanced Ultrasound (TeUS) is a non-invasive imaging approach, recently proposed by our group.  TeUS makes use of ultrasound time series for tissue classification, and it has been successfully applied to ex vivo prostate tissue classification, breast cancer detection, and prostate cancer grading. &#xD;
&#xD;
Of particular importance is the physical phenomenon underlying the tissue characterizing capability of TeUS. Our group previously proposed that physiological micro-vibrations are a source of tissue differentiation. These micro-vibrations are induced by blood perfusion (heart beat: ~ 1 Hz) and breathing (0.2-0.4 Hz). Our group then derived a theory that integrates the effect of micro-vibrations into the standard imaging equation. We validated this theory by digitally simulating micro-vibrations in benign and cancerous pathology and demonstrated that response to the micro-vibrations can be the basis for differentiating the tissues. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis aims to find experimental evidence to support the theory. Specifically, I accurately simulated and measured micro-vibrations; I then studied the mechanical properties of the tissue and their relationship to TeUS, through tissue mimicking phantom studies. &#xD;
&#xD;
First, I adapted a fiber optic sensor for micro-vibration detection. The sensor was shown to be capable of simultaneously capturing low frequency micro-vibration as well as megahertz ultrasound transmission waveforms. The sensor is expected to be an invaluable tool for studying micro-vibrations and developing advanced ultrasound tissue characterization technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
I then developed and characterized tissue mimicking phantoms with an integrated micro-vibration mechanism. To investigate the effects of micro-vibrations on TeUS, I built the tissue mimicking phantoms that differed in ultrasound scatterer size and elasticity. I collected TeUS signals and showed that TeUS is sensitive to scatterer size and elasticity through micro-vibrations. These results provided experimental evidence to the hypothesis that physiological micro-vibrations are a cause of TeUS differentiation, as proposed by our group's previous work. They also warrant the translation of TeUS to other types of material characterization tasks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Schools provide adolescents with opportunities to form healthy relationships and feel a sense of belonging connected to others. Although youth are provided with opportunities to belong at school, some adolescents are victimized by peers within their school communities. Adolescents who are bullied may be at risk for feeling excluded at school. Students’ feelings of not belonging at school may explain the link between peer victimization and adverse mental health and school-related problems. While peer victimization increases the risk of negative outcomes, experiences of victimized youth can differ across schools. School climate assesses characteristics of the school environment, including the quality of relationships, norms, and expectations of the school community. Understanding how school climate may buffer the risks associated with peer victimization can inform efforts to cultivate safe and supportive school environments. The current thesis consists of two studies. These studies examined how school belonging may explain the link between peer victimization and both mental health and school-related outcomes. In both studies, we examined how positive school climates may reduce the risk of negative mental health and academic outcomes associated with peer victimization. Results indicated that school belonging partially explained the relationship between peer victimization and adolescent outcomes. Peer victimization was negatively associated with adolescents’ sense of school belonging, which in turn, was related to negative mental health and school-related outcomes. While positive school climate and high levels of school safety protected victimized boys in higher grades, these school characteristics exacerbated the risks among girls in specific grade-levels. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of helping adolescents feel that they belong at school. In addition, our findings highlight a need to better understand how to cultivate school environments that foster feelings of belonging among victimized adolescents.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents novel control techniques to improve the performance of DC optimizers for harvesting solar energy in DC microgrids. The focus of this thesis is to implement a reliable and efficient structure to harvest the maximum power from solar panels. &#xD;
	To increase the efficiency of the system, a control scheme is presented that provides the converter with zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) capability. ZVS can significantly eliminate switching losses and provide highly efficient and reliable operation for the DC optimizer. This task is done through a variable frequency peak current mode (PCM) control technique. Implementing this ZVS control scheme increases the input inductor current ripple. Therefore, an interleaved structure is used, which is able to reduce the input current ripple through the phase shifting of the inductor currents in the system. To implement the phase shifting technique, the first interleaved converter is selected as the base converter. The switching period of the base converter is measured by a switching frequency indicator unit. The one-third point and two-thirds point of the base converter’s switching period is calculated and imposed as delays to the second and third interleaved converters’ gate signals, respectively. Finally, an observer-based control technique is proposed that can estimate the control parameters, including the precise inductor current, both in continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). Thus, instead of an expensive and complex current sensor-based analog variable frequency PCM design, the inductor values in the system are estimated by a digital observer-based estimation block and used in the closed loop control system. Therefore, the whole closed-loop control system is implemented by a fully digital controller. This control scheme eliminates the need for expensive and inaccurate current sensors in the system. The proposed techniques are verified for performance through simulation and experimental results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study begins with a discussion regarding the military crises of third and early fourth century Roman Empire and how they appear to have missed Sicily entirely, resulting in the island entering a period of prosperity, especially in the rural regions. The direct link between the establishment of Constantinople as capital of the Empire and Sicily’s subsequent economic boom is also examined. Within this historical context, the relationship between the mosaics of North Africa and those of Sicily begins with a survey of the richly-decorated Villa Romana del Casale near modern-day Piazza Armerina. The extensive collections of mosaics adorning this villa are examined in depth and grouped thematically. Finally, comparisons of the motifs, and the methodologies used for creating these mosaics are made with similar, and in some cases even identical works found in North Africa, especially around Carthage. From this, it can be determined that not only were the mosaics of Piazza Armerina influenced by North African design, but they may have even been made by North African mosaicists themselves.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cardiovascular risk remains difficult to assess, particularly in women. It is known that patients with ankle-brachial index (ABI)-indicated peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Femoral ultrasound, a sensitive marker of PAD, has potential value as a screening tool. However, the association of femoral plaque burden with coronary artery disease (CAD) severity and extent remains unknown. Furthermore, little information is available on sex differences in the burden of PAD and its relationship to CAD, a consideration that may improve patient risk management algorithms. To explore this, five hundred study participants (34% female) underwent bilateral carotid and femoral ultrasound within 24 hours of coronary angiography. A subset of 124 participants underwent ABI measurements. It was found that in women, increased combined common femoral and carotid bulb plaque area yielded the strongest association with significant CAD (odds ratio (OR) 7.3 (95% CI 3.5-16.8)), independently of age and traditional cardiac risk factors, while in men, this was achieved by increased combined plaque height at the carotid bulb and femoral bifurcation (OR 4.3 (CI 2.4-8.2)). Additionally, ultrasound-detected femoral plaque burden more accurately identified participants with significant CAD (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.731) than ABI (AUC = 0.578) (p = 0.02). Femoral plaque burden had a higher sensitivity (84%) than ABI (25%) for ruling out disease. In conclusion, we determined sex-specific markers of ultrasound-detected atherosclerotic disease that may improve risk stratification when used uniquely in women and men. A combined assessment of common femoral and carotid plaque area is most advantageous in women, while men may benefit most from a combined analysis of carotid and femoral bifurcation plaque height. Furthermore, femoral ultrasound, while being an equally safe, inexpensive, and rapid tool, more accurately predicts significant coronary disease than a traditional ABI assessment. Used clinically, vascular ultrasound may have immense value when incorporated into cardiovascular management algorithms, especially for those patients in which risk remains uncertain despite the use of conventional stratification tools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The epidemiological evidence supporting an association between shift work, and cardiovascular diseases and hypertension is growing. However, few population-based studies have explored the relationship between shift work and hypertension risk and the potential mechanism(s) linking them.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: 1) To determine the association between shift work status and rates of hypertension in a cohort of Ontario working adults during a 12-year follow-up period; 2) To determine whether sleep quality mediates this relationship.&#xD;
Methods: The cohort included Ontario adult respondents of the 2000-01 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), which was linked to health administrative databases within the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Baseline shift work status, sleep quality, and covariate measures were obtained from the CCHS; time of hypertension diagnosis was ascertained from the ICES databases. The inception cohort included individuals who reported working with no pre-existing hypertension.  Follow-up was 12 years. We conducted a mediation analysis using the natural effects models that use marginal structural modeling to directly parameterize the natural direct and indirect effects of shift work on the rates of hypertension in a Cox proportional hazard model.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Shift workers reported lower frequency of refreshing sleep, more trouble sleeping, and poorer sleep quality overall. Night shift work was not associated with increased hypertension rates in either men (HR=1.15, 95% CI:0. 93-1.43) or women (HR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.96-1.57) during 12 years of follow-up, but the hazard ratios were in the hypothesized direction. Other shift work (including evening shifts, split shifts, irregular schedules, on-call, or other schedules) was associated with increased hypertension rates in men (HR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62) during 12 years of follow-up, but this association was not mediated through sleep quality (HR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01). Similar results were found among women (HR=1.30, 95% CI: 0.97-1.74) during 12 years of follow-up.&#xD;
Conclusions: Irregular working hours appear to increase hypertension rates. Shift work does disrupt sleep, but sleep quality does not appear to be a mediator between shift work and increased hypertension rates.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In cancer research, two-stage designs are usually used to assess the eﬀect of a new&#xD;
agent in phase II clinical trials. The optimal two-stage designs with two co-primary&#xD;
endpoints have been proposed to assess the eﬀects of new cancer treatments, such&#xD;
as cytostatic or molecularly targeted agents (MTAs), based on both response rate&#xD;
and early progression rate. Statistical inference procedures, such as, point estima&#xD;
tion, p-value, and conﬁdence region, for the true response rate and early progression&#xD;
rate based on the data from the phase II trials conducted according to the optimal&#xD;
two-stage designs would be very useful for further testing of the agents in phase III&#xD;
trials but have not been addressed in the literature. In this thesis, I ﬁrst provide a&#xD;
review of the optimal two-stage design for phase II clinical trials with one endpoint&#xD;
and statistical inference procedures developed for this design. Then I propose some&#xD;
new statistical inference procedures for the optimal two-stage design of phase II clin&#xD;
ical trials with two co-primary endpoints, which include naive maximum likelihood&#xD;
estimate (MLE), bias-corrected estimates, and uniformly minimum variance unbiased&#xD;
estimate (UMVUE) for the point estimation, naive p-value and likelihood ratio test&#xD;
(LRT) based p-value for the hypothesis testing, and LRT based conﬁdence region.&#xD;
Simulation studies were performed to evaluate the performance of these procedures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We exploit N-body simulations (GalactICS, Illustris, NIHAO) to study the impact of inclination on the estimates on various photometric and spectroscopic quantities of galaxies such as sizes, surface brightnesses, stellar masses, velocities, and dynamical masses. With the help of radiative transfer codes, we create mock images of galaxies to study the variation in sizes and various structural parameters as a function of inclination. We also generate observed rotation curves for Illustris and NIHAO galaxies to derive dynamical masses after correcting the rotation curves for inclinations. We  find that in the dust-free (transparent) case, sizes derived for edge-on and face-on orientations diff er on average by 10% (6%) for the half-light (isophotal) radii of massive galaxies. However, for the same galaxies, the relative change in stellar masses due to inclination is insignificant, as expected for transparent systems. We compare our simulated size and mass measurements against the observed size-mass relation of CALIFA galaxies and conclude that inclination effects can contribute up to 20% of its slope. The inferred slope of the simulated size-mass relation remains in agreement with the observed relation within calculated errors. After correcting rotation curves of galaxies for basic projection effects, we also  find the maximum circular velocity for Illustris galaxies varies by as much as 17%. Moreover, the velocity-stellar mass relation of Illustris galaxies is a poor match to observations (Ouellette et al. 2017). These discrepancies are attributed to numerical resolution issues and inadequate feedback prescriptions in Illustris. To circumvent these issues, we use NIHAO zoom-in simulations given their adequate and robust sub-grid physics implementation and  find better agreements with observations. The future extension of this study will involve high-resolution zoom-in simulation that account for dust attenuation in a clumpy medium. With dust in the mix, projected galaxy sizes are expected to change significantly.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Participatory Sensing (PS) is an approach that offers individuals and interest groups the opportunity to contribute to an application using their handheld sensor devices such as smartphones and tablets. These sensor devices are able to sense, collect available data and use cellular and Internet communication infrastructure such as LTE and WiFi to transmit the data to the application server. The application server processes the collected data and makes the data available to the end-users. Participant contributions consist of sensor data, location, date and time. In addition, PS applications usually need to collect additional data about participants such as identity, age, gender and contact.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the numerous benefits the PS approach brought to the application domain, there are two main challenges that threaten the success of PS: data trustworthiness and participant privacy. The additional data collected from participants’ devices are essential to verify the credibility of participants and the accuracy of their contributions. Moreover, these additional participant data are considered private. Thus, ensuring data trustworthiness and accuracy sacrifices the participant privacy, and vice versa.&#xD;
In this thesis, we propose a framework for PS that involves three major schemes to overcome the challenges of accuracy-privacy trade-off. The framework ensures participant contribution data trustworthiness in PS applications, verifies the accuracy of participant contributions in critical situations, and protects participant privacy in critical situations.&#xD;
PS applications are usually open to the public, and receive sensor data from multiple participants. This openness feature of PS applications allows inaccurate and corrupted contributions to affect the quality of the application services negatively. A way of ensuring contribution validity is by evaluating participant reputation values through a designed reputation system. Therefore, we propose a Reputation System to Evaluate Participants (RSEP) to ensure participant contribution data trustworthiness and provide accurate participant contributions.&#xD;
When a crisis occurs, immediate response by rescue personnel is crucial. Decisions for a rescue plan are based solely on data about the crisis from the location. Receiving data from the public could potentially result in corrupted and inaccurate data that will negatively impact the rescue plans. Therefore, we propose a Participant Contribution Trust scheme (PCT) that allows the PS application to verify the accuracy of contributions before sending the data to the crisis response system that requires all available data in order to reach its optimal performance.&#xD;
In critical situations when a crisis occurs, the accuracy-privacy trade-off becomes more complex. Adding more weight to one side needing accurate data, over the other, risking breach of privacy, may become essential due to the specific situation. When a participant is at risk, data accuracy becomes more important than participant privacy. Thus, we propose a Context-Aware Privacy scheme (CAP) that balances the privacy-accuracy trade-off. The CAP scheme eventually provides privacy-preserved data to authorized recipients based on the status of the participants. Depending on the recipient category, their role and policies enforced, a different level of participants’ private data may be received.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A library of cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes have been established for their uses as luminescent probes for the detection of molecular oxygen. By varying the N,C-chelates of the OSPs (oxygen sensing probes), it was determined that benzothiophene-pyridyl chelates have greater sensitivities compared to the benzofuran-pyridyl and pyridyl-indole chelates. By further altering the backbone with the attachment of dimesityl boron, an enhancement in the oxygen sensitivity was observed, establishing borylation as a sensible strategy to improve an OSPs performance. The second part of this study examined phenyl-triazole N,C-chelate Pt(II) complexes as OSPs and it was observed that functionalization with a diphenyl amine moiety substantially increased the quenching of phosphorescence. These changes are mainly due to the increase in phosphorescence decay lifetime allowing for a greater interaction between the excited state complex and O2, leading to efficient quenching. Majority of the films showed high photostability due to minimal photobleaching (oxidation in the excited state), are fully reversible in conjunction with having acceptable sensitivities; paving the path for potential topical applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Food insecurity, an issue of inadequate or insecure access to food due to financial constraints, is under-researched among older people. Of this limited literature, the relevance of aging to food insecurity remains unclear. My goals with this thesis were to: i) synthesize and critically examine the literature on food insecurity and aging; ii) contribute a profile of food insecurity among older people to the population estimates of food insecurity in Canada; and iii) examine more closely key predictors of food insecurity among older people in Canada. I undertook a scoping study, and characterized this collection of literature by methodological, empirical, and conceptual contributions. Population estimates varied greatly between studies, with an overall emphasis on individual risk and experience, alongside attempts to explicate a perceived complexity of this issue with respect to health. Of the very limited inclusion or application of theory overall, most emphasis was placed on frameworks of disease and disability, with many assumptions made about how aging relates to food insecurity. Taken together, these findings suggest a strong tendency towards biomedicalization. The two subsequent empirical studies involved the use of data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). In the second manuscript I found the overall prevalence of food insecurity among older Canadians to be 2.4%, and using a generalized linear model in the second manuscript, I found sex, age, racial background, self-perceived health, marital status, living arrangement, and low household income to be predictive of food insecurity. In the third manuscript, logistic regression revealed that women are at greater risk of food insecurity and this inequity largely operates through household income. Younger old people were most vulnerable to food insecurity, and age modified the relationship between household income and food insecurity. In the discussion chapter I offer a brief political-historical context of hunger and aging in Canada, explore the relevance and implications of the major findings from each study, and demonstrate the connection between consistent monitoring of food insecurity in exploring the geographic heterogeneity of this issue. Overall, I argue that, like younger populations, food insecurity among older people is an income-based issue.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, is known for its opportunistic way of infecting humans as well as other animals. Due to its pathogenicity, P. aeruginosa has been considered to be one of the top bacterial threats by the World Health Organization. It tends to infect targets with reduced immune systems and various tissues and organs, causing pneumonia, necrosis, and intestinal infection etc. P. aeruginosa, like other bacteria, has evolved different types of secretion systems to secrete a wide spectrum of virulence factors, especially various proteins and nucleotides. Bacteria use these molecular ‘weapons’ not only to adapt for surviving environments in the hosts but also to penetrate into hosts tissues to facilitate their colonization and proliferations, which further results in infections. &#xD;
        To date, out of seven identified types of bacterial secretion systems, the Type II secretion system (T2SS) is one of the best-characterized secretion systems, known for its capability of translocating large, structured protein molecules from the periplasm though the outer membrane into the extracellular milieu. &#xD;
        In P. aeruginosa, the T2SS is established through the synergistic combination of four structural assemblies formed by twelve Xcp proteins.  These four subcomplexes, from the perspective of function, can be divided into platform, engine, channel and piston, in which the piston, called pseudopilus, is of pivotal importance in the system as its tip complex, comprised by XcpU, -V, -W and -X, recognizes and binds to various virulence factors. &#xD;
        Aiming to better clarify the function-dependent structural features of this pseudopilus tip, we utilized X-ray protein crystallography to fully depict the architecture of the ternary complex of XcpVWX as well as to identify the core complex of XcpVW. The reconstruction of the entire tip complex was done using small-angle X-ray scattering, which exhibits an overall architecture of the pseudopilus tip and the plausible working model during the secretion. Through the elucidation of the detailed interaction interface of XcpV and -W, we developed two inhibitory peptides and four inhibitory compounds. It is confirmed that these structure-based molecules can interfere the interaction between XcpV and -W and compromise the pseudopilus tip complex. Due to the critical role of the XcpVW complex to the Type II secretion, the disruption of the XcpVW complex leads to the inhibition of the entire Type II secretion system. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as an investigation model, our research shows that the virulence of P. aeruginosa towards C. elegans has been reduced in the presence of the structure-based inhibitory molecules and that these molecules are able to alleviate the infection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the new public world of print that emerged and developed in the “Province of Quebec” from 1764 to 1791. Using discourse analysis, it argues that the press reflected, and contributed to producing the race and gender privileges of the White, respectable gentleman, also called the “honest man,” regardless of whether he was Canadien or of Anglo-descent. &#xD;
&#xD;
A British colony created by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Province of Quebec existed until 1791 when it was divided into the separate colonies of Upper and Lower Canada by the Constitutional Act. The colony’s development and dissolution corresponded with a growing population and changing demographics in the Saint Lawrence Valley, a brief increase in racial slavery in Montreal and Quebec City, and altered political and economic alliances between the White settler population and Native peoples of the North American interior after the defeat of the French in 1763 and following the emergence of the American Republic in 1783. Internally, changes brought about by the conclusion of the British Conquest in 1760, such as the introduction of British rule and English law in Quebec, were implemented alongside French ancien régime structures of legal and political governance that persisted mostly unhampered and fostered the preservation of an authoritarian-style government in the new “old” colony. At the same time, as of 1764, attempts by British authorities at cooperation with the Canadiens bred conflict between two groups of elites. This same conflict engendered cooperation across ethnic lines. Against this backdrop, the newly founded newspapers allowed for spaces where White gentlemen of diverging ethnic, political, and economic interests came together to engage in print sociability. &#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation concludes that when Quebec’s only newspapers, the Quebec Gazette, the Gazette du commerce et littéraire, the Montreal Gazette, and the Quebec Herald and Universal Miscellany disseminated discourses that associated manhood with loyalty to the English king, fashionable women with male status and problematic womanhood, “Blackness” with enslavement, an infantile nature, and exotic origins, and Indigeneity with violence, they legitimized the dominance of loyal White gentlemen in society regardless of their ethnic, political, or economic interests.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: In the Canadian context, ethical tensions for health promotion in relation with Indigenous health have received limited attention. Urban environments are particularly relevant for an anti-colonial critique of health promotion because urbanization processes have worked to exclude and marginalize Indigenous peoples. For this research, I partnered with M’Wikwedong Native Cultural Resource Centre, a friendship centre in Owen Sound, Ontario. Objectives: Firstly, to explore how M’Wikwedong fosters health in the city of Owen Sound from the perspective of Indigenous youth. Secondly, to suggest ways in which anti-colonial health promotion approaches can be advanced. Thirdly, to reflect on digital storytelling’s potential as an anti-colonial research method. Methods: In May 2017, I moved to Owen Sound. Ongoing volunteer work at M’Wikwedong allowed me to establish a research team. From January to August 2018, I worked with five youth co-researchers using a modified digital storytelling process that facilitated a critical and in-depth inquiry of my co-researchers’ perceptions about M’Wikwedong’s work and produced four videos (1-4 minutes). There were 13 research team meetings and 17 individual video-coaching sessions. We used semi-structured interviews and note-taking to document co-created data. I performed thematic analysis on interview transcripts, observation notes, and video scripts followed by discussions of emergent interpretations with youth co-researchers. Findings: Four thematic categories emerged. The first category highlights M’Wikwedong’s role in intervening in the city to foster welcoming places for Indigenous youth. The second focuses on the conditions that foster a sense of safety in urban environments. The third tackles the relevance of access to Indigenous ways of knowing and living in urban environments. Finally, the fourth emphasizes M’Wikwedong’s supports for youth in carrying on their ideas for making their city a better place to live. Implications: Using environmental repossession as a conceptual lens, M’Wikwedong’s work brings attention to the opportunities of an epistemic shift in health promotion: from an onus on ‘controlling’ health to an onus on fostering ‘connection’ as inherently health promoting. Methodologically, digital storytelling can be a successful process for advancing anti-colonial health promotion agendas if it is properly adapted to the local context and oriented by Indigenous research.</dcterms:abstract>
