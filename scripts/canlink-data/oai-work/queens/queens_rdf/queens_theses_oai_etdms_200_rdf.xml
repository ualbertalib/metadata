      <dcterms:abstract>Experimental and theoretical progress has been made toward the production and manipulation of novel atomic and molecular states. The design, construction and characterization of a driver for an acousto-optic modulator is presented which achieves a maximum diffraction efficiency of 54 % at 200 MHz, using a commercial modulator. A novel design is presented for a highly sensitive optical spectrum analyzer for displaying laser mode structure in real time. Utilizing programmable microcontrollers to read data from a CMOS image sensor illuminated by the diffraction pattern from a Fabry-Perot interferometer, this device can operate with beam powers as low as 3.3 micro-watts, at a fraction of the cost of equivalent products. Computational results are presented analyzing the behaviour of a model quantum system in the vicinity of an avoided crossing. The results are compared with calculations based on the Landau-Zener formula, with discussion of its limitations. Further computational work is focused on simulating expected conditions in the implementation of the STIRAP technique for coherent control of atoms and molecules in the beam experiment. The work presented provides tools to further the aim of producing large, mono-energetic populations of heavy Rydberg systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Experimental and theoretical investigations of highly-excited molecules are presented&#xD;
that advance the current state of knowledge of intramolecular interactions in highly-excited molecular states.&#xD;
A quantitative analysis of intramolecular interactions in excited hydrogen fluoride&#xD;
is presented, in which the rotational levels of the B singlet-Sigma+, v = 29 vibronic level are shown to mix with the corresponding e-parity components of the C singlet-Pi, v = 0 level. Extrapolating the experimentally-derived mixing parameter to the unperturbed limit reveals an unperturbed value of the aF hyperfine parameter of 4132(25) MHz. &#xD;
Coupling energies between the ion-pair curve and long-range asymptotes of covalent states are calculated for a large number of alkali–alkali collision channels, revealing&#xD;
the dependence on the internuclear distance at which the crossing takes place and&#xD;
forming a foundational step for the calculation of cross-sections and rate coefficients for different charge-exchange and other processes.&#xD;
To advance the experimental investigation of these systems, optical instrumentation&#xD;
and associated control systems have been designed and constructed for cooling&#xD;
and trapping lithium in preparation for experimental studies of cold-collisions that&#xD;
will be informed by, and ultimately a test of, some of these calculated ionic–covalent&#xD;
coupling energies. A novel scheme for systematic optimization of peak-locking has been developed and implemented, providing a rigorous assessment of the optimal experimental parameters. A side-of-filter offset-locking scheme was implemented,&#xD;
characterizing and correcting for a previously unexplained offset in the error-signal.&#xD;
A novel calibrated polarimetry scheme is demonstrated, correcting for the primary&#xD;
sources of uncertainty relating to manufacturing tolerances and experimental errors. The calibrated set of polarization measurements is used to examine the purity of the optical polarization state in the light sources to be used for trapping lithium.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
The focus of this thesis is stress in rehabilitation professionals. Within the thesis, burnout encompasses compassion fatigue and moral stress. Therefore, burnout is the emotional and ethical fatigue which is produced through organizational and clinical expectations present when working with individuals who live with disabilities.  This thesis argues that current rehabilitation service delivery models exacerbate burnout through their neglect of emotional and ethical needs in professionals.&#xD;
  The goal of this thesis is to develop an alternative model of service delivery which addresses burnout in rehabilitation professionals. The thesis answers the following question. How does Jean Vanier's thinking about relationships between individuals, living with and without disabilities, contribute to the field of rehabilitation therapy and, more specifically, to reducing stress currently experienced by rehabilitation professionals? To answer this question and meet the thesis goal, the research is situated within a constructivist paradigm and uses a single, interpretive case study design.&#xD;
   This research has produced the transformational model of service delivery.  This model states rehabilitation is a transformational process. Whereas traditional rehabilitation views the client as the focus of the change process, the transformational model states both the client and the professional benefit from their participation in a transformational change process. The change process is directed at the personal identity of both client and professional and is characterized by increased awareness and acceptance of key aspects within self and other.  Whereas in more traditional rehabilitation models, creating the relational conditions necessary for change is the professional's responsibility, within the transformational rehabilitation model, both client and professional contribute to the relationship which is characterized by commitment, co-operation and compassion. In addition, client and professional experience the outcome of transformation, maturity.  A mature person is defined by his/her capacity for agency and authenticity.&#xD;
  This thesis argues that Jean Vanier is relevant to rehabilitation professionals. The articulation of an alternative model of service delivery, based on Vanier's thinking about relationships between individuals living with and without disabilities, makes a significant contribution to reducing stress in rehabilitation professionals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In society, personal load carriage systems (backpacks) are commonly used to transport loads by foot, however, they have also been implicated in causing injuries. The aim of this study was to develop a model for load carriage which could be used to determine safety limits in humans. To start, a number of experiments were conducted to determine the appropriateness of using pressure mapping technology to measure peak and mean pressures acting on humans during load carriage limits. Tests of accuracy and repeatability were performed using three common pressure mapping technologies: capacitance, piezoresistive and resistive ink. Pressure mapping was tested statically and dynamically on a human-like flat surface, as well as on human shoulder-shaped model. Error was found to be ≥ 20% on static flat and curved surfaces and it rose to 36-51% under dynamic conditions. Since pressure mapping would require significant modifications before it could be used to study human load carriage, a psychophysical approach was used instead. For this approach, an epidemiological study of pain was conducted based on 48 subjects who used multiple backpack designs to complete occupationally relevant tasks. As a result, pain trends and new methods of data analysis were identified that had potential use on human trials. In a final study, pain mapping, quantification of pain intensity, and physiological/motor testing were conducted on humans performing endurance exercise with light to heavy payloads. Results showed that all subjects were able to exercise with a 15-35 kg payload for 45 minutes and with a 50 kg payload for 30 minutes, without stopping. As well, pain was found to be highest in the anterior acromial (shoulder) region, particularly for the 50 kg payload (mean peak pain = 3.4/10). Based on these findings, two models were proposed: an assertive model and a conservative model to allow prediction of human load carriage limits for endurance exercise.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This essay is on ‘Phenomenal Consciousness’. By introducing the ‘hard problem’ of phenomenal consciousness, I will focus on Chalmers’ efforts on developing a theory of consciousness, which he believes is a project toward finding a solution to the hard problem. &#xD;
As a result of focusing on the hard problem, this paper deals with the questions such as “how and why cognitive functioning is accompanied by conscious experience”, “how the physical systems or the physical brain processes give rise to conscious experience”, “why these processes do not take place ‘in the dark’ without any accompanying states of experience”, “what is the relation between the physical, the psychological and the phenomenal” and finally “what is the phenomenal experience or phenomenal feel”. There are two main streams trying to find a solution to (or dissolve) these kinds of questions about consciousness: the reductive doctrines (materialists) and the nonreductive doctrines.  &#xD;
Before exploring Chalmers’ answer to these questions, which is by his nonreductive theory of consciousness, I will explore some of the most important reductive (materialist) theories by focusing on Chalmers’ arguments against them and I will indicate his main objection to materialist theories by pointing out what he thinks is missing in these theories. This issue will be followed by the part in which I will argue that what makes Chalmers’ arguments against materialists views applicable, actually applies to his own theory of consciousness as well. I will argue that what is missing in all theories of consciousness, (including Chalmers’) which could play a significant role in a theory of consciousness, is a ‘first person point of view’ and an ‘ability to have a first person point of view’, by which I mean an ability for a being to have a first person (subjective) access to the results of his own physical cognitive information processing system. As a result, I will argue that phenomenal consciousness is actually an epistemic phenomenon which is the result of being in a sort of epistemic relation to one’s own cognitive system. &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>This essay is an attempt to explain and assess the liberal nationalists’ view on the problems of the legitimacy of nationalism and cultural rights. I want to look at some theories over the past fifteen years that normatively evaluate ‘nationalism’ according to the liberal principles. The main focus of the first part will be on three questions, which are: the question of legitimacy (is nationalism permissible?), the question of justice (is nationalism required?), and the question of appropriate format (what forms of nationalism and nationalistic policies are considered as legitimate and just?). &#xD;
In the second part, by considering the alleged conflict between the ‘minority nation-building’ and the ‘majority nation-building’ in multination countries, I will examine two models for resolving this conflict: ‘Multinational Federalism’ and ‘Transnational Federalism’. I will argue that, though most liberal nationalists support the former model, they fail to provide a convincing normative ground for justifying Multinational Federalism and stopping national minorities from secession. The liberal nationalists’ arguments for necessity of nationalism, ironically, undermine their own claim about normative importance of Multinational Federalism in comparison to Transnational Federalism. This is what I call ‘the paradox of liberal nationalism’.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
Introduction:  Human newborn and animal studies provide support for the intersensory redundancy hypothesis, which posits that learning is more effective when information is presented simultaneously in two modalities than one alone. Whether the same is true in the human fetus is unknown and was examined in this study.&#xD;
Methods:  63 low-risk fetuses (≥36 weeks gestation) were randomly assigned to one of 6 experimental groups: each group included one of 3 stimulus conditions [unimodal (music), unimodal (maternal sway) or bimodal (music and maternal sway)], and one of 2 pieces of music (music A, 4/4 time; music B, 3/4 time) composed for the study. Laboratory pre-testing included a 2 min no-music, 2 min music (A or B), 2 min no-music observation while fetal heart rate (FHR) and body movements were recorded.  Subsequently, mothers carried out the assigned intervention at home, twice a day for 5 days. On day 6, laboratory testing was repeated first with the familiar (A or B) and then the novel music. &#xD;
Results: The initial testing showed a difference between Music A and Music B, F (1, 61) = 8.203, p &lt;.01, where FHR decreased to Music A and increased to Music B.  The same FHR response was found when fetuses were exposed to the opposite music for the first time in the novelty testing, F (1, 44) = 4.543, p &lt;.05, following intervention. Music A elicited a response in both the unimodal music only and sway only groups, F (29, 203) = 1.871, p &lt; .01, and F (29, 174) = 1.818, p &lt; .01, respectively. In music B only the multimodal group showed an effect of intervention, F = (29, 203) = 1.914, p &lt; .005.  &#xD;
Conclusions: Fetal response to music A and B was qualitatively different. During pretesting, FHR decreased to music A and increased to music B. When the stimulus elicited an attention response (FHR decrease) learning was observed in both the unimodal or multimodal conditions. This is seen with music A (4/4 time) music where the fetus learns the stimulus.  When the stimulus did not elicit a FHR decrease (Music B, 3/4 time), there was evidence that a multimodal stimulus was more effective providing some support for the intersensory redundancy hypothesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ediacara Biota is a distinct group of soft-bodied organisms that flourished in late Precambrian (Ediacaran) oceans. The succession at Mistaken Point, Newfoundland, contains the most extensive collection of Ediacaran fronds in the world, with hundreds of complete specimens spanning at least 10 million years. &#xD;
&#xD;
The goals of the completed thesis were to investigate the growth strategies, preservational biases, function, and taxonomy of Ediacaran fronds through the use of qualitative morphological descriptions and quantitative morphometrics. Several of these mathematical techniques had not been previously applied to the Ediacara Biota, and strengthen traditional descriptive techniques through mathematical scrutiny. The second chapter applies standard biometric and principal components analyses to the cosmopolitan frond Charniodiscus from Newfoundland, which allowed for rigorous definition of two new closely related species that evolved differently shaped petalodiums to extract nutrients from different levels in the water column. The third chapter utilizes "landmark morphometrics" to interpret the original 3D shape of Charnia. These techniques suggest that traditional descriptions of Ediacaran fronds as sheet-like organisms are incorrect, and are a direct result of preservational processes. It was demonstrated that branch rigidity is species specific, resulting in the description of a new species of ancestral Charnia. The fourth chapter describes a new species of multifoliate rangeomorph frond that was preserved in four unique taphonomic settings. Only through comparison of specimens from all four preservational regimes was it possible to reconstruct the original morphology of this frond, and isolate taphonomically based features from true morphological characters. &#xD;
&#xD;
The final chapter reviews the biological significance of the frond morphoshape, and proposes that the present emphasis on overall shape in Ediacaran taxonomy is inherently flawed. It is recommended that a new system be erected to classify Ediacaran fronds based on branching architecture, as frond morphology most likely represents a common need to extract nutrients from the water column, and therefore represents a shared ecology, not ancestry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research has consistently shown an association between the personality trait of perfectionism and a variety of emotional, psychological, and interpersonal difficulties.  Using a longitudinal design, the present investigation aimed to examine the validity of a diathesis-stress model linking perfectionism to specific psychopathological symptoms in a large sample of university students.  The specific stress processes of stress enhancement and stress generation were examined as potential mechanisms linking perfectionism with emotional maladjustment (see Hewitt &amp; Flett, 2002).  In addition, two different frameworks for conceptualizing perfectionism were tested: (1) a multidimensional framework by Hewitt and Flett (1991) which posits that perfectionistic tendencies and behaviours are influenced both by intrapersonal and interpersonal factors, and (2) a adaptive-maladaptive perfectionism typology (Frost et al., 1993) which posits the existence of both a positive and a negative form of perfectionism.  &#xD;
	Results of this investigation indicated that particular dimensions of perfectionism were directly predictive of stress enhancement.  In addition, particular dimensions of perfectionism were also predictive of stress generation, albeit indirectly via the experience of general negative affect.  Finally, perfectionism was indeed predictive of increases in emotional maladjustment over time.  More specifically, particular perfectionism dimensions were directly predictive of psychopathological symptoms, while other dimensions were only predictive of symptoms via their interactions with relevant measures of life stress (i.e., via a diathesis-stress interaction).  &#xD;
	The results of the present investigation do not support the adaptive-maladaptive perfectionism typology in that the measure of adaptive perfectionism used was predictive of both stress and psychopathological symptoms.  The results of this study are more consistent with the perfectionism framework highlighting intrapersonal-interpersonal dimensions.  Overall, the results of this study suggest that a diathesis-stress model provides a fruitful framework from which to investigate perfectionism and its relation to psychopathology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neural network models were developed to model the short-term concentration distribution of aerosols released from point sources. Those models were based on data from a wide range field experiments (November 2002, March, May and August 2003). The study focused on relative dispersion from the puff centroid. The influence of puff/cloud meandering and large-scale gusts were not considered, the modelling was limited to studying the dispersion caused by small-scale turbulence. The data collected were based on short range/time dispersion, usually shorter than 150 s. The ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models considered explicitly a number of meteorological and turbulence parameters, as opposed to the Gaussian models that used a single fitting parameter, the dispersion coefficient.   The developed ANN models were compared with predictions generated from COMBIC (Combined Obscuration Model for Battlefield Induced Contaminants), a sophisticated model based on Gaussian distributions, and a traditional Gaussian puff model using Slade’s dispersion coefficients. Neural network predictions have been found to have better agreement with concentration measurements than either of the other two Gaussian puff models. All models underestimate the maximum concentration, but ANN predictions are much closer to observations. Simulations of concentration distributions under different stability conditions were also checked using the developed ANN model, and it showed that, for a short time, Gaussian distributions are a good fit for puff dispersion in the downwind, crosswind and vertical directions. &#xD;
&#xD;
For Gaussian puff models, the key issue is to determine appropriate dispersion coefficients (standard deviations). ANN models for puff dispersion coefficients were trained and their average predictions were compared with the results of measurements. Very good agreement was observed, with a high correlation coefficient (&gt;0.99). The ANN models for dispersion coefficients were used to analyze which input variables were more significant for puff expansions. Dispersion time, particle position relative to the centroid, turbulent kinetic energy and insolation showed the most significant influence on puff dispersion. The Gaussian puff model with dispersion coefficients from the ANN models was compared with COMBIC and a Gaussian puff model using Slade’s dispersion coefficients. Generally speaking, predictions generated by the Gaussian puff model with dispersion coefficients generated by ANN models showed better agreement with concentration measurements than the other two Gaussian puff models, by giving a much higher fraction within a factor of two, and lower normalised mean square errors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the past decades there has been onsiderable commercial and academic interest in methods for monitoring control system performance for linear systems. Far less has been written on control system performance for nonlinear dynamic / stochastic systems. This thesis presents research results on three control performance monitoring topics for the nonlinear systems:&#xD;
i) Controller assessment of a class of nonlinear systems: The use of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models to assess the control loop performance for linear systems is well known. Classes of nonlinear dynamic / stochastic systems for which a similar result can be obtained are established for SISO discrete systems. For these systems, the performance lower bounds can be estimated from closed-loop routine operating data using nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) models.&#xD;
ii) Variance decomposition of nonlinear systems / time series: We develop a variance decomposition approach to quantify the effects of different sources of disturbances on the nonlinear dynamic / stochastic systems. A method, called ANOVA-like decomposition, is employed to achieve this variance decomposition. Modifications of ANOVA-like decomposition are proposed so that the NOVA-like decomposition can be used to deal with the time dependency and the initial condition.&#xD;
iii) Parameter uncertainty effects on the variance decomposition: For the variance decomposition in the second part, the model parameters are assumed to be exactly known. However, parameters of empirical or mechanistic models are uncertain. The uncertainties associated with parameters should be included when the model is used for variance analysis. General solutions of the parameter uncertainty effects on the variance decomposition for the general nonlinear systems are proposed. Analytical solutions of the parameter uncertainty effects on the variance decomposition are provided for models with linear parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The non-interacting, nonuniform electron gas exhibits simplifications in two dimensions, that are of particular interest in the application of density functional theory. The results of linear response theory for an attractive impurity in a two-dimensional gas have been shown to be surprisingly accurate even though there are bound states, and were shown to be exact in the high density limit (Zaremba et al. Phys. Rev. B, 71:125323, 2005 and Zaremba et al. Phys. Rev. Lett., 90(4):046801, 2003).  The density resulting from linear response theory and the Thomas-Fermi approximation coincide in the high density limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
As an alternative to linear response theory, the Kirzhnits gradient expansion gives corrections to Thomas-Fermi in gradients of the potential.  In two dimensions, all of the gradient corrections vanish at zero temperature, which is a new result presented in this work.  We have performed numerical calculations which show that while Thomas-Fermi appears to be a surprisingly accurate approximation in two dimensions, it is not exact.  The differences between two and three dimensions that lead to the vanishing of the gradient corrections, however, are of great interest since these may lead to better understanding and simplifications of the corresponding three-dimensional problem.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In coronary artery bypass surgery the autologous saphenous vein is the most commonly used vascular graft. However, in a growing number of patients this vein is not available due to disease or availability. To date, there are no commercially available vascular grafts to replace the autologous saphenous vein. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that a successful small diameter blood vessel alternative will be found using a tissue engineering approach. A photo-cross-linked biodegradable elastomer of acrylated star-poly(ε-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (ASCP) has recently been developed. The elastomer possesses many desirable properties, such as manufacturability and mechanical properties, making it an interesting scaffolding material candidate for this application. &#xD;
To test the feasibility of the ASCP elastomer as a scaffolding material, a porous scaffold with 90% porosity was constructed using paraffin microbeads combined with an emulsion of ASCP prepolymer and water. Native arterial mechanical properties were matched with an 1800 Da ASCP elastomeric scaffold (ELAS 1800) having 85% porosity. In vitro degradation of scaffolds prepared with two different ASCP Mn (1800 and 4500 Da) was investigated for 8 weeks. Bulk hydrolysis was the mode of degradation regardless of configuration, with the porous scaffold degrading slower than the nonporous control. In addition, the ELAS 4500 scaffold also degraded faster than the ELAS 1800 scaffold with the same porosity.&#xD;
 In order to promote the cellular response to this potential vascular scaffold, the surface of the elastomer was modified to enhance bovine coronary artery smooth muscle cell (SMC) attachment and proliferation. Base etching the surface was not as effective as adding a small peptide sequence Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) known to enhance cell adhesion. The surface modifications did not change SMC phenotype as all surfaces expressed the contractile marker proteins smooth muscle α-actin and h-caldesmon. The SMCs also expressed these marker proteins when seeded on porous scaffolds. &#xD;
Finally, it was possible to integrate the porous scaffold into a biomimetic blood vessel design. With this initial testing, it appears that the ASCP elastomer is a feasible scaffolding material for small diameter blood vessel tissue engineering. Nevertheless, more detailed testing of mechanical properties and cell behaviour must be conducted to ascertain that the ASCP elastomer and the proposed biomimetic blood vessel design can be appropriate replacements for the autologous saphenous vein.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is a low-power, low-rate MAC/PHY standard that meets most of the stringent requirements of single-hop wireless sensor networks. Sensor networks with nodal populations comprised of thousands of devices have been envisioned in conjunction with environmental, vehicular, and military applications, to mention a few. However, such large sensor network deployments necessitate multi-hop support as well as low power consumption. In light of the standard's extremely limited joint support of the two aforementioned attributes, this thesis presents two essential contributions. First, a framework is proposed to implement a new IEEE 802.15.4 operating mode, namely the synchronized peer-to-peer mode. This mode is designed to enable the standard's low-power features in peer-to-peer multi-hop-ready topologies. The second contribution is a distributed Guaranteed Time Slot (dGTS ) management scheme designed to function in the newly devised network mode. This protocol provides reliable contention-free access in peer-to-peer topologies in a completely distributed manner. Assuming optimal routing, our simulation experiments reveal perfect delivery ratios as long as the traffic load does not reach or surpass its saturation threshold. dGTS sustains at least twice the delivery ratio of contention access under sub-optimal dynamic routing. Moreover, the dGTS scheme exhibits minimum power consumption by eliminating the retransmissions attributed to contention, which in turn reduces the number of transmissions to a minimum.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ontario Water Resources Act requires a Permit To Take Water (PTTW) for withdrawals greater than 50,000 L/day.  The permitting process includes a requirement to minimize the environmental effects of the withdrawal, but does not include a specific framework to do so.  A methodology is proposed for estimating the water supply, the water demand, both anthropogenic and ecological, and the amount available for withdrawal.  Water supply is estimated using statistical analysis of recorded daily flows in the watershed of interest, in adjacent watersheds, and in the region.  Anthropogenic demand is given by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment’s PTTW database. Ecological demand is also estimated using statistical analysis of recorded daily flows, and through field measurement methods such as the Wetted Perimeter method. A case study of Millhaven Creek in eastern Ontario shows that the methodology is appropriate for this area and, with minor modifications, would apply to the rest of Ontario.  &#xD;
Evaluation of the existing methods for water supply estimation showed that using long-term data for analysis is the best method, and that the regional analysis work completed for Ontario is out of data and needs revising.  Estimation methods for ecological demand are not necessarily appropriate for all areas.  A single instream flow requirement based on the Mean Annual Flow is not appropriate for Millhaven Creek, and even a set of flows based on Mean Monthly Flows needs modification to be acceptable for Millhaven Creek.  Supply minus demand varies from month to month, and therefore the decision on whether to issue a permit depends on the season as well as the duration of the withdrawal (e.g. seasonal vs. continuous) and type of use proposed (e.g. golf course irrigation vs. municipal drinking water).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>N,N-Diethyl-O-sulfamate (OSO2NEt2) has been established as a new directed metalation group (DMG).  Its similarity to the established O-carbamate DMG has prompted investigation into its potential as a partner in transition metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions with aryl organometallics with the intention to develop a new route to contiguously substituted aromatics.  Furthermore, aryne formation of ortho-magnesiated O-sulfamates at higher temperatures can be trapped with furan to afford cycloaddition products having substitution patterns difficult to prepare by similar methods.  &#xD;
Schumanniophytine is a structurally interesting alkaloid possessing anti-viral activity.  Thus far, only a single synthesis has been reported which proceeds in poor yield and offers little opportunity for the synthesis of structurally diverse schumanniophytine derivatives.  Herein we report the total synthesis of schumanniophytine by a directed ortho metalation (DoM) – cross coupling strategy using a key directed remote metalation (DreM) step.  The synthesis proceeds in 10 steps with 24% overall yield, offering plenty of opportunity for structural variation.   &#xD;
Naturally abundant chromone derivatives contain an array of biological activities.  The ability to prepare differentially substituted chromones in a rapid manner is of great interest in medicinal chemistry.  Reported is a general and divergent synthesis of chromone carboxamides, from easily prepared 2-but-2-ynoyl aryl O-carbamates.  The reaction proceeds by carbamoyl translocation and anionic Fries rearrangement followed by Michael addition of the initially generated cumulenolate for which evidence is provided.  Further metalation and borylation reactions of the synthesized compounds allow the regioselective construction of polysubstituted chromones.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose- The World Health Organization describes ‘activities’ as what one does, and ‘participation’ as life situations or roles.  This thesis explores and describes important influencers of activities and participation from the perspective of persons with disabilities. It also suggests how to include such information when reporting results of tools measuring activities and participation, so that health professionals working with persons with disabilities might collaborate and communicate more effectively with each other and the people they serve. &#xD;
&#xD;
Method- The World Health Organization framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) was used. Participants with mobility problems living in the community with their disability for a least 1 year were involved in this mixed methods study to gain a broad understanding of how persons with disabilities perceive and experience factors that affect their general and specific activities and participation. Semi-structured interviews guided by categories contained in two standard measures, the Barthel Index (BI), and the Participation Scale (P-scale) were employed, and grounded theory methods were used.  From their responses, relationships between important concepts were used to inform a theoretical model. Upon this framework, relevant important shared factors, derived through combining several methods, were incorporated into reporting tools. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results- 24 participants identified 258 individual factors. Grounded theory analysis resulted in The Successful Adaptation Model, describing relationships amongst factors and activities and participation. For the BI, devices, home modifications, and treatments were most contributory. For the P-scale, personality, community and home accessibility, level of impairment, mobility aids, and transportation were among the most influential factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion- This study incorporates perspectives of persons with disability into the Successful Adaptation Model, describing factors affecting activities and participation and their interactions. It also suggests a method of reporting important factors in conjunction with standardized measures of activities and participation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels have both high strength and high ductility. Retained austenite in the microstructure, upon straining, transforms to martensite and this absorbs energy and improves the work hardening of the steel, giving improved elongation. The transformation can be either stress-assisted or strain-induced and the initiation and the mechanism depend on the composition of, the size and shape of, and the phases surrounding, the austenite grains. It is important to understand the relationship between these variables and the properties of the TRIP steel.&#xD;
&#xD;
The aim of this work was to determine how the microstructure of the TRIP steel affects the transformation. Four experimental microstructures were developed, containing austenite grains with different sizes, shapes, and surrounding phases. The Fine microstructure had thin elongated austenite laths between fine bainitic ferrite laths, the Coarse microstructure had elongated austenite grains between coarser bainitic ferrite laths, the Equiaxed microstructure had equiaxed austenite grains in a matrix of equiaxed ferrite and the Acicular microstructure had elongated austenite grains surrounded by recovered ferrite laths.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tensile tests were performed and detailed characterization, using neutron diffraction, was done of samples with the four microstructures. The variation in the amount of austenite during deformation was measured. The tensile tests revealed that the microstructures had different mechanical properties and different transformation behaviours. Fine had the lowest elongation and the highest strength. Acicular and Equiaxed had good elongation but lower strength. Coarse had intermediate strength and Equiaxed had sustained work hardening.&#xD;
&#xD;
The transformation in Fine and Coarse was minimal. Coarse had some slow, steady transformation, but Fine may have had none. The transformation in Equiaxed was larger. It started quickly and then slowed at higher strains. The austenite in Acicular transformed steadily. The predominant mechanism of transformation was stress-assisted transformation, with strain-induced transformation occurring only in Equiaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
The results of this work showed that the influence of the surrounding phases on the stability of the austenite is significant. The differences in the transformation behaviour of the four microstructures seemed to be due more to the surrounding phases than the grain size or the composition, although both these factors also played a role.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the number of processors in multiprocessor system-on-chip devices continues to increase, the complexity required for full cache coherence support is often unwarranted for application-specific designs. Bus-based interconnects are no longer suitable for larger-scale systems, and the logic and storage overhead associated with the use of a complex packet-switched network and directory-based cache coherence may be undesirable in single-chip systems. Unidirectional rings are a suitable alternative because they offer many properties favorable to both on-chip implementation and to supporting cache coherence. Reducing the overhead of cache coherence traffic is, however, a concern for these systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis adapts two filter structures that are based on principles of coarse-grained coherence tracking, and applies them to a ring-based multiprocessor. The first structure tracks the total number of blocks of remote data cached by all processors in a node for a set of regions, where a region is a large area of memory referenced by the upper bits of an address. The second structure records regions of local data whose contents are not cached by any remote node. When used together to filter incoming or outgoing requests, these structures reduce the extent of coherence traffic and limit the transmission of coherent requests to the necessary parts of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
A complete single-chip multiprocessor system that includes the proposed filters is designed and implemented in programmable logic for this thesis. The system is composed of nodes of bus-based multiprocessors, and each node includes a common memory, two or more pipelined 32-bit processors with coherent data caches, a split-transaction bus with separate lines for requests and responses, and an interface for the system-level ring interconnect. Two coarse-grained filters are attached to each node to reduce the impact of coherence traffic on the system. Cache coherence within the node is enforced through bus snooping, while coherence across the interconnect is supported by a reduced-complexity ring snooping protocol. Main memory is globally shared and is physically distributed among the nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results are presented to highlight the system's key implementation points. Synthesis results are presented in order to evaluate hardware overhead, and operational results are shown to demonstrate the functionality of the multiprocessor system and of the filter structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. To describe variations in major trauma between rural and urban residents of Ontario in terms of external causes, severities, prehospital care and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
2. To determine whether prehospital intubation improves survival to hospital discharge among victims of major trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods:&#xD;
The study involved secondary analyses of data from the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support Study (OPALS). OPALS is the largest study of prehospital emergency medical services conducted worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
  1. Rural-urban status of trauma patients was determined using modified Beale Codes.  Differences in trauma characteristics and patient care were compared among four geographic groups (Large Metro, Medium Metro, Small Metro, Rural).&#xD;
     2. Patients who were intubated in the field were individually matched with non-intubated patients by patient age, injury severity score category, abbreviated head injury score category, and exact Glasgow coma scores.  Cox regression was used to estimate the effect of prehospital intubation on patients' survival to hospital discharge, stratifying on patient matching.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Patients in the large metro and rural groups had higher injury severity scores (medial 25, 24, respectively) than the other two groups (median=22).  Paramedics generally spent more time in rural and large metro areas (median=37.4, 36.6 minutes respectively) than in medium and small metro (median=32.0, 30.7 minutes respectively) areas.  Response times and transport times in rural groups were significantly longer than the other three groups, while scene times in the large metro group were significantly longer compared with the other geographic groups.  There were no significant differences in survival rates by geographic group.&#xD;
2.  There were no significantly differences between the intubated and the non-intubated groups by age, sex, Glasgow coma scores, injury severity score, and systolic blood pressure category.  Prehospital intubated patients exprienced a 3-fold risk of mortality after adjustment for potential confounders (HR2.9; 95% CI 1.4 to 5.8).&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions:&#xD;
1. While response and transport times for major trauma were longer in rural areas, there were no significant differences in mortality in patients with different rural urban status.&#xD;
2. Prehosptial intubation showed a negative association with survival among major trauma patients.  Further randomized trials are required to invesitigate this clinical issue.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ultrasound is a favorable tool for intra-operative surgical guidance due to its fast imaging speed and non-invasive nature. However, deformations of the anatomy caused by breathing, heartbeat, and movement of the patient make it difficult to track the location of anatomical landmarks during intra-operative ultrasound-guided interventions. While elastic registration can be used to compensate for image misalignment, its adaptation for clinical use has only been gradual due to the lack of standardized guidelines to quantify the performance of different registration techniques. Evaluation of elastic registration algorithms is a difficult task since the point to point correspondence between images is usually unknown. This poses a major challenge in the validation of non-rigid registration techniques for performance comparisons. Current validation guidelines for non-rigid registration algorithms exist for the comparison of techniques for magnetic resonance images of the brain. These frameworks provide users with standardized brain datasets and performance measures based on brain region alignment, intensity differences between images, and inverse consistency of transformations. These metrics may not all be suitable for ultrasound registration algorithms due to the different properties of the imaging modalities. Furthermore, other metrics are required for validating the registration performance on different anatomical images with large deformations such as the liver. This work presents a validation framework dedicated for ultrasound elastic registration algorithms. Quantitative validation metrics are evaluated for ultrasound images. These include a simulation technique to measure registration accuracy, a segmentation algorithm to extract anatomical landmarks to measure feature overlap, and a technique to measure the alignment of images using similarity metrics. An extensive study of an ultrasound temporal registration algorithm is conducted using the proposed validation framework. Experiments are performed on a large database of 2D and 3D US images of the carotid artery and the liver to assess the performance of this algorithm. In addition, two graphical user interfaces which integrate the image registration and segmentation techniques have been developed to visualize the performance of these algorithms on ultrasound images captured in real time. In the future, these interfaces may be used to enhance ultrasound examination.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the creation of the church of S. Maria del Pianto and its altarpieces commissioned in the wake of the Neapolitan plague of 1656. The church and its sacred images are representative of the devotional shift that occurred in Naples after such catastrophic loss of life – in particular devotion to the souls in Purgatory. An exploration of the church’s commission, the people involved as benefactors, and the significance of the site upon which it was built proved central to the identification of the possible meanings of the altarpieces for their seventeenth-century audience and are examined in detail in this study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A limitation to investigations of homodimeric protein dissociation is that the signals produced from methods such as fluorescence and circular dichroism represent both dissociation and protein unfolding that may be occurring simultaneously within a sample. Although size exclusion chromatography examines the state of a protein’s quaternary structure, complicated overlapping peaks representative of oligomer and monomer can result. To address these limitations the mixed dimer system has been adopted to investigate the dissociation of a homodimeric protein. A mixed dimer is a species in which each subunit of a homodimeric protein is associated with a different affinity tag. The two tags used are the His6-tag and the Glu7-tag. Such a mixed dimer will bind to a metal chelating column such as Ni-NTA so long as the dimer is intact. Denaturant- or temperature induced dimer dissociation can be detected by the amount of Glu7-tagged subunit present in the unbound fraction after the protein is passed over an Ni-NTA resin. SDS PAGE and densitometry assess the amount of Glu7-tagged subunit present in those unbound fractions. The experimental conditions necessary to implement this method were developed, and then applied to mammalian inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Staphylococcus aureus NOS (SaNOS). With respect to both urea and temperature, the stability of SaNOS is higher than that of iNOS in spite of the bacterial enzyme having a much smaller dimer contact surface. We have also used the mixed dimer method to estimate an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for iNOS dissociation of no greater than 2.3μM. This value is compared to the results obtained for iNOS by analytical ultracentrifugation, which can characterize protein complexes and their stoichiometry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The influence of yielding foundations on the mechanical behaviour of reinforced soil walls including wall deformations and loads (strains) in the reinforcement layers is very complex. Based on a review of the literature, there is a need to quantify and isolate the influence of foundation boundary type and magnitude of foundation stiffness on deformations and reinforcement loads in geosynthetic reinforced soil walls. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents the results of a series of 1/6-scale reinforced soil wall model tests that were carried out to examine the influence of horizontal and vertical toe compliance and vertical foundation compressibility on wall behaviour. &#xD;
&#xD;
The heavily instrumented walls were constructed in a strongbox that was 1.2 m high by 1.6 m wide and retained soil to a distance of 2.3 m behind the facing. The models were uniformly surcharged in stages following construction. &#xD;
&#xD;
The experimental program consisted of three groups of tests. Group 1 tests involved five walls. One wall was constructed with a very stiff horizontal restraint, and three walls were constructed with different horizontal toe stiffness using combinations of coiled springs. The remaining wall in this series was constructed without any horizontal toe restraint.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Group 2 was comprised of three walls. One wall was a control wall with a rigid toe. The other two walls were constructed with different vertical toe stiffness support using different combinations of rubber blocks. &#xD;
&#xD;
Group 3 included a control wall with a rigid foundation and a companion wall constructed with a compressible foam and rubber layers below the backfill soil and the wall facing.&#xD;
The results demonstrate that the quantitative behaviour of the models was affected by the type and magnitude of foundation stiffness. For example, as horizontal toe stiffness increased a greater portion of the total horizontal earth load against the wall facing was carried by the toe. The data showed that the shape of facing lateral deformation profiles changed from rotation about the toe for the case of a very stiff horizontal toe to a more uniform profile for the unrestrained toe case. For the case of a rigid vertical footing support below the facing, vertical toe loads were greater than those computed from facing self-weight alone due to down-drag forces developed at the facing–reinforcement connections as the wall facing moved outward. As vertical toe support stiffness decreased with respect to foundation compressibility below the soil backfill, the magnitude of soil down-drag forces diminished resulting in a decrease in vertical toe load.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A new special case computer simulation to model the non-linear, three dimensional dynamic equations of motion of a five degree of freedom point contact joint has been developed and the functionality has been validated with data collected from a physical model.  A system physically realistic to model was designed with sphere in sphere contact. A small outboard body articulates within a larger inboard spherical cut out body and springs help provide stability to the system by attaching the outboard body to the ground. The outboard body can move relative to the inboard body in both a rolling and sliding manner.  The dynamic equations of motion were determined using Kane’s formulation and a&#xD;
numerical solution was attained through the implementation of a fourth-fifth order,&#xD;
variable time step, Runge-Kutta integrator. The positions of four markers, located on the outboard body of the system, were predicted in ground fixed coordinates by the solution routine. A physical model of the system was constructed and position locations of four markers located on the outboard body were captured by an Optotrak 3020 motion tracking system.  Both static and dynamic experimental trials were performed and compared to the simulation. For one test case, the experimental data frequency of oscillation was found to be ωe = 2.33 Hz and the simulation frequency was found to be ωs = 2.37 Hz. Several sources for the discrepancies include viscous damping, a possible additional forcing function caused by lead wire sway, and neglecting the mass of the system’s&#xD;
springs. Coulomb damping was included in the simulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Livingstone Range anticlinorium (LRA) is a long (&gt;65 km) narrow (&lt;5 km) structural culmination that coincides with a major hanging-wall ramp across which the Livingstone thrust cuts ~1000 m up-section eastward from a regional décollement in the upper part of Devonian Palliser Formation to another regional décollement within Jurassic Fernie Formation. The presence of Precambrian basement fluids prior to thrusting and folding is recorded in the LRA by deformed jasper+/-fluorite+/-sphalerite veins, and adjacent haloes of altered dolomitic host rock with high 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7094 to 0.7100) relative to most host rocks. Basement fluids are a possible source for anomalously radiogenic strontium that occurs in the diagenetically altered Paleozoic carbonate rocks in the LRA and throughout the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, but underlying thick shale strata such as the Exshaw Formation are also a possible source. The earliest stages of thrusting deformation involved the development of distinctive chevron-style, flexural-slip thrust-propagation folds that have conspicuous blind thrust faults along their hinge zones. The hinge-zone thrust system of the Centre Peak anticline consists of a series of stacked detachment thrusts, each of which emerges from a different zone of interbed slip in the backlimb of the anticline and deflects the hinge zone eastward. Each successively higher detachment thrust dies out in the hinge zone at approximately the same stratigraphic level at which an overlying detachment thrust fault emerges from a bedding detachment zone in the backlimb. Fluid flow during thrust-propagation folding is recorded by dolomite+/-calcite veins with isotopic compositions that are similar to those of host rocks. Fluid flow occurred along faults related to thrust-propagation folding, and also along many tear faults and larger thrust faults. Veins in these fault zones have slightly higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios relative to adjacent host rocks and are interpreted to have formed from a mixture of formation fluids and hotter basement fluids in a rock-dominated system. Oxygen isotope thermometry of four syn-folding veins indicates they precipitated at anomalously high temperatures (&gt;250°C). The youngest episode of fluid flow along thrust faults and tear faults is recorded by calcite veins with very low δ18O values (-18 to -9‰ PDB), which are interpreted to have precipitated along faults that were active while the LRA was being transported eastward and elevated by underlying thrust faults, and cooled by infiltrating meteoric water. The conduits along which significant meteoric fluid circulation occurred are marked by visibly altered host rocks that have anomalously low δ18O values and slightly lower δ13C values relative to most host rocks.&#xD;
Rapid cooling due to deep infiltration of meteoric water into the shallow brittle surface of the deforming earth is almost certainly not restricted to thrust and fold belts, nor is its thermal effect necessarily restricted to the upper few kilometers. This model for fluid flow has significant implications for predicting thermal conditions in deep metamorphic rocks that lie beneath the brittle crust, the most obvious effect being to push down the brittle/ductile transition zone, which would enhance even deeper meteoric fluid circulation and cause the deflection of underlying isotherms.</dcterms:abstract>

More than 40 industries have existed within the inner harbour over the last century, and while many of these industries are no longer present, the properties that they operated on remain to the present day as potential sources of persistent contamination. This study examined total mercury (THg) concentrations in depth profiles of 21 sediment cores within the inner harbour. THg in pore waters was measured in some selected cores along with methylmercury (MeHg), and total organic carbon measured as % Organic Matter (OM). Results show that the spatial distribution of THg in the surface sediment is not homogenous; concentrations in surface&#xD;
sediment along the southwestern shoreline, adjacent to the former industrial properties, are significantly greater than the rest of the inner harbour, and above the severe effect limit (2000 μg/kg) guideline for sediment. MeHg was detected in some sediment cores, and was found to have a significant, positive correlation with [THg] in surface sediment. THg in pore water was&#xD;
below detection limits in most cores, indicating possible strong associations with sediments, however OM only showed significant, positive correlations with THg in one core sampled. To determine the sources of Hg to sediments, soils, runoff and storm sewer discharges near high&#xD;
concentration sediments were measured for THg. Hg was not detected in storm sewers, but&#xD;
was detected in terrestrial soil near the Kingston Rowing Club at a concentration of more than 4000 μg/kg. Significant [THg] was detected in runoff draining shoreline soils, indicating that erosion from terrestrial sources may be an ongoing source of Hg to sediment. Since [THg] was correlated to the [MeHg] in surface sediment, reducing the amount of Hg entering the river from terrestrial sources may reduce the amount of bioavailable Hg in sediments of the inner&#xD;
harbour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the wide variety of ways in which radical intellectuals and activists in Montreal used and adapted Third World decolonization theory to build a broad movement of solidarity and anti-colonial resistance from 1963-1972.  Beginning in the early 1960s, activists and intellectuals in Montreal began drawing upon the language of Third World decolonization to resituate their understandings of themselves, their society, and the world in which they inhabited.  Through their engagement with Third World liberation theory – and the closely related language of Black Power – radical intellectuals in Montreal sought to give new meaning to the old conception of humanism, and they worked to drastically expand the geographical frame of reference in which Quebec politics were generally understood.   After analyzing the shifting meaning of decolonization in the period leading up to the late 1960s, this thesis explores the ways in which various groups adopted, built upon, challenged, and shaped the conception of Quebec liberation.  Montreal’s advocates of women’s liberation, the city’s Black activists, defenders of unilingualism, and labour radicals were all deeply shaped by the intellectual and urban climate of Montreal, and by ideas of Quebec decolonization.  They developed their own individual narratives of liberation, yet linked by the flexible language of decolonization, these narratives all greatly overlapped, forming a vast movement which was larger than the sum of its parts.  If the concept of decolonization was extremely powerful, however, it was also highly ambiguous and contradictory, and activists only slowly came to an understanding of the multi-layered nature of colonialism in Quebec.  By the early 1970s, the idea of decolonization was slowly abandoned by those advocating radical social change in the city.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis makes three interrelated arguments.  First, it argues that radicalism in Quebec in the 1960s cannot be understood outside of the larger international context in which it emerged.  Second, it attempts to rethink the ways in which different groups and movements during the 1960s interacted and fed upon each other’s analyses and learned from each other.  And, finally, by looking at the centrality of Third World decolonization to the development of dissent in Montreal, it hopes to add new perspectives to the growing field of international Sixties scholarship, by insisting that history of the ‘West’ was profoundly shaped by its interactions with the Third World.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An ultra-low dose of a drug is approximately 1000-fold lower than the dose range traditionally used to induce a therapeutic effect. The purpose of the present thesis was to broaden the knowledge of the ultra-low dose effect, that was previously identified in the opioid receptor system, by looking at whether opioids and cannabinoids interact at the ultra-low dose level, whether cannabinoid receptors themselves demonstrate the ultra-low dose antagonist effect, and whether the opioid ultra-low dose effect is maintained in a model of persistent, unavoidable pain.  For experiment 1, separate groups of Long Evans rats were tested for antinociception following an injection of vehicle, the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55 212-2 (WIN), the opioid antagonist naltrexone (an ultra-low or a high dose), or a combination of WIN and naltrexone doses.  Ultra-low dose naltrexone elevated WIN-induced tail flick thresholds without extending its duration of action.  In experiment 2, antinociception was tested in rats following either acute or sub-chronic (7 days) injections of vehicle, WIN, ultra-low doses of the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (SR 141716), or a combination of WIN and ultra-low dose rimonabant.  Following the chronic experiment, striatal tissue was rapidly extracted and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation to analyse CB1 receptor coupling to G-protein subtypes. Ultra-low dose rimonabant extended the duration of WIN-induced antinociception, and attenuated the development of WIN-induced tolerance.  Animals chronically treated with WIN alone had CB1 receptors predominately coupling to Gs proteins, whereas all other groups had CB1 receptors predominately coupling to Gi proteins.  For experiment 3, all animals were subjected to the formalin test following either acute or sub-chronic injections of vehicle, the opiate morphine, ultra-low doses naltrexone, or a combination of morphine and ultra-low dose naltrexone. Ultra-low dose naltrexone had no significant effect on morphine-induced pain ratings in either the acute, or sub-chronic drug treatments.  This thesis provides evidence that the ultra-low dose effect, including the agonist-induced G-protein coupling switch, extends to another receptor type. This effect may, therefore, be part of a generalized principle that applies to many G-protein coupled receptors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, I examine the factors that influence the introduction of sustainable practice into university food services.    There is a growing body of evidence documenting the ecological impact of the conventional agro-food system. Therefore, understanding how institutional practice either enables or hinders sustainable or ‘alternative’ food practice is critical because institutional food services could serve as a potential site for challenging conventional food geographies.  Drawing upon a case study approach, my thesis explores the food service environment at Queen’s University, Kingston, Canada.  Two smaller, less detailed food service cases studies (the University of Guelph and the University of Toronto) are used to compare the factors and indicators that determine how sustainability is incorporated into food services.  Given the geographical variability within University institutions, I argue that university food services are a contested political space and an important site for challenging conventional food systems.  They are also places to test alternative, more sustainable models. I outline some key variables that are currently preventing Queen’s University from moving toward a more sustainable food service model.  Furthermore, I discuss the implications of this research for the alternative food geography literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research thesis is focussed on the development of a novel low density explosive composition whose main application is wall control in open pit mining. The product has, however, the potential to be used in a variety of applications and rock conditions where customization of the explosive’s energy output is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
Experimental observations on the novel low density explosive showed that the product is capable of initiating and sustaining stable detonations at densities as low as 0.10 g/cm3. Given the extreme low densities at which the novel product maintains its detonating characteristics, it will be appropriate to treat it as a reactive bulking agent, hence its name: Low Density Reactive Agent or LDRA for short.&#xD;
&#xD;
When mixed with standard ANFO prills, the reactive nature of the LDRA ensures a detonable mixture regardless of the final dilution sought or the degree of segregation eventually produced during mixing and loading. If operational constraints are such that a lower energy is required, the LDRA can then be used on a stand‐alone basis, without mixing it with other explosive compositions, such as ANFO or emulsions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The detonation characteristics of the LDRA at a target density of 0.15 g/cm3 were evaluated, with particular effort placed on measuring the detonation and explosion pressures, parameters having the greatest influence on damage. The effects of diameter, confinement and primer on LDRA performance were evaluated through velocity of detonation (VOD) measurements. In addition, VOD experiments were conducted in the LDRA to evaluate the stability of propagation in longer columns, the behaviour in a decking configuration and the ability to initiate and be initiated by a column of ANFO. The low pressure regimes characterizing the LDRA provided the opportunity to investigate the full pressure history of the detonation gases by designing experiments of a non‐destructive nature that allowed the repetition of tests under different loading scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
Following the characterization stage, the opportunity to test the LDRA as a damage control tool under a true operational scenario arose at the Chuquicamata Mine, in northern Chile. The project provided important input as to the feasibility of manufacturing the LDRA at a semi‐industrial scale and to evaluate the performance of the product in the large diameter blastholes used at the mine</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication and behaviour [Str04]. Given the diversity and varying severity of PDDs, diagnostic tools attempt to identify homogeneous subtypes within PDDs. &#xD;
The diagnostic system Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) divides PDDs into five subtypes. Several limitations have been identified with the categorical diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV. The goal of this study is to identify putative subtypes in the multidimensional data collected from a group of patients with PDDs, by using cluster analysis.&#xD;
Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning method. It offers a way to partition a dataset into subsets that share common patterns. We apply cluster analysis to data collected from 358 children with PDDs, and validate the resulting clusters. Notably, there are many cluster analysis algorithms to choose from, each making certain assumptions about the data and about how clusters should be formed. A way to arrive at a meaningful solution is to use consensus clustering to integrate results from several clustering attempts that form a cluster ensemble into a unified consensus answer, and can provide robust and accurate results [TJPA05].&#xD;
In this study, using cluster analysis, cluster validation, and consensus clustering, we identify four clusters that are similar to – and further refine  three of the five subtypes defined in the DSM-IV. This study thus confirms the existence of these three subtypes among patients with PDDs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The medieval wall paintings of the church of S. Maria in Pallara, situated on the Palatine Hill, Rome, provide insight into the intellectual use of images in the Middle Ages. The fragmentary apse programme survives, supplemented by antiquarian drawings that include copies of lost nave cycles and a lost donor portrait of their patron, Petrus Medicus. The patron, along with his monastic foundation, is documented in tenth-century charters, on which documents the paintings’ dating currently depends. Questions about this dating have surfaced in the art-historical literature, as have concerns about gender and historical veracity, matters of historiography which are introduced in Chapter 1. Thus, the goals of this study were to verify the paintings’ dating, to examine their use of text and image and to illuminate the context in which they were created.&#xD;
	Chapter 2 describes and analyses the S. Maria in Pallara paintings within Roman artistic traditions of the Romanesque period. Since no contemporary parallel can be found for the iconography of the Apostles on the shoulders of Prophets decorating the church’s apse arch, a composition more common to Gothic art, Chapter 3 examines the iconography’s diffusion and sources. Textual evidence suggests that a church dedicated to Saint Sebastian preceded the tenth-century foundation of S. Maria in Pallara, which was then rededicated to the Virgin Mary, Saints Sebastian and Zoticus. Thus, Chapter 4 examines the visual profile of the cult of Saint Sebastian and its dependence on the Acta Sebastiani to provide a context for the church’s depictions of that saint, including portraits and a lost narrative cycle. Messages about chastity encoded in these images are also examined. Chapter 5 examines the lost narrative cycle depicting the life of the little-known Saint Zoticus, to whom the church was also dedicated and who was envisioned in the guise of another saint, Getulius, who was martyred with his wife, Saint Symphorosa, and their seven sons. Messages about chastity were also communicated through that cycle’s manipulation of S. Maria in Pallara’s topographic history. Thus, far from being simple reflections of text, the S. Maria in Pallara paintings engage Roman history, reforming that history to project a moral image of the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Health research and services are dominated by a biomedical model which understands health as the absence of disease in the physical body. The dominance of this approach has resulted in the absence, silence and refutation of lay perspectives on health, particularly those of visible minority groups. Using qualitative interview methods, this study provides an avenue to hear the voices and stories of church-going, low-income Black women who live in Toronto, Canada. Analysis of the data shows that for this group of women, the meanings of health and the way it is experienced can be seen as an amalgamation of spiritual principles which holistically touches the various domains of their lives. The women in this study experience health as emotional, social, communal, personal, physical, material and above all in spiritual dimensions. These findings would be useful in guiding the development of meaningful and effective health care services that are sensitive to the diverse experiences of health.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This experiment was conducted to examine the hypothesis that learning by analogy will invoke characteristics of an implicit mode of learning. On Day 1, dart novices learned to throw darts as close as possible to the centre of a target under one of three scenarios: control (without instruction), implicit (while performing a distracting secondary task), and analogy (while imagining an analogous physical image). Each participant threw 6 blocks of 40 darts, receiving repeated instructions before each block. The next day (Day 2), participants were tested for retention and for transfer by the addition of a secondary distracting task. The results showed that significant learning took place in all groups over a period of six learning blocks on the first day. There was also significant response to retention and transfer testing on Day 2. Learning to throw darts without instruction was shown to be superior to learning under both of the other conditions – analogy and secondary task. The study demonstrated that dart throwing instruction using analogy was insufficient to induce the beneficial features of implicit learning. The chosen elastic analogy, in fact, led to a significant deterioration of performance when compared to controls during transfer on Day 2. Sex and skill differences are unlikely to have played a significant role in the main findings. The findings are discussed within the framework of current literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Delivering high bandwidth to the individual household or small business is currently a major bottleneck in the high speed network, a problem referred to as the last mile issue. Multimode fibre is widely deployed in the last mile for cost reasons. Recently, the tremendous high-speed data transport potential of multimode fibre has been demonstrated by utilizing offset launch techniques and a laser source. However, modal noise, caused by interference among the various propagating modes of a multimode fibre in the presence of mode selective loss, is a significant roblem when a laser source is employed.&#xD;
    This thesis investigates several aspects of modal noise for what we believe to be the first time. By utilizing single mode fibre launching, modal noise is measured at different transverse offset launching positions with both continuous wave and pulse waveform input at several different fibre lengths. Modal noise is also measured for both waveforms in conjunction with a multimode optical fibre taper in an “in line” configuration, and timing jitter is investigated for the case of pulse waveform input. Performance improvements are found in some offset positions with the fibre taper in line.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The reaction products of thermally generated atomic V with ethene and ethene isotopomers have been investigated by matrix isolation ultraviolet visible and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. When V is deposited into matrices of pure Ar, evidence for V and V2 are present in the UV-visible absorption spectra. Addition of trace amounts of ethene results in the elimination of absorptions due to V2 on deposition, likely due to the formation of V…(C2H4) van der Waals complexes on matrix condensation. Irradiation of matrices containing V and trace C2H4 in Ar, with light corresponding to atomic V electronic excitations, eliminates all UV-visible absorptions due to atomic V in the Infrared analysis of matrices containing V and C2H4 give evidence for a new product on deposition, consistent with a kinetically formed H-V-C2H3 isomer.&#xD;
Following further irradiation of the matrix, several new products of C-H bond insertion by the metal atom, including additional H-V-C2H3 conformational&#xD;
isomers, and H2V(η2-C2H2) products are observed in the infrared spectrum.&#xD;
Additionally, the formation of ethane is evident as a major product immediately following deposition of V + C2H4 + H2O in Ar. The formation of this product is&#xD;
consistent with alkene insertion into the V-H bond of an H-V-OH intermediate, followed by a photo-induced elimination to give C2H6.&#xD;
Under higher C2H4 concentrations, competitive ethane formation in which a sacrificial hydrogenation mechanism involving two ethene molecules is observed, analogous to the mechanism proposed to account for V + H2O + C2H4. Isotopic investigations aimed at confirming key aspects of the proposed mechanisms are also presented. Similar reactivity is observed for several metals, suggesting that&#xD;
this reaction is a generalized reaction, whenever transition metal hydrides are formed. The additional observation of ethene hydrogenation where the initiating hydride source is either water, or ethene, suggests that this reaction could also easily generalize to other initiating hydride sources. The mechanism could also extend to the insertion of other π-bond containing species, as well.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Steel bridges and structures often need strengthening due to increased life loads, or repair due to corrosion or fatigue cracking. This study explored the use of adhesively bonded Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) flexible sheets and rigid plates in retrofitting steel columns and girders, through experimental and analytical investigations. The first part of the research program investigated the behaviour of CFRP-strengthened steel columns comprised of square Hollow Structural Sections (HSS). Fifty columns, 175 mm to 2380 mm long (i.e. with slenderness ratios ranging from 4 to 93), were tested under axial compression loads to examine the effects of number and type of CFRP layers, fibre orientation, and slenderness ratio. Transverse wrapping was shown to be suitable for controlling outwards local buckling in HSS short columns, while longitudinal layers were more effective in controlling overall buckling in slender columns. The maximum increases in axial strength observed in the experiments were 18 and 71 percent, for short and slender columns, respectively. An analytical fibre-element model and a non-linear finite element model were developed for slender columns. The models account for steel plasticity, geometric non-linearities, and residual stresses. The models were verified using experimental results, and used in a parametric study. It was shown that CFRP effectiveness increases for columns with larger out-of-straightness imperfections and higher slenderness ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second part of the research program investigated w-section steel-concrete composite girders retrofitted using CFRP materials. Three girders, 6100 mm long, were tested to study strengthening of intact girders using CFRP plates. Eleven girders, 2030 mm long, including girders artificially damaged by completely cutting their tension flanges at mid-span, were tested to study the effectiveness of repair using CFRP sheets. The parameters considered were the CFRP type, number of layers, number of retrofitted sides of the tension flange, and the length of CFRP repair patch. The strength and stiffness of the intact girders have increased by 51 and 19 percent, respectively. For the repaired girders, the strength and stiffness recovery ranged from 6 to 116 percent and from 40 to 126 percent, respectively. Unlike flexural strength, the stiffness was not much affected by the bond length. Analytical models were developed, verified, and used in a parametric study, which showed that the higher the CFRP modulus, the larger the gain in stiffness and yielding moment, but the lower the gain in strength and ductility. In general, this study demonstrated that steel structures can indeed be successfully strengthened or repaired using CFRP material.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examined the academic achievement, academic self-concept, and academic motivation of 573 immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents in two public secondary schools in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Multivariate analyses revealed statistically significant differences between immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents with respect to their academic achievement, academic self-concept, and academic motivation. In addition, supplemental exploratory analyses indicated significant ethnic group differences in academic achievement, academic self-concept, and academic motivation. Surprisingly and importantly, analyses showed the absence of statistically significant gender differences among immigrant adolescents in terms of their academic achievement, academic self-concept, and academic motivation. Results from multiple linear regression analyses provided support for the Self-Description Questionnaire II as a measurement to be used with both immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents. In contrast, support for the Academic Motivation Scale, which is based on the Self-Determination Theory, was not adequately substantiated in the current research for either immigrants or non-immigrants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores some theoretical and empirical issues in the voluntary contributions to public good. Chapter I contains a brief motivation and introduction. In chapters II and III, we analyze two non-cooperative methods for either enhancing or mitigating externality-causing activities. Chapter II deals with positive externality in the public good contribution context, and chapter III with negative externality in the pollution abatement context. Chapter IV contains an empirical analysis of charitable donations by the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter II models the so-called ``corporate challenge gift'' used in real world fund-raising, and adopts the concept to voluntary contributions to public goods more generally. We model the process as a sequential game in public good contributions. One of the agents sets a quantity-contingent matching scheme to leverage higher contributions from the other players. Under the assumption that the preferences of agents are public information and the assumption that the scheme setter can commit to the matching plan, we show that the scheme brings efficient levels of total contributions to the public good.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter III applies some ideas from a joint work with Professor Robin Boadway and Professor Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Tremblay on ``Commitment and Matching Contributions to Public Goods'' to the issue of reducing negative externality-causing activity. In particular, it adapts both the Guttman-Danziger-Schnytzer type of rate-matching mechanism and the quantity-contingent matching method for public good contributions to the international pollution abatement problem. In a simple two-country model, we find that both matching schemes induce the countries to internalize the negative externality imposed on the other country. However, perhaps due to the lack of enough policy instruments, they cannot equate the marginal costs of abatement across the countries, leaving room for Pareto improvement. This further improvement can be achieved if the two countries also contribute to a conventional public~good.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter IV is an empirical exercise on some positive externality-generating activities by the elderly. It attempts to document the charitable giving of money and time by people aged 60 or above in the 2003 PSID data for the United States and analyze the influences of some economic and demographic factors on these activities. Income, wealth, the subjective rating of health status, and years in school are found to have statistically significant impacts. Income and wealth appear to have distinct influences. The tax price of money donation also has a statistically significant effect on money donations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Exposure to crude oils has been shown to induce CYP1A enzymes and cause chronically toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Earlier studies indicated that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in crude oil are primarily responsible for the chronic toxicity. Crude oil contains a variety of PAHs; the majority of them are alkyl substituted. In this work, we have used an effects-driven fractionation and analysis approach (EDFA) to isolate and characterize PAHs present in Alaskan North Slope and Scotian Light crude oils that are toxic to fish.&#xD;
The crude oil components were first fractionated into four fractions using a low temperature vacuum distillation technique. Among them, the heavy gas oil fraction (boiling range 287°C – 461°C) of both oils caused highest toxicity to fish. To isolate the PAHs from waxes present in this fraction, a low temperature wax precipitation method was developed and optimized. CYP1A induction results showed that the extract contained a large number of CYP1A inducers while the residue contained none. Chemical analyses confirmed that most of the PAHs were partitioned into the extract fraction. Alkyl PAHs present in the extract were further fractionated into five fractions based on the number of aromatic rings using a normal phase HPLC method. Chemical analysis and the toxicity testing of these fractions indicated that alkyl PAHs belonging to classes such as phenanthrene, fluorene, naphthobenzothiophene, and chrysene are likely responsible for the observed toxic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
To aid the EDFA scheme, a new HPLC-DAD method for the analysis of alkyl PAHs was developed. The alkyl PAHs were first fractionated based on the number of aromatic rings using a normal phase column followed by their analysis using reverse phase HPLC–DAD technique. The reverse phase analysis involved classifying the alkyl PAH peaks into different PAH classes based on their DAD spectra. Then, alkyl carbon numbers for each peak were assigned based on their retention time. To analyze co-eluting alkyl PAH isomers an offline multi-dimensional HPLC method was developed. Orthogonal separation was achieved by first fractionating the alkyl PAHs on a normal phase column followed by the RP-HPLC-DAD analysis. Using these data a 2D contour plot was developed and used for the detailed analysis of alkyl PAHs isomers. Analysis results showed good agreement with a gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis method, and the new method was able to distinguish some PAH types which could not be identified by GC-MS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Philosophers often endorse the claim that perceptual experience has content.  However, the significance of this claim is highly disputed.  A particularly central issue is the relationship between concepts and the content of perceptual experience.  Accounts of this relationship are largely shaped by a key question; is perceptual content itself conceptual, or is it nonconceptual?  In the following thesis, I focus on this debate, and consider arguments in favour of both conceptualism and nonconceptualism.  The first chapter lays the foundation for the other two, by developing some general views about perceptual content, and what it means to claim that the content of perceptual experience is either conceptual or nonconceptual.  In the second chapter, arguments on behalf of conceptualism are discussed, which largely focus on epistemic issues surrounding perceptual experience.  The third chapter discusses the idea that perceptual experience outstrips conceptual resources in various ways.  I argue that on the balance of considerations, primarily due to certain ways in which experience is situation dependent, a stronger case can be made for nonconceptualism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As in many arctic regions, impacts of increasing environmental stressors such as climate change and industrialization (particularly mineral exploration and mine development) have led local Inuit in northern Labrador to notice changes in their environment.  In addition, they have expressed concerns that research and monitoring programs aimed at understanding and tracking these changes are lacking in many areas and do not accurately reflect their knowledge and concerns.  Many communities feel powerless in the face of these changes as they lack the resources needed to respond. In consideration of this, an integrated regional approach has been initiated in Nunatsiavut to ensure concerns from all stakeholders, including Inuit as well as major industrial and governmental organizations, are adequately addressed.  &#xD;
The purpose of this study was to further the understanding of environmental changes in Anaktalâk Bay (the shipping route to the Voisey’s Bay Nickel mine) and the effects of these changes on local Inuit in order to inform the development of a multi-partner monitoring (MPM) program for the area.  The research was conducted using a participatory approach that included documenting Inuit knowledge (IK) obtained during a workshop involving 14 long-term residents of Nain (&gt;25 years; both genders) in December 2006. Trends identified during the transcript analysis highlight that often the most severe perceived effects on Inuit occur when environmental stressors work synergistically.  Key linkages between environmental changes and effects were also identified.&#xD;
The workshop findings document the local desire for a monitoring program to track ecosystem-based changes, as well as the social, economic and environmental effects of these changes, to ensure that Inuit are able to mitigate these changes, and adapt when mitigation is not possible or sufficient. Workshop participants voiced an interest in participating in future monitoring activities and it is anticipated that program development will give both researchers and community members an opportunity to continue to work together and learn from each other, in order to develop and implement relevant and appropriate local solutions. Ultimately, this program should begin to address the Inuit desire in this region to strengthen and protect their relationship with the environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The high-energy open shelf along the southern Australian continental margin is blanketed by heterozoan cool-water carbonates of late Pleistocene and Holocene age.  Three distinct assemblages have been identified and radiocarbon dated.  These include: i) Holocene grains, unaltered biofragments deposited during Marine Isotope Stage 1; ii) stranded grains, grey and buff-colored abraded biofragments and intraclasts marooned during the sea level rise associated with the latter stages of Marine Isotope Stage 2; and iii) relict grains, highly abraded, iron-stained intraclasts originally deposited during the intermediate sea-level stands of Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 4.  Whereas the skeletal makeup of Holocene grains has been previously detailed, attributes of the older grains have not been elucidated.  Relict-grain skeletal composition indicates that during Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 4 shallow, warm, oligotrophic, marine grassbed environments developed across the western portion of the region, whereas more heterozoan assemblages to the east imply cooler marine waters and that an overall upwelling regime was in effect.  Stranded grains (Marine Isotope Stage 2) are mostly heterozoan across the whole region, reflecting deposition on narrower shelves (restricted euphotic zone) and in generally cool waters.  Stable isotopic compositions of relict and stranded foraminifera indicate that the western portion of the region (the Great Australian Bight) had water of elevated salinity.  Environments analogous to outer Shark Bay are interpreted to have formed across the Great Australian Bight during portions of Marine Isotope Stages 2, 3 and 4. &#xD;
Comparison between relatively unaltered Holocene grains and altered late Pleistocene stranded and relict grains reveals pathways of early diagenesis in this cool-water marine realm.  Both calcitic and aragonitic biogenic grains display dissolution features.  Dissolution of calcitic components over the past ~20,000 years is incomplete (stranded and relict sediments are predominantly Mg-calcite).  Aragonitic skeletons, however, are mostly dissolved over this same time period.  Contemporaneously, micritic cement also precipitates in this environment, wherein Mg-calcite (~12 mol%) infills skeletal pores of many stranded and most relict skeletons.  Similar cement locally precipitates between grains, forming cemented grain aggregates.  &#xD;
Mobilization of metals in the slightly reducing pore waters of the southern Australian margin has resulted in the formation of Fe- and Mn-oxides that discolor the stranded and relict grains.  Such oxides precipitated on the surface of shells, in empty microbial borings, and in skeletal micropores, scavenge other trace metals, altering the original elemental makeup of these cool-water carbonates.  Trace element analysis of Holocene carbonate grains and of living gastropod skeletons indicates that these coatings begin to precipitate during or soon after shell formation.  Marine dissolution/precipitation dynamics in addition to mobilization of metals in pore water, fundamentally changes the sedimentological and chemical attributes of these cool-water carbonates on the seafloor soon after deposition.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Canadian National Memorial Site, near Vimy, Artois, France, commemorates the WWI Battle of Vimy Ridge; where all four divisions of the young Canadian Corps fought together with the British Forces to liberate the French ridge.  Today, trench systems and an extensive subterranean network of tunnels underlie the gentle landscape of the park, which is visited each year by hundreds of thousands of tourists.  Failure within these excavations is expressed as local subsidence and is potentially hazardous to the public.&#xD;
	The following research identifies the geologic factors that influence instability in the excavations and how these factors vary both with depth and lateral extent.  The Artois region of northern France is underlain by Upper Cretaceous chalk with a thin veneer of Paleocene sediments.  Structure is dominated by the northwest-southeast trending Weald-Boulonnais anticlinorium. &#xD;
Three principle geological controls govern failure within the excavations at the Vimy site; lithologic variations, structural geometry and carbonate dissolution.  An extensive stratigraphic study identified variable horizons such as chalk marls, nodular chalks, hardgrounds and flint seams, which affect the strength, permeability and structure of the rockmass.  &#xD;
Structural geometry in the chalk varies with depth and clay content.  Orthogonal fracture patterns are typical in pure carbonate rockmasses whereas inclined conjugate sets occur in clay-rich chalk.  Three failure mechanisms were observed in the Vimy excavations that vary with structure and lithology.  Beam failure via block fall-out is observed in pure chalk with subhorizontal and subvertical structures.  Ravelling, the upward propagation of roof failure, is typical of closely spaced inclined jointing, and is also observed in shallow clay-rich lithologies.  Finally, dissolution pipes occur at the intersection lineations of conjugate joint sets, and are also typical of clay-rich lithologies. &#xD;
Dissolution by meteoric groundwater is identified as the third geologic control and results in a decrease of intact strength, weakening of joint surfaces and overall loss of confinement in the rockmass, thereby initiating the failure modes described previously. &#xD;
	These extensive geologic studies pinpoint the origins and variability of instability in the rockmass at the Vimy site.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this study was to further investigate the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of fetal cererbral white matter injury associated with chorioamnionitis by charaterizing the time course of the cytokine response in the pregnant guinea pig following a maternal inflammatory insult. Chorioamnionitis increases the risk for fetal brain injury. In the guinea pig, a threshold maternal inflammatory response must be reached for significant fetal brain injury to occur. However, a previous study demonstrated that, by seven days after an acute maternal inflammatory insult, cytokine levels in both maternal and fetal compartments are not different from controls. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to test the hypothesis that a significant cytokine response occurs within the first seven days following an acute maternal inflammatory response. Pregnant guinea pigs (n=34) were injected intraperitoneally with 100µg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 70% gestation and euthanized at 24 hours, 48 hours or 5 days following endotoxin exposure. Control animals were euthanized at 70% gestation without exposure. Concentrations of interleukin-6, interleukin 1-β and tumour necrosis factor-α (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) were quantified in the maternal serum and amniotic fluid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations were elevated in the maternal serum at 24 hours and returned to control levels by five days. In the amniotic fluid, IL-6 peaked at 48 hours and IL-1β at 24 hours. TNF-α levels were not significantly increased. A single maternal LPS injection produces transient increases in cytokine concentrations in the maternal serum and amniotic fluid. This further implicates the cytokines as potential mediators of fetal white matter damage. Although this response might not be sufficient to produce the brain injury itself, it may initiate harmful pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, which could even continue to harm the fetus following delivery. A human diagnostic protocol was developed to assess the use of serial serum biomarkers, including IL-6 and TNF-α, in the prediction of histological chorioamnionitis. Preliminary analysis of the pilot study suggests that certain biomarkers might be worthy of further investigation in a larger-scale study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As organizations and government agencies work diligently to detect financial irregularities, malfeasance, fraud and criminal activities through intercepted communication, there is an increasing interest in devising an automated model/tool for deception detection. We build on Pennebaker's empirical model which suggests that deception in text leaves a linguistic signature characterised by changes in frequency of four categories of words: first-person pronouns, exclusive words, negative emotion words, and action words. By applying the model to the Enron email dataset and using an unsupervised matrix-decomposition technique, we explore the differential use of these cue-words/categories in deception detection. Instead of focusing on the predictive power of the individual cue-words, we construct a descriptive model which helps us to understand the multivariate profile of deception based on several linguistic dimensions and highlights the qualitative differences between deceptive and truthful communication. This descriptive model can not only help detect unusual and deceptive communication, but also possibly rank messages along a scale of relative deceptiveness (for instance from strategic negotiation and spin to deception and blatant lying). The model is unintrusive, requires minimal human intervention and, by following the defined pre-processing steps it may be applied to new datasets from different domains.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates the application of pattern recognition techniques to rock type recognition using monitoring-while-drilling data. The research is focused on data from a large electric blasthole drill operating in an open-pit coal mine. Pre-processing and normalization techniques are applied to minimize potential misclassification issues. Both supervised and unsupervised learning is employed in the classifier design: back-propagation neural networks are used for the supervised learning, while self-organizing maps are used for unsupervised learning. A variety of combinations of drilling data and geophysical data are investigated as inputs to the classifiers. The outputs from these classifiers are evaluated relative to the rock classification made by a commercially available rock type recognition system, as well as relative to independent labelling by a geologist.  Classifier performance is improved when drilling data used as inputs are augmented with geophysical data inputs. By using supervised learning with both drilling and geophysical data as inputs, the misclassification of coal, as well as of the non-coal rock types, is reduced compared to results of current commercial recognition methods. Moreover, rock types which were not detected by the previous methods were successfully classified by the supervised models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies several issues in the field of macroeconomic and financial stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 2, I argue that systemic bankruptcy of firms can originate from coordination failure in an economy with investment complementarities. I demonstrate that in such an economy, a very small uncertainty about economic fundamentals can be magnified through the uncertainty about the investment decisions of other firms and can lead to coordination failure, which may be manifested as systemic bankruptcy. Moreover, my model reveals that systemic bankruptcy tends to arise when economic fundamentals are in the middle range where coordination matters. High financial leverage of firms greatly increases the severity of systemic bankruptcy. Optimistic beliefs of firms and banks can alleviate coordination failure, but can also increase the severity of systemic bankruptcy once it happens.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 3 studies how coordination failure in a country's new technology investment dampens a country's economic growth. I establish a two-sector Overlapping Generation model where capital goods are produced by two different technologies. The first is a conventional technology with constant returns. The second is a new technology exhibiting increasing returns to scale due to technological externalities, about whose returns economic agents have only incomplete information. My model reveals that coordination failure in new technology investment can lead to slower economic growth. More interestingly, the model generates a positive correlation between economic growth and volatility.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 4, Frank Milne and I establish a dynamic currency attack model in the presence of a large player. In an attack on a fixed exchange rate regime with a gradually overvalued currency, both the inability of speculators to synchronize their attack and their incentive to time the collapse of the regime lead to the persistent overvaluation of the currency. We find that the presence of a large player can accelerate or delay the collapse of the regime, depending on his incentives to preempt other speculators or to “ride the overvaluation."</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The London dispersion interaction is responsible for attraction between non-polar molecules and is of great importance in describing structure and reactivity in many areas of chemistry. Dispersion is difficult to model accurately. Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods, widely used in computational chemistry today, do not include the necessary physics. This often leads to qualitatively incorrect predictions when DFT is applied to dispersion-bound systems. A novel DFT method has been developed which is capable of accurately modeling dispersion. Dispersion attraction between molecules arises when an instantaneous dipole moment in one molecule induces a dipole moment in a second molecule. Our approach proposes that the source of these instantaneous dipole moments is the position-dependent dipole moment of the exchange hole. The model is no more computationally expensive than existing DFTs and gives remarkably accurate dispersion coefficients, intermolecular separations, intermolecular binding energies, and intramolecular conformational energies. Our dispersion theory is also combined with previous post-exact-exchange models of dynamical and nondynamical correlation, yielding a unified exact-exchange-based energy functional called DF07. DF07 overcomes many of the outstanding problems in DFT arising from local exchange approximations. The DF07 model is shown to provide highly accurate results for thermochemistry, kinetics, and van der Waals&#xD;
interactions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The rural cemetery was a European creation first introduced in the nineteenth century. Relocated outside the commercial city sector the cemetery was promoted as a diversion to the confusion and complexity of urban life. Applying picturesque ideas to traditional burial grounds rural cemeteries became symbolic landscapes for the city and country.  The aesthetic nature of its design became an inspiration and eventual model for North American cemeteries. &#xD;
&#xD;
As a cultural institution, the cemetery is constantly in flux. Centuries of interaction between society and the cemetery have resulted in substantial changes that have shaped the present landscape. Although traditionally in public-trust, cemeteries have become largely privatized, operated, managed and developed as businesses for-profit. The commercially-driven practices of these institutions have had significant impacts on the present cemetery landscape. Toronto’s Mount Pleasant Cemetery is a good example of a cemetery experiencing this extensive commercial restructuring. &#xD;
A review of pertinent literature outlined recent transformations within the cemetery landscape citing concerns over the emerging private-enterprise cemetery and its impacts on the burial landscape. My fieldwork examined site-transformations specific to Mount Pleasant through an in-depth analysis of the present cemetery landscape. Concepts of commercialization, commodification and heritage tourism framed my analysis of the architecture, landscaped environment and new developments in light of the rising ‘cemetery business’.&#xD;
&#xD;
My findings revealed that by expanding into a multi-purpose cemetery Mount Pleasant is learning to do business in the twenty-first century. Increasingly run as a private enterprise Mount Pleasant Cemetery remains a historical landmark in crisis, unsure how to remain competitive in the commercial industry of the present, while preserving the integrity and traditions of the past.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine how sport type and interdependence were associated with the growth experiences of select level male basketball players (n = 150) and distance runners (n = 98), aged 14 to 17 years. This study also examined how growth experiences were related to the outcomes of enjoyment and burnout. Athletes completed the Youth Experiences Survey 2.0 (Hansen &amp; Larson, 2005), Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (Raedeke &amp; Smith, 2001), Sources of Enjoyment in Youth Sport Questionnaire (Wiersma, 2001), and a newly developed scale assessing interdependence. Hierarchical multiple regression procedures determined sport type was an independent predictor of teamwork and social skills experiences, and adult networks and social capital experiences. Basketball players reported higher rates of growth experiences promoting adult networks and social capital, and teamwork and social skills, and negative experiences. In terms of interdependence levels, athletes from both sports did not differ. Hierarchical multiple regression determined interdependence was an independent predictor of growth experiences promoting identity exploration, initiative, positive relationships, adult networks and social capital, and teamwork and social skills. Hierarchical multiple regression also determined negative experiences significantly predicted burnout. Although different sports may provide different learning environments for youth, interdependence levels in a sport setting were also related to the learning environment, independent of sport type. From this study, it can be surmised that the learning environments of youth sports may be more strongly influenced by how the people involved interact than by the type of sport.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>While sorting through my experiences as a student teacher, my research question has shifted from “How can teacher education be improved?” to “How is teacher education represented?” I am interested in the juxtaposition of these two inquiries, and use them not to suggest pedagogical rules, but to draw attention to the kinds of spaces such a juxtaposition opens up. The shift in my research question is influenced by the discursive turn—the movement from social justice theories to poststructuralist theories, from theories based on experience to theories based on discourse. Questions of representation are the focus not only of poststructuralist theories but also of psychoanalytic theories, or theories of the unconscious, and both theories acknowledge that representations of reality are excessive: they contain more and less than that which they represent (Orner et al., 2005). The concept of excess enables me to make sense of moments in my teacher education program that could not be contained by dominant educational discourses of knowledge, reflection, and inclusion. The excessiveness of a teaching strategy called the Six Thinking Hats troubles the theory/practice binary in discourses of knowledge. The excessiveness of an assignment about philosophies of teaching, and a class discussion in response to the film Submission trouble the enlightenment/ignorance binary in discourses of reflection. And, the excessiveness of my attempt to question curricular content troubles the normal/exceptional binary in discourses of inclusion. I use excessive moments from my teacher education program to question existing discourses, and to suggest that we need to change the stories we tell ourselves about education (King, 2003). Our current educational discourses perpetuate histories of violence that we have inherited, and I suggest that social justice, poststructuralist, and psychoanalytic theories will enable us to more effectively heal from these inherited histories.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>RdoA is a bacterial protein kinase from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium first noted for its regulation of dsbA expression in this organism.  The crystal structure of RdoA’s homologue, YihE from Escherichia coli, revealed a basic bi-lobal kinase domain that is a hallmark of the eukaryotic Ser/Thr, Tyr protein kinase superfamily.  YihE however, bears the greatest structural similarity to choline kinase and aminoglycoside 3’-phosphotransferase [APH(3’)]-IIIa which are both atypical kinases.  RdoA and YihE have demonstrated the capacity for autophosphorylation in vitro and the ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein, however, the native kinase target protein has not been identified.  Based on structural alignment with APH(3’)-IIIa, predictions were made of key residues involved in ATP binding and catalysis and five YihE mutants were generated.  Both the wildtype and YihE mutants were cloned for expression as N-terminal histidine-tagged proteins.  In the work presented here, these proteins have been overexpressed and purified for further study.  Mutational analyses revealed that four of the five mutants had decreased kinase activity in comparison to the wildtype protein, thereby establishing the mutated residues as important for enzymatic activity.  Several attempts were made to elucidate the substrate of RdoA/YihE, however, it remains unknown.  Further investigation is necessary to identify its substrate(s) and to pinpoint its physiological significance.  RdoA is a member of the Cpx regulon and its absence stimulates Cpx activation.  Since the Cpx system is involved in regulating expression of cell surface appendages and is one of three envelope stress response systems, it is hypothesized that RdoA serves to relay Cpx activation signals.  This is supported by studies on the effect of pH on Cpx activity in wildtype and rdoA- cells presented here.  RdoA homologues are present in at least 85 different genera.  This level of conservation is indicative of an important biological role for this previously uncharacterized bacterial protein kinase.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability to obtain complex global behaviour from simple local rules makes cellular automata an interesting platform for massively parallel computation. However, manually designing a cellular automaton to perform a given computation can be extremely tedious, and automated design techniques such as genetic programming have their limitations because of the absence of human intuition. In this thesis, we propose elements of a framework whose goal is to make the manual synthesis of cellular automata rules exhibiting desired global characteristics more programmer-friendly, while maintaining the simplicity of local processing elements. We also demonstrate the power of that framework by using it to provide intuitive yet effective solutions to the two-dimensional majority classification problem, the convex hull of disconnected points problem, and various problems pertaining to node placement in wireless sensor networks.</dcterms:abstract>

poisons such as oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
Before using the chemical hydride packed bed, heat transfer through the reactor was studied using circulating water. The water experiments showed that an increase in&#xD;
heat flux to the reactor led to a faster desorption rate of hydrogen from the metal hydride resulting in a larger temperature drop throughout the reactor.&#xD;
&#xD;
After the operating characteristics of the hybrid reactor were studied, a 10 wt%&#xD;
solution of sodium borohydride was created and pumped through the packed bed to&#xD;
produce enough hydrogen for a 300 W fuel cell. The amount of heat produced from the&#xD;
packed bed portion of the reactor was significant, but temperatures levelled to around 80 °C. As expected, temperature control was directly proportional to the rate of hydrogen release from the metal hydride. On average, approximately 10% of the available heat energy was transferred to the metal hydride, and the hybrid reactor operated with gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 0.27 kWh·kg-1 and 1.29 kWh·L-1 respectively. If the hybrid reactor is used solely to control peak temperatures, the amount of metal hydride necessary for thermal control could be decreased. Additionally, improvements in heat transfer as well as the hydrogen storage materials themselves would increase the energy density values further.&#xD;
&#xD;
When compared to other energy storage devices, the hybrid reactor without&#xD;
improvements is competitive as a backup power generator due to its silent operation and&#xD;
large volumetric energy density. Since the hybrid reactor can provide quiet and cool&#xD;
energy storage in a relatively small volume, it may become an effective and efficient&#xD;
means for hydrogen storage with limited improvements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this study is to improve the understanding of the effect of biofilm growth and biofouling on well performance in a fractured rock aquifer.  The study was conducted by investigating biofouling in several recently drilled and much older wells.  The study was conducted at three field sites using six groundwater wells in Perth, Portland and Cambridge Ontario.  The well located in Perth was drilled in the spring of 2006 and after preliminary hydraulic testing; biofilm was grown in the well by the addition of nutrients (steel wool, Difco beef peptone and gelatin).  The wells located in Portland and Cambridge are more than 10 years old and were already biofouled.  In each case, the well was hydraulically tested using open- well pumping methods and via slug testing using a straddle packer system (1.7m spacing) in which measurements were obtained contiguously from the bottom to the top of the well.  This provided distinct measurements of the hydraulic properties of the individual fracture zones along the length of each hole.  The five older wells in Portland and Cambridge were cleaned following the initial testing using recirculation of hydrochloric acid followed by recirculation of 35% hydrogen peroxide.  Once the cleaning was completed, the hydraulic testing was repeated.  Each of the wells were videotaped using a downhole camera at various stages during the study.  Samples were obtained on three occasions for bacterial typing using the BART™ system.  Transmissivity data from the different states of fouling (drilled, fouled or cleaned) were compared and it was determined that fractures with low transmissivity values are more susceptible to the effects of biofouling than those with high transmissivity.  The reduction in transmissivity was as much as 50% percent.  Fractures with low transmissivity are of small apertures which are easily plugged by biofilm.  The cleaning process did not markedly improve total wellbore performance for those wells where a comparison was made following cleaning.  The presence of any form of iron, (i.e. steel well casing or steel pump parts) in the well will contribute significantly to the biofouling, based on the results of the laboratory study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In a constructed treatment wetland applied to domestic wastewaters, long term studies and increased operational experience indicate that phosphorus removal is variable or inconsistent, especially in cold-climate applications. These inconsistencies can be attributed to the complexity of phosphorus removal mechanisms, and the lack of consideration of these complexities in the design, installation and operation of these treatment systems. Sorption of phosphorus to the wetland media is generally considered to be the major removal mechanism. The research described in this thesis was conducted to determine the most suitable material for application in a constructed wetland and a post wetland-filter to treat phosphorus in wastewater effluents, taking advantage of sorption processes. The present work was conducted at lab (bench) scale. &#xD;
Three potential sorptive media were studied in the research program, namely gravel, slag and clinker. Several methods for media analysis were investigated as potential screening tools for media selection.  To determine the various forms of phosphorus in the media, sequential extraction tests were considered to be most relevant and useful for this research. Batch testing and flow cell testing along with sequential extraction tests were conducted to predict the sorption capacity and performance of the media for the long term (10+ years) removal of phosphorus. The protocols developed in this thesis permitted a rigorous assessment of the media and should be applied in any assessment of sorptive media to select the best medium.&#xD;
Gravel showed some sorption of phosphorus although it was not sufficient to meet the regulatory limits for the effluent concentration. Clinker and slag showed high sorption capacity as compared to gravel and the observed effluent concentration was below the regulatory limits. All three media showed the presence of background phosphorus, with clinker having the highest amount of background phosphorus. However, except gravel, clinker and slag did not show any significant amount of phosphorus being leached out during low phosphorus loading conditions. Taking all factors under consideration, slag and clinker were identified as good media for phosphorus removal. Media that have proven to have high sorption capacities and also retention capabilities should be considered for applications where phosphorus removal is the prime objective.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A laboratory study was conducted to assess the relationship between degree of volatile organic compound (VOC) mass removal from soil and heating duration, initial dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) saturation, and grain size. The relationship between post-remedy sampling temperature and VOC soil concentration was examined.  Soil contained in glass jars was spiked with DNAPL phase tetrachloroethylene (PCE), saturated, and placed in an oven for a specified period of time. The soil temperature at the centre of each jar was monitored during heating. Upon removal from the oven, each jar was immediately capped with an air tight seal and placed into an ice bath until the soil temperature had cooled to the desired sampling temperature.  The jar caps were subsequently removed and the soil was sampled using a coring tool and immersed into pre-weighed vials containing methanol.  PCE in soil samples was quantified using purge-and-trap with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Soil temperature increased steadily from ambient until reaching a plateau at 89 ºC ± 4 ºC due to co-boiling of DNAPL phase PCE and water.  A linear relationship was found between the length of the co-boiling plateau and the initial PCE saturation.  Co-boiling continued until DNAPL phase PCE had been depleted, at which time the soil temperature increased to the boiling point of water and remained constant while remaining pore water was removed. &#xD;
&#xD;
PCE soil concentrations decreased rapidly in the early stages of heating, but leveled off between 9.0 and 19 ppb soon after the soil became dried out. Analysis of the sensitivity to initial PCE saturation data revealed that the concentration of PCE in post-remedy samples increased with increasing initial saturation. Results of the sensitivity to grain size tests showed a decreasing trend between PCE soil concentration and decreasing sand grain size while temperature at sampling was not found to affect the amount of PCE quantified post-thermal remedy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Soil temperature at the centre of each jar during cooling was measured and an analytical solution was fit to the recorded data.  From this data, the thermal diffusivity of the soil was approximated and was found to range from 1.4 x 10-7 to 1.8 x 10-7 m2/s.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the absence of clinical markers for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), research&#xD;
to find a biological basis for it is still open. Many data-mining techniques have&#xD;
been widely employed to analyze biomedical data describing different aspects of CFS.&#xD;
However, the inconsistency of the results of these studies reflect the uncertainty in&#xD;

biological basis that is detectable in gene expression data better than blood profile&#xD;
and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data. Using random forests, the analysis&#xD;
of gene expression data achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 89%. We also&#xD;
identify sets of differentially expressed candidate genes that might contribute to CFS.&#xD;
We show that the integration of data spanning multiple levels of the biological scale&#xD;
might reveal further insights into the understanding of CFS. Using integrated data,&#xD;
we achieve a prediction accuracy of approximately 91%. We find that Singular Value&#xD;
Decomposition (SVD) is a useful technique to visualize the performance of random&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies the influence of values and perception on pedestrian behaviour, to recommend how places can be designed to satisfy their user needs. By satisfying needs we mean creating user perceptions that resonate with the environmental values held by the users. &#xD;
&#xD;
This study examines user perception of a number of pedestrian environments in New Delhi, India to identify if the environments satisfy their users’ environmental values, and then to explain how this happens. It studies Kevin Lynch’s performance dimensions for good city form – safety, access, fit, sense, and control – as some environmental values that are common to most people. &#xD;
&#xD;
The study finds that user perceptions of how the environment affects these values will influence user behaviour. It also becomes evident that the legibility of paths, edges, and landmarks plays an important role in the mechanics of perception. Legibility is crucial to the pedestrian’s mental image of the environment: the more legible the paths, edges, and landmarks, the easier it is for the user to construct his or her mental image. Legible surroundings will enhance the user’s perception of the environment’s ability to satisfy his or her values. &#xD;
&#xD;
The findings are used to recommend design improvements for the pedestrian environment. The successful application of this study method in New Delhi suggests robustness of Lynch’s analysis regarding how the legibility of the physical environment – especially of paths, edges, and landmarks - is a key determinant of the success of an environment to satisfy important values that are common to most users.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Microprocessor systems have been advancing at a phenomenal rate, with each new generation introducing improved fabrication processes and architectural innovations. Unfortunately, traditional fabrication techniques cannot sustain this exponential growth indefinitely. Thus, additional research into conventional design methodologies, such as those involving asynchronous design techniques, is essential to maintain the current trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
The primary objective of this research was to explore the viability of asynchronous design techniques as an alternative to current synchronous design methods. In order to simulate the design complexities involved in a real-world system, the MIPS-II R2000 pipelined microprocessor was selected as the basis for comparison. All of the experimental processors were designed in VHDL on an FPGA using the Altera Quartus II design package. The processors were tested using timing simulations with various benchmarks to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each design technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
Four distinct asynchronous processors with varying handshaking and synchronization methods were designed and compared to the baseline synchronous processor. Although, in theory, each of the asynchronous design variations had its merits, it was clear that not all of them were well suited for practical use in a large-scale microprocessor environment. Three of the asynchronous processors suffered from an excessive amount of synchronization overhead that drastically reduced their overall system performance to the point where they performed considerably worse than the baseline synchronous processor. However, one asynchronous processor performed considerably better: with only a 1.5 percent increase in logic complexity, it outperformed the baseline synchronous processor by over 10 percent on a sorting test benchmark and had a maximum theoretical speedup of over 36 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Therefore, it is evident that asynchronous designs have the potential to improve the performance of traditional synchronous systems. However, designing efficient and hazard-free asynchronous logic on an FPGA proved to be challenging and time-consuming. With additional research and further design tool improvements to facilitate the creation of optimized glitch-free logic, asynchronous design methodologies may become a viable alternative to traditional synchronous designs and contribute to the current trend of microprocessor advancement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research is grounded in my observation that we live in a society that is racist, sexist, classist, heterosexist, able-ist, and oppressive in other ways for a variety of groups and individuals outside of the dominant norm. Schools functions as sites of reproduction that work to maintain the status quo through the reproduction of racist, sexist, classist, and heterosexist language and discourse (among others) that maintain the normalcy of oppressive behaviour. However, in as much as schools may reproduce inequalities, they could equally well produce possibilities for equal and just relations in society. In many ways, schools are contradictory places where the dynamics of reproduction and production are simultaneously at work. The question becomes one of how to encourage and nurture the possibility of schools to become sites of struggle over oppressive relations in society. Critical multicultural theory has been proposed as one possible answer to this question.&#xD;
While critical multicultural education understands schooling as a site of social reproduction, it is also believed that schools can work to challenge the inequality engendered by the process of social reproduction by educating students about the dynamics of oppression and privilege. Schools are, thus, understood as sites of possibility, where the normative and common sense understanding of society’s current oppressive relations are deconstructed and critiqued. In this work, I use critical multicultural theory to focus on the role of teacher education in the creation of new possibilities for schooling.&#xD;
The purpose of this research is to examine new possibilities for teacher education by making problematic the normative discourse of a university teacher education program and its implication for critical multicultural teaching. As such, this research will deconstruct the dominant discourse in a Faculty of Education at a mid-size Canadian university through an examination and analysis of the perspectives of current teacher candidates; examine how the discourses in teacher education work to constrain and limit the possibility of critical multicultural education; consider the pedagogical challenges of a critical approach to multicultural education; and provide new possibilities for teacher education and, in particular, critical multicultural teacher education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The retinoid X receptor (RXR) participates in a multitude of nuclear receptor signaling pathways and is induced by its highly sought-after cognate ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA).  In flies and moths, molting is mediated by the ecdysone receptor that consists of a heterodimer comprising the ecdysone receptor monomer (EcR) and the invertebrate RXR homolog ultraspiracle (USP); the latter, however, is believed to have diverged from its RXR origin.  From the more evolutionarily-primitive insect Locusta migratoria (Lm), long and short RXR transcripts (LmRXR-L and LmRXR-S, respectively) were detected during embryogenesis.  This thesis reports the immunochemical detection of RXR cross-reactive material throughout Locusta embryogenesis, suggesting that the protein may have another role besides ecdysone signaling.  Thus, the RXR isoforms were cloned for recombinant expression and purification in order to demonstrate retinoid specificity.  Both isoforms bound 9-cis-RA and all-trans-RA with high affinity.  Binding was further corroborated by the identification of endogenous retinoids during embryogenesis.  Embryos were first subjected to modified “Bligh and Dyer” as well as solid phase extractions to circumvent oil precipitation that rendered whole homogenates unsuitable for retinoid assay and detection.  The RA-inducible Cyp26A1-promoter reporter cell line identified the presence of endogenous RAs (5.4 nM) from insect embryo extracts.  Finally, high pressure liquid chromatography followed by mass spectroscopy (HPLC/MS) confirmed the identity of all-trans-RA and the more abundant 9-cis-RA (1.3 nM).  These findings suggest a functional role for 9-cis-RA in the invertebrate embryo and favour signaling through the combination of 9-cis-RA and RXR in evolutionarily early RA-driven animal development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibilities in reinventing Freirean critical pedagogy in the context of Indian formal education, and to examine the tensions and limitations that emerge and that would need to be addressed in such an attempt. It argues that Brazilian educator Paulo Freire's model of critical pedagogy can offer useful ideas and possibilities for change in the formal education system in India that is currently suppressing critical education and thereby perpetuating inequality and oppression. However, inasmuch as current educational practice in India is embedded in a cultural worldview that is different from the cultural worldview which shaped Freire's thinking, his theory will have to be contextualized, in keeping with the ideals of humanization, epistemology, liberation, ontology and pedagogy that are valued in Indian society, in order to be reinvented successfully in the Indian context. &#xD;
&#xD;
To this end, the thesis will present a comparative study of Freirean critical pedagogy and the Indian culture of pedagogy in order to explore the following questions: What are some of the possibilities that a Freirean perspective can offer for a critique of the Indian culture of pedagogy? What are some of the possibilities that an Indian perspective can offer for a critique of the cultural specificities of Freire's worldview? What are some of the tensions between the two worldviews that would need to be addressed in order to successfully reinvent critical pedagogy in the context of Indian education, and what are some tentative ways to address these tensions? These questions will be answered by exploring the points of commonality and difference between the worldviews framing the Indian culture of pedagogy and critical pedagogy. Based on the specific historical, social, cultural and political context in which each of these pedagogies arose, the thesis will explore how the points of commonality between these two frameworks can allow them to speak to each other, and how the differences between them can be potentially reconciled. Postcolonial theory, Clarke's (2001) construct of "the culture of pedagogy," and critical pedagogy itself will together provide the conceptual lens through which these questions will be examined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of three different electromyography (EMG) detection systems commonly used to acquire EMG data from the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) at rest, during maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) and during a coughing task. Twelve nulliparous women between the ages of 24 and 40 participated in the study. EMG data were recorded from each side of the pelvic floor using surface (Femiscan™ and Periform™ vaginal probes), and fine-wire electrodes while subjects performed three repetitions of each task in supine and in standing. RMS amplitudes of baseline and peak PFM activity were computed from the data acquired during the MVC and the coughing tasks. The peak RMS amplitudes from the cough data were also normalized to each subject’s MVC and report as a percent of their maximum voluntary electrical activation (% MVE). Signal to noise ratio (SNR) was calculated for each task. Comparisons were made between the RMS amplitudes and SNR recorded from each side of the PFM. Between-trial and between-day reliability was determined using a variety of measures including intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficients of variation (CV) and mean absolute difference (MAD). The reliability of the different devices was compared using the MAD normalized to average signal amplitude (nMAD). The results indicated that the EMG data recorded from the right and left sides of the PFM were different, therefore the EMG data acquired from each side of the pelvic floor were analyzed separately. Between-trial reliability assessed by ICC was good for all the devices (left and right average ICC(3,1) = 0.80 – 0.96); the CVs supported these findings (average CV = 12.4 – 17.1%)   Between-day reliability was poor and inconsistent across all devices as tasks. When the cough data were normalized however, the between-day RMS amplitudes were very consistent (79.5 – 90.2% MVE). Each device recorded consistent activation amplitudes within a given day.  Between-day reliability results indicate that EMG data recorded on separate days with these instruments should not be compared unless data can be normalized.  Clinicians and researchers are cautioned to normalize their data if day-to-day comparisons in EMG amplitude are to be made using data recorded with these devices.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Widespread abandonment of agricultural land has occurred in northeastern North America over the past two centuries. Soil carbon often increases as sites naturally regenerate towards perennial grasslands or forests. Understanding the large-scale controls on the potential and rate of soil carbon sequestration is necessary in order to evaluate the significance of this sink to the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, we need to understand the key roles soil microorganisms play in regulating ecosystem processes through their control over soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Such studies are rare at the century long time scale of temperate forest succession. Additionally, research has taken place primarily on productive agricultural soils, while abandonment is more common on marginal agricultural soils. We characterized patterns of total and labile soil carbon and nitrogen and microbial dynamics in mature forest and adjacent agricultural field sites, and in replicated chronosequences of forest successional sites on marginal soils of southeastern Ontario, Canada. &#xD;
Total soil carbon was significantly depleted in the top 10 cm of current agricultural fields as compared to forest sites and increased at a rate of 10 g C m-2 yr-1 across our 100-year chronosequences. There was no difference in carbon loss or accumulation over time in three soil types differing in texture and parent material, suggesting that time since abandonment is more important than soil type in determining carbon accumulation within this climatic region. In contrast, free-light fraction carbon did not increase over time and thus most carbon accumulated in pools with slower turnover times. Soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen increased significantly following abandonment and our results strongly suggest that microbial growth during all phases of succession was limited by carbon supply. In contrast, net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates during mid-summer did not change consistently over the first 100 years following agricultural abandonment. Therefore, inorganic nitrogen supply rates into the plant available pool were similar across the entire successional sequence. Together, the results of these two studies demonstrate the potential for carbon sequestration in abandoned agricultural soils across this climatic region and highlight the importance of plant-soil interactions for understanding carbon cycling during ecosystem development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Breast cancer is a complex disease, whose etiology is not well understood. A number of factors have been found to contribute to its development. Psychological stress has been recognized as such a factor in epidemiological studies, but few molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain its association to breast cancer risk. This work addresses the lack of knowledge in the area of stress and breast cancer with the use of molecular and epidemiological techniques. Molecular experiments allowed the identification of a link between stress signaling and intracellular signaling pathways known to be affected in breast cancer development. Namely, the stress hormone hydrocortisone (cortisol) was found to down-regulate the Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene 1 (BRCA1). Further study allowed identification of some of the mechanisms involved. Binding of the transcription factors GABPa/b and USF2 at specific sites of the BRCA1 promoter (the RIBS and UP sites) was shown to be negatively affected by hydrocortisone. In addition, a novel hormone-independent function of the receptor for hydrocortisone, the glucocorticoid receptor, was identified in the context of BRCA1 regulation. GR was determined to act as a positive regulator of BRCA1 in the absence of hydrocortisone through the RIBS and UP sites. Taken altogether these results represent a novel molecular mechanism linking stress signaling to breast cancer development.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second objective of this work was to design an epidemiological study which would determine whether stress-susceptible individuals are at higher risk of developing breast cancer. This study would be the first of its kind in the case of breast cancer and would allow the development of a genetic method of measuring stress exposure which can be used in future studies. The study was designed to look at glucocorticoid receptor iii polymorphisms known to produce phenotypic differences in GR activity in a population of women with incident breast cancer and population-based controls. In conclusion, the present work suggests an integrative model of the effect of stress on breast cancer development which incorporates genetic redisposition to the effects of stress and downstream changes in the expression and activity of the Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene 1.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the creation of an environmental monitoring system for inhospitable environments.  It has been named The Remote Environmental Sensor Array System or RESA System for short.  This thesis covers the development of RESA from its inception, to the design and modeling of the hardware and software required to make it functional.  Finally, the actual manufacture, and laboratory testing of the finished RESA product is discussed and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
The RESA System is designed as a cost-effective way to bring sensors and video systems to the underwater environment.  It contains as water quality probe with sensors such as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, specific conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential and chlorophyll a.  In addition, an omni-directional hydrophone is included to detect underwater acoustic signals.  It has a colour, high-definition and a low-light, black and white camera system, which it turn are coupled to a laser scaling system.  Both high-intensity discharge and halogen lighting system are included to illuminate the video images.  The video and laser scaling systems are manoeuvred using pan and tilt units controlled from an underwater computer box.  Finally, a sediment profile imager is included to enable profile images of sediment layers to be acquired.  A control and manipulation system to control the instruments and move the data across networks is integrated into the underwater system while a power distribution node provides the correct voltages to power the instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Laboratory testing was completed to ensure that the different instruments associated with the RESA performed as designed.  This included physical testing of the motorized instruments, calibration of the instruments, benchmark performance testing and system failure exercises.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two studies were undertaken to examine the relationship between suicidality and three key psychological predictors of suicide risk, namely, depression, hopelessness, and psychache. Study 1 determined the degree to which these suicide risk predictors are distinct using a sample of undergraduate students (N = 587). Because typical measures of depression, hopelessness, and psychache differ in terms of their scale format, results were compared using original items, dichotomized items, parcels of original items, and parcels of dichotomized items. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that depression, hopelessness, and psychache comprise three separate, but correlated factors. Psychache accounted for a greater proportion of variance in depression and hopelessness than vice versa, and psychache was also more strongly associated with a wider range of suicide criteria than depression and hopelessness, though all three predictors made unique contributions to suicidality. In order to ascertain whether suicide risk predictors interact with stress to predict suicidality, study 2 compared diathesis-stress models of depression, hopelessness, and psychache in a 4-month longitudinal study using an independent sample of university undergraduates (N = 301). When initial levels of all variables were controlled, hopelessness and psychache, but not depression, were significantly associated with suicide risk. Furthermore, negative cognitions about oneself, the world, and the future served as a common diathesis that interacted with major negative life events to precipitate increases in both hopelessness and psychache. Simple slopes analyses further indicated that among individuals with a low level of cognitive diathesis, the frequency of major life stressors was positively associated with both hopelessness and psychache. However, among individuals with a high level of cognitive diathesis, the frequency of  &#xD;
major life stressors was negatively associated with hopelessness and unrelated to psychache. Together, the results of the research presented in this dissertation have important implications for understanding the unique roles of depression, hopelessness, and psychache in the prediction of suicide risk.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“The Proletarian Prometheus: Socialism, Ethnicity, and Revolution at the Lakehead, 1900-1935” is an analysis of the various socialist organizations operating at the Canadian Lakehead (comprised of the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William, Ontario, now the present-day City of Thunder Bay, and their vicinity) during the first 35 years of the twentieth century. It contends that the circumstances and actions of Lakehead labour, especially those related to ideology, ethnicity, and personality, worked simultaneously to empower and to fetter workers in their struggles against the shackles of capitalism. The twentieth-century Lakehead never lacked for a population of enthusiastic, energetic and talented left-wingers. Yet, throughout this period the movement never truly solidified and took hold. Socialist organizations, organizers and organs came and went, leaving behind them an enduring legacy, yet paradoxically the sum of their efforts was cumulatively less than the immense sacrifices and energies they had poured into them. Between 1900 and 1935, the region's working-class politics was shaped by the interaction of ideas drawn from the much larger North Atlantic socialist world with the particularities of Lakehead society and culture. International frameworks of analysis and activism were of necessity reshaped and revised in a local context in which ethnic divisions complicated and even undermined the class identities upon which so many radical dreams and ambitions rested.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The 1880s were turbulent years in the Dominion. Under the auspices of the National Policy, Canada was in the midst of a social and political ‘transformation.’ The social and cultural aspects of this transformation became a source of public debate as the ‘Labour Question’ and the relations between labour and capital reached a high mark of political and economic significance. Waves of strikes and the emergence of large international labour organizations challenged many liberal Victorian ideas about a strictly limited state. Many looked upon the federal government as responsible not only for economic growth, but also for protection from the more pressing problems of industrial life. &#xD;
The Royal Commission on the Relations of Capital and Labour is a testament to not only the turbulent economic relations in late-Victorian Canada, but the emergence of the Canadian state’s active role in social relations. Its very title envisioned a dual role for the Canadian state: to “promote the material, social, intellectual and moral prosperity” of labouring men and women, and to improve and develop “the productive industries of the Dominion so as to advance and improve the trade and commerce of Canada.” However, this thesis argues that the Labour Commission was more subtly designed to enhance the prestige of the Canadian state and install Ottawa as an authority on, and mediator of, industrial relations in Canada. &#xD;
Attention to the formation, activities, and impact of the Labour Commission suggests that, rather than an exercise in addressing a mounting social polarization between “labour” and “capital,” the Commission lends insight into the emergence of a Canadian middle class. It was a carefully-constructed exercise in the assertion of middle-class cultural hegemony whereby such values and understandings as respectability, morality, manliness, worth and expertise were naturalized. In the process, the tension between labour and capital was diminished and in its place were developed visions of social reciprocity and mutual interest. It is in this way that the Labour Commission was an exercise in ‘commissioning consent:’ it placed oppositional voices and wrenching exposés about industrial life in a framework that worked to quell rather than stimulate far-reaching critiques of the established order.&#xD;
The Commission’s formation, methodology and language functioned like an industrial exhibition rather than a pointed social investigation. The evidence presents a thriving economy that had grown exponentially under a wise and paternal government. It also presented a vision of the Dominion whereby the disturbances that occurred between labour and capital could be handled within a conventional language of liberal politics. In addition, social and intellectual elites were fully ensconced in the formation and legitimization of these social and moral understandings. Because it was up to the state to select who would speak for labour and capital, the Commission’s message was not one of class polarization. Thus, exploring who became ‘labour’ and who ‘capital,’ and what sorts of things they said to each other, sheds light on to the emergent strategies of the Canadian state as it sought to understand and influence civil society. The Commission is an indication, even anticipation, of a more activist and energetic state.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Who was Fulvia? Was she the politically aggressive and dominating wife of Mark Antony as Cicero and Plutarch describe her? Or was she a loyal mother and wife, as Asconius and Appian suggest? These contrasting accounts in the ancient sources warrant further investigation. &#xD;
This thesis seeks to explore the nature of Fulvia’s role in history to the extent that the evidence permits. Fulvia is most famous for her activities during Antony’s consulship (44 BC) and his brother Lucius Antonius’ struggle against C. Octavian in the Perusine War (41-40 BC). But there is a discrepancy among the authors as to what extent she was actually involved. Cicero, Octavian and Antony, who were all key players in events, provide their own particular versions of what occurred. Later authors, such as Appian and Dio, may have been influenced by these earlier, hostile accounts of Fulvia. &#xD;
This is the first study in English to make use of all the available evidence, both literary and material, pertaining to Fulvia. Modern scholarship has a tendency to concentrate almost exclusively on events towards the end of Fulvia’s life, in particular the Perusine War, about which the evidence is much more abundant in later sources such as Appian and Dio. However, to do this ignores the importance of her earlier activities which, if studied more fully, can help to explain her later actions in the 40’s BC.&#xD;
This thesis is divided into five chapters. The first provides an introduction to the topic and a biography of Fulvia. The second is a review of the modern scholarship on Fulvia. The third focuses on the contemporary sources, both the literary evidence from Cicero, Cornelius Nepos and Martial, as well as the surviving material evidence, namely the sling bullets found at Perusia and a series of coins that may depict Fulvia in the guise of Victoria. The fourth is a discussion of those authors born after Fulvia’s death in 40 BC, of whom the most important are Plutarch, Appian, and Dio. The fifth provides a conclusion to the thesis, and returns to the questions posed above in light of the analysis of the sources provided throughout the thesis. It concludes that Fulvia played a significant role in events, particularly from Antony’s consulship onwards, and that her actions were deliberate and politically motivated. Moreover, while these actions were done on her husbands’ behalf, she nevertheless exhibited a remarkable degree of independence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>China has long been sceptical on mitigating sentences based on the offender’s good character, while good character mitigation is widely accepted in Canada. This study was to examine the justification of good character mitigation in Canada so that China can better face the future choice in sentencing: whether to consider good character a mitigating factor. Through examining the use of good character in Canadian sentencing practice, the justification of good character mitigation in Canada has been questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
A three-part argument has been put forward to support the removal of good character as a mitigating factor in Canada: first, the workability of the very concept of “good character” is low; second, theoretical basis for mitigating sentences on good character is problematic; third, the present practice contributes to a form of status-based discrimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
This study shows that the justification of good character mitigation is not as strong as we have expected it to be. Even in Canada, a country which has good character mitigation with a long history, the consideration of good character as a mitigating factor needs further discussion. The adoption of good character mitigation in China should be more cautious.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The silicon complexes in silicon doped calcium phosphate bioceramics have been studied using $^{29}$Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The replacement of phosphorus by silicon in these materials requires a charge compensation mechanism which is difficult to study by many experimental techniques due to the small amount of silicon added. Producing these materials using an isotopically enriched source of silicon made the use of NMR spectroscopy feasible. Three different materials have been studied: a multiphase material commercially available under the trade name Skelite$^{\rm TM}$ composed of predominantly a silicon stabilized $\alpha$-tricalcium phosphate ($\alpha$-TCP) phase as well as a silicon doped hydroxyapatite (HA) phase, a single phase Si-HA material and a single phase silicon stabilized $\alpha$-TCP material. Slight changes to the material production method were first introduced to accommodate the switch to an isotopically enriched silicon source. Characterization of the enriched materials was carried out using Rietveld refinement of X-ray powder diffraction spectra and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to confirm that these materials were similar to the previously studied, non-enriched, materials in terms of the silicon contents, Ca/(P+Si) molar ratios and lattice parameters. NMR Spectroscopy showed that in all three materials, the silicon formed Q$^1$ structures in which two silicate tetrahedra joined together by sharing an oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy which compensated the substitution of two silicon for phosphorus. This is the first observation of this charge compensation mechanism in Si-HA and may explain the interesting phase evolution previously found in the system studied in this work in which the Si-HA transforms to silicon stabilized $\alpha$-TCP upon sintering.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Unbonded post-tensioned concrete slabs have been widely used in Canada and the United States since the 1960s, as they allow increased span-to-depth ratios and excellent control of deflections compared to non-prestressed reinforced concrete flexural members.  The satisfactory fire performance of unbonded post-tensioned concrete slabs in &#xD;
North America was established by a series of standard fire tests performed in the United States during the 1960s.  However, there is a paucity of data on the effect of elevated temperatures on cold-drawn prestressing steel, both in terms of post-fire residual mechanical properties and high-temperature stress relaxation, which can lead to significant prestress loss both during and after a fire.  &#xD;
A detailed and comprehensive literature review is presented that provides background on the residual mechanical properties of prestressing steel, as well as on the creep-relaxation behaviour experienced at elevated temperatures under stress.  The results of two test series are discussed; the first examining the effects of elevated temperatures on the residual mechanical properties of prestressing steel exposed to elevated temperatures.  The second test series examines the irrecoverable and significant loss of prestress force that results from steel relaxation and other thermal effects experienced during heating.  A preliminary analytical model is presented, capable of predicting the change in prestress force experienced by a stressed strand under transient heating.  The model is then compared with experimental elevated temperature relaxation data.  &#xD;
Finally, the analytical model developed and residual mechanical properties obtained through experimentation are used along with a pre-existing finite difference heat transfer model (developed for concrete slabs) to examine the effect of elevated temperature exposure on the residual flexural capacity of a typical unbonded post-tensioned example slab.  Several parameters, such as heated length and concrete cover, are examined using the example structure.  From this it was observed that, after one hour of exposure to a standard fire (ASTM E119), significant losses in effective prestress and moment capacity occurred even with the appropriate amount of concrete cover.  This is a finding which is of the utmost practical importance to engineers engaged in the evaluation of fire damaged unbonded post-tensioned structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mercury (Hg) research in Ontario has centered on aquatic environments since fish can be &#xD;
a significant source of methylmercury for humans. Interactions between terrestrial and &#xD;
aquatic environments in regards to the Hg cycle have received less attention. This study &#xD;
focuses on the role of trees as a source and/or sink of Hg to the environment and the ap- &#xD;
plicability of deciduous trees as biomonitors for Hg. Leaf, bark and wood core samples &#xD;
were taken from a variety of deciduous species including Acer spp. (sugar, silver and red &#xD;
maple), Quercus spp. (red oak), Populus spp. (eastern cottonwood), and Salix spp. (willow) &#xD;
mainly from the Dorset and Kingston, ON regions. Examination of seasonal variation of &#xD;
Hg concentrations ([Hg]) in leaves indicated that average autumn leaf Hg ranged from 17– &#xD;
45 ng/g and differed significantly among species. Leaf [Hg] increased with the growing &#xD;
season and roughly corresponded to regional atmospheric [Hg]. Microspatial trends in &#xD;
leaf [Hg], such as position on a branch, may increase variability. Tree cores from contami- &#xD;
nated and reference sites in the Kingston area showed that although dendrochronological &#xD;
techniques are not appropriate for estimating historical atmospheric Hg, they are useful &#xD;
for estimating the total Hg burden of a single tree. Populus and Salix, had the greatest &#xD;
bark and wood [Hg] with maximums reaching 18 ng/g. This was significantly higher than &#xD;
more inland trees such as Quercus and Acer, with maximum values of 7 and 1.2 ng/g for &#xD;
bark and wood [Hg]. Individual, average sized trees in this study contained a total of &#xD;
0.4–2.6 mg of Hg. This study will provide forest and watershed managers with a better &#xD;
understanding of the importance of trees in the Hg cycle and the contribution of leaf and &#xD;
wood Hg to litterfall and waterbodies in southern Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates the effect of elaborate retrieval, which is a byproduct of spaced practice, on adult cognition. It was hypothesized that elaborate re-conceptualization of new information, within a context that was disparate from the one used during learning, could facilitate learning transfer through the development of a broader conceptual frame of reference. The re-conceptualization task was not expected to degrade rote definitional memory. The two re-conceptualization tasks used in this study were termed model-building and free study. The model building task required the development of a personalized conceptual model using information provided within three spaced narrated information passages. The free study task required the unaided study of all three passages.&#xD;
Transfer of learning and rote memory were evaluated using a general knowledge test and a knowledge extension test. These tests were given at the end of the experiment. The general knowledge test required participants to match concept labels and definitions which were provided during the experiment. The knowledge extension test required participants to transfer knowledge amassed during the experiment to a complex “real world” situation. The results demonstrated that learners, who completed the spaced re-conceptualization task, improved their ability to transfer new information as the spacing intervals lengthened. Participants who were required to study the same information without any instruction did not show learning transfer improvement. Both groups illustrated parallel improvements in rote memorization due to spacing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The neutrino fluxes from the neutral current (NC), charged current (CC), and elastic scattering (ES) neutrino interactions in the salt phase of SNO have been extracted.  The signals were extracted above an energy threshold of 4MeV,  which is the lowest energy threshold at which the neutrino signals have been extracted from SNO to date.  To achieve this low energy threshold the internal and external radioactive background signals have also been measured.  The $^{8}$B neutrino fluxes for the 4MeV threshold were found to be&#xD;
\begin{eqnarray*}&#xD;
\Phi_{CC} &amp; = &amp;  1.60  ~^{+0.04}_{-0.04}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.06}_{-0.06}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1},\\&#xD;

\end{eqnarray*}&#xD;
\noindent These results are in agreement with the values published in ~\cite{SNO3} and the NC flux is in agreement with the standard solar model calculation from ~\cite{bp2004}.  The published fluxes were&#xD;
\begin{eqnarray*}&#xD;
\Phi_{CC} &amp;= &amp; 1.68 ~^{+0.06}_{-0.06}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.08}_{-0.09}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1} , \\ &#xD;

 \end{eqnarray*} &#xD;
\noindent The uncertainties on the extracted NC and CC fluxes are significantly smaller than on the published values.  A comparison of the total uncertainty from flux measurements presented here and those published are given below.&#xD;

 The shape of the CC energy spectrum has also been extracted with the 4MeV energy threshold.  The uncertainties on the extracted fluxes are smaller than what was previously published.  The CC spectrum gives a measure of the neutrino energy shape distortion due to neutrino oscillations.  The uncertainties on the lowest energy bins in the extracted CC spectrum are much larger than the predicted distortion.   We are therefore not sensitive to the upturn in the neutrino survival probability at lower energies predicted by neutrino oscillations in the large mixing angle (LMA) region.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“Exotic-type” Cu silicate-oxide deposits hosted by Miocene pediment gravels represent an unusual, but characteristic, by-product of the supergene enrichment of Cenozoic porphyry Cu deposits in northern Chile. Carbon stable isotopic analysis is employed herein to clarify the environment of exotic ore formation and to provide guidelines for the exploration for non-outcropping mineralisation. Two main sample suites were examined: chrysocolla-rich ores from the Huinquintipa and Mina Sur deposits; and soils overlying a paleochannel in the Huinquintipa area known to be mineralised.&#xD;
The samples were processed using four different analytical techniques to determine their 13C values: (1) Elemental Analysis Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (EA/IRMS) of the whole sample; (2) crushing in vacuo followed by IRMS to analyse fluid inclusions; (3) thermal extraction at 100˚C, followed by IRMS to analyse weakly bound carbon dioxide; and (4) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extraction followed by IRMS. EDTA-partial extraction favours the dissolution of minerals with divalent cations, releasing as carbon dioxide the carbon trapped within the crystal structure. All four of these analytical techniques have been used before, but this is the first time that they have all been used together on exotic copper silicate and oxide mineralisation. &#xD;
Three major carbon sources are identified: (1) atmosphere-derived carbon dioxide with a 13C value of around 0 ‰; (2) plant-derived carbon dioxide with a 13C of about -25 ‰; and (3) microbe-derived carbon dioxide with a 13C of approximately -50 ‰. The bulk of the carbon liberated by EA/IRMS was plant-derived. The thermally- and crushing-released carbon dioxide has the highest proportion of atmosphere-derived carbon, whereas EDTA-extraction preferentially liberated the lightest of carbon. On the conclusion that EDTA preferentially dissolved Cu-rich silicate mineraloids, it is concluded that microbial consortia, including methanogenic microbes, were hosted specifically by the high-grade Cu assemblages and plausibly played a critical role in their precipitation. &#xD;
The same microbial-carbon signature was obtained through the EDTA-extraction of soil samples above the paleochannel. Carbon isotopic analysis of CO2 sequestered through EDTA-extraction could therefore be used as an exploration tool for buried exotic mineralisation. Future exploration should exploit the presence of microbes in niche-specific environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For control systems that evolve on Euclidean spaces, Jacobian linearization &#xD;
is a common technique in many control applications, analysis, and controller &#xD;
design methodologies. However, the standard linearization method &#xD;
along a non-trivial reference trajectory does not directly &#xD;
apply in a geometric theory where the state space is a differentiable &#xD;
manifold. Indeed, the standard constructions involving the Jacobian are &#xD;
dependent on a choice of coordinates.&#xD;
&#xD;
The procedure of linearizing a control affine system along a &#xD;
non-trivial reference trajectory is studied from a &#xD;
differential geometric perspective. A coordinate-invariant setting for &#xD;
linearization is presented. With the linearization in hand, the &#xD;
controllability of the geometric linearization is characterized &#xD;
using an alternative version of the usual controllability&#xD;
test for time-varying linear systems. The various&#xD;
types of stability are defined using a metric on the fibers along the&#xD;
reference trajectory and Lyapunov's second method is recast for linear&#xD;
vector fields on tangent bundles. With the necessary background stated&#xD;
in a geometric framework, Kalman's theory of quadratic optimal control&#xD;
is understood from the perspective of the &#xD;
Maximum Principle. Finally, following Kalman, the resulting &#xD;
feedback from solving the infinite time optimal control problem is &#xD;
shown to uniformly asymptotically stabilize the linearization &#xD;
using Lyapunov's second method.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The risk of crude oil exposure to the early life stages (ELS) of fish is difficult to assess, given the complexity of the chemical composition of different oils. The aromatic portion of crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are known to be toxic. In 2004, an “effects-driven” fractionation research program was initiated in an attempt to better identify toxic constituents of two unique crude oils, Alaskan North Slope Crude (ANSC; medium-heavy crude) and Scotia Light (SCOT; light crude). The ANSC contained much more PAH than SCOT. These oils induced cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A) enzymes in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and caused blue-sac disease (BSD) and mortality in larval Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). &#xD;
Four unique fractions (F1-F4) were produced from both oils via low temperature vacuum distillation. The F3 contained an array of unsubstituted and alkyl-PAH, and was responsible for most of the CYP1A induction and chronic toxicity associated with whole oil. Cold acetone extraction (CAE) of F3 produced 2 new sub-fractions (F3-1 and F3-2). The F3-1 was rich in alkyl-PAH, was a potent CYP1A inducer, and was chronically toxic to ELS of fish. The F3-1 was further separated into five more sub-fractions via normal phase HPLC (F3-1-1 – F3-1-5). Neither F3-1-1 nor F3-1-2 induced CYP1A or produced BSD, but F3-1-2 was lethal. The F3-1-3, 4, and 5 were all potent CYP1A inducers and were all chronically toxic. &#xD;
 &#xD;
Induction of CYP1A proved to be an effective tool for tracing potentially toxic PAH throughout fractionation (Chapter 2), and sub-fractions rich in alkyl-PAH caused the most BSD and mortality (Chapter 3). Alkyl-homologues of phenanthrene, fluorene, naphthobenzothiophene (NBT), pyrene, and chrysene are perhaps the most toxic of the known constituents present in crude oil. The ANSC sub-fractions were more toxic than the SCOT ones, indicating that heavier crude oils with a higher proportion of intermediate-sized alkyl-PAH may be more toxic than lighter crude oils that are comprised of fewer of these compounds.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Until recently it has been widely believed that significant anthropogenic influences on the environment began in Canada following the onset of European colonization.  However, our paleolimnological data indicate that centuries prior to European settlement, ponds on Ellesmere and Bathurst Island were impacted by Thule Inuit whalers, whose activities altered nutrient levels in nearby ponds.  Two Thule Inuit whaling sites were selected based on input from several archaeologists, to ensure good coverage of the Thule geographic range and proximity to freshwater ponds.&#xD;
Multiple independent paleolimnological proxies have been used to analyze a pond from Ellesmere Island, showing taxonomic shifts in diatoms assemblages coinciding with 1.5 - 2‰ shifts in d15N, during the period of Thule occupation (ca. 1000 – 1670 AD).  Increases in the relative abundance of Amphora ovalis, indicate nutrient concentrations above average for the High Arctic.  Elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus were observed in the pond indicating the continuing influence of nutrient inputs centuries after the abandonment of the camp.  &#xD;
Meanwhile, on Bathurst Island, the orientation of the Deblicquy site, such that the large majority of the Thule nutrient inputs are focused towards one of our two study ponds, provided us with the opportunity to compare two ponds that are essentially identical with the exception of the degree of Thule influence.  In our “impacted” site, a marked increase in Stephanodiscus minutulus, coincides with a 2‰ shift in d15N.  While our a priori determined control site shows no major changes in geochemistry or algal composition.&#xD;
Previous research on Bathurst Island used water chemistry and  surface sediment diatoms to construct a diatom-inferred total nitrogen model for Bathurst Island.  However, this study was limited by excluding unbuffered, low pH sites which characterize the western half of Bathurst Island.  By expanding the previous Bathurst Island dataset to include western sites, we have been able to construct a diatom-inferred pH model which will prove invaluable in future climate research in this region.   &#xD;
Together, these three studies serve to highlight the sensitivity of freshwater ecosystems to relatively minor anthropogenic disturbances and represent some of the earliest known anthropogenic impacts on North American aquatic ecosystems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During soft ground tunnel construction, if the face pressure of a tunnel boring machine is not strictly controlled, excessive ground movements will propagate vertically upwards causing significant damage to adjacent buried infrastructure and surface structures. In order to investigate the face pressure - ground deformation relationship for tunnels in sands, the construction process was modelled using the technique of geotechnical centrifuge modelling and the resulting ground deformations were recorded using digital image correlation. In these tests a unique tunnel face boundary condition was developed which allowed the boundary condition to be initially set as a zero strain condition before it was transformed into a load-controlled boundary to investigate the instability of the face. Tests were preformed at four different burial depths in dry sand, corresponding to cover depths of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 times the tunnel diameter. These results indicate that the face pressure at failure is largely independent of burial depth over the values tested. The ground deformation at the onset of tunnel face instability was found to be very small, and once initiated, the zone of ground deformations was observed to propagate upwards in a narrow chimney in front of the tunnel until it reached the ground surface causing subsidence.  Further tests investigated the variation in ground deformations to be expected if a tunnel were to be passing through more complex ground conditions, including unsaturated sand, saturated sand, and the unique case of sand / clay mixed ground conditions. Ground deformations at tunnel face instability were much lower for the case of unsaturated sand, than for either the saturated or dry cases which showed broadly similar responses. In the mixed ground condition of a clay layer over topping a sand layer, the clay layer was found to only influence the tunnel face pressure – deformation response if the bottom of the clay layer was closer than 0.5 diameters above the tunnel crown.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates the work of the Canadian artist and filmmaker Joyce Wieland (1930-1998) from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s in relation to its historical conditions of production and considers both her film and non-film work, including quilts, embroidery and prints. To examine these artistic media together not only provides a means to re-contextualize Wieland’s work, but rethinks disciplinary boundaries and&#xD;
contributes to a renovation of both art historical and filmic methods of critical inquiry.&#xD;
Wieland’s work from this period serves as an exemplary case study of the ways in which&#xD;
female artists have consistently had to negotiate contemporaneous constructions of femininity/feminism, modernity, and representation in relation to their art practice. I argue that Wieland consistently explored, through aesthetic means, the terms by which contemporary re-conceptualizations of gendered, classed, and raced identities were being defined as new national subjects within the Canadian nation-state. I begin by outlining the ways in which Wieland’s work as been constructed within the dominant narratives of Canadian art and film, and argue that the disciplines that generated them, with their formalist and textual foci, inhibit larger discussions of the historical, political and cultural contexts of Wieland’s art production. Each chapter subsequently examines an identity that emerged as a collective during the late 1960s in Canada –women, the working classes, French Canadians, and aboriginal peoples– that Wieland aesthetically explores. Through her engagement with second-wave feminism, the development of the New Left in English and French Canada, Québécois nationalism, and shifting notions of aboriginal identity, Wieland’s art production visually materializes the intersection of feminism and nationalism –discourses that were actively circulating in Canada during this period.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent disease in society which is associated with decreased cardiac output.  This thesis describes the proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue obtained from HF patients and a transgenic animal model of HF. Initial experiments optimized one proteomic technology, 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), to maximize the number of proteins which could be observed / resolved from human cardiac tissue.  Protein abundance changes in cardiac tissue between normal patients and those with a diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy were determined by performing 2-DE and identifying proteins by mass spectrometry.  HF patients had a reduced abundance of proteins involved in energy production and the sarcomere.  Sarcomeres contain the myofilament subproteome consisting of thick and thin filaments with the thick filaments primarily myosin.  Thick and thin filament undergo Ca2+ induced ATP hydrolysis to form crossbridge cycles, resulting in muscle contraction.  An assembly chaperone for myosin, UNC-45B, was found to be increased in HF patients.  Western blot analysis confirmed that the abundance of UNC-45B was increased in different etiologies of heart failure.  Follow up physiological measurements demonstrated that UNC-45B is most likely a protein necessary for transcriptional control of the α-isoform of myosin heavy chain.  In a second proteomics study, abundance changes occurring in a pacing induced model of HF in wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) rabbits with increased expression of the α-isoform of myosin heavy chain were examined.  WT and TG rabbits had a different response in their myofilament and intermediate filament abundance changes following induction of HF.  TG rabbits had a decreased abundance of heat shock proteins and non-sarcomeric associated desmin.  As well, TG rabbits had an increased ratio of actin:myosin heavy chain and UNC-45B suggesting an altered ratio of thick to thin filaments.  In conclusion, an altered abundance of contractile proteins, regulated in part by UNC-45B, may be one cause of the contractile dysfunction which occurs in HF.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zircaloy-2 and its sister alloy, Zircaloy-4, have extensive applications in the nuclear industry as core components in heavy water reactors and fuel cladding in both heavy and light water reactors.  Intergranular stresses and texture can greatly affect the mechanical performance of these components. A complete understanding of the development of intergranular constraints and texture in Zircaloy-2 will allow an improved understanding of the plastic deformation of zirconium alloys, and the prediction of in-reactor deformation of tubes made by different manufacturing routes. &#xD;
Neutron diffraction was used to track the development of lattice strain and peak intensity in three dimensions for various crystallographic planes in samples cut from a rolled Zircaloy-2 slab.  The samples were subject to room temperature compression or tension in-situ in the neutron spectrometer in each of the three principal directions of the slab.  Textures in the deformed samples were measured using neutron diffraction.  Strong evidence was found for tensile twinning in tensile tests in the plate normal direction and compression tests in the transverse and rolling directions.  The lattice strain development inside the newly formed twins was recorded for the first time in a Zr alloy.&#xD;
An elasto-plastic self-consistent model and a visco-plastic self-consistent model were used to interpret the lattice strain and texture data, respectively.  Various slip and twinning modes were considered in both models.  Prism &lt;a&gt; slip, basal &lt;a&gt; slip, pyramidal &lt;c+a&gt; slip and tensile twinning were concluded to be indispensable, while pyramidal &lt;a&gt; slip was unnecessary in the modeling.  The critical resolved shear stresses and hardening parameters were obtained by simultaneously achieving a ‘best-fit’ with the complete experimental data set.  The effects of anisotropic latent hardening due to dislocation interactions were found to be critical, and the inclusion of Lankford coefficients as modeling constraints was necessary.&#xD;
This research provided a comprehensive experimental data set obtained by neutron diffraction, forming a sound basis to investigate active plastic deformation mechanisms and to rigorously test plasticity models and twinning models.  The research also made a substantial improvement in understanding the plastic deformation of Zircaloy-2 through polycrystalline modeling by introducing extensive data sets to constrain the modeling parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous studies have suggested that phosphodiesterase (PDE) hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is important in the generation of specific and segregated cAMP signals within cells.  The purpose of this study was to determine if PDE compartmentation was important in cardiac ventricular myocytes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of β-adrenergic (β-AD) stimulation with isoproterenol in the presence of cilostamide, a PDE3 inhibitor, or Ro 20-1724, a PDE4 inhibitor, on unloaded cell shortening, L-type calcium currents and intracellular calcium levels in freshly dissociated adult rat ventricular myocytes.  PDE3 inhibition resulted in a 216 ± 17 % (n=8) increase in unloaded cell shortening after ten minutes of isoproterenol exposure, whereas isoproterenol produced a statistically smaller increase of 155 ± 12 % (n=8) in the presence of PDE4 inhibition. There was a non-significant trend for PDE4 inhibition to produce larger increases in calcium currents (179 ± 17 % (n=4) of controls) than PDE3 inhibition (155 ± 10 % (n=6) of controls). Both PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors had similar effects on isoproterenol-stimulated increases of calcium transient amplitude with values of 209 ± 14 % (n=8) and 185 ± 12 % (n=8), respectively. Determination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium load using caffeine pulse experiments demonstrated that PDE4 inhibition and isoproterenol superfusion produced a statistically larger increase in SR-calcium loading (139 ± 9 % (n=6)) than PDE3 inhibition and isoproterenol superfusion (113 ± 9 % (n=6)).  These results suggest that PDE3 may be active in proximity to the contractile apparatus of cardiac myocytes, whereas PDE4 may be localized in a domain consisting of the L-type calcium channel and junctional SR.  Consequently, our study provides functional evidence for differential localization of PDE isoforms in cardiac myocytes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Applications such as video and audio streaming, online gaming, video conferencing, Voice over IP (VoIP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) demand a wide range of QoS requirements such as bandwidth and delay. Existing wireless technologies that can satisfy the requirements of heterogeneous traffic are very costly to deploy in rural areas and “last mile” access. Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) provides an affordable alternative for wireless broadband access supporting a multiplicity of applications. The IEEE 802.16 standard provides specification for the Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) layers for WiMAX. A critical part of the MAC layer specification is scheduling, which resolves contention for bandwidth and determines the transmission order of users.&#xD;
It is imperative for a scheduling algorithm to have a multi-dimensional objective of satisfying QoS requirements of the users, maximizing system utilization and ensuring fairness among the users. In this thesis, we categorize and study various scheduling algorithms for the uplink traffic in WiMAX in view of these objectives. The algorithms are studied under different mixes of traffic and for various characteristics of the IEEE 802.16 MAC layer such as uplink burst preamble, frame length, bandwidth request mechanisms etc. Simulation results indicate that legacy algorithms are not suitable for the multi-class traffic in WiMAX as they do not explicitly incorporate the WiMAX QoS parameters. We provide recommendations for enhancing existing scheduling schemes in WiMAX, and shed light on some of the open issues that need to be addressed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is believed to play a role in human lung cancer induced by tobacco smoking.  NNK biotransformation may involve the enzymes prostaglandin H synthase (PHS)-1, PHS-2 and cytochrome 450 (CYP) 2F.  PHS activity is thought to be important in extrahepatic tissues, where CYP activity is low.  The CYP2F subfamily contains a single functional enzyme in humans (CYP2F1) and goats (CYP2F3); these enzymes are preferentially expressed in the lung, with little or no expression in other organs.  The role of these enzymes in the pulmonary biotransformation of NNK was investigated.  &#xD;
&#xD;
4.2 µM [5-3H]NNK was incubated with human lung microsomes under NADPH-dependent and arachidonic acid-dependent conditions.  Metabolites reflective of NNK α-carbon hydroxylation, N-oxidation and carbonyl reduction were detected in the presence of NADPH, and metabolite levels for all three biotransformation pathways were lower in the presence of arachidonic acid compared with NADPH (p&lt;0.05, N=4).  Incubation of microsomes with the PHS-1 selective inhibitor SC-560 and the PHS-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 did not change NNK biotransformation either in the presence of NADPH or in the presence of arachidonic acid (p&gt;0.05, N=4).  Incubation of [5-3H]NNK with ovine PHS-1 or PHS-2 did not result in formation of α-carbon hydroxylation or N­-oxidation metabolites; 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) was measurable only in the presence of PHS-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
Incubation of goat recombinant CYP2F3 with [5-3H]NNK resulted in formation of keto acid, keto alcohol and NNK-N-oxide (65.0%, 17.5% and 30.0% (µmol enzyme)-1 minute-1, respectively).  Metabolite formation was inhibited by 3-methylindole (3-MI), a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2F3.  Based on an N value of 3, incubation of human lung microsomes with 3-MI inhibited N-oxidation (p&lt;0.05) but did not alter NNK bioactivation or carbonyl reduction (p&gt;0.05).  However, when metabolite formation was examined in lung microsomes from different individuals, decreases in NNK biotransformation (ranging from 19.6 to 68.5%) were observed and were more pronounced in some patients than others, suggesting inter-individual variability in CYP2F1 activity.  &#xD;
&#xD;
These studies demonstrate the ability of CYP2F to biotransform NNK and suggest inter-individual variability in the importance of CYP2F1 for this activity in human lung.  They also strongly argue against the involvement of PHS enzymes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents modifications to two widely used numerical groundwater flow models in an effort to improve upon the interaction between a well of finite length and conductivity with the surrounding formation.  The first objective is to discard the common assumptions about flux- or head-based boundary conditions along the well screen by coupling pipe flow hydraulics and groundwater flow.  The second objective is to avoid restricting the wellbore hydraulics to a single flow regime.  Five flow regimes (laminar through rough-turbulent), based on Reynolds number and pipe roughness, are considered.  The modifications are integrated into the highly versatile, well-documented and well-tested models HydroGeoSphere (finite-element/finite-difference) and USGS MODFLOW (finite-difference).  Verification of the algorithm and code and is performed by comparing results to: 1) the idealized, analytical Theis solution; 2) the original, unmodified code; and 3) the results of a third party numerical solution that also accounts for variable frictional wellbore losses.  Results highlight the inadequacy of either a uniform flux or a uniform head assumption along the wellbore.  The solution also tends to produce much steeper hydraulic gradients in those portions of the aquifer nearest the pump intake than have previously been predicted.  Systems most affected by in-well hydraulic losses include those for which well screen is long, pumping rate is large, pipe diameter is small, pipe roughness is large (either through design or aging) and aquifer conductivity is high.  Improved modeling of the non-linear hydraulic conditions within the well screen can particularly influence the interpretation of wellbore flowmeter and tracer tests, leading to more precise knowledge of the variation of local aquifer hydraulic conductivity along well screens.  Aquifer drawdown curves, solute transport and inflow velocities will also be influenced, which can impact capture zones and remediation costs.  Given that the solution is incorporated within the HydroGeoSphere and MODFLOW models, it presents the additional advantage over existing approaches of offering a wide range of modeling capabilities, such as three-dimensional flow, arbitrary well inclination and surface-subsurface flow integration.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A numerical model for isothermal and non-isothermal flat-plate liquid-desiccant dehumidifiers and regenerators was developed and implemented. The two-dimensional model takes into account the desiccant, water and air flow streams. A parametric analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of some of the most important operational parameters on mass transfer performance, such as flow configuration, water mass flow rate and inlet temperature, and desiccant mass flow rate. The results indicate that the water temperature and mass flow rate have a strong effect on the performance of the dehumidifier and regenerator, with the isothermal wall case acting as an upper limiting case. Increasing the desiccant mass flow rate improves the water transfer performance, but the improvement is asymptotic with mass flow rate. &#xD;
An experimental rig with a single channel prototype was also built and tests were run for 18 different cases, with varying water mass flow rate, desiccant mass flow rate and flow configuration. The results show trends similar to those observed in the numerical results. However, the discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are larger than the estimated experimental uncertainty at a 95% confidence level. There is some indication that poor desiccant wetting of the channel walls was partially responsible for the discrepancies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This qualitative study with a phenomenological approach explored the friendship experiences of adolescents with intellectual disabilities from their own perspective. Five adolescents with intellectual disabilities from Community Living Toronto were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide about the meaning, nature, formation, maintenance, and development of friendships. The interview questions were first pilot-tested with two adolescents with intellectual disabilities. The interviews were analyzed, and themes were identified. The findings indicated that these young people attached helping, trust, affection, intimacy, and companionship to the meaning of friendship. Participants identified friends as casual friends, best friends, buddies, and family friends. Adolescents with ID did not report intimate and reciprocated friendships with buddies and family friends. Disclosing secrets, personal information and feelings and receiving emotional support were limited only to relationships with best friends with disabilities, in their age group and from their classroom. Adolescents with ID indicated that they wanted more friends. The participants’ suggestions for friendship formation were to meet people, starting a conversation, and smiling. They also identified out of school contact, conflict resolution, and gift giving as the means for friendship maintenance. Giving help, having more contact, and secret sharing were suggested as strategies for friendship development from their perspective.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Exposure to benzene, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has been linked to leukemogenesis, although the mechanism of benzene initiated carcinogenesis remains unclear. It has been proposed that benzene can be bioactivated to toxic metabolites such as 1,4 benzoquinone (BQ), which can alter signalling pathways and affect chromosomal integrity. BQ has been shown to increase the activity of c-Myb, which is an important transcription factor involved in hematopoiesis, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. The c-Myb protein also increases topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) promoter activity specifically in cell lines with hematopoietic origin. Topo II is a critical nuclear enzyme that removes torsional strain by cleaving, untangling and religating double-stranded DNA. Since topo II mediates DNA strand breaks, aberrant topo II activity or increased protein levels may increase the formation of DNA strand breaks, leaving the cell susceptible to mutational events. I hypothesize that BQ increases c-Myb activity, which in turn increases topo IIα promoter activity resulting in increased DNA strand breaks. Using luciferase reporter assays in K-562 cells (human chronic myeloid leukemic cells) I confirmed that BQ exposure (25 and 37 µM) caused an increase in c-Myb activity after 24 hours. Contradictory to previous findings, overexpression of exogenous c-Myb or a polypeptide consisting of c-Myb’s DNA binding domain (DBD), which competitively inhibits the binding of endogenous c-Myb to DNA, did not affect topo IIα promoter activity. However, BQ exposure (37 µM for 24 hours) caused a significant increase in topo IIα promoter activity, which could be blocked by the overexpression of the DBD polypeptide. Western immunoblotting analysis did not show any significant increases in topo IIα protein levels in cells exposed to 37 µM BQ for 24 hours. Overall, this study suggests that BQ exposure increases topo IIα promoter activity through the c-Myb signalling pathway and furthers our understanding of BQ-mediated toxicity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research study considered subsonic short air-air ejectors with multi-ring entraining diffusers.&#xD;
Many references can be found for the design of air-air ejectors with solid diffusers. However, a limited amount of work has been published specially addressing the performance of short ejectors&#xD;
with entraining diffusers. This study was an experimental and computational investigation of how ejector performance is affected by ejector geometry (i.e. nozzle, mixing tube and diffuser), flow inlet swirl conditions and flow temperature. Ejector performance was quantified in terms of pumping, pressure recovery, wall temperature and velocity and temperature distribution at the diffuser exit.&#xD;
The experiments were conducted on one cold flow wind tunnel and one hot gas wind tunnel.&#xD;
In total, eight ejector systems were tested for this research. Five different swirl conditions and two primary air flow temperatures were studied. Ejector inlet conditions were measured using four fixed 7-hole pressure probes in the annulus. Ejector exit flow conditions were measured using a traversing 7-hole pressure probe with a thermocouple.&#xD;
A parallel computational study was conducted along with the experimental study. The&#xD;
commercial CFD packages, Gambit 2.3 and Fluent 6.2, were selected for meshing and flow solutions. The objective of the computational study was to determine the utility of RANS based CFD model for predicting device performance as design changes were implemented. The computational study was intended to provide practitioners with guidance as to when CFD will provide practical answers to specific questions relating to the ejector performance including&#xD;
ejector pumping, pressure recovery, wall temperatures and velocity and temperature distribution at the diffuser exit.&#xD;
&#xD;
In total, twenty-six complete cold flow experiments and twenty complete hot flow&#xD;
experiments have been completed. A detailed CFD model study has been performed to select the suitable computational domain, mesh density, boundary conditions, turbulence model and near wall treatment. Twenty-four CFD cases were selected to compare with the corresponding experimental data.&#xD;
The experimental results showed that the inlet swirl conditions and the diffuser bent angle had significant effects on the ejector performance. In general, the maximum ejector performance was achieved with the 20° inlet swirl condition. This level of swirl enhanced pressure recovery in the ejector. As the diffuser bent angle increased, the total pumping decreased due to the flow&#xD;
impingement in the diffuser. The oblong ejector generally had better flow mixing performance than the round ejector.&#xD;
For the CFD simulations, the Realizable k-ε turbulence model was found to give reasonable&#xD;
predictions for most of the bulk flow properties such as the total pumping, velocity profiles, swirl levels and back pressure. These were achieved at a reasonable cost in terms of the human efforts&#xD;
and computational resources. The RSM was able to give slightly improved predictions but at a much higher cost in terms of the efforts and computing resources. All of the turbulence models had difficulty predicting the pressure recovery in the mixing tube and diffuser because of their inability to accurately predict flow separation in the core of the swirling primary flow. As a result of this, the turbulence models considered in this work overpredicted the pumping of the mixing tube and underpredicted the pumping of the entraining diffuser. This unresolved issue with the&#xD;
CFD models is an important consideration when designing such devices.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, a class of antidepressant medications) may contribute to increased breast cancer risk by stimulating the secretion of prolactin, a potential tumour promoter. The main objective of this study was to determine breast cancer risk associated with the duration, dosage and timing of SSRI use among women, with control for a limited set of confounders.  This thesis project, conducted within the context of a population-based two-stage case-control study, consisted of a record linkage study utilizing three Saskatchewan health services databases.  Cases included 1,273 women with primary breast cancer diagnosed between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005, and controls consisted of 12,730 subjects randomly selected from the province’s population registry. Data on SSRI use was compiled from the Saskatchewan prescription drug plan database.  Information on a limited set of established risk factors for breast cancer that may confound this relationship was ascertained from the population registry and the prescription database.  	&#xD;
Cases and controls were similar in terms of age, total number of consecutive years eligible for prescription coverage and indicators of socioeconomic status.  Compared to controls, cases were more likely to be married and to have used hormone therapy and/or oral contraceptives.&#xD;
Compared to nonusers, results indicated that the use of SSRIs for three or more years (as estimated by having filled 36 or more prescriptions for all SSRIs combined during the main exposure window more than two years prior to index date) was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.08, 95% CI: 0.74-1.58), controlling for age, marital status, oral contraceptive and hormone therapy use.  In addition, no suggestion of increased risk was detected for long-term exposures to individual SSRIs (24 or more prescriptions filled during the main exposure window) and in relation to total combined SSRI use 2-7 years and more than seven years prior to index date.  However, these risk estimates may have been affected by potential sources of information bias and confounding.  In summary, these results do not provide evidence to suggest that the risk of breast cancer is increased with the use of SSRIs.</dcterms:abstract>
