      <dcterms:abstract>Herein I describe a model study to determine the feasibility of organic hydride donors as a source of hydride in the regeneration of ammonia borane. Hydride transfer was observed in the model system comprised of Hantzsch ester and several analogues, as the organic hydride donor, and tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, as the boron-based hydride acceptor akin to BBr3. Side reactions could be minimized by varying the reaction conditions. We determined that a Lewis acid-base adduct was forming between the carbonyls of the donor and the hydride acceptor, that this adduct was dynamic in the case of Hantzsch ester and that it could be inhibited by bulkier ester groups or promoted by reducing the steric bulk at the carbonyl in the case of a methyl ketone. The thermodynamics of the hydride transfer reaction with an N-substituted analogue were probed via variable temperature NMR and compared to two differently substituted analogues.&#xD;
In addition, the scope of the sp2-sp3 Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling previously developed in our lab was extended to include 2-(1,2-diaryl)ethane pinacolborane scaffolds. In order to access this asymmetric scaffold, reaction conditions for the cross-coupling of a primary boronic ester in the presence of a secondary one were developed. Yields achieved for the linear cross-coupling were in the 70 % range and varied from 42 % to 69 % for the secondary position. These latter yields are in the same range as the hydroborated styrene scaffolds described in our first account demonstrating the broad scope of these reaction conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Landfill leachate production is an unavoidable by-product of landfilling solid waste. Mitigation of the adverse environmental impacts of landfill leachate is required at all active and closed landfill sites. Since leachate production continues long after the landfill is closed and no longer generating revenue, management strategies including low-cost passive and naturalized landfill leachate treatment systems are ideal.&#xD;
The past practice of dumping solid waste into unused tracts of land has created many brownfield sites with uncontrolled discharges of leachate to the receiving environment. Belle Park in Kingston, Ontario is an example of such a site that has been reclaimed for recreational use. A seep management strategy, which included the installation of leachate extraction wells, has been implemented at the site. Passive treatment systems, a coastal fringe wetland and a phreatophyte plots, were installed to evaluate their effectiveness in conjunction with the leachate seep management. Modelling estimated that originally, the pumping wells decreased leachate discharge by 60%, and with the newer wells in 2007 the discharge was decreased by 75- 85%.&#xD;
In situ pilot-scale evaluations of treatments systems are required to ensure adequate treatment of the leachate. The Merrick Landfill in North Bay, Ontario currently captures leachate produced on site and is assessing the potential of a hybrid-passive landfill leachate treatment system. This design process started with bench-scale design and assessment of active pretreatment options, followed by an evaluation of passive and semi-passive treatment systems at the bench-scale (treating 2-3 L/day) at both room (24oC) and cold (2oC) ambient temperatures. The design process culminated with a pilot-scale assessment of hybrid-passive treatment systems (treating 2000 L/d).&#xD;
Assessment of flow in passive treatment system is usually conducted with tracer evaluations. Vertical-flow passive treatment systems with intermittent dosing of leachate for passive aeration have both saturated and unsaturated flow regions. This research shows that tracer evaluation of these types of system was insufficient to measure the clogging within the pore spaces. Therefore a time-lagged flux method was created, based on the pilot-scale hybrid passive treatment system at the Merrick Landfill. This analytical solution quantified the changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity in the treatment system cells.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examines the static recovery behaviour of a clad aluminum alloy manufactured by Novelis FusionTM technology after 72% cold rolling.  The clad alloy system studied consisted of a core AA6XXX alloy clad on one side with AA3003.  The Recovery at the inter-alloy region is compared with the recovery of core AA6XXX at the same depth from the rolling surface.  Sample coupons from the inter-alloy region and core AA6XXX were heated isochronally and isothermally, at different temperatures and times, respectively, to probe the recovery kinetics of the X-ray peak broadening, X-ray macro-texture and micro-hardness from the cold rolled state. The recovery of the {220} and {311} X-ray line profiles were observed between the anneals.  A pseudo-Voigt fit function was fit to the profile to obtain the defect related information. Recovery in the peak broadening began by 100°C and correlated to a decrease in the hardness.  Sharpening of X-ray profiles during recovery is attributed to the microstructural evolution resulting from preferred release of the stored energy due to dislocation rearrangement and annihilation.  Kinetic behaviour of the recovery is measured by observing the evolution of X-ray profiles and hardness during isothermal annealing at two different temperatures.  Recovery behaviour in the inter-alloy region is measured to be relatively slower than the recovery of the core AA6XXX after same macroscopic pre-strain.  Activation energy for recovery is calculated from the isothermal data to deduce a recovery mechanism. The activation energy calculated in core AA6XXX, 1.7eV, is close to the activation energy value for diffusion of Mg in Al (1.3-1.7eV).  This indicates a possible role of Mg diffusion in the recovery of AA6XXX.  The relatively higher activation energy for recovery of 2.9eV measured in the inter-alloy region may be due to pinning by nano-scale Al-Mn precipitates. The X-ray broadening data is deconvoluted to determine the apparent dislocation content using a modified Williamson-Hall model.  The dislocation density measured in the AA6XXX and inter-alloy regions in the deformed and recovered conditions indicates that dislocation density is a suitable parameter that represents the stored energy that drives subsequent structural evolution during recovery.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Work conducted as part of this thesis evaluated the lifting techniques of paramedics using a novel link-segment model that was validated against a commercially available software package, 3D Static Strength Prediction Program (3DSSPP). &#xD;
 Twenty-five paramedics visited the Biomechanics Lab at Queen’s University to participate in testing sessions mimicking the daily lifting and carrying tasks performed by paramedics on the job. &#xD;
Participants were outfitted with the Xsens Motion Tracking System and asked to lift and carry bags ranging from 5-20kg. Output from the Xsens system was used in a 3D-inverse dynamic model to estimate loading at the L5/S1 joint. The compressive and shear force estimates at this joint are of particular interest given their correlation with low back pain and injury.&#xD;
Across all conditions the greatest compressive forces were seen during bag pickup and bag release. Additionally, reaching forward 50 cm at pickup increased peak spinal compressive loads by nearly 300N and 500N for a 5kg and 10kg handbag respectively. Not surprisingly, at bag release greater trunk lean values were correlated with higher compressive force estimates. Single-shoulder backpack carries showed similar loading characteristics when compared to double-shoulder backpack carries. Shear force estimates remained well below acceptable levels across all conditions.&#xD;
Based on paramedic feedback, a supplementary testing session was performed with a single participant to evaluate multi-bag carries and stair climbing. The results of this testing session showed that loading was reduced at pickup and release when the load was distributed across two bags.&#xD;
This research led to the development of four recommendations that have been presented to the Association of Municipal Emergency Medical Services of Ontario.&#xD;
1.	Paramedics should not lift single bags or a combination of bags that exceed 20kg. &#xD;
2.	Prior to lifting, bags should be located as close to the paramedic as possible.&#xD;
3.	When placing bags on the ground and when picking bags up off of the ground, paramedics should use a squat lift technique to prevent forward and side bending.&#xD;
4.	When multiple bags are carried the load should be evenly distributed within bags and across sides of the body.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Most events that we encounter in everyday life provide our different senses with correlated information, and audiovisual speech perception is a familiar instance of multisensory integration. Several approaches will be used to further examine the role of cognitive factors on audiovisual speech perception. The main focuses of this thesis will be to examine the influences of cognitive load and selective attention on audiovisual speech perception, as well as the integration of auditory and visual information in talking distractor faces. The influence of cognitive factors on the temporal integration of auditory and visual speech, and gaze behaviour during audiovisual speech will also be addressed.&#xD;
The overall results of the experiments presented here suggest that the integration of auditory and visual speech information is quite robust to various attempts to modulate the integration. Adding a cognitive load task shows minimal disruption of the integration of auditory and visual speech information. Changing attentional instructions to get subjects to selectively attend to either the auditory or visual speech information also has a rather modest influence on the observed integration of auditory and visual speech information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Generally, the integration of temporally offset auditory and visual information seems rather insensitive to cognitive load or selective attentional manipulations. The processing of visual information from distractor faces seems to be limited. The language of the visually articulating distractors doesn't appear to provide information that is helpful for matching together the auditory and visual speech streams. Audiovisual speech distractors are not really any more distracting than auditory distractor speech paired with a still image, suggesting a limited processing or integration of the visual and auditory distractor information.&#xD;
&#xD;
The gaze behaviour during audiovisual speech perception appears to be relatively unaffected by an increase in cognitive load, but is somewhat influenced by attentional instructions to selectively attend to the auditory and visual information. Additionally, both the congruency of the consonant, and the temporal offset of the auditory and visual stimuli have small but rather robust influences on gaze.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This qualitative case study examined a cohort of prospective teachers who completed a university mathematics course during which they were given the opportunity to relearn geometry conceptually and gain experience teaching using contemporary approaches.  The course embedded mathematics content using the context of (a) problem solving in university-based seminar classes and (b) a concurrent Grade 7 and 8 teaching placement.  Questionnaires, administered at the beginning and end of the semester, and individual interviews were used to obtain data about the prospective teachers’ beliefs about the nature of mathematics and its teaching, and about their pedagogical content knowledge.&#xD;
The pre-course profile was that of a group who held comparable views about mathematics teaching as passive, learning as procedural, and mathematics itself as instrumental.  The post-course profile, however, was of a radically different group who once again claimed to hold comparable beliefs about reform-based teaching methods, conceptual learning, and a dynamic view of the utility of mathematics.  There are five findings from this study with import for preservice mathematics teacher education.  First, learning best occurs within a community.  Second, an inquiry-based approach to mathematics provides a rich learning opportunity for students.   Third, the instructor, who must have expertise in both mathematics and mathematics pedagogy, must embody reform-based teaching practice.  Fourth, to enhance their competence and confidence, teacher candidates must have opportunities to emulate the instructor in a safe environment.  Fifth, reflecting critically about course experiences is an essential part of learning for prospective educators.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the relationship between the monster and the tragic in 16th and 17th century French literature, in particular through the analysis of the figure of the tragic monster. We borrowed the term “tragic monster” from F. Dupont (Monstres de Sénèque) and we have elaborated this concept in conjunction with the structure of Ancient Greek and Roman tragedy, composed of dolor, furor, néfas and the tragic monster. Our first chapter explores the many connotations associated with the monster in 16th and 17th century France (prodigious births, grotesques, and monstrous heroes of Greek and Roman tragedy) and establishes the similarities between the scenario of Ancient tragedy and the story of the Fall of man.&#xD;
	In our second chapter, we take note of the coincidence between monstrous form and monstrous behaviour in Aubigné’s depiction of France as a “monstrous giant” in Les Tragiques and also demonstrate the strong connection between the tragic and the monstrous for Aubigné. In chapter three, a comparison of Bèze’s Abraham sacrifiant to the medieval treatment of the story of Abraham and Isaac reveals the concept of the tragic monster as an innovation that Bèze develops from his Greek and Roman models. We also note the important differences between Bèze’s biblical tragedy and his models. In chapter four we follow the tragic arc of both Thésée and Phèdre in Racine’s Phèdre, highlighting the importance of self-knowledge in this play and that of lucidity for the concept of the tragic monster. In chapter five, lucidity continues to be a major theme as Pascal attempts to convert his reader by impressing upon him his status as a “monstre incompréhensible” in Les Pensées. In our conclusion, we attempt to trace an evolution in the concept of the monster – originally thought of  something “against nature”, to finally being defined with Pascal, as the very essence of the human being – and we point to the possible consequences of this evolution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis charts the shifts in metaphors of memory associated with the digitization of personal photography – from ‘archiving’ to ‘sharing’ – developing  a strong account of the role of metaphor in shaping cultural conceptions and material technologies of memory making in relation to photography. Early discourse surrounding the emergence of photography heralded the camera as a medium capable of capturing the imprinted trace (light) of the real.  By extension, photography has routinely been figured as an essential means through which ‘the social’ can be captured, framed, communicated, and distributed, with personal photographs historically positioned as visual ‘archives’ of the self. Underlying this are specific metaphorical conceptions of the relationships between human memory, reality and representation. This thesis considers how metaphors of the ‘memory-archive’ have naturalized historically specific ideas about human memory which have in turn come to serve as models for the design and ongoing use of photographic technologies. This thesis argues for a sociology of metaphor, which can account for the ideological potential of metaphor in constructing a specific paradigm of memory, while advancing the material consequences of metaphor as a constitutive agent that enables and constrains the possibilities for memory making. The thesis focuses upon the metaphoric shifts from analogue preservation or ‘archiving’ to online distribution or ‘sharing’ within digital landscapes. The central chapters of the thesis consider the ways in which particular metaphors of memory – as archive, as distributed, as shared – are materialized as technologies, in this case photographic media. By exploring three key technologies – the Kodak EasyShare Camera, Cloud Computing, and the Instagram Application – the thesis examines the ways in which new metaphors of memory and of the social are becoming materially embedded. The thesis further reveals residual anthropocentric ideas of memory and technology, which continue through metaphors of photo-sharing which further disguises the role of the ‘technological unconscious’ in shaping potential memories.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Both security and human rights are important to all within the civilized world. Yet there are some serious tensions between the two political norms. For instance, it may not be easy for a state or the international community to reconcile well intentioned acts to maintain security and to preserve human rights. In the recent past, such a difficulty has been played out not only in the events, but also in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. The result of the attacks, culminating in the massive loss of lives and property, has been in the adoption of various international treaties and domestic laws that have swiftly been enacted and deployed to counter terrorism, and the development of a concept of a state of “urgency” that appears to shadow the obligation to protect fundamental human rights, particularly the right to life under international law. This thesis thus focuses on the promotion and protection of fundamental human rights, particularly, the right to life with the subsequent declaration of the “war on terror” by the United States. The work targets the debate between security and human rights in the light of terrorism post 9/11, highlights the impact of choosing one ideal over another, and eventually rationing out a balance that would serve as a threshold for upholding standards in both security and human rights in the face of terrorism threats.&#xD;
  Essentially, however, this thesis is hinged on the argument that to allow the ideal of security which apparently appears advantageous to a “continuing state of urgency” to overwhelmingly influence the implementation of counter-terrorism measures while paying no attention to the fundamental right to life would constitute a paradox in combating terrorism. I posit that the result of the above exercise, if chosen, implies more tragic consequences when implemented than the singular acts of terrorism in themselves.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Brachytherapy is an important method of breast cancer treatment; however, improvements in both treatment planning and delivery are needed. The procedure involves insertion of catheters in the tumor site, which, in current practice, is prone to clinically significant error. In order to improve on contemporary catheter placement accuracy, integration of pre-operative imaging, supplemented by computerized surgical planning and mathematical optimization were used to develop and test an intra-operative immobilization and catheter guidance system.&#xD;
&#xD;
A custom-template specific to each patient with optimally-placed guide-holes for catheter insertion was designed and fabricated for use on phantom studies. Template creation is based on a virtual reality reconstruction of the patient's anatomy from computed tomography imaging. The template fits on the patient's breast, immobilizing the soft tissue, to provide pre-planned catheter insertion holes for guidance to the tumor site. &#xD;
&#xD;
Agar-based phantom and target models were used for quantitative validation of the template using computed tomography imaging for template planning and validation. Planned catheter tracks were compared to post-insertion image data and distance measurements from target location were used to create an error measure.  Using the latest template design spanning multiple experiments resulted in a mean of 2.6 mm, 95%, CI =3.1-2.2, which is within the clinically acceptable range of 3 mm, as validated with our clinical collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
Validation of the brachytherapy template on phantom tissue produced clinically acceptable results.  Use of a patient-specific template for breast brachytherapy is feasible and may improve the procedure accuracy and outcome. This work has been a proof-of-concept, providing evidence to support moving forward with the next phase of patient-specific breast template trials for use in brachytherapy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The globular cluster system (GCS) of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 has been examined using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS); spectra for 156 candidate globular clusters (GCs) were obtained, extending to a galactocentric radius of 42 kpc.  The system was found to have an even 78 GC candidates per population, using a colour of g-i = 0.92 (Faifer et al. 2011) to split the system into sub-populations. The  populations refer to their metalicity; a g-i&lt;0.92 is considered metal-poor (MP), and a g-i&gt;0.92 is metal-rich (MR).&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Line-of-sight-velocity measurements and subsequent modelling, were used to measure the full GCS rotational velocity as 59+/-28 km/s, with a position angle of 218+/-28 degrees. The MR population was found to have rotational velocity of 81+/-42 km/s with a position angle of 221+/-29 degrees, while the MP population measures a rotational velocity of 30+/-36 km/s with a position angle of 202+/-73 degrees.  The average velocity dispersion for the full GCS was calculated at 247+/-61 km/s, the MR population 266+/-94 km/s, and the MP population, 221+/-76 km/s.  These findings are consistent (within uncertainties) with previous studies by Hwang et al.(2008), and Bridges et al. (2006).&#xD;
The velocity dispersion profile for all populations is constant with increasing radius, suggesting the presence of a dark matter (DM) halo.  A tracer mass estimator was used to measure the mass at 42 kpc as (2.01+/-0.05)X10^{12} solar masses, for an isothermal potential, and (1.21+/-0.05)X10^{12} solar masses if the tracers followed the DM profile.  Finally, it was estimated that M/L_{B}=22 - 44, consistent with the presence of considerable amounts of DM for a luminous galaxy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The web of the future will require automated tagging of equivalent or similar services in support of service discovery and the selection of appropriate alternatives in case of failure. Code similarity detection tools, or clone detectors, provide a mature and scalable method of identifying these kinds of similarities and can be used to assist in this problem. However, they require a set of units to be compared; something to which the most popular description language, WSDL (Web Service Description Language), does not lend itself. First, each WSDL description can contain more than one operation description, which does not provide the granularity we need to compare services on the operation level. Secondly, these operation descriptions are mixed together throughout the file, often sharing some common elements. This thesis describes a technique for extracting the elements of each operation description and consolidating them into a self-contained unit using TXL, a source transformation language. These units, referred to as Web Service Cells or WSCells (pronounced “wizzles”), can then be used by similarity detectors to search for similarities. We describe a modified architecture to the NICAD clone detector to support the creation of WSCells, and the implementation of a special WSDL extractor we used to emulate this modification in its absence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent paleolimnological research in the eastern Canadian high Arctic on the ecological impact of the Thule c.1000-1500 AD has documented the influence of prehistoric anthropogenic activities.  Six lake and pond sites (three pairs) on the south-western coast of Baffin Island, Nunavut, were used to compare impacted and non-impacted sites in the southern-most region of Thule occupation, as well as to compare Thule occupation sites with sites occupied by another early Arctic population group, the Dorset.  Tanfield 1 and Tanfield 2 (impacted and control, respectively) are adjacent to several multiple-occupation Dorset sites on Cape Tanfield; Juet 1 and 2 (impacted and control, respectively) are adjacent to a short-term occupation Dorset site on Juet Island; McKellar 1 is adjacent to a multiple-occupation Thule site near McKellar Bay. A nearby site (McKellar 2) was also studied, but it was clearly an anomalous, eutrophic site, rather than a control for McKellar 1.  Diatom assemblages and sedimentary 15N profiles were analyzed in sediment cores from all study sites.  Selected paired sediment intervals were AMS radiocarbon dated using both humic acids and terrestrial macrofossils in an attempt to establish basal dates for each core.  Significant differences between several of the paired AMS radiocarbon dates serve as a cautionary note for dating Arctic sediments using either humic acids or terrestrial macrofossils.  Paleolimnological analyses revealed that at both multiple-occupation sites (Tanfield 1 and McKellar 1), the activities of the Dorset and the Thule influenced lake ecology, while at the short-term occupation site (Juet 1), the Dorset occupation was not sufficiently large to have a discernible impact.  McKellar 1 showed a greater impact compared to Tanfield 1, consistent with the intense marine mammal hunting by Thule at the former, compared to the moderate marine mammal hunting by Dorset at Tanfield 1.  The origin of marine-derived nutrients at McKellar 2 could not be ascertained with certainty. The influence of early Arctic population groups remains obvious in present-day nutrient- and production-related water chemistry variables.  This research points to the value of collaborations between paleolimnologists and archaeologists and may provide insight into the future implications of current anthropogenic activities in the Arctic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My MSc project aims at developing pH-responsive molecular tweezers for drug delivery applications. The project began with the synthesis of our 2nd generation tweezer, whose main objective was to improve our previous model, 1st generation tweezer, which contained a pH-responsive triad spacer and two naphthalene walls known to interact with hydrophobic drugs such as Mitoxantrone®. The naphthalene interaction sites were successfully modified to contain&#xD;
oligoethylene glycol chains to improve their water-solubility, in anticipation for more accurate measurements of pKa and binding constants in aqueous media. However, all attempts to convert such naphthalene derivatives into their corresponding boronic acid or ester through standard protocols (halogen-lithium exchange, palladium catalyzed borylation) failed. Without&#xD;
the required boronic acid/ester, the final Suzuki-Miyaura coupling with the di-bromo triad spacer was not achieved.&#xD;
Synthesis of the 3rd generation tweezer, which was modified to contain theophylline as&#xD;
the new interaction sites, was then attempted. The half-tweezer was successfully synthesized via copper (II) catalyzed coupling of theophylline with the 5-bromo-4-methoxyphenyl boronic acid. However, all attempts to convert it into the required boronic acid/ ester for the final Suzuki-&#xD;
Miyaura coupling reaction with 2,6-dibromopyridine failed. We then focused our attention on the conversion of the triad spacer into its corresponding diboronic acid. The synthesis of the triad diboronic acid was a success, however, the final copper (II) catalyzed reaction with theophylline to form the tweezer only yielded the mono-coupled product.&#xD;
Lastly, our 4th generation tweezer was engineered to avoid the synthetic difficulties encountered in the boronic acid/ ester synthesis stage. Using the commercially available 5-formyl-2-methoxyphenylboronic acid and o-phenylenediamine, we successfully synthesized a benzimidazole-derived “half tweezer” through ring condensation reaction. Alkylation of this half-tweezer was also successfully achieved, although purification of the alkylated product was not optimized. Using this crude product, we carried out the final tweezer reaction via Suzuki- Miyaura coupling with 2,6-dibromopyridine under microwave irradiation. 1H NMR results show&#xD;
formation of new species that is believed to be the 4th generation tweezer (although the&#xD;
presence of impurities made integration of the signals unreliable). Much work is needed in the purification of the alkylated half tweezer boronic acid in order to avoid complicated mixtures in the final tweezer reaction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neurons perform complex computations, communications and precise transmissions of information in the form of action potentials (APs). The high level of heterogeneity and complexity at all levels of organization within a neuron and the functional requirement of highly permeable cell membranes leave neurons exposed to damage when energy levels are insufficient for the active maintenance of ionic gradients.&#xD;
When energy is limiting the ionic gradient across a neuron’s cell membrane risks being dissipated which can have dire consequences. Other researchers have advocated “generalized channel arrest” and/or “spike arrest” as a means of reducing the neuronal permeability allowing neurons to adjust the demands placed on their electrogenic pumps to lower levels of energy supply. I investigated the consequences of hypoxia on the propagation of a train of APs down the length of a fast conducting axon capable of transmitting APs at very high frequencies. Under normoxic conditions I found that APs show conduction velocities and instantaneous frequencies nearly double that of neurons experiencing energy limiting hypoxic conditions. I show that hypoxia affects AP conduction differently for different lengths of axon and for APs of different instantaneous frequencies. Action potentials of high instantaneous frequency in branching lengths of axon within ganglia were delayed more significantly than those in non-branching lengths contained within the connective and fail preferentially in branching axon. I found that octopamine attenuates the effects of hypoxia on AP propagation for the branching length of axon but has no effect on the non-branching length of axon. Additionally, for energetically stable cells, application of the anti-diabetic medication metformin or the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blocker ZD7288 resulted in a reduced performance similar to that seen in neurons experiencing energetic stress. Furthermore both metformin and ZD7288 affect the shape of individual APs within an AP train as well as the original temporal sequence of the AP train, which encodes behaviourally relevant information. I propose that the reduced performance observed in an energetically compromised cell represents an adaptive mechanism&#xD;
employed by neurons in order to maintain the integrity of their highly heterogeneous and complex organization during periods of reduced energy supply.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Akan relationship with nature as expressed by Jefferson and Skinner (1974) enjoins the living to view nature as sacred and in effect prevent it from wanton destruction. This is because humans have a relationship with nature and must in return treasure it. This relationship shaped people‟s perception and attitude towards nature through the adherence to taboos associated with nature as well as the recognition of the place of non-human members of the community. This was meant to consolidate the sacred relationship between humans and nature. However, with Ghana‟s adoption of „Western‟ perspectives of development which perceives humanity as superior and in charge of creation as well as its perception of Akan animistic tendencies as „primitive,‟ „superstitious‟ and „fetish‟ has led to the destruction of nature. Ghana‟s environment continually faces gradual degradation because of the neglect of the role of the Akan indigenous religion in the preservation of nature because of the perception that the adoption of the animistic tenets of Akan Indigenous religion in Ghana‟s environmental policy constitutes a retrogression. The continuous neglect of religion and the over-reliance on legislation as a means of preventing environmental degradation will worsen the environment situation. It is therefore appropriate that contemporary conservation methods take cognizance of Indigenous religion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In sports like gymnastics and figure skating where peak performance occurs before physical maturation it logically follows that athletes need to be dedicated to their athletic development at a young age if elite performance is to be attained. However, countless studies have reported that early specialization in a single sport exposes youth to elevated risks of negative physical, psychological or emotional outcomes associated with sport participation (Côté &amp; Fraser-Thomas, 2007). As such, it is important that we develop an understanding of the contextual factors or features of specialized youth sport environment(s) that are having positive impacts on youth growth, development and long-term commitment to sport. By harnessing an understanding of the features of specialized youth sport environments that positively contribute to the youth sport experience, we will be better equipped to mitigate the increased risk of negative outcomes in these environments.   &#xD;
Using the National Research Council Institute of Medicine’s (2002) eight setting features as a framework, the general goal of the current study was to explore the specialized youth sport environment as it is experienced by young athletes. Photo-elicitation was used to conduct interviews with 15 female athletes between the ages of 8 and 13 who primarily participated in one sport for 12 or more hours per week, for at least 9 months of the year. Two over-arching dimensions of the specialized youth sport experience emerged from the themes generated by the interviews: program design and interaction. Program design represents six themes underpinning the program’s inherent structure and organization: personal performance emphasis, consistent training structure, adaptable practice activities, rule guided engagement, appropriate equipment set-up and maintenance, and supervision by one or more adults. The interaction dimension represents six themes that emerged as a result of relationships with key social agents (e.g., parents, coaches, peers, community) of the sport environment: tangible support, informational support, emotional support, cultivation of camaraderie, achievement recognition, and opportunities for autonomy.  These findings add to the literature as they provide a first step in understanding the specialized youth sport environment from the athlete’s eyes. That is, they not only help us understand the elements of the youth sport environment that youth perceive as important, but they also provide us with a working framework of the key features that are likely to contribute to positive outcomes in specialized sport environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hypoxic condition   is a naturally occurring environmental stressor in aquatic ecosystems. However, due to modern anthropocentric activities, hypoxia has been increasing in prevalence and severity.  Rainbow trout, a keystone species in many North American lakes, is hypoxia intolerant.  As a result, this species is of particular concern when studying the effects of hypoxia on an organism’s physiological functioning.  Chronic starvation was used as a tool to induce metabolic depression to determine the effect that depressed metabolic rate had on hypoxia tolerance.  Juvenile rainbow trout were deprived of food for five weeks at 15oC.  Each week, routine metabolic rate (RMR) and critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) were measured. Concomitantly, resting and post-hypoxia fish (8 h at ~50% air saturation) were sampled to measure metabolites in blood, liver and muscle, as well as enzyme activities in select tissues. Food deprivation resulted in a decrease in routine metabolic rate (RMR) and shift towards an increased reliance on aerobic metabolism. Pcrit decreased significantly following four weeks of food deprivation respectively, indicating that metabolic depression induced by food deprivation may confer an increased tolerance to low environmental oxygen concentration ([O2]).  However, marginal metabolic scope (MMS), another indicator of hypoxia tolerance, did not change in response to metabolic depression.  Furthermore, subjecting trout to O2 limitation resulted in mobilization of carbohydrates from the liver subsequently leading to hyperglycemia.  This was likely a survival technique ensuring that if severe hypoxia ensues, anaerobic substrates are ready for transport to the necessary tissues.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper provides the theoretical component to a blog I wrote as part of an academic program in Cultural Studies for a period from March 2, 2011 until September 30, 2011. Called The Last Triangle: Sex, Money and the Politics (http://www.thelasttriangle.com), I set out to explore the increasing normalization of pubic hair removal among women in North America. The reasons for the upswing in the popularity of pubic hair removal are hard to pinpoint, but seem to be motivated by a number of forces. From the ready accessibility of pornography, where pubic hair is currently so rare it has spawned its own fetish, to the widespread attention Brazilian waxing has received in the media, pubic hair removal is merely one among a myriad of body grooming practices many women increasingly indicate they feel obliged follow. This paper will explore some of those ideas, taking a critical view of the practice in light of questions around performing femininity, how pubic hair removal pertains to body control, and how pubic hair removal is, for many, increasingly viewed as a practice closely connected with good hygiene. Because it is intimately tied to the purchase of dedicated products, pubic hair removal will also be considered in as much as it relates to capitalism. Because the blog was a fundamental component of my research experience, excerpts of both my own writing, as well as comments from readers, will be included in conversation here with the theoretical questions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study of quenched-in nanovoids in 99.988 and 99.995 at.% aluminum (Al) is presented. Nanovoids are agglomerations of point defects&#xD;
(vacancies) in the metallic host. SAXS is a non-destructive, dynamic probe which is ideally suited to characterize nanoscale electron density inhomogeneities, e.g., electron density difference between void and metal matrix. Previous SAXS studies of nanovoid structures in metals were limited by the presence of multiple scattering from the metal matrix. The first published report of nanovoid characterization in quenched Al using the SAXS method took place in 2008. In the present work, meticulous material processing methods were applied to induce a significant nanovoid concentration in nominally pure Al while minimizing the introduction of multiple scattering artifacts through sample deformation.&#xD;
Absolute intensity calibration with a secondary glassy carbon standard was performed. Data analysis procedures were developed to extract void scattering by subtracting calibrated reference scattering from calibrated quenched sample scattering, independent of their thicknesses. SAXS analyses were used to estimate void size as well as the void-metal interface structure, void number distribution and void volume fraction in quenched aluminum samples, an extension over the previous work where only estimates of void sizes were obtained. This work, including identification of experimental tools that can be readily&#xD;
improved, demonstrates that SAXS studies are capable of providing precise characterization&#xD;
of nanovoid structure in aluminum. SAXS analysis provides statistically averaged&#xD;
parameters from scattering data collected from a macroscopic sample volume, which is an&#xD;
advantage over electron microscopy studies. Also, preliminary aging studies of nanovoids&#xD;
in Al revealed some interesting trends in the kinetic properties of the nanovoids which can be extended to test and develop the existing phenomenological models of void nucleation and growth. This level of information, i.e., at the nanoscale and, ideally, yielding kinetic information about the early stage formation and growth of nanovoids, has the potential to be used to develop novel aluminum alloy materials.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Large-eddy simulations are carried out to study the combined&#xD;
  effects of roughness and favourable pressure gradient in boundary layer flows,&#xD;
  where the high acceleration (on smooth walls) may cause flow reversion to the&#xD;
  quasi-laminar state. A sand-grain roughness model is used, with the &#xD;
no-slip boundary condition modeled by an immersed boundary method. &#xD;
The properties and accuracies of the scheme are studied,  &#xD;
 the roughness model is validated, and the spatial-resolution requirements are &#xD;
determined.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The roughness model is applied to boundary layers subject to mild or strong&#xD;
acceleration, with simulations carried out underlining the effects of &#xD;
three parameters: the acceleration parameter, the roughness height,&#xD;
and the inlet Reynolds number. &#xD;
The roughness effects are limited to the roughness sublayer; the outer layer is &#xD;
affected indirectly only, through the changes that roughness causes in the &#xD;
relaminarization and retransition processes.&#xD;
The roughness significantly affects the inner-layer&#xD;
quantities like the friction velocity and the friction coefficient, while &#xD;
the local Reynolds number, the outer-layer mean velocity, as well as the Reynolds &#xD;
stresses beyond the roughness sublayer, are not sensitive to the roughness. &#xD;
The acceleration decreases the Reynolds stresses in the&#xD;
overlap region and promotes a laminar-like velocity profile.&#xD;
The acceleration leads to stabilization of near-wall structures and causes &#xD;
one-dimensional turbulence. The roughness generates small-scale structures&#xD;
at the bottom wall, which disturb the larger structures originally &#xD;
stabilized by the pressure gradient, leading to a decrease in the Reynolds-stress&#xD;
anisotropy. Roughness increases the Reynolds stresses in the roughness sublayer &#xD;
and tends to restore the fully turbulence flow early. The inlet Reynolds number &#xD;
affects the flow stability by determining the viscous length scale &#xD;
compared to the roughness length scales, and by determining how far &#xD;
the roughness effect extents into the boundary layer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper utilizes a critical (political) discourse analysis to examine security dialogue as revealed through policy; in order to facilitate this task, the following publically available political documents will be analyzed: Smart Border Declaration; Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP), and the pending Beyond Borders deal. The objective is to highlight the complexities and realities of the security era as it pertains to North American border security. In other words, I am interested in the administration of border security policy in its practical context. Reviewing the Beyond Borders deal and situating it within the overall national security policies that govern the Canadian border facilitates the identification of limitations posed by the security mentality dominant in border governance. This thesis advocates that those studying border security policies in order to formulate alternative options do so in a manner that appreciates the unique polity milieu of the border. The analysis presented here has policy implications and concludes with recommendations and projections for the Beyond Borders deal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic landscape features on genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity has important implications for conservation of species living in fragmented environments. Here, I combine population genetic data, detailed land cover information, and computer simulations to explore how landscape shapes genetic structure across two regional populations of the threatened eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) in Ontario, Canada: one along the eastern shores of Georgian Bay and the other largely confined to the northern half of the Bruce Peninsula. &#xD;
First I used spatial Bayesian assignment to quantify the genetic population structure within each regional population. I found marked subpopulation structure within eastern Georgian Bay with differentiation of island and mainland snakes, a north-south split within the mainland coinciding with the town of Parry Sound, and evidence of further subdivision within the cluster of snakes north of Parry Sound. In contrast I found no population subdivision within the mainland of the Bruce Peninsula, but genetic distinction of mainland and island snakes.&#xD;
Next, I identified the landscape features that shape spatial genetic structure within regional populations. In eastern Georgian Bay I found local variation in the effect of landscape on populations. North of Parry Sound I found no effect of landscape on inter-individual genetic differentiation, but a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance. In contrast I found that both open water and roads restrict gene flow of snakes south of Parry Sound. I found no evidence of isolation-by-distance or that landscape shape genetic structure within the Bruce Peninsula. &#xD;
Finally I used individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to identify the lag-time associated with the detection of contemporary landscape feature effects on genetic structure of massasaugas, and explore the consequences of using spatially correlated land cover elements in landscape genetic analyses. I found that the genetic consequences of roads could be detected within 2-12 generations when population sizes were small or juvenile dispersal was low. However, I also found that roads could be spuriously identified as impediments to gene flow when spatially correlated features such as water are included in genetic models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the later decades of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth, large numbers of Canadian women were stepping out of the shadows of private life and into the public world of work and political action.  Among them, both a cause and an effect of these sweeping social changes, was the first generation of Canadian women to work as professional authors.  Although these women were not unified by ideology, genre, or date of birth, they are studied here as a generation defined by their time and place in history, by their material circumstances, and by their collective accomplishment.  Chapters which focus on E. Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake), the Eaton sisters (Sui Sin Far and Onoto Watanna), Joanna E. Wood, and Sara Jeannette Duncan explore some of the many commonalities and interrelationships among the members of this generation as a whole.  This project combines archival research with analytical bibliography in order to clarify and extend our knowledge of Johnson’s and Duncan’s professional lives and publishing histories, and to recover some of Wood’s “lost” stories.  This research offers a preliminary sketch of the long tradition of the platform performance (both Native and non-Native) with which Johnson and others engaged.  It explores the uniquely innovative ethnographic writings of Johnson, Duncan, and the Eaton sisters, among others, and it explores thematic concerns which relate directly to the experiences of working women.  Whether or not I convince other scholars to treat these authors as a generation, with more in common than has previously been supposed, the strong parallels revealed in these pages will help to clarify and contextualize some of their most interesting work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Humic-based organic compounds containing phenol or benzoic acid groups strongly compete with phosphates for specific binding sites on the surface of these colloidal particles.  To study the interactions between phenol groups and the surface binding sites of unmodified or modified colloidal particles, chemical force spectrometry (CFS) was used as a tool to measure the adhesion force between an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip terminated with a phenol self-assembled monolayer and colloidal particles under varying pH conditions.  Two modification methods, co-precipitation and post-precipitation, were used to simulate the naturally-occurring phosphate and humic-acid adsorption process.  The pH dependence of adhesion forces between phenol-terminated tip and colloidal particles could be explained by an interplay of electrostatic forces, the surface loading of the modifying phosphate or humic acid species and ionic hydrogen bonding.&#xD;
      Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a widely-used polymer in microfluidic devices. PDMS surfaces are commonly modified to make it suitable for specific microfluidic devices. We studied the surface modification of PDMS using four perfluoroalkyl-triethoxysilane molecules of differing length of perfluorinated alkyl chain.  The results show that the length of fluorinated alkyl chain has important effects on the density of surface modifying molecules, surface topography and surface zeta potential.  The perfluorinated overlayer makes PDMS more efficient at supporting electroosmotic flow, which has potential applications in microfluidic devices.&#xD;
     The kinetic study of RNase A, lysozyme C, α-lactalbumin and myoglobin at different concentrations adsorbed on the self-assembled monolayers of 1-octanethiol (OT-Au) and 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl-1-thiol (FOT-Au) has been carried out.  The results show a positive relationship between the lower protein concentration and the increased adsorption rate constant &#xD;
(ka) on both surfaces.  At low concentrations, the protein adsorption on an OT-Au surface has greater ka than it on a FOT-Au surface. Comparing ka values for four proteins on OT-Au and FOT-Au surface demonstrates that hard proteins (lysozyme and RNase A) have larger ka than soft proteins (α-lactalbumin and myoglobin) on both surfaces.  The discussion is based on the hydrophobicity of OT-Au and FOT-Au surfaces, as well as average superficial hydrophobicity, flexibility, size, stability, and surface induced conformation change of proteins.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study explores the concept of ecotourism in terms of Honey’s (2008) seven principles of ecotourism (involves travel to natural destinations, minimizes impacts, builds environmental awareness, provides direct financial benefits to conservation, provides financial benefits and empowerment for local people, respects local culture, and supports human rights and democratic movements) and their application to the paddling industry of St. Lawrence Islands National Park (SLINP) and environs. SLINP and environs is located within the Thousand Islands Region of Eastern Ontario, and for the purpose of this research, includes all of the land and waterways along the St. Lawrence River extending as far as Jones Creek in the northeast to, but not including, Howe Island just southwest of Gananoque. The market and demand for paddle-based recreation in SLINP and environs is examined to determine if ecotourism is a feasible alternative to conventional tourism. Subsequently, Honey’s (2008) principles of ecotourism are applied to explore the role of paddle-based recreation within an ecotourism framework of the defined region. Specific recommendations were developed to better comply with these principles. General recommendations concerning the universal applicability of the principles were also prepared and included considerations for quality control measures and established tourism destinations. Ecotourism has traditionally been viewed as a panacea concept for developing countries to stimulate the economy, as well as, directly provide support for conservation efforts. This research instead examines the concept of ecotourism for a relatively sustainable, single activity within an established tourism destination of a developed country. If the recommendations are correctly implemented, the long term implications could include a reshaping of, first, the regional tourism industry and then, potentially the tourism industry at large, by encouraging a more holistic approach to tourism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Solvent-free peroxide-initiated polymer modifications are widely used to improve the physical and/or chemical properties of commodity plastics and elastomers. Although the reactions that underlie polymer grafting are known, our understanding of H-atom transfer reactions in this context is incomplete. Fundamental questions remain unanswered, such as the difference in reactivity between different polymers (polyethylene versus polypropylene and polyisobutylene) and differences in the regiochemical outcomes of grafting reactions upon them. Herein, experimental data pertaining to the H-atom transfers involved in polyolefin graft modifications were obtained to improve our fundamental understanding of these reactions by using radical-trapping techniques and quantum chemical calculations. In this project, experimental measurements of the efficiency of H-atom abstraction by t-butoxyl radicals from polyolefins, and suitable model compounds such as pentane, 2,4-dimethylpentane and 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane were determined. Insight is gained from alkyl-trapping experiments to quantify the relative reactivities of the primary, secondary and tertiary positions of the model compounds. Experimental data were compared to quantum chemical calculations, which revealed that entropic effects dictate the regioselectivity and preclude abstraction at the secondary position in favour of the less enthalpically-favourable primary abstraction site. MP2 and CBS-QB3 level calculations were able to reproduce experimental trends in model compound reactivity, while the highly common B3LYP density functional, used in other investigations on the subject, could not.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to identify the value of geomechanics and engineering geology to mine enterprise value for hardrock underground mines.  It was decided that the most effective way to highlight the value of geomechanics and engineering geology was by identifying an increase in expenditure that could be economically justified in the present to mitigate the cost of a future event, thus providing a means for showing the economic value of the work performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Cost models were generated for several events based on the direct cost, value of ore lost and decline in value of ore due to the event.  A cost associated with fatalities was also included.  Six rockburst events were developed into cost models from publicly available information.  A further 13 were developed from confidential information provided by mining companies, bringing the total number of events analyzed to 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
A probabilistic approach was then taken to identify the probability of a rockburst with a certain magnitude occurring and, if an event occurs, the probability it will cause damage.  The former is based on the Gutenberg-Richter Frequency-Magnitude relationship while the latter was derived from Unusual Occurrence Reports provided by the Ontario Ministry of Labour.  Three case studies were then developed to show how to use the average cost of a rockburst event in conjunction with the probability analysis to arrive at an increase in expenditure above baseline spending.&#xD;

It was found that the total average cost of a rockburst based on the 19 events analyzed from 13 mines in 4 different countries for events occurring between 1984 and 2009 is $35.4 million (2010 CAD) with a range of $1.1 to $263.5 million (2010 CAD).  Using the probabilistic method outlined above and cost models from the specific region involved, the increase in expenditure for the Ontario hard rock underground case study, Mine A and Mine B was found to be $12.1 million (2010 CAD),  $5 million (2010 CAD) and $4.0 million (2010 CAD) respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Our knowledge of how Arctic freshwater ecosystems will respond to continued climate change and variability is fundamentally limited by logistical difficulties of such remote research, resulting in relatively sparse long-term baseline data on these systems. This research applies a unique paired-watershed approach (i.e., two similar, adjacent lakes and catchments) to help address these limitations, which provided an opportunity to identify how broad-scale factors are filtered or modified by site-specific characteristics. &#xD;
My first main objective was to document the seasonal hydrochemical variability of runoff and influences on lake chemistry. Both lakes appear to be relatively insensitive to seasonal hydroclimatic variability, largely because periods of high discharge were also characterized by lower concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter, but also because of the relatively long lake water turnover time that suggests the effects of climatic and environmental changes would be felt later in these systems than in lakes and ponds with smaller lake volumes. &#xD;
My second objective was to investigate spatial and temporal trends in the lake diatom communities in order to refine subsequent paleoenvironmental reconstructions. A critical aspect of this objective was testing how faithfully the whole lake diatom community was represented in deep lake surface sediments where sediment cores are routinely collected. Most differences between the two lakes were largely accounted for with micro-environmental conditions associated with the specific sampling location. Also, both lakes exhibited a degree of disconnection between littoral benthic and profundal zones that manifested as an under-representation of the benthic community in deep lake surface sediments, with implications for paleoenvironmental interpretations. &#xD;
Finally, I present a multi-proxy record of environmental conditions in adjacent lakes spanning the period from pre-industrial times. Biogeochemical records reflected major changes in lake primary productivity and terrestrial organic matter accumulation beginning prior to 1950 in both lakes, pointing to profound environmental changes that culminated with the establishment of an appreciable diatom community in both lakes in the 1980s. Differences in the timing of changes between the two lakes point to differing threshold capacities to external forcings, and suggest that East Lake’s response to post-industrial climate change is advanced compared to West Lake.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Like many other multimedia applications, image compression involves a significant amount of data processing for coding images. Sophisticated general-purpose processors with parallel architectures and advanced cache systems can be dedicated to enhancing performance for serial multimedia applications through parallelization. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis describes parallelization of the JasPer reference software for the JPEG-2000 image compression standard and presents results from simulation, and from hardware execution on a multicore processor where speedups of more than 2 are obtained with 4 processors. Results from execution and cache behavior analysis are presented to establish the expected speedup and to further characterize JasPer execution. &#xD;
&#xD;
The JasPer encoding process has been analyzed on a single processor for both simulated and hardware execution in order to obtain more insights into application behavior. On recent hardware platforms, the significant contributors to the total execution time have been identified through profiling. The granularity of parallelism for parallelizable loops have been analyzed for execution on real hardware. Cache behavior and memory access pattern have been studied closely for the simulated execution. &#xD;
&#xD;
To facilitate parallelization, selected parallelizable loops have been transformed in order to assist the partitioning of loop iterations for parallel execution and to increase workload granularity and reduce synchronization overhead. These modifications include loop index and body transformation, and loop fusion. &#xD;
&#xD;
A memory access pattern tracking feature has also been introduced for serial and parallel execution of a program in simulation. This feature tracks the number of memory accesses in a particular data region during a particular interval of time in order to gain additional insights into execution behavior. &#xD;
&#xD;
The multithreaded execution of the parallelized JasPer encoder presents a relatively balanced workload which indicates a reasonable efficiency for parallel execution. The generated images have been compared against their original images by using analytical tools to ensure the image quality and to verify correctness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Narrowband optical filtering and chromatic dispersion are two important issues that affect optical fiber transmission performance. Recent technological developments in high-speed digital signal processors, digital-to-analog converters and analog-to-digital converters have enabled the implementation of electronic signal processing (ESP) in optical transmission systems leading to adaptive and cost efficient integrated solutions. This thesis focuses on applying ESP at the transmitter to pre-compensate for narrowband optical filtering and chromatic dispersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
A novel electronic pre-compensation approach was proposed to deal with narrowband optical filtering. The effectiveness was demonstrated by a straight-line experiment and a recirculating loop experiment for 10 Gb/s non-return-to-zero on-off-keying (NRZ-OOK). Moreover, the work was extended to NRZ differential-phase-shift-keying as well as 20 Gb/s NRZ differential-quadrature-phase-shift-keying. Experimental results demonstrate that electronic pre-compensation effectively reduces the degradation in system performance induced by narrowband optical filtering.&#xD;
&#xD;
Electronic dispersion pre-compensation was investigated using a semiconductor InP Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) for the NRZ-OOK modulation format at 10.709 Gb/s aiming at providing a cost efficient implementation for core and metro transmission networks. A brute-force method was developed to determine the requisite drive voltages due to the nonlinear voltage dependent attenuation and phase constants of the InP MZM. The transmission results for the recirculating loop and straightline experiments demonstrate that an InP MZM provides comparable dispersion precompensation performance with a conventional LiNbO3 MZM. Use of the NRZ-OOK modulation format and InP MZM provides a simple and cost-efficient solution for core and metro transmission network.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dispersion pre-compensation was also performed for a 85.672 Gb/s polarization multiplexed 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (PM-16QAM) modulation format with digital coherent detection and offline digital signal processing. The transmitter was characterized to ensure the quality of the 16QAM signal generation. Simulation results indicate the impact of the modulator bias voltage error on system performance. Recirculating loop experimental results demonstrate that the performance of dispersion pre-compensation is comparable with dispersion post-compensation, thus providing the possibility to combine dispersion pre- and post-compensation for PM-16QAM coherent transmission for further performance improvement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This is a study in the political ethics of liberalism. It uses political obligation theory to shed light on the neutrality-perfectionism debate. My thesis is that neutralism cannot provide a coherent foundation for liberal political morality because a viable account of general political obligation relies on background assumptions about persons and conduct that are reasonably contestable even though they are not illiberal. To make this case, Section I reviews the conceptual details of neutrality across two generations of thinking. Second-generation neutrality, under political liberalism, is the more plausible rendering because it acknowledges that liberalism must stake a middle-ground between non-moral instrumentalism and moral absolutism. Liberalism, in other words, needs a moral reason to be neutral. I question whether political liberalism remains sufficiently moral and sufficiently neutral by asking if it offers mutually sustaining legitimacy and obligation principles. Section II discusses perfectionist ethics and highlights a crucial kind of value, called inherent value, often invoked but rarely scrutinized in political theory. Inherent value marks the main ethical difference between liberal neutrality and illiberal perfectionism, showing how liberal-perfectionist positions on controversial matters can be taken without prescribing for the whole of life. Including this type of value, I then outline the precise neutralist and perfectionist conditions that liberals adopting either perspective would have to meet in justifying general political obligation. Section III then answers my main research question about whether political liberalism’s moral account of political obligation coheres with its neutralist position on legitimacy. My essential claim here is that our responsibility to comply with the moral and epistemological standards of civility is a position from inherent value. And since political liberalism cannot escape these inherent value assumptions while explaining and justifying its account of general political obligation, it is there that we can most clearly see political liberalism’s perfectionist leanings. My dissertation therefore shows a new way to understand that only liberal-perfectionist valuation can hang-together a coherent and viable liberalism for today’s pluralistic polities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Radiofrequency identification (RIFD) is a significant player in the spread of computation out of the box and into the environment and is becoming a key component in what some have titled the “digital era”.  In its capacity to identify and classify material objects often associated with human beings, RFID should also be considered as a mechanism of surveillance.  Rather than focusing on the often inflated claims of the transformative power of RFID (from both its boosters and its critics), current applications of RFID are analyzed firstly, through the lens of the digital sublime as employed by Vincent Mosco (2004), and secondly, from the risk society thesis as coined by Ulrich Beck (1992) and explored in light of Bauman’s analysis of the production of fear and its associated capacities (2007).  From the viewpoint of the digital sublime, RFID promises revolutionary potential in communication, distribution and efficiency and belief in these properties seems to override actual evidence of the more limited impacts of RFID.  In the risk society thesis, RFID is implemented for its perceived contribution to greater security, understood at several levels but is simultaneously feared for its grandeur of capabilities.  This critical analysis of RF technologies explores the current understanding of RFID: what the perception is, how the perception was built, and what sustains it, while pointing both to the propensity of RFID to alter time-space patterns and extend surveillance but also to the ways in which both proponents and opponents of RFID may exaggerate this contribution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The problem of parameter and state estimation of a class of nonlinear systems is addressed. An adaptive identifier and observer are used to estimate the parameters and the state variables simultaneously. The proposed method is derived using a new formulation.  Uncertainty sets are defined for the parameters and a set of auxiliary variables for the state variables. An algorithm is developed to update these sets using the available information. The algorithm proposed guarantees the convergence of parameters and the state variables to their true value. In addition to its application in difficult estimation problems, the algorithm has also been adapted to handle fault detection problems. The technique of estimation is applied to two broad classes of systems. The first involves a class of continuous time nonlinear systems subject to bounded unknown exogenous disturbance with constant parameters. Using the proposed set-based adaptive estimation, the parameters are updated only when an improvement in the precision of the parameter estimates can be guaranteed. The formulation provides robustness to parameter estimation error and bounded disturbance. The parameter&#xD;
uncertainty set and the uncertainty associated with an auxiliary variable is updated such that the set is guaranteed to contain the unknown true values.&#xD;
The second class of system considered is a class of nonlinear systems with timevarying&#xD;
parameters. Using a generalization of the set-based adaptive estimation technique proposed, the estimates of the parameters and state are updated to guarantee convergence to a neighborhood of their true value. The algorithm proposed can also be extended to detect the fault in the system, injected by drastic change in the time-varying parameter values. To study the practical applicability of the developed method, the estimation of state variables and time-varying parameters of salt in a stirred tank process has been performed. The results of the experimental application demonstrate the ability of the proposed techniques to estimate the state variables and time-varying parameters of an uncertain practical system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Dementia leads to progressive cognitive and functional decline.  Population aging is a concern, and the healthcare system must refocus its limited resources to keep up with service demands.  Three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) – donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine – have been approved for the treatment of dementia and are covered under Ontario’s formulary plan, but there has been little research regarding their economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: The purpose of this study was to describe the patterns of use of ChEIs, and to assess associated health resource utilization and costs to Ontario’s healthcare system.  Anonymized patient-level data from seven provincial administrative databases were linked at the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences at Queen’s University.  First-time users of ChEIs aged 66 years and older were identified between April 1st, 2004 and March 31st, 2009, and were followed until treatment discontinuation or up to one year following their index date.  Health resource use was classified into six care categories: prescription drugs, physicians, long-term care, home care nursing, emergency department, and hospitalizations.  Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and linear regression were employed to compare resource use between users of the three ChEIs.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Results: In the cohort (N=40,057), the majority were prescribed donepezil (n=24,347), were female (60.5%) and had at least one other co-morbid disease.  The odds of discontinuation were 1.47 (1.36, 1.60) and 1.26 (1.17, 136), higher for rivastigmine users than galantamine and donepezil users, respectively.  Between 2005 and 2008, overall healthcare costs increased from $95.2 million to $106.1 million.  Prescription drugs comprised 33% of all healthcare costs.  ChEIs accounted for half of all prescription drug costs.  Overall mean annual healthcare system cost per patient was $12,679.47 ($12,510.86, $12,848.08).  Predictors of overall healthcare costs included long-term care, co-morbidity status, hospitalization and hip fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Prescription drugs account for a substantial proportion of healthcare costs for patients with dementia, and the amount attributable to ChEIs alone is significant.  Knowing the health service utilization patterns for dementia patients can help healthcare professionals and decision-makers plan patient care and timely resource allocation.  The results stress the utility of administrative databases and the need for further research for this disease.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accurate registration of 3D data  is one of the most challenging problems in a number of Computer Vision applications.&#xD;
Visual Odometry is one such application, which determines the motion, or change in position of a moving rover by registering 3D data captured by an on-board range&#xD;
sensor, in a pairwise manner. The performance of Visual Odometry  depends upon two main factors, the first being the quality of 3D data, which itself depends upon the type of sensor being used. The second factor is the robustness of the registration algorithm. Where sensors like stereo cameras and LIDAR scanners have been used in the past to  improve the performance of Visual Odometry, the introduction of &#xD;
 the Velodyne LIDAR scanner is fairly new and has been less investigated, particularly for odometry applications. &#xD;
&#xD;
	&#xD;
This thesis presents and examines a new method for registering 3D point clouds generated  by a Velodyne scanner mounted on a moving rover. The method is based on one of the the most widely used registration algorithms called Iterative Closest Point (ICP).   The proposed method is divided into two steps. The first step, which is also the main contribution of this work, is the introduction of a new point sampling method, which prudently select points that belong to the regions of greatest geometric variance in the scan. Interest Point (Region) Sampling plays an important role in the performance of  ICP by effectively discounting the regions with non-uniform resolution and selecting regions with a high geometric variance and uniform resolution. Second step is to use sampled scan pairs as the input to  a new plane-to-plane variant of ICP, known as Generalized ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
	&#xD;
Several experiments  have been executed to test the compatibility and robustness of Interest Point Sampling (IPS) for a variety of terrain landscapes. Through these experiments, which include comparisons of  variants of  ICP and past sampling methods, this work demonstrates that the combination of IPS and GICP  results in the least localization error as compared to all other tested method.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The primary aim of this thesis is to advance economics' understanding of the organization of political parties, for the purpose of explaining the policy choices that result from collective decision procedures. Motivating this inquiry is the benign neglect that the political party as an organization has long suffered from in economics, in a manner that mirrors depictions of the firm in early neoclassical analysis. &#xD;

Accordingly, this thesis first considers the question of the relative influence of different contributors to the political parties' electoral activities, i.e. special-interest groups contributing money and individual party activists volunteering their time, on their choice of policy platforms. It is found that the presence of activists induces parties to offer differentiated policy platforms, even in the presence of a special-interest group whose contributions are perfectly substitutable with those of activists. Concurrently, the special interest's influence is to bias the parties' platforms towards its preferred policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, the internal dynamics of parties organized into factions sharing common goals are investigated. It is studied how they affect the party leader's choice of policies while in office and her accountability to voters, through the threat of her removal from the party's helm. While occasionally acting as a distortion on the election mechanism's effectiveness for keeping politicians accountable, the presence of the politician's party is accountability-enhancing especially in the presence of other distortions. This contributes to a second-best theory of politics.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis' secondary aim is to contribute to restoring the use of moral and ethical concerns in normative analysis and political economy. This is warranted by the fact that moral and ethical motives matter more in such contexts than in most market transactions, where rational self-interested behaviour largely prevails. &#xD;
&#xD;
This objective is primarily represented in this thesis' study of normative analysis as conditioned on a societal consensus. This study asks how redistributive policies are to be optimally-chosen when the extent of societal co-operation regarding work participation depends on a social norm. Its main finding is that constraining the social planner's choices on the extent of societal cohesion restricts the scope of redistribution compared with an unconstrained social planner.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Driven by the limitations of solar-optimized roof space and International Energy Association (IEA) Task 35, there is a renewed interest in photovoltaic solar thermal (PVT) hybrid systems. Current PVT systems focus on cooling the solar photovoltaic (PV) cells to improve the electrical performance. This however, causes the thermal component (T) to underperform. An exergetic study was completed comparing a PVT, PV + T and a PV only system in Detroit, Denver and Phoenix. It was found that the PVT system outperformed the PV + T system by 72% for each location and by 8, 8.6 and 9.9% for Detroit, Denver and Phoenix when compared to the PV only system. To further improve the PVT system, using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) PV as the absorber layer of the solar thermal device was explored. The temperature coefficient and annealing properties of a-Si:H allow the thermal component to run more efficiently, while enabling the a-Si:H i-layers to be thicker resulting in more electricity production. It was found that running i-layer thicker cells (630nm and 840nm) stabilized at higher efficiencies at 90°C (potential PVT operating temperatures) than the thinner cell (420nm) by 2% and 0.5% respectively. In addition, spike annealing, which is a new concept of stagnating a PVT system to allow for the a-Si:H PV to anneal and return it to its original efficiencies was also investigated. It was found that over the lifetime of the system with the spike annealing occurring once a day 10.6% more electricity was produced than a system without stagnation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Increasing power density of switch mode power supplies, by increasing their switching frequency has becoming a challenging obstacle for EMI mitigation. The passive EMI suppression technique has always been the primary solution to fulfill the EMC requirement in terms of conducted emission limits. However, the call for stringent power supplies specifications renders the passive techniques less desirable, due to their increasing size and power losses. In other words, the greater the power density of the converter, the bigger the passive filter. Other suppression techniques such as the spread spectrum frequency modulation (SSFM), and soft switching, prove to have less performance and much complex to implement. The active analog EMI filters provide the basic noise suppression technique; however, their performance is dramatically impeded at higher frequency. This solution requires an additional small size passive filter to complete the EMC spectrum for conducted emissions.&#xD;
Digital active filtering techniques offer advantages of flexibility, fewer external components and reduced overall size and power losses as compared to conventional passive filtering techniques.&#xD;
In this thesis DSP-based and FPGA-based EMI control techniques to mitigate the conducted emissions of switch mode power converters are proposed. These techniques are implemented in-lieu of the passive filtering techniques, by keeping equal or better performance. Moreover, these solutions can be configured as a stand-alone or integrated into the converter digital controller algorithm.&#xD;
Finally, the proposed solutions are implemented into three types of power converters, namely, a AC-DC power factor corrected converter, DC-AC micro-inverter for Photovoltaic application, and DC-DC for Electric Vehicle (EV) battery charger. Analytical, simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the proposed solutions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For pairing-based cryptographic protocols to be both efficient and secure, the underlying genus 2 curves defined over finite fields used must satisfy pairing-friendly conditions, and have small rho-value, which are not likely to be satisfied with random curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we study two specific families of  genus 2 curves defined over finite fields whose Jacobians do not split over the ground fields into a product of elliptic curves, but geometrically split over an extension of the ground field of prescribed degree n=3, 4, or 6. These curves were also studied extensively recently by Kawazoe and Takahashi in 2008, and by Freeman and Satoh in 2009 in their searches of pairing-friendly curves. &#xD;
&#xD;
We present a new method for constructing and identifying suitable curves in these two families which satisfy the pairing-friendly conditions and have rho-values around 4. The computational results of the rho-values obtained in this thesis are consistent with those found by Freeman and Satoh in 2009. An extension of our new method has led to a cryptographic example of a pairing-friendly curve in one of the two families which has rho-value 2.969, and it is the lowest rho-value ever recorded for curves of this type. Our method is different from the method proposed by Freeman and Satoh, since we can prescribe the minimal degree n =3,4 or 6  extension of the ground fields which the Jacobians of the curves split over.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Developing an optimized growth environment for adipose-derived stems cells (ASCs) to obtain clinically useable cell quantities from relatively small tissue biopsies would significantly impact the field of tissue engineering. To date, ASCs have been differentiated into adipose, bone, cartilage, smooth muscle, endothelial, skeletal muscle, nervous, and cardiac tissue. Therefore, ASCs have potential for use in the treatment of a wide variety of clinical conditions ranging from myocardial infarction, to musculoskeletal disorders, and the repair of soft tissue defects. &#xD;
In this work, a custom-designed, 3-dimensional (3-D) scaffold-based perfusion bioreactor system was investigated in the culture of ASCs. Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) was used to provide a 3-dimensional scaffold, as it possesses the native extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture and composition of human adipose tissue. The DAT had a permeability of 149 m2, based on a perfusion rate of 1.5 mL/min over a 200 mg DAT sample, and the culturing medium was evenly perfused throughout the DAT, thereby permitting possible cell growth within the central regions. Initial culturing studies of human ASCs on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) demonstrated that hypoxic (5% O2) conditions decreased the doubling time, and resulted in enhanced cell proliferation, as compared to normoxic (21% O2) conditions. &#xD;
The cell imaging and DNA quantification results showed that suspension seeding of the ASCs permitted cell attachment to the DAT scaffold, but did not support long-term ASC growth. In contrast, when the ASCs were seeded as multicellular aggregates, the cells attached and underwent measurable proliferation. The optimal seeding density observed was 1 x 106 ASCs/scaffold; or 50 aggregates (20,000 ASCs/aggregate) per scaffold. Based on the confocal imaging, the ASCs remained spherical in morphology during the entire culturing period. Moreover, results illustrated that the perfusion bioreactor provided an improved culturing environment for ASCs over traditional static culturing. Hypoxic (5% O2) conditions showed improved proliferation over normoxic (21% O2) conditions, within the bioreactor system. After a 14-day hypoxic culturing period in the perfusion bioreactor, the seeded ASCs retained the ability to undergo adipogenesis, as indicated by Glycerol-3-Phsophate Dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzymatic activity measurements, demonstrating the promise of this approach for soft tissue engineering applications</dcterms:abstract>

In solution, py(mi)ridinols 1.33, 1.34 and 1.35 are 2-, 5- and 28-fold more reactive antioxidants, respectively, than α-TOH (the most potent lipid-soluble antioxidant in nature). In order to develop a highly-reactive fluorescent indicator of lipid peroxidation in cells, we sought to couple these antioxidants with boron-dipyrro- methene (BODIPY) dyes, such that the resulting conjugates will display a significant fluorecence enhancement upon oxidation. This chapter details efforts towards the synthesis of these compounds.&#xD;

Lipoxygenases are a family of important enzymes that catalyze the dioxygenation of arachidonic acid to yield a variety of potent lipid mediators that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous degenerative conditions. We have undertaken a preliminary study of the effect of replacing the unsaturation in the related polyunsaturated lipid linoleic acid with cyclopropane rings on both the oxidizability of the lipid, as well as lipoxygenase’s ability to utilize it as a substrate. We anticipate that these analogs will be useful in co-crystallization studies with the enzyme that will provide unique insight into substrate acquisition, binding and the necessary conformation for catalysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arguably, all Canadian students should have a profound knowledge of Aboriginal peoples’ contribution to Canada’s development as the original inhabitants of Canada. However, Aboriginal peoples continue to be marginalized as though unimportant, and subordinate to other cultural groups in Canada’s culturally plural society. The Ontario mainstream education system plays an important role in perpetuating these social distances. Under the mandate of the provincial government, the public education system is responsible for the delivery of educational programming to all Ontario students. &#xD;
In the 1970s, the federal government introduced the concept of multiculturalism to extend citizenship rights to all culturally diverse groups into Canadian society. To help Canada to become more competitive in a globalizing world, the government has sought to change the image of Canada as a White settler state to one of a global and multicultural society. Yet Aboriginal peoples continue to be marginalized in Canada’s socio-cultural landscape in mainstream education, regardless of heightened awareness for their rights and culture, as well as their being recognized as having the fastest growing demographic in Canada. It is in the context of multiculturalism that this thesis examines the influence of multiculturalism on Aboriginal coverage in mainstream school textbooks. &#xD;
Despite Canada’s proclaimed commitment to multiculturalism, I argue that the production of educational curricula and texts still produces a national imaginary that erases the experiences and concerns of Aboriginal population. Far less effort has been made to change the image of Aboriginal people in that narrative, and how students imagine a globalizing Canada with little attention given to the ongoing forms of discrimination that affect how Aboriginal peoples interact with the rest of the world.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cognitive radio (CR) is a class of wireless communication technologies that have the ability to learn from the surrounding radio environment and the intelligence to adapt communication resources to enhance quality of service. The problem of acquiring information from a CR's radio environment is called spectrum sensing, which can take on many forms. In particular, this thesis concerns the determination of whether a spectrum band (or channel) is in a busy or idle state. The binary nature of a channels availability means that spectrum sensing can be cast as a hypothesis testing problem. While an abundant literature exists on spectrum sensing as a signal detection problem, this thesis treats spectrum sensing differently, and features the following elements: 1) the system is equipped with an arbitrary number of sensors; 2) sensing is performed over multiple channels; 3) each channels availability is modelled by random periods of busy and idle times corresponding to packet transmission; and 4) the optimization criteria minimizes detection delay subject to a reliability constraint.&#xD;
A related spectrum sensing problem formulation based on the use of a single sensor has been proposed in the recent literature. The previous research employs an optimization framework based on modeling channel uses as an on-off process via partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This thesis generalizes previous results from single-sensor to multiple-sensor spectrum sensing, i.e., detecting idle periods with multiple sensors. In addition, an alternative reduced-complexity algorithm is proposed. For both proposed detectors, the performances are evaluated based on Monte Carlo simulation with calculated confidence intervals, and the results show that 1) adding sensors generally improves the system performance by reducing detection delay (improved agility); 2) the application of previously existing quickest detection methods result in error floors complicating test design. Finally, performance assessment using a channel model derived experimentally from the wireless local area network (WLAN) traffic is conducted and compared to that obtained using a geometrically-distributed channel traffic model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Approximately 20,000 tonnes of arsenic (As)-bearing emissions from roasting&#xD;
arsenopyrite ore were aerially released from 1949-1999 at Giant Mine, located outside&#xD;
Yellowknife, NT. As part of the process used to free refractory gold (Au) from arsenopyrite (FeAsS), roasting created As-bearing roaster off-gases that condensed into As2O3, one of the most toxic As compounds to humans. Roaster emissions also contained some As-bearing iron (Fe)- oxides. Arsenic emission controls were first implemented in 1951, and by the time the emission control process was completely refined in 1963, 86% of the total aerial As emissions at Giant had been released into the surrounding area. The continued presence of roaster-derived As2O3 in surface soils at Giant has been previously documented despite its theoretical instability in oxidizing surface environments. Wrye (2008) found As concentrations in roaster-affected soils&#xD;
occurring on rock outcrop (covering ~30% of the Giant property) greater than in many other surface soils; most outcrop soils were not considered when delineating areas of contaminated material for future removal in the Giant Mine Remediation Plan (currently undergoing environmental assessment).&#xD;
To investigate roaster-derived As  persistence, outcrop soils and soil pore waters were analyzed. Comparing proportions of As, Sb, and Au concentrations in soil samples and historic As2O3-rich dust captured by emission controls show that most of the roaster-derived As in soils at&#xD;
Giant was likely deposited before 1964. Thin section examination has shown that while the vast majority of discrete As hosts in soils are As2O3, textural relationships and  certain secondary As hosts in soils indicate that As2O3 is not static in surface soils and could be transforming over time, albeit very slowly. Bulk chemical relationships among As, antimony (Sb), and carbon support&#xD;
this. Topographic restriction by rock outcrops and dry, cold climate probably play a large role in elevated As concentrations and As2O3 persistence in outcrop soils. In light of possible future human exposure, As bioaccessibility from three adjacent samples was determined for synthetic human gastric (34%) and lung (18%) fluids.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>How can mixed-use development be used as a tool of cross-subsidization, allowing for the creation of office space in Metro Vancouver suburban town centres where it would not otherwise be economically viable?  The central hypothesis explored in this report is that mixed-use development, focused primarily on residential uses, allows for office space to be 'carried' or subsidized on the development pro forma, making development of office space viable where it would not otherwise be so.  Pro forma financial analysis is conducted for a single development site in Port Moody, British Columbia.  Semi-structured interviews are used to gather data for the financial analysis and to test the analytical generalizability of case study findings to other areas of Port Moody and municipalities beyond.  Case study findings indicate that, provided there is sufficient residential space within the project to make the overall project viable, office space can be included in the project and offered at rents congruent with what the market can pay. Residential end-users subsidize the office component.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3, Stat3, has been associated with cytokine-induced proliferation, anti-apoptosis and neoplastic transformation, while constitutively active Stat3 has been found in many human tumors. Stat3 activation by the Src oncoprotein leads to specific gene regulation and the Stat3 mediated signaling pathway is one of the critical signaling pathways involved in Src oncogenesis. Our laboratory demonstrated that engagement of cadherins, which are a class of cell-cell adhesion molecules, can activate Stat3, even in the absence of direct cell to cell contact. Interestingly, a significant increase in total Rac1 and Cdc42 protein levels triggered by cadherin engagement, and an increase in Rac1 and Cdc42 activity, which led to Stat3 activation by a mechanism involving gp130, a common subunit of the IL-6 family of cytokines, was also observed. To investigate the role of gp130 in vSrc transformation, we knocked down gp130 in vSrc transformed cells and found a decrease in the levels of phosphorylated Stat3, the rate of cell migration, rate of cell proliferation and the anchorage-independent growth.&#xD;
      It was also previously demonstrated that vSrc had a negative effect on the function of cadherins. Surprisingly, however, despite the fact that vSrc may reduce cadherin adhesion, previous results in our lab showed that cell density still caused a significant increase in Stat3 activity in vSrc transformed cells. Moreover, Stat3 downregulation induced apoptosis in transformed cells which was more pronounced at high cell densities. This may reflect an increased need for Stat3 activity at high densities, possibly to overcome apoptosis, which raised the question of the actual role of cadherins in the density-mediated activation of Stat3 in such cells. &#xD;
      The expression of cadherin-11, a type II cell adhesion molecule, is associated with invasive breast cancer and many studies suggest that it may play a significant role in facilitating tumor cell invasion and the formation of metastatic tumors. Since Src and its family members participate in many aspects of tumor progression and metastasis, it was interesting to see if Src needed cadherin-11 for neoplastic transformation. To this effect, when we knocked down cadherin-11 in Balb/c3T3 cells, we observed a significant reduction in levels of phosphorylated Stat3-ptyr705 which was also observed when vSrc was expressed in them. Moreover, expressing vSrc in cells in which cadherin-11 was knocked down also decreased the anchorage –independent growth and increased apoptosis indicating that cadherin-11 is needed for transformation and survival respectively, in vSrc transformed cells. &#xD;
     Our results thus demonstrate that cadherin-11 may be a good target for the selective elimination of cells expressing Src and presumably other oncogenes as well. Stat3 activation by cadherins is so potent and important that tumor cell death can be enhanced by cadherin inhibition. In our experiments, the inhibition of cadherin-11 induced apoptosis in Src expressing cells, while the normal cells were not affected. Elucidation of the functions and regulation of cadherin-11 may enhance our understanding of the roles of cadherins in invasive cancer and may provide future targets for therapy. Through our work, the cadherin/IL-6 pathway may emerge as a crucial Stat3 activator in vSrc expressing cells.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Medical simulators have become commonly used to teach new procedures to medical students and clinicians. Their accessibility allows trainees to perform training whenever they desire, and their flexibility allows for various patient body types and conditions to be simulated. This is in contrast to {\it in-vivo} training, which requires direct supervision from a trained clinician, and access to a live patient or cadaver, both of which have restrictions.&#xD;
This thesis proposes a novel prototype system for spinal anesthesia procedures which combines the use of both a haptic device for virtual, ultrasound-guided (US) needle simulations, and a physical mannequin registered to a patient specific computed tomography (CT) volume in order to create an augmented reality (AR) overlay. The mannequin will provide the user with a greater sense of spatial awareness that is not present in a purely virtual simulation, as well as providing physical visual clues to navigate the patient. Another novel aspect is the simulation of US images from CT images deformed via a finite element model (FEM).&#xD;
The system is composed of a torso mannequin from Sawbones Inc., a MicronTracker2 optical tracking system from Claron Technology, a Sensable PHANToM Premium 1.5A haptic device and a graphical user interface (GUI) to display relevant visual feedback. The GUI allows the user to view the AR overlaid on the video feed, and the CT slice and simulated US image based the position/orientation of a dummy US probe. &#xD;
Forces during the insertion are created via the FEM and sent to the haptic device. These forces include force from needle tip insertion, friction along the length of the needle inside the body, and from displacing the needle off its original insertion axis. Input to the system consists of a patient CT volume.&#xD;
The system is able to create forces that closely match those reported in the literature. A user study consisting of subjects with expertise ranging from familiarity with medical imaging to clinical experience with needle insertion procedures, was performed to qualitatively analyze the performance of the system. Three experienced physicians were also consulted for input and improvements. The feedback received from the questionnaire, and comments from the subjects and physicians, showed the system is able to simulate a real needle insertion quite well, and the graphical aids added were helpful during the training procedure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The existing literature in marketing and consumer behavior tends to adopt a somewhat static view of membership and belonging, focusing on the status uncertainty that surrounds new group aspirants. In the literature, the portrayal of becoming a member is one of a logical step-by-step process as members move toward the top of the social hierarchy and secure status. An underlying assumption of this process is that once an individual secures membership through status, that individual is no longer uncertain about their membership or belonging. This thesis presents an alternative to this static step-by-step view and introduces the idea of the belonging paradox.&#xD;
  A belonging paradox is a recursive cycle of an unsolvable duality of simultaneous inclusion and exclusion that can result from idiosyncratic factors such as gender, race, disability or self-doubt. This thesis also develops a new conceptual framework or perspective on the concept of belonging by integrating Uncertainty-Identity Theory, Self-Verification Theory and Symbolic Self-Completion Theory into a more dynamic and fluid understanding about the nature of belonging. Through the introduction of the belonging paradox and the new conceptual framework of belonging, a more comprehensive understanding of belonging emerges. Specifically, the belonging paradox suggests that beyond the initial stages of striving for group membership, uncertainty of belonging can continue to be a pervasive, continuous struggle even for committed hardcore group members.&#xD;
  Through an analysis of the skateboarding subculture, this thesis illustrates how members continuously construct and shape their own belonging experience within groups. It also demonstrates the different ways members use consumption to try to cope with the duality and constant tension of the belonging paradox as well as explores the link between uncertainty and the ability to play with identities. This leads to a number of theoretical and managerial contributions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over-the-air reprogramming is an important aspect of managing large wireless sensor networks. However, reprogramming deployed sensor networks poses significant challenges due to the energy, processing power and memory limitation of sensor nodes. For improved energy efficiency, a reprogramming mechanism should use less transmission and flash writing overhead. Past research has proposed different mechanisms for reprogramming deployed sensor networks. However, all of these mechanisms produce large patches if software modifications involve changing program layouts and shifting global variables. In addition, existing mechanisms use large amounts of external flash and rewrite entire internal flash. In this thesis, we present a differential reprogramming mechanism called QDiff that mitigates the effects of program layout modifications and retains maximum similarity between old and new software using a clone detection mechanism. Moreover, QDiff organizes the global variables in a novel way that eliminates the effect of variable shifting. Our experiments show that QDiff requires near-zero external flash, and significantly lower internal flash rewriting and transmission overhead than leading existing differential reprogramming mechanisms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>MRPs mediate the ATP-dependent efflux of a structurally diverse array of compounds. Certain MRPs, including MRP1, MRP2 and MRP4, are involved in multidrug resistance in tumour cells, while in non-malignant cells these MRPs can influence the distribution and/or elimination of many clinically important drugs. In addition, these MRPs mediate the efflux of physiological metabolites, many of which are conjugated organic anions. Modulation of the drug transporting activity of MRP1 (and to a lesser extent MRP2 and MRP4) has been a long sought after therapeutic objective. In this study, the modulatory abilities of five structurally distinct classes (I-V) of chalcogenopyrylium dyes (CGPs) were examined utilizing an in vitro assay which measures inhibition of radiolabeled estradiol glucuronide ([3H]E217βG) (a prototypical MRP substrate) uptake into inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from MRP-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Additionally, some CGPs were tested in a calcein efflux assay using intact MRP1-transfected HEK cells. Sixteen of 34 CGPs initially tested at a single concentration (≤30 μM) inhibited MRP1-mediated uptake by &gt;50%, with IC50’s ranging from 0.7-7.6 μM. Of the 9 CGPs with IC50’s ≤2 μM, five belonged to Class I, two to Class II, and two to Class IV. When tested in the calcein efflux assay, only 4 of 16 CGPs inhibited MRP1-mediated cellular efflux by &gt;50% (I-3, -4, -6, IV-1) while a fifth (II-5) inhibited efflux by 23%. These five CGPs were then tested as modulators of [3H]E217βG uptake by MRP2 and MRP4. Their effects on MRP2 transport activity were differential with two (I-4, I-6) inhibiting transport (IC50’s 2.0, 7.1 μM), two (I-3, IV-1) stimulating transport (&gt;2-fold), while II-5 had no effect. On the other hand, all five CGPs inhibited [3H]E217βG uptake by MRP4, but less effectively than by MRP1. Finally, five analogs of CGP IV-1 were tested for their effects on MRP1, MRP2 and MRP4 [3H]E217βG uptake, but none were more efficacious than CGP IV-1. The CGPs tested here represent novel MRP1, MRP2 and MRP4 modulators with variable effects on transport activities. These CGPs may represent a new avenue for the development of clinically applicable modulators of MRP proteins involved in multidrug resistance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the last few years, web-based attacks have caused significant harm to users. Many of these attacks occur through the exploitations of common security vulnerabilities in web-based programs. Given that, mitigation of these attacks is extremely crucial to reduce some of the harmful consequences. Web-based applications contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers at a client-side (browser) without the victim’s (browser user’s) knowledge. This thesis is intended to mitigate some exploitations due to the presence of security vulnerabilities in web applications while performing seemingly benign functionalities at the client-side. For example, visiting a webpage might result in JavaScript code execution (cross-site scripting), downloading a file might lead to the execution of JavaScript code (content sniffing), clicking on a hyperlink might result in sending unwanted legitimate requests to a trusted website (cross-site request forgery), and filling out a seemingly legitimate form may eventually lead to stealing of credential information (phishing). Existing web-based attack detection approaches suffer from several limitations such as (i) modification of both server and client-side environments, (ii) exchange of sensitive information between the server and client, and (iii) lack of detection of some attack types. This thesis addresses these limitations by mitigating four security vulnerabilities in web applications: cross-site scripting, content sniffing, cross-site request forgery, and phishing. We mitigate the exploitations of these vulnerabilities by developing automatic attack detection approaches at both server and client-sides. We develop server-side attack detection frameworks to detect attack symptoms within response pages before sending them to the client. The approaches are designed based on the assumption that the server-side program source is available for analysis, but we are not allowed to alter the program code and the runtime environments. Moreover, we develop client-side attack detection frameworks so that some level of protection is present when the source code of server websites (either trusted or untrusted) is not available. Our proposed solutions explore several techniques such as response page parsing and file content analysis, browser-level checking of requests and responses, and finite state machine-based behavior monitoring. The thesis evaluates the proposed attack detection approaches with real-world vulnerable programs. The evaluation results indicate that our approaches are effective and perform better than the related work. We also contribute to the development of benchmark suites for evaluating attack detection techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Health Canada recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months postpartum with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years and beyond. While 88% of Canadian mothers initiate breastfeeding, only 70% of mothers continue to do so at 4 weeks postpartum and only 14% are exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months. Breastfeeding self-efficacy is a potentially modifiable variable that has been associated with mothers’ breastfeeding practices. The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (Short-Form) is an instrument that could potentially identify women with low breastfeeding self-efficacy during the in hospital period. &#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose: To describe the breastfeeding practices of new mothers in the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox &amp; Addington area and to assess the association between in-hospital scores on the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (Short-Form) and duration of breastfeeding. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of a dataset from the 2008 Infant Feeding Survey, a prospective study of 463 mothers with 12-month longitudinal follow-up. Data were weighted according to the maternal age distribution of the general population of new mothers. Breastfeeding practices were described using Kaplan-Meier survival distributions. Four outcomes were described: ‘exclusive breastfeeding from birth’, ‘exclusive breastfeeding from discharge’, ‘high breastfeeding’, and ‘any breastfeeding’. Using logistic regression, scores from the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (Short-Form) were assessed for association with duration of ‘exclusive breastfeeding from birth’ and duration of ‘any breastfeeding’ (dichotomized as ‘less than 6 weeks’ and ‘6 weeks or beyond’). &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The sample was highly educated (75% had post-secondary education) and reported high levels of household income (37% reported &gt;$80,000/year). Six percent of mothers exclusively breastfed to 6 months. Close to one quarter (24%) of women sustained some extent of breastfeeding for 12 months. The relationship between scores on the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (Short-Form) and duration of ‘exclusive breastfeeding from birth’ and the relationship between self-efficacy scores and duration of ‘any breastfeeding’ were identical (OR = 1.05) and non-significant (95% CI 1.0-1.1). &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: This study did not show a significant relationship between in-hospital scores on the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (Short-Form) and duration of breastfeeding. Given the high socioeconomic status of women in this study, further studies are warranted to confirm these results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bridge expansion joints are directly subjected to traffic load, and thus prone to premature fatigue failure. Replacement of components such as modular bridge expansion joints is typically done in a staggered schedule to minimize traffic blockage. Field splices are used to connect the successively installed segments. These splices typically include a combination of field welding or bolting, and experience has shown that they often fail due to fatigue cracking. &#xD;
This thesis reports the investigation of hybrid FRP/steel splice details that avoid the use of field welding. &#xD;
Two configurations have been examined: A GFRP pultruded square tube section, adhesively bonded to the soffit of the spliced beam, consists the moment resisting component in one configuration, whereas the other takes advantage of two series of FRP plates for this purpose. Bolted steel plates splice the beam through web in both cases. The behaviour of these details has been studied extensively under vertical static loads. The effect of several parameters including bond length, FRP end shape, bond surface treatment, adhesive, etc. for each detail has been investigated. A three-dimensional, non-linear finite element model has been developed for each detail and validated using the experimental results. &#xD;
The bond strength of two adhesives was investigated experimentally using double shear lap splice tests. &#xD;
A new method is proposed to analyze the strength of the splice details. This method is based on the results obtained from shear lap splice tests and the verified finite element model developed for the splice detail. The finite element model could thus be used for further parametric studies. More experiments, however, are statistically required before using this model with confidence.&#xD;
The fatigue behaviour of one of the promising splice details has been investigated both experimentally and numerically. A special fatigue test set-up has been designed and used successfully for this purpose. Two fatigue tests to 1,000,000 cycles were run. One failed at 719, 347 cycles and the other survived 1,000,000 cycles. The predicted fatigue life as per the developed model was 871,840 cycles. More experiments are required to understand the fatigue behaviour of the splice detail under various stress ranges.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis argues that the environmental undertones of artists Edward Burtynsky’s and Olafur Eliasson’s work have clearly aligned them; however, the focus of my study is not an evaluation of the artists’ abilities to express environmental concerns, but rather an exploration of the effects of their representations on our understanding of the surrounding environment, and of the artists’ contributions toward a definition of Nature that now includes its own demise as a site of aesthetic pleasure. &#xD;
This study focuses on Olafur Eliasson’s New York City Waterfalls and on Edward Burtynsky’s Nickel Tailings photographs. Burtynsky’s Nickel Tailings photographs, among them in particular, his well known Nickel Tailings No. 34, depict a barren grey and black landscape centered primarily around an intensely coloured red and orange river of molten metal. Eliasson’s recent New York City Waterfalls consists of four artist-constructed waterfalls, ranging from 90 to 120 feet tall, located within the waters of Lower Manhattan, Governs Island, and beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. &#xD;
In his monumental New York City Waterfalls, Eliasson has made an intervention into the landscape that effectively works to contaminate the established aesthetic upon which it is based. In his monumental photographs, in contrast, Burtynsky does the opposite; he aestheticizes the contaminated. Here I would add that both artists have carefully called upon the elemental in order to reference the idea of wilderness or a “pure” form of Nature. Reference to the elemental in Nature—to air, water, and fire— has allowed these artists to challenge the viewer’s perception and experience of the nonhuman world. These manufactured landscapes are undeniably owned by humanity, yet is this the type of landscape we are comfortable to claim as our own?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A simple model that includes energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the economics of machining is proposed, which has been published in the highly respected and cited journal, Annals of CIRP (International Academy for Production Engineering). This is a timely analysis in current government discussions on a proposed carbon tax or a carbon cap and trade regime and greater energy efficiency. &#xD;
The new cost model is based on life cycle analysis methodology for the initial part production. An illustrative example is given showing that the cheapest electrical grid should not be chosen, if it also has the highest CO2 emissions. Accurate pricing is important, because the more expensive product was highly dependent on the carbon price.&#xD;
A comprehensive review of machining economic models is covered. However, there is a dearth of actual machining data in the literature. This work includes studies in milling and single point incremental forming (SPIF) which can be used by other manufacturing engineers in their machining economic model development.&#xD;
The first milling study involved simple straight cuts. In general, as feed rate (FD) increased (increasing the material removal rate, MRR), the energy consumed decreased as process time decreased. In contrast, as spindle speed (N) increased, energy consumed increased, since more power is drawn by the motor, without a process time reduction. Given the inverse power relationship observed for the time, energy, process CO2 and cost against MRR, the recommended parameters were the same at the highest FD and lowest N permissible. In the second milling study with constant N for a more complex part (sprocket), similar relationships were observed. However, for sprockets made at constant chip load (allowing FD and N to change together), there were varying prescribed MRRs for time, energy, process CO2 and cost minimization.&#xD;
The SPIF studies showed a similar relationship to the constant N milling, and, that results for a simple part can be extrapolated to improve efficiency in more complex parts. &#xD;
Finally, although the energy and carbon costs represented a small contribution to the final cost, their significance increased for higher efficiency parameters or user conditions, e.g. low labour rate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Using a sediment budget approach, suspended sediment transport dynamics were studied over the 2010 summer runoff season in the 8 km2 West River catchment at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut.  Research was carried out in an effort to determine the longer term impacts and response of recent (2007-8) active layer detachments (ALD) on the river system.  In 2010, measured ALD inflows contributed 4.7% of the measured sediment yield, a decrease of 13.3% from 2007 when they initially formed.  This indicates that while they continue to supply sediment to the main river, the impact they have on sediment fluxes, and hence the sediment budget has diminished, with time.  Results from the sediment budget indicate that connectivity and the sediment delivery ratio within the system have also decreased with time.  Sediment budget analysis shows that in response to this additional sediment, the West River progressively stores more sediment throughout the season, storing as much as 85% of sediment inflows during baseflow.  Sediment was preferentially deposited within the channel, with coarser material deposited in the upper reaches, and finer material deposited in the lower reaches.  Similarly, the transported and stored sediment became progressively finer with time, indicating the importance that river competence and wetted perimeter have on sediment transport as the larger sediment was entrained earlier in the season under higher flow conditions when the sediment was accessible, and finer sediment transported later in the season due to decreased competence and reduced accessibility of sediment.  This sediment storage is expected to replenish sediment in the channel that is eroded during peak discharge in spring, and also dampens the effects that disturbances have on the sediment budget through storage.  Sediment stored in the channel towards the end of the season does not contribute to sediment yield and may prove to be an important source of sediment in future years under late summer rainfall events.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Extraction of metals from the seafloor has been considered for decades, beginning with manganese nodules in the 1970s.  Today, the targets are massive sulphide deposits rich in copper, zinc, gold, and silver that are associated with hydrothermal vents or black smoker chimneys that occur at divergent and convergent plate margins such as mid-ocean ridges and volcanic island arcs respectively.&#xD;
A recent objective of the mining industry is to develop industry practices that coincide with concepts of sustainability or sustainable development.  This objective, known by some as sustainable mining, has indeed become an essential part of the commissioning of any new project, regardless of geographical location.  While there has been much work on sustainable mining practice for terrestrial mining, these frameworks are not directly applicable to seafloor projects.  &#xD;
There are two problems facing the development of a seabed mining industry.  First, there is a regulatory vacuum when considering the mining of seabed deposits, leading to important policy issues.  Second, the economic, environmental, and social impacts of a seabed mining project are theoretical, and the real impacts are unknown.  Thus, the identification, characterization, and analysis of the sustainability issues facing a seabed mining project are essential steps.  To assist with performing these three steps, this thesis provides a process model based on the IDEF0 (Integration DEFinition) standard to assess seafloor massive sulphide mining projects from sustainable mining perspectives.  This adaptation of IDEF0 provides a clear, visual representation of a hierarchical framework that can be used to identify “go no-go” sustainability criteria to assist decision makers interested in the potential development of an ore body.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An improved steady-state method combining experiment and mathematical modelling has been developed to characterize the scalable convective heat transfer coefficient, hvol [W*m^(-3)*K^(-1)], of uncoated and catalyst-support coated aluminium foam monoliths. The values of hvol were recovered by parameter fitting its model values to experimental temperature data for steady-state air-cooled monoliths under a known heating flux. The model was built with experimentally recovered values of the monolith’s thermal conductivity and fluid permeability along with known values for other physical parameters. The volumetric heat transfer coefficients of 10, 20 and 40 pore-per-inch uncoated aluminium foams were determined to range between 2,700 and 20,000 W*m^(-3)*K^(-1) at channel Reynolds numbers between 85 and 1,700. The presence of a 76 micron thick anodized layer of catalyst support on monolith foams effected a small but significant reduction in the value of hvol. Coating with an anodized layer also reduced the permeabilities of the monoliths to air flow by 4-20%. Knowledge of the scalable parameter, hvol, was used to model a steady-state non-isothermal, non-isobaric heat-coupled methanol reformer. The model shows that changes to the convective transfer coefficient due to coating the monolith with catalyst support may have significant consequences for the thermal profile of the model reactor and for the product yield.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Elevated plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) are associated with increased risk of atherothrombotic disease. Lp(a) is a unique lipoprotein consisting of a low density lipoprotein-like moiety covalently linked to apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), a homologue of the fibrinolytic proenzyme plasminogen. Apo(a) is extremely heterogeneous in size with small isoforms being independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk. &#xD;
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Lp(a)/apo(a) can inhibit tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated plasminogen activation on fibrin surfaces, although the mechanism of inhibition by apo(a) remains controversial. Essential to fibrin clot lysis are a number of plasmin-dependent positive feedback reactions that enhance the efficiency of plasminogen activation, including the plasmin-mediated conversion of Glu1-plasminogen to Lys78-plasminogen. &#xD;
Additionally, abnormal fibrin clot structures have been associated with both an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a) levels. Similarly, oxidized phospholipids have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease, and are not only preferentially carried by Lp(a) in the plasma but have also been shown to covalently-modify both apo(a) and plasminogen.  &#xD;
In this thesis, we built upon the understanding of the role of apo(a) in plasminogen activation on the fibrin/degraded fibrin surface by determining that: (i) apo(a) inhibits plasmin-mediated Glu1-plasminogen to Lys78-plasminogen conversion and identifying the critical domains in apo(a) responsible for this effect, (ii) apo(a) isoform size does not affect either the inhibition of tPA-mediated plasminogen activation or the inhibition of plasmin-mediated Glu1-plasminogen to Lys78-plasminogen conversion, (iii) apo(a) modifies fibrin clot structure to form more dense clots with thinner fibers and reduced permeability, modifications that enhance the ability of apo(a) to inhibit tPA-mediated plasminogen activation and (iv) the phosphorus content of apo(a) affects its ability to inhibit tPA-mediated plasminogen activation and the phosphorus content of plasminogen affects its ability to be activated by tPA. &#xD;
By understanding these individual reactions, each of which has the potential to affect the broader fibrin clot lysis process, we have expanded our understanding of the overall effect of Lp(a)/apo(a) in the inhibition of plasminogen activation on the fibrin/degraded fibrin surface and thus broadened our understanding of how Lp(a)/apo(a) may mediate the inhibition of thrombolysis in vivo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mechanochemistry, the use of mechanical stress to activate chemical reactions, has emerged as a significant area of interest in recent years. Two theoretical approaches have been developed to simulate mechanochemical processes: COnstrained Geometries Simulate External Force (COGEF) and External Force is Explicitly Included (EFEI). In the COGEF method, mechanical stress is simulated by increasing the distance between atoms in a molecule that serve as pulling points (PPs) at a constant rate. In the EFEI methods, a constant external force (Fext) is applied between PPs, allowing the atoms to move to maintain that force. Both methods have been used in the literature to study the ring opening of cyclobutene under mechanochemical conditions. These studies have shown that applying a force between cis PPs in cyclobutene induces ring opening along the conrotatory pathway in COGEF-based simulations and ring opening along the disrotatory pathway in EFEI-based simulations. The latter is consistent with experiments. The work in this thesis identifies the origin of the differences in the outcomes obtained with these two methods, which may be of interest in the context of researchers selecting methods to simulate mechanochemical processes. The results demonstrate that the origin of the difference in behaviour is related to the manner in which these methods alter the potential energy surface (PES) through the application of a mechanical stress. Specifically, the PES obtained with the COGEF method does not contain a minimum energy pathway (MEP) linking cyclobutene to the disrotatory product, whereas the EFEI surface does contain such a path. The differences in PESs suggest that the EFEI method is more suitable to simulate mechanochemical processes. The EFEI approach was then used to examine how the electronic structure evolves to permit a formally forbidden disrotatory reaction to occur. The circumvention of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules was not due to a change in the electronic structure. Instead, the application of an external force shifts the transition state along the reaction coordinate towards the reactants, lowering the barrier for the reactions. The orbital effects that disfavor movement from reactants to products are rendered secondary to mechanochemical factors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
This research explores the relationship between stories from the land and character education, and examines how the land forms the characters of those who live with Her. Twenty-seven participants were chosen through the snowball, or chain sampling, method from three groups of people living roughly within the boundaries of Hastings County, Ontario. Three groups of people were included: those living on Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory; generational farmers, whose families had settled in this area; and relative newcomers who have come to the area as recently as twenty years ago and self-identified as coming here in order to be closer to the land. Ages varied, with the youngest participant being 30 years old and the eldest being 94. Each participant was asked to share a story from his or her experience of living with the land in this area. During personal visits, stories were conveyed through conversations between the participant and the researcher, and recorded using both audio and video equipment. After transcription, the stories were coded for evidence of character development and reflected upon using three lenses: Noddings (2003) circles of caring; Haig-Brown’s (2010) ways through which the land teaches us; and the traditional Ojibway story of the Seven Grandfather Teachings. This reflection process was guided by the notion of close reading of the transcripts, close listening to audio recordings for voice inflection and laughter, and close watching of video recordings for body language. Findings from the research revealed rich connections between the stories and the three lenses used. Every aspect of character development was evidenced in one or more stories. The stories affirmed that, as the elders have traditionally taught, the land moulds people. Those who live in the same area develop character in similar ways. There was no substantial difference shown between the character traits evident in the stories given by Mohawk people and those from the other two groups. Character traits identified were reflective of the skills necessarily developed to live and work on this land. Implications for the development of character education curriculum emerged from the consideration of the use of locally based stories within classrooms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In vivo production of medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (MCL-PHA) containing a side chain carboxyl group from azelaic acid (AzA), a nine-carbon α,ω-dicarboxylic acid, was investigated using Pseudomonas citronellolis DSM 50332 in a phosphate (P)-limited chemostat. Co-feeding with nonanoic acid (NA) and inhibition of β-oxidation with acrylic acid (AA) were strategies that were used to stimulate the incorporation of carboxylated monomers, but both were unsuccessful. P. citronellolis DSM50332 was capable of growing on AzA as a sole source of carbon and energy, indicating that enzymes in β-oxidation utilized AzA and its derivatives. However, the MCL-PHA produced from AzA comprised 3-hydroxyoctanoate (C8) and 3-hydroxydecanoate (C10) monomers, which was consistent with precursor supplied via the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. This evidence suggests that one or more of 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (FabG), enoyl-CoA hydratase (PhaJ) and PHA synthase (PhaC) of this organism do not have the low specificity required to utilize a carboxylated substrate. Future work involving mutations may broaden the substrate specificity of these key enzymes to overcome this obstacle.&#xD;
Two-stage high-cell density carbon (C)-limited chemostat cultivation of P. putida KT2440 was examined for MCL-PHA production from nonanoic acid (NA) at high intracellular polymer content and volumetric productivity. Growth conditions stimulating good PHA production were first established in single-stage chemostat, which yielded 63.1 wt% PHA containing 90 mol% C9 units and a productivity of 1.52 g L-1h-1 at a dilution rate of 0.30 h-1. This productivity was higher than any value reported in literature for continuous MCL-PHA production systems and comparable to the upper range of fed-batch results. Two-stage production yielded promising results, notably the increase in polymer content from the first to second stage. However, complications involving foaming and an unexplained decline in PHA content adversely affected system performance. The best PHA content and overall productivity were 58.5 wt% and 0.76 g L-1h-1, respectively. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate the potential to achieve high PHA content&#xD;
without the need for pure oxygen at high dilution rates, warranting further investigation focusing on the&#xD;
optimization of growth conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Emma Lake Artists’ Workshops from the 1950s to the 1970s were a series of professional workshops held in northern Saskatchewan, under the auspices of the University of Saskatchewan and Regina College, for the creation and advancement of a dynamic arts culture in the province and as a way for the individual artists there to overcome feelings of isolation from the Canadian cultural hubs.  Throughout the course of the Workshops provincial and federal attitudes, and cultural policies and perspectives on cultural nation building exerted an overarching influence in the shaping of the Workshops.  &#xD;
	The Workshops drew the attention and support of many established celebrity U.S. artists and it is due to their presence and influence at the Workshops that it is possible to examine the provincial and national response to perceived U.S. cultural imperialism.  The founding and maturity of the Workshops is a case study of the ways in which the politics of Canadian nationalism and the effects of U.S. cultural imperialism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries interacted to impact the growth and development of art communities across Canada.  The Workshops serve as an example of the effects, on a regional art movement, of Canada’s relationship with the United States, and Canadian response to the perceived threat of cultural imperialism from the U.S.  Because the Workshops were a microcosm of cultural production, involving artists who, aside from their participation at Emma Lake, were often fairly isolated from the ebb and flow of art currents inherent to larger cultural centers, the Workshops are also an important case study of the effects of national and provincial policy on the regional arts.  The Workshops’ history reveals that ideas of nationalism, regionalism and continentalism can come together to have a profound and unique effect on the development of an art community.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective and accurate surface measurements are important in many clinical disciplines. Non-irradiating and low cost alternatives are available but validation of these measurement tools for clinical application is variable and sparse. This thesis presents a three dimensional (3D) surface measurement method validated by gold standard Computed Tomography (CT). Forty-one 3D surface data sets were acquired by two modalities, a laser scanner and a binocular camera. The binocular camera was tested with three different texture modifiers that increased the colour variability of the imaged surface. A surface area calculation algorithm was created to process the data sets. Relative differences were calculated for each area measurement with respect to its corresponding CT measurement. The laser scanner data sets were affected by movement and specular reflection artefacts. The measurements were statistically equivalent to CT if less than 20% error were considered acceptable. The binocular camera with the slide projected texture modifier was shown to be statistically equivalent to CT gold standard with less than 5% error (p &lt; 0.0005). The surface area measurement method can easily be expanded and customized. By following the protocol outlined by the example in this work, researchers and clinicians would also be able to objectively asses other vision systems' performance and suitability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ecologists studying acid-damaged zooplankton communities have often documented a time lag in recovery following pH increases. While previous work has provided a solid understanding of the local factors that may delay recovery (e.g. competition), less is known about the role of dispersal. The work in this thesis was conducted to test the hypothesis that dispersal limitation contributes to delays in the recovery of acid-damaged zooplankton communities. To assess the role of dispersal during recovery I pursued three objectives: 1) To measure dispersal in the field and determine the relative importance of various dispersal vectors for contributing acid-sensitive colonists to lakes; 2) to determine if spatial structure in recovering zooplankton communities exists across the landscape independent of environmental gradients; and 3) to determine if an interaction between dispersal and local environmental variables could influence recovery. &#xD;
Data collected for Objective 1 demonstrated that overland dispersal rates for acid-sensitive species in Killarney Park were relatively low, but some species were found emerging from the diapausing egg bank or dispersing through streams to recovering lakes. Spatial modeling and variation partitioning analyses for Objective 2 revealed spatial patterns indicative of dispersal limitation in recovering Killarney Park zooplankton communities. Enclosure experiments conducted for Objective 3 suggested that the colonization of the acid-sensitive copepod Epischura lacustris may be influenced by an interaction between dispersal levels and pH, such that higher dispersal levels may be required for establishment in lakes that are early in the process of pH recovery. Enclosure experiments also indicated that community resistance and low dispersal levels might hinder the reestablishment of the acid-sensitive copepod Skistodiaptomus oregonensis. &#xD;
Taken together, my results strongly suggest that dispersal limitation could contribute to delays in zooplankton community recovery. The recovery of acid-sensitive copepod species may be particularly difficult, as their reestablishment in recovering lakes appears to be influenced by Allee effects, community resistance, and an interaction between pH and dispersal levels. While dispersal rates could be artificially increased by human intervention, this would carry the risk of introducing invasive species. As a result, patience and continued monitoring of recovering lakes may be the best management approaches at this time.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To optimize muscle blood flow to the skeletal muscle during exercise, the vascular bed of the muscle is partially protected from sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) vasoconstriction via a phenomenon termed functional sympatholysis. Functional sympatholysis has been documented during exercise periods in human skeletal muscle. However, it remains unknown whether functional sympatholysis is specific to the exercising period, or if it may persist for a period of time following skeletal muscle exercise. Through this study, we aimed to confirm the presence and duration of post-exercise functional sympatholysis in the human skeletal muscle. The cold pressor test (CPT) was administered to 9 male (mean age = 21.1 ± 0.8 years) participants at various time points during four different experimental trials (Rest, Exercise, Recovery 1 and Recovery 2). Exercise consisted of 7 minutes of moderate isometric handgrip exercise (15% below critical power). Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded continuously throughout each trial. Brachial artery mean blood velocity measurements as well as brachial artery diameter measurements were recorded on each participant’s exercising arm throughout each trial. Deep venous blood samples were drawn pre- and post-CPT administration from a catheter inserted into an antecubital vein of each participant’s non-experimental arm. The cardiovascular response to the CPT was repeatable across experimental days as it consistently resulted in MAP elevations regardless of the experimental time point of administration. The CPT also resulted in a significant elevation in plasma norepinephrine concentration from 0.49 ± 0.04 ng/mL at “pre-CPT” measurement to 0.66 ± 0.05 ng/mL at the end of the CPT in the Rest trial (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage reduction in forearm vascular conductance (FVC) due to CPT administration during Exercise (4.5 ± 6.6%) and Recovery 1 (4 minutes post-exercise; -11.6 ± 8.8%) was significantly blunted in comparison to that measured during Rest (-34.8 ± 7.4%) (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage change in FVC during the Recovery 2 trial (10 minutes post-exercise; -20.1 ± 7.1%) was not significantly different from that measured at Rest. These findings support the concept of a lingering presence of functional sympatholysis 4 minutes, but not 10 minutes, post-moderate exercise.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Functional water-soluble polymers find applications in a variety of fields including waste-water treatment, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, drug delivery, and hygiene. Despite the increased demand for these products, understanding of their synthesis by free-radical aqueous-phase polymerization has lagged behind that of polymers produced in organic solvents. In this doctoral work, the free-radical batch and semibatch aqueous-phase polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), N-vinylformamide (NVF), N-vinylimidazole (NVI) and quaternized vinylimidazole (QVI), as well as NVP polymerized in n-butanol, has been studied. Kinetic models are developed to describe monomer conversion and polymer molecular weight (MW) behaviour of these systems. The expressions developed from independent pulsed-laser studies for propagation (kp) and termination (kt) rate coefficients, including their variation with monomer concentration and conversion, are shown to provide an excellent description of aqueous-phase NVP polymerization. Polymerization of NVP in butanol and of NVF in water are well-represented by the base NVP model, with differences in polymerization rate and polymer MWs simply accounted for by the differences in kp for the systems, indicating that the kt behaviour must be quite similar. The NVI/QVI study demonstrates the importance of a pH-dependent degradative addition reaction to monomer for NVI, with polymerization behaviour identical to that of QVI for pH 1, an effect captured in the model developed to describe the system. &#xD;
&#xD;
The aqueous-phase copolymerization of NVP and NVF was also studied, and reactivity ratios were determined to be very close to unity. This information was combined with the kp and kt expressions used to describe NVP and NVF homopolymerizations, with no other additional parameters required to model the copolymerization rate, copolymer composition and copolymer MW. This result demonstrates that the improved homopolymerization knowledge of these water-soluble monomers can be easily extended to understand their behaviour in copolymerization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Endometriosis affects 5-10% of women and is characterized by the growth of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus.  Treatment for endometriosis primarily focuses on symptom relief, is short term with severe side effects and often leads to recurrence of the condition.  Establishing new blood supply is a fundamental requirement for endometriosis lesions growth.  This has led to the idea that antiangiogenic therapy may be a successful approach for inhibiting endometriosis.  Recent evidence indicates that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to neoangiogenesis of endometriotic lesions.  These EPCs are recruited to the lesion site by stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1).  We hypothesize that SDF-1 is central to the neoangiogenesis and survival of endometriotic lesions and that administration of SDF-1 blocking antibody will inhibit lesion growth by inhibiting angiogenesis in a murine model of endometriosis.  Immunohistochemistry for SDF-1 and CD34 was performed on human endometriosis and normal endometrial samples.  Quantification of SDF-1 and EPCs was performed in the blood of endometriosis patients and controls using ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively.  A new mouse model of endometriosis was developed using BALB/c-Rag2-/-/IL2rg-/- mice to investigate role of SDF-1 in neoangiogenesis.  Either SDF-1 blocking antibody or an isotype control was administered on a weekly basis for four weeks.  Weekly samples of peripheral blood from mice were analyzed for SDF-1, other cytokines of interest and EPCs.  Mice were euthanized at seven weeks to observe lesion growth and blood vessel development.  Our results indicate overabundance of SDF-1 and CD34+ progenitor cells in human endometriotic lesions compared to eutopic endometrium.  In the mouse model, SDF-1 and circulating EPC levels decreased from pre-treatment levels after one week, and remained constant over the course of the treatment in both SDF-1 blocking antibody and isotype control groups.  In the SDF-1 blocking group, reduced vascularity of lesions, identified by immunofluorescence staining for CD31, was revealed compared to isotype controls.  These findings suggest that SDF-1 may be responsible for CD34+ progenitor cell recruitment to the neoangiogenic sites in endometriosis.  Blocking of SDF-1 reduces neovascularization of human endometriotic lesions in a mouse model.  Further studies on blocking SDF-1 in combination with other antiangiogenic agents are needed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this study, I use visual and material culture that addresses the contemporary war in Afghanistan to critically assess the ways in which national conflict history is envisioned. I focus in particular on cultural production related to the involvement of Australia and Canada in the conflict. I do so to question the ways in which Australia’s and Canada’s engagements with this particular conflict are visualized in relation to their official narratives, which posit their military activities in Afghanistan as undertaken in the name of security, peacekeeping, and rebuilding.  Such a query is important, because it allows me to investigate which visualizations contribute to the history and narrative of national engagements with conflict, and which are ignored. Moreover, it allows me to ask how visual and material culture not only constitutes, but also legitimates national conflict narratives. And finally, it allows me to locate examples within this field of cultural production that renegotiate, contest, subvert, and resist state representations. &#xD;
	These lines of inquiry help to situate my study of visual and material culture by suggesting that such objects can act as lenses through which to address what Jon Stratton and Ien Ang describe as the “unstable, provisional and often jeopardous status of the national” (1996, 381). Following Stratton and Ang, I approach the concept of the “nation” as “a contested terrain between historically specific ‘cultures’ structured in relations of dominance and subordination to each other” (367). Using exhibitions and cultural objects produced post-9/11 in Australia and Canada (that is, after 11 September 2001), I analyze the visual and material culture of conflict within the “contested terrain” of national/ist narratives. The particular process of culture-making exemplified in exhibitions and cultural objects is crucial when it comes to advancing national/ist narratives, since as I argue throughout this study, it represents part of the larger historical transition from the state enlistment of cultural production in support of nation-building to the neoliberal mobilization of visual culture for the global marketplace.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Positive emotional health is an important component of overall health, and it is linked to many social and health outcomes among youth. The natural environment is thought to influence emotional health. Psychological and experimental research have each shown links between exposure to nature and both stress reduction and attention restoration. Some population studies have suggested positive effects of green space on various indicators of health. However, there are limited large-scale epidemiological studies assessing this relationship, specifically for populations of young people and in the Canadian context. &#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: To examine possible effects of natural space on positive emotional health among young adolescent Canadians. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: This cross-sectional study was based upon the Canadian 2009/10 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey with linked geographic information system (GIS) data. Following exclusions, the sample included 17 249 (mostly grades 6 to 10) students from 317 schools. Features of the natural environment were extracted using GIS within a 5 km radius circular buffer surrounding each school. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between the presence of natural space and students’ reports of positive emotional health, while controlling for salient covariates and the clustered nature of the data. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Over half of Canadian youth reported positive emotional health (58.5% among boys and 51.6% among girls). Relationships between the amount of natural space and positive emotional health were weak and lacked consistency. Compared to the lowest quartile of natural space, the most notable protective effect existed for students who lived in the third quartile (RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00-1.10). The relationship appeared to differ by urban/rural geographic location, suggesting protective effects in small cities. Positive emotional health was, however, more strongly associated with other factors including demographic characteristics, family affluence, and perceptions surrounding neighbourhoods. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: Exposure to natural space in youth’s immediate living environment may not be a leading determinant of their emotional health. The relationship between natural space and positive emotional health may be context specific, and hence different for Canadian youth compared to adult populations and those studied in other nations. The main contributors to emotional health among youth were personal factors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The breaking of internal solitary waves (ISWs) of depression shoaling upon a uniformly sloping boundary in a smoothed two-layer density field was investigated using high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. The simulations were performed for a wide range of boundary slopes S∈[0.01,0.3] and wave slopes. Over steep slopes (S≥0.1), three distinct breaking processes were observed; surging, plunging and collapsing breakers which are associated with reflection, convective instability and boundary layer separation, respectively. Over mild slopes (S≤0.05), nonlinearity varies gradually and the wave fissions into a train of waves of elevation after it passes through the turning point where solitary waves reverse polarity. The dynamics of each breaker type were investigated and the predominance of a particular mechanism was associated with a relative developmental timescale. The breaker type was characterized in wave slope S_w versus S space and the reflection coefficient (R), modeled as a function of the internal Iribarren number, was in agreement with other studies. &#xD;
The same 2D model was applied to investigate boundary layer separation-driven global instability, which is shown to play an important role in breaking of shoaling ISWs. The simulations were conducted with waves propagating over a flat bottom and shoaling over relatively mild (S=0.05) and steep (S=0.1) slopes. Combining the results over flat and sloping boundaries, a unified criterion for vortex shedding is proposed, which depends on the momentum thickness Reynolds number and the non-dimensionalized ISW-induced pressure gradient at the point of separation. The criterion is generalized to a form that may be readily computed from field data and compared to published laboratory and field observations. During vortex shedding, the bed shear stress, vertical velocity and near-bed Reynolds stress were elevated, implying potential for sediment re-suspension.&#xD;
Laboratory experiments were also performed to study three-dimensionality (3D) of global instability. Our results agree with previous laboratory experiments, using the proposed pressure gradient parameter and Reynolds number. The 3D effects prevent the vortices from ascending as high as they do in 2D simulations. The instabilities were not able to re-suspend sediments with 20 µm median diameters, which suggests applying lighter sediments, as finer sediments will be cohesive and dynamically different.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multimedia services have become one of the major demands in wireless systems. As a result of growing demands for media services, traffic in wireless networks are increasing. Hence, optimization of multimedia delivery systems to efficiently consume the valuable transmission resources in wireless networks has gained a lot of interest. Raptor codes, with linear encoding and decoding time complexity are one branch of  fountain codes (also known as rateless codes) which have found their ways in many recent communication standards as  application layer forward error correcting (FEC) codes. Various attempts have been made in order to  adapt these codes to wireless channels with their time varying nature. When multimedia delivery is targeted, some other issues such as delay should also be considered. Moreover, in multicast solutions, the system has to address demands of multiple clients. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we investigate some optimization scenarios for wireless multimedia multicast systems wherein clients with heterogeneous channels and media quality demands subscribe to a video program. The video program is assumed as a multilayer source with possible spatial, temporal and fidelity layers. The point of optimization under various systems is to provide the clients of different quality constraints with  their demanded services while imposing the minimum network/client cost (e.g. delay, power consumption, outage probability) or maximize the provided utility to the clients while considering their heterogeneous capabilities. To achieve these tasks, we study  outage probability which serves as a measure to quantify the reliability of a service in a client's side.  Packetized rateless multimedia multicast (PRMM)  with  few optimization criteria regarding the experienced delay in clients are studied and analytical solutions are obtained.  A new optimization framework for rateless multimedia multicast is proposed in which, the provided utility to heterogeneous clients are maximized with respect to the clients channel and their quality demands.  Application of this optimization in a rateless multimedia multicast system wherein the utility is defined based on perceptual quality experience of clients is also investigated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A composite bioscaffold was constructed by encapsulating human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) within a photopolymerized polysaccharide hydrogel towards the goal of forming an injectable scaffold for adipose tissue engineering. Methacrylated glycol chitosan (MGC) and methacrylated chondroitin sulphate (MCS) were investigated as the hydrogel base materials with varying DAT concentrations. Glycol chitosan and chondroitin sulphate were converted to photopolymerizable prepolymers through graft methacrylation using glycidyl methacrylate and methacrylate anhydride respectively to achieve a degree of substitution (DOS) of 15% and 16%, respectively. MGC and MCS gels containing 0, 3 and 5 w/v% cryo-milled DAT were fabricated and characterized by measuring sol content, equilibrium water content and compressive mechanical properties (n=4, n=3). An increase in stiffness and a decrease in sol and water contents were observed in the gels with higher DAT concentration, suggesting that the DAT was acting as a filler material that contributed to the crosslinking reaction. In vitro studies were conducted with primary human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) encapsulated in the DAT-polymer constructs to assess cellular viability (n=3, N=3) as well as adipogenic differentiation, quantitatively via glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity (n=3, N=3) and qualitatively through end-point RT-PCR analysis of key adipogenic genes (LPL, PPARγ, and CEPBα) (n=2, N=3) and intracellular lipid staining (n=3, N=3). Incorporating the DAT with MGC or MCS hydrogels enhanced cell viability as compared to the MGC and MCS scaffolds alone, with the MCS + 5 w/v% DAT scaffold having the highest overall cell viability and total cell number. The addition of the DAT in the MGC and MCS scaffold groups enhanced ASC adipogenesis as measured by an increase in GPDH levels, adipogenic gene expression and intracellular lipid accumulation characteristic of adipocytes. The highest GPDH levels were observed in the induced MCS with 5 w/v% DAT scaffolds, as compared to all other scaffold groups and tissue culture controls. The GPDH activity in this group increased by almost three times between 3 and 14 days, consistent with the progression of differentiation. The results indicated that the MCS-based scaffolds incorporating the DAT promoted cell viability and adipogenesis, demonstrating great promise as composite scaffolds for soft tissue regeneration.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Master-Slave teleoperation systems are designed to extend a human's manipulation capability to remote tasks. Recent applications of these systems are in robotic therapy, telesurgery, and medical simulators.&#xD;
In practice, due to the uncertainties in the operator and environment dynamics, and time delay, stability and performance are compromised. Stability-based and performance-based controllers are introduced for these systems. A major class of the former controllers are based on the passivity theory and suffer from the assumed unbounded range of dynamics which is rather unrealistic. The latter class of controllers are mostly adaptive methods that are based on performance optimization.&#xD;
The theme of this thesis is on the development of new stability analysis methods, control strategies, and implementation techniques for enhanced trade-off between stability and performance. I have developed a less conservative passivity-based robust stability method and introduced, for the first time, the notion of Bounded Impedance Absolute Stability. The method provides mathematical and visual aids to incorporate bounds of the passive environment impedance for less conservative guaranteed stability conditions, promising a better compromise between stability and performance.&#xD;
I have extended the new method to include the dynamic range of the human operator for increased stability margins. I have also used the new method to develop a bilateral controller robust to time delays. Furthermore, I have investigated the effect of sampling position versus velocity for various sampling models to obtain less conservative coupled stability conditions for haptic simulation systems.&#xD;
Estimates of the environment dynamics are required to include their variations. Therefore, I have proposed two new real-time parameter estimation methods for linear and nonlinear contacts and experimentally evaluated and compared them with the available techniques.&#xD;
Finally, I have introduced needle insertion as a task in telerobotic systems to combine the expertise of the surgeon with robotic control.  Here, the very first few steps needed to effectively control the targeting needles have been taken. I have developed a mechanics-based dynamic model for bevel-tip flexible needles inserted into soft tissues. Finite element models are used to estimate soft tissue deformation, while the mechanics-based model is used to predict needle deflections due to bevel-tip asymmetry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>President John F. Kennedy’s announcement, on Monday 22 October 1962, that there were offensive missiles on the island of Cuba began the public phase of what would be remembered as the Cuban missile crisis.  This Cold War crisis had ramifications in many other countries than just the Soviet Union and the United States.  Due to the danger involved in this nuclear confrontation, the entire globe was threatened.  If either side lost control of negotiations, an atomic war could have broken out which would have decimated the planet.  As the direct northern neighbors of the United States and partners in continental defence, Canadians experienced and understood the Cuban missile crisis in the context of larger issues.&#xD;
	In many ways, Canadian and American reactions to the crisis were similar.  Many citizens stocked up their pantries, read the newspapers, protested, or worried that the politicians would make a mistake and set off a war.  However, this dissertation argues that English Canadians experienced the crisis on another level as well.  In public debate and print sources, many debated what the crisis meant for Canadian-Cuban relations, Canadian-American relations and Canada’s place in the world.  Examining these print and archival sources, this dissertation analyzes the contour of public debate during the crisis, uniting that debate with the actions of politicians.   Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker hesitated for two days before making a statement which fully committed Canada to a position which supported the American quarantine of Cuba, and shortly after the crisis,  was defeated at the polls.  This dissertation argues that understanding the Canadian reaction to and experience of the Cuban missile crisis necessitates an understanding of how different Canadians talked about and understood the actions of their leaders.  The shifting terrain of memory also serves to demonstrate the manner in which this history is told and remembered in Canada.  This dissertation, therefore, examines the intersections between this Cold War confrontation and Canadian identity in the postwar period.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is a relatively new procedure that is used to treat shoulders with massive rotator cuff tears combined with arthritis, a condition that is not well managed using conventional shoulder arthroplasty. By reversing the ‘ball-and-socket’ anatomy of the shoulder, the constraint of the joint can be increased. Despite the success of this prosthesis in improving pain and function, complication rates remain high and instability is often reported as the most commonly occurring complication. The mechanism of dislocation as well as factors that can be modified to decrease the risk of dislocation are not well understood for reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to create a platform for examining the stability of reverse shoulder arthroplasty and use this to investigate factors affecting stability, including shoulder orientation (abduction and abduction plane angles), loading direction, glenosphere eccentricity and diameter, and humeral socket constraint.&#xD;
&#xD;
An anatomical shoulder simulator was developed using a synthetic bone model and pneumatically actuated cables to represent the three heads of the deltoid. A displacing force was applied to the humeral head by a material testing machine in an anterior, posterior, superior, or inferior direction. The force required to dislocate the joint was used as a measure of stability and the identified factors and the interactions between factors were examined using a half-fraction factorial design experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Increases in glenohumeral abduction or inferior-offset of the glenosphere were found to improve the stability of the prosthesis. Additionally, increased humeral socket depth resulted in greater stability for all loading directions, with the exception of inferior loading. Abduction plane angle and glenosphere diameter had no effect on the stability of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the behaviour of the Supreme Court of Canada in cases involving electoral/referendum laws and the alleged violation of freedom of expression and/or the right to vote. In 2007, it declared that the judiciary should adopt "a natural attitude of deference" towards Parliament's decisions about the democratic process when determining, under section one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, whether the infringement is reasonable and justified. This declaration reflected institutional concerns about judicial competence to review legislative choices in this area of public policy and the democratic legitimacy of it doing so. It was made even though the Court had found laws unconstitutional in a majority of the cases that it had heard to date. Deference is often simply equated with government 'wins' in court. Such an equation ignores the effect that the decision has on judicial reasoning. It sets the standard of review the court uses when applying the Oakes test, the framework within which the section 1 analysis occurs. It also establishes the standard of proof that the Crown must meet to demonstrate that an infringement is justified. The outcome of constitutional disputes can turn on the decision about deference, pointing to a need for structure and coherence in the judiciary's approach. A review of the Court's jurisprudence shows that this need has not been met. In spite of its importance to constitutional adjudication, the analytical process by which the decision is made has garnered little attention from those who study the Charter. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by examining deference theory and the use of deference in disputes involving the democratic process and by proposing an approach for specific use in these cases. The approach links the decision to the nature of the legislation, the nature of the right and the nature of the parliamentary discourse that preceded the enactment or amendment of the impugned law. Before setting the standards of review and proof used during the Oakes test, courts should determine whether: they have the necessary competence and legitimacy to act; the right warrants stringent constitutional protection; and parliamentarians engaged in serious deliberations that included the Charter and the reasonableness of any infringements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prostate brachytherapy, a treatment for prostate cancer, was a procedure that typically involved placing radioactive sources in a cancerous prostate using percutaneous needles.  The placement of these&#xD;
sources determined the dose that the prostate and healthy tissues surrounding it received.  However, because a needle could bend, tissue&#xD;
could deform, and a patient could move, each source may have been displaced from its planned position.  This source misplacement could later cause some cancer to be spared or healthy organs to be further&#xD;
damaged.  To better understand patterns of source misplacement, and eventually reduce the phenomenon, this work matched and registered implanted sources with their planned positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Each implant was registered to its plan using a sequence of four successive registrations.  A rough initial registration was first found, using features known in the planned dataset and estimated from the implanted dataset.  Second, subsets of sources were reconstructed&#xD;
in the implanted dataset.  The implanted sources were next matched to the planned sources using the subsets as constraints.  Finally, the optimal rigid transformation between the implants and the plan was&#xD;
found.&#xD;
&#xD;
The algorithm was tested on both simulated and clinical datasets. Simulations placed limits on how properties of the subsets affected registration accuracy.  When tested on 9 clinical datasets, the algorithm found 100% of correct plan-implant source matches within seconds on commonly available computers.  When the implanted strands&#xD;
were reconstructed as sine waves, 97% of t strands had an amplitude of less than 2mm.  The clinical accuracy result generally agreed with simulation: subsets with amplitudes less than 2mm were expected to produce an accuracy &gt;90%.  The high accuracy of the algorithm may enable its use in finding patterns of source misplacement.  The fast run-time of the algorithm may additionally make it useful for use in a clinical setting.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Electrospray ionization (ESI) has been an invaluable technique to mass spectrometry (MS) especially for analyzing large bio-molecules with unparalleled sensitivity, robustness, and simplicity. Great effort in the development of ESI technique has been devoted in the emitter design, as its shape and geometry have proved pivotal to the electrospray performance and further MS detection. Intrinsic problems for the traditional single-hole emitters including clogging and low throughput limit the applicability of the technique. To address this issue, the current project is focused on developing multiple electrospray (MES) emitters for improved ESI-MS analysis. &#xD;
In this thesis, joint work of both computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations for electrospray and offline electrospray experiments for spray current measurement were performed. Numerical simulations were used to test the effect of various emitter designs on electrospray performance and the laboratory results serve as a guide and validation. The CFD code was based on Taylor-Melcher leaky dielectric model (LDM) and the transient electrospray process was successfully simulated. The method was first validated via a 750 μm inner diameter (i.d.) emitter and further applied to a 20 μm i.d. model. Different stages of the electrospray process were visually demonstrated and the quantitative investigations for the change of spray current under various applied electric fields and flow rates share good agreement with previous simulations and measurements. Based on the single-aperture prototype, MES simulations were performed with 2-hole and 3-hole emitters. Simulation predictions compared favorably with the experimental results. Evidence from this work has proved that CFD simulation can be used as an effective numerical tool to test emitter designs for MES. The benchmarking result on the successful simulation of a microscale emitter electrospray achieved in this work is believed to be the smallest scale of the dynamic simulation for electrospray published to date.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The hybridizing Daphnia mendotae and D. dentifera (Crustacea: Cladocera) are sympatric&#xD;
throughout much of North America, and are considered a cryptic species complex due to their lack of&#xD;
phylogenetically informative morphological characters. They appear to have no biological mating&#xD;
barriers: hybrids may dominate or coexist with either or both parental species, and are sexually&#xD;
competent, forming both F2 hybrids and back-crosses. Nevertheless, the two species remain distinct.&#xD;
There is observational evidence that separation may be enforced by adaptation to different predation&#xD;
regimes: D. mendotae, with its greater anti-predator morphological plasticity, may out-compete D.&#xD;
dentifera under intense invertebrate predation, while the smaller D. dentifera may be better adapted to&#xD;
avoid predation by visually feeding fish. We tested this idea by examining whether D. mendotae and D.&#xD;
dentifera differ in ecologically relevant life history and morphological traits. We performed a replicated&#xD;
life history experiment involving 6 replicates of 6 clones within each species, and measured time until&#xD;
first reproduction, fecundity, and juvenile and population growth rates. In parallel, we examined&#xD;
whether these species differed in morphological traits predicted to arise from adaptation to different&#xD;
predator types, and tested the ecological relevance of these traits by exposing Daphnia to predation by&#xD;
the invasive cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus. Finally, we examined the plasticity of life history,&#xD;
morphology, and susceptibility to predation by rearing Daphnia under exposure to Bythotrephes&#xD;
chemical cues for two generations. D. mendotae and D. dentifera differed across almost all measured&#xD;
life history and morphological traits in directions that accord with our hypotheses, strongly suggesting&#xD;
that their species boundaries are maintained by adaptation to different predation regimes. Plastic&#xD;
reaction to Bythotrephes, however, was weak and inconsistent, suggesting that these species either do&#xD;
not detect or respond to this recent invader, or that their responses are manifested in other ways.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The processing of nickeliferous laterites to produce nickel metal is both complex and energy intensive. Since most laterites are found in remote regions, the capital costs for the infrastructure can exceed those for the process itself. The low temperature sulphidation of lateritic ores to produce an intermediate nickel concentrate for further processing offers a number of potential advantages, such as lower energy consumption and a relatively simple flowsheet.  In this research, the sulphidation of a nickeliferous lateritic ore was investigated between the temperatures of 450-1100oC and sulphur additions of between 25-1000 kg of sulphur per tonne of ore.&#xD;
The experiments demonstrated that the nickel oxide within the ore can be selectively sulphidized to a nickel-iron sulphide. It was found that both the grade and the sulphidation degree largely depended upon the temperature and the sulphur additions, with temperatures above 550oC exhibiting the highest nickel sulphidation extents and grades. A DTA/TGA with mass spectrometer was used to further elucidate the nature of the phase transformations that occur upon heating of the ore, in the presence of sulphur. &#xD;
It was found that the Fe-Ni-S phase formed at low temperatures was submicron in nature and heating to temperatures of 1050oC-1100oC allowed for the growth of the sulphides to a d80 of up to 14 µm due to increased sulphide mobility, associated with the formation of a liquid sulphide matte with dissolved oxygen. Flotation studies conducted on 60 g samples showed that the sulphides formed respond to flotation with maximum grades of up to 6-7 wt% nickel being achieved and average grades of between 4-5 wt% nickel.  Recoveries were approximately 50% on a sulphide basis and it was determined that the low nickel grades were due to the entrainment of magnetite fines.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cape Bounty, Melville Island is a partially vegetated High Arctic landscape with three main plant communities: polar semi-desert (47% of the study area), mesic tundra (31%) , and wet sedge meadows (7%). The objective of this research was to relate biophysical measurements of soil, vegetation, and CO2  exchange rates  in each vegetation type to high resolution satellite data from IKONOS-2, extending plot level measurements to a landscape scale.    Field data was collected  through six weeks of the 2008 growing season. Two IKONOS images were acquired, one on July 4th and the other on August 2nd. Two products were generated from the satellite data: a land-cover classification and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). &#xD;
	The three vegetation types were found to have distinct soil and vegetation characteristics. Only the wet sedge meadows were a net sink for CO2; soil respiration tended to exceed photosynthesis in the sparsely vegetated mesic tundra and polar semi-desert.  Scaling up the plot measurements by vegetation type area suggested that Cape Bounty was a small net carbon source (0.34 ± 0.47 g C  m-2 day-1) in the summer of 2008. &#xD;
	NDVI was strongly correlated with percent vegetation cover, vegetation volume, soil moisture,  and moderately with soil nitrogen, biomass,  and leaf area index (LAI). Photosynthesis and respiration of CO2  both positively correlated with NDVI, most strongly when averaged over the season. NDVI increased over time in every vegetation type, but this change was not reflected in any significant measured changes in vegetation or CO2  flux rates. &#xD;
	A simple spatial model was developed to estimate Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) at every pixel on the satellite images based on NDVI, temperature and incoming solar radiation.  It was found that the rate of photosynthesis per unit NDVI was higher early in the growing season. The model estimated a mean flux to the atmosphere of  0.21 g C  m-2 day-1 at the time of image acquisition on July 4th, and -0.07 g C m-2 day-1 (a net C sink) on August 2nd.  The greatest uncertainty in the relationship between NDVI and CO2 flux was associated with the polar semi-desert class.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Developmental evaluation (Patton, 1994, 2011) is one of the latest approaches to be introduced into evaluation practice. It purports to support the development of social innovation by infusing evaluative thinking through collaboration between program clients and the developmental evaluator (Patton, 2011). In an attempt to build “practical knowledge” (Schwandt, 2008) about this emerging approach, this research seeks to investigate the capacity of developmental evaluation to support innovation. &#xD;
This thesis reports on a case study of the Assessment Pilot Initiative (API) where developmental evaluation was used to support the development of a novel approach to teacher education. Charged with a vision to innovate their own teaching practices and the learning of teacher candidates, the instructors of the case invited a developmental evaluator onboard in a yearlong collaboration. While the instructors, along with the developmental evaluator, were uncertain about the outcome of the initiative or how best to proceed, this engagement resulted in a novel adaptation of microblogging web technology (Twitter) that came to be piloted with a group of teacher candidates.&#xD;
This thesis presents an analysis of the development process and the contributions developmental evaluation made in enabling the development of the API. Such analysis is anchored in the records of the program development, and in the perspectives of the program clients and the developmental evaluator. Analyzing the program development records for developmental moments revealed certain trends and patterns that, when triangulated with interview data from program clients and with reflections from the developmental evaluator, provided intricate insights into how the development came about and of the contributions developmental evaluation made in this case. &#xD;
Development of API proceeded in a highly nonlinear, emergent process through six foci of development. Critical to addressing the uncertainty and complexity that might had otherwise inhibited development, developmental evaluation enabled a data-informed approach that lent a quality of responsiveness to the emergent, evolving nature of the initiative. The developmental evaluator was instrumental in identifying activities that helped make explicit values and assumptions underpinning the initiative and in structuring a learning framework to engage program clients in sense-making. The notion of design emerged from analysis as an important function of developmental evaluation. Implications of the findings are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Clinical instruction is an essential component of professional education in nursing and accounts for a significant portion of credits within baccalaureate nursing programs. Clinical instructors (CIs) are expected to have strong clinical knowledge as well as strong teaching skills. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an online education program for increasing CIs’ perception of teaching self-efficacy and knowledge about the clinical teacher role. &#xD;
A convenience sample of CIs (n = 32) at Queen’s University School of Nursing were recruited for this study. Over the span of seven weeks, participants completed self-paced online educational modules (Preceptor Education Program - PEP) available from the University of Western Ontario. A single sample pre-test, retrospective pre-/post-test research design was used. Participants completed teaching self-efficacy and teaching knowledge questionnaires pre-intervention (n=32) and post-intervention (n=21).&#xD;
Mean teaching self-efficacy scores increased significantly from pre-test to post-test (t = 6.7, p &lt; .001). Teaching knowledge scores increased significantly from pre-test to post-test (t = 4.1, p &lt; .05).The online modules had a significant impact on CIs’ teaching knowledge and self-efficacy. Descriptive data regarding participants’ satisfaction with the PEP modules was gathered; clinical instructors for the most part completed the PEP modules and were very satisfied with them. This online mode of clinical instructor education appears to be a feasible, facilitative and an accessible way to provide ongoing professional development and education for clinical instructors at Queen’s University.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over half a century ago the scientist and novelist C. P. Snow described a world divided into two cultures – scientists on the one hand, literary intellectuals on the other. Both played a significant role in shaping the world, but were unable to even hold a conversation (Snow 1971). This dissertation brings a sociological perspective to this divide (now seen as a divide between the sciences and the humanities) and hope for reconciliation, as it has been revisited in the more technologically saturated environment of the twenty-first century. The digital humanities combines computer science and the humanities and its impact on the humanities has been called “game changing” (Bobley 2008). Just as technology has revolutionized science, in fields such as astronomy or neuroscience for example, by allowing scientists to see and analyze objects and patterns they could not before, digitization allows humanities scholars to ask questions, and find answers, that were not possible in the past (Katz 2005; Kirschenbaum 2010; Kornbluh 2008). The digital humanities also promises to expand the reach of the humanities in terms of what is studied, who is able to participate, and who has access. This dissertation argues that the digital humanities is leading to the democratization of the humanities by expanding access to and participation in the humanities. In addition, although there are still divides between the two cultures, the digital humanities is a place where a third culture is fostered, as digital humanists are increasingly becoming experts in both the humanities and computing. Three case studies are examined: the Centre for History and New Media at George Mason University, The Orlando Project, a joint project between the University of Alberta and Guelph University, and the Electronic Arts Game Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Temporary Agricultural Worker to Canada (TAWC) project was introduced in 2003 with the purpose of recruiting Guatemalan migrants to fill seasonal labour voids in Canada.  Workers contracted through TAWC directives have received minimal scholarly attention, given the infancy of the program and the substantial focus on Mexican migrants recruited through the Canadian Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program.  This dissertation illuminates the transnational political realities of Guatemalans by examining the impact that circular migration has on the subaltern migrant body.&#xD;
Fieldwork was conducted in two sites, the first St. Rémi in Québec, the second Santiago Sacatepéquez in Guatemala.  Research findings underscore the transnational nature of the flow of hegemonic (discipline, insecurity, oppression, exploitation) and counter hegemonic (empowerment, liberation, collectiveness, security) political ideas and activities between the spaces traversed by migrants.  The study engages a multi-faceted ethnographic design in order to explore the spatiality of political consciousness, assessing Guatemalan migrant responses to a range of ideas and activities imparted by agencies of power.  These include both the Canadian and Guatemalan governments, the International Organization for Migration, and le Fondation des entreprises pour le recrutement de la main-d'oeuvre étrangère along with a range of transnational supporting allies.  Nevertheless, the decision to (dis)engage in certain politicized conduct is largely dependent on the human agency of Guatemalan migrants, as they find the means to cope with the pressures of seasonal migration.&#xD;
A political economy perspective allows me to engage three debates that theoretically frame the transnational political identity of Guatemalan migrants.  These are: (1) processes of political transnationalism; (2) neoliberal agenda and mindsets; and (3) migrant political consciousness, with a particular emphasis on Foucauldian concepts of governmentality and Gramscian notions of hegemony and consciousness.  By engaging the (re)shaping of transnational political identity as a phenomenon influenced by agencies of power, and more importantly, the human agency of subaltern migrants, my dissertation emphasizes migrant (un)willingness to embrace and/or suppress certain resources that restructure political consciousness and political action.  The versatility and fluidity of transmigrant political identity reveal that the distinct realities of individuals are constructed by travelling back and forth, as seasonal labourers, between Guatemala and Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Modern applications of XML use automata operating on unranked trees. A common definition of tree automata operating on unranked trees uses a set of vertical states that define the bottom-up computation, and the transitions on vertical states are determined by so called horizontal languages recognized by finite automata on strings. The bottom-up computation of an unranked tree automaton may be either deterministic or nondeterministic, and further variants arise depending on whether the horizontal string languages defining the transitions are represented by DFAs or NFAs. There is also an alternative syntactic definition of determinism introduced by Cristau et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is known that a deterministic tree automaton with the smallest total number of states does not need to be unique nor have the smallest possible number of vertical states. We consider the question by how much we can reduce the total number of states by introducing additional vertical states. We give an upper bound for the state trade-off for deterministic tree automata where the horizontal languages are defined by DFAs, and a lower bound construction that, for variable sized alphabets, is close to the upper bound.&#xD;
&#xD;
We establish upper and lower bounds for the state complexity of conversions between different types of deterministic and nondeterministic unranked tree automata. The bounds are, usually, tight for the numbers of vertical states. Because a minimal deterministic unranked tree automaton need not be unique, establishing lower bounds for the number of horizontal states, that is, the combined size of DFAs used to define the horizontal languages, is challenging. Based on existing lower bound results for unambiguous finite automata we develop a lower bound criterion for the number of horizontal states.&#xD;
&#xD;
We consider the state complexity of operations on regular unranked tree languages. The concatenation of trees can be defined either as a sequential or a parallel operation. Furthermore, there are two essentially different ways to iterate sequential concatenation. We establish tight state complexity bounds for concatenation-like operations. In particular, for sequential concatenation and bottom-up iterated concatenation the bounds differ by an order of magnitude from the corresponding state complexity bounds for regular string languages.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We present the results of three proposed mechanisms for ejection of gas from a spiral arm into the halo.  The mechanisms were modelled using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as a theoretical template.  Each mechanism was run through simulations using a Fortran code: ZEUS-3D, an MHD equation solver.  The first mechanism modelled the gas dynamics with a modified Hartmann flow which describes the fluid flow between two parallel plates.  We initialized the problem based on observation of lagging halos; that is, that the rotational velocity falls to a zero at some height above the plane of the disk. When adopting a density profile which takes into account the various warm and cold H$_I$ and H$_{II}$ molecular clouds, the system evolves very strangely and does not reproduce the steady velocity gradient observed in edge-on galaxies.  This density profile, adopted from Martos and Cox (1998), was used in the remaining models.  However, when treating a system with a uniform density profile, a stable simulation can result.  Next we considered supernova (SN) blasts as a possible mechanism for gas ejection.  While a single SN was shown to be insufficient to promote vertical gas structures from the disk, multiple SN explosions proved to be enough to promote gas ejection from the disk.  In these simulations, gas ejected to a height of 0.5 kpc at a velocity of 130 km s$^{-1}$ from 500 supernovae, extending to an approximate maximum height of 1 kpc at a velocity of $6.7 \times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ from 1500 supernovae after 0.15 Myr, the approximate time of propagation of a supernova shock wave. Finally, we simulated gas flowing into the spiral arm at such a speed to promote a jump in the disk gas, termed a hydraulic jump.  The height of the jump was found to be slightly less than a kiloparsec with a flow velocity of 41 km s$^{-1}$ into the halo after 167 Myr.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The latter models proved to be effective mechanisms through which gas is ejected from the disk whereas the Hartmann flow (or toy model) mechanism remains unclear as the heliocentric velocity profile becomes unstable when run through a time-dependent simulation.  Though the cause of this instability is unclear, pressure fluctuations in the system are suspected to play a role.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The primary objective of my thesis was to investigate the effect of crimp-like fibrous scaffolds on bovine fibroblasts and to develop a scaffold for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tissue engineering. To achieve this objective, fibrous biodegradable polymeric scaffolds were fabricated, which upon relaxation developed a crimp-like structure, which resembled the crimp seen in native collagen. The understanding of the crimp mechanism allowed for controlling crimp-like patterns in various polymer fibre systems, and was determined to be due to residual stress coupled with an operating temperature (Top) above the glass transition temperature of the polymer (Tg). The benefit of crimp was evaluated by seeding fibroblasts on crimp-like fibres that were subjected to dynamic mechanical loading. The results showed a significant increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation by fibroblasts that experienced crimp unfolding. In addition, fibroblasts seeded on mechanically stimulated crimp-like fibrous scaffolds formed ECM bundles that resembled collagen fibre fascicles.&#xD;
Two separate studies were conducted to fabricate fibrous scaffolds with high modulus: one on thermoplastic polyesters and the other on a photocrosslinkable polyester. Of the thermoplastic polyesters investigated, poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) P(LLA-DLLA) exhibited the highest modulus, and was the most resistant to hydrolytic degradation. These fibres were placed in a heated aqueous environment to exhibit a crimp-like pattern similar to that of native collagen. Bovine fibroblasts were shown to attach, proliferate and deposit ECM on the surface of the P(LLA-DLLA) fibrous scaffolds. In addition, the deposited ECM appeared to be organized in distinctive bundles that resembled fascicles found in native ACL. However, upon crimp unfolding the crimp was not completely recovered. Photocrosslinkable poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate cinnamate) P(LLA-TMC cinnamate) fibres in addition to supporting cell proliferation and ECM accumulation, completely recovered their crimp-like pattern, via [2 + 2] cycloaddition of the cinnamate groups. The recovery of crimp upon unfolding is a novel design feature incorporated into electrospun fibres as it innately mimics the function of collagen fibres found in the ACL.&#xD;
From the results obtained it is evident that crimp and its unfolding are key design features/conditioning techniques that need to be incorporated into fibrous scaffolds that possess high modulus, intended for ligament tissue engineering.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Surface plasmon is a collective oscillation behavior of electrons in metal nanoparticle induced by the excitation of incident light, which can create an enhanced localized electric field near the surface of metal nanoparticle. To date, metal nanoparticle surface plasmon resonances have been extensively studied in the photoluminescence domain; little work however was devoted to electroluminescent and photovoltaic research. &#xD;
In this thesis, as a fundamental study we firstly investigated surface plasmon enhanced europium complex luminescence and obtained an improved understanding of the importance of optical spacer in metal enhanced fluorescence phenomenon. Under this guideline, we incorporated metal NPs into organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and organic solar cells, by means of thermal evaporation and wet chemistry. Metal nanoparticles are demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of both OLEDs and solar cells only under tailored device architecture. The surface plasmon enhanced local electric field plays an important and comprehensive role in enhancing device performance. In Alq3 based OLED we observed increased charge carrier injection by depositing Ag nanoparticles underneath the Al cathode; in Ir(ppy)3 based OLED we gained enhanced luminous efficiency via doping silica functionalized Ag nanoparticles into emitting layer; in P3HT based organic polymer solar cell we noticed an increased polymer absorption by incorporating Ag nanoparticles over  the active layer. On the other hand, adverse effects such as metal nanoparticle induced charge carrier recombination and light extinction are also observed. The study of surface plasmon effects in organic optoelectronic devices reveals interesting surface plasmon features and permits to optimize optoelectronic devices from a novel point of view.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wireless sensor network technology has now been widely adopted.  In many applications, distributed sensor nodes collect data at different locations and the location information of each node is required. The Global Positioning System is commonly used to identify the location of the nodes in such networks. Although GPS localization has consistent long-term accuracy, it is limited by the inherent dependency on a direct line of sight to 4 or more external satellites. The increasing demand for an embedded system providing reliable navigation solutions regardless of its operational environment has motivated investigations into the use of integrated systems that combine inertial sensors with GPS receivers.  &#xD;
This research proposes a hardware architecture for location-based wireless sensor networks. In this architecture, each sensor node consists of a GPS receiver, a reduced set of low cost micro-electro-mechanical-system-based INS and a wireless transceiver. Sensor nodes in WSN are often equipped with irreplaceable batteries, which makes the power consumption crucial. To reduce the energy consumption, a microcontroller is used to control the power supply. Besides, a motion detection scheme is proposed by taking advantage of the ultra low-power wake-up function of the microcontroller. A low-power featured digital signal processor is used to accomplish the navigation computation using the Kalman filter for GPS/INS data fusion. Non-Holonomic Constraints derived velocity updates are applied to reduce the position errors. Field tests are conducted to verify the real-time performance of the proposed system with a positioning update rate of 20 Hz. &#xD;
The first test shows that the 2D INS/GPS integration can maintain the average system position error within 5 meters during a 60-second GPS outage. The second test used low cost inertial sensors. The average position error was 10.17 meters during a 20-second outage. The largest RMS value of position errors among these outages was within 14.5 meters. Furthermore, additional accuracy improvements of approximately 1.4 meters were achieved by utilizing NHC during GPS outages. The third test shows that the average error during a 30-second outage is approximately 20.6 meters for the on-foot scenario and 26.7 meters for the in-vehicle scenario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Solar Domestic Hot Water systems and air-source heat pumps offer the potential for energy savings in residential hot water production, however their performance is limited in cold climates, where the low ambient temperature reduces the collector efficiency or the heat pump coefficient of performance.   Combining these systems into a Solar-Assisted Heat Pump can alleviate these limitations by reducing the required collector temperature and by providing an increased heat pump evaporator temperature.&#xD;
This study is a continuation of the development of an Indirect Solar-Assisted Heat Pump undertaken at the Queen’s University Solar Calorimetry Laboratory. Previously, a numerical study compared its performance to existing technology, and based upon this feasibility analysis, a prototype was constructed for controlled laboratory tests using simulated solar input. In the current study, the prototype was modified to include a novel hybrid collector such that its performance under actual weather conditions throughout the year could be assessed. &#xD;
On sunny days, the system experienced daily averaged collector efficiencies between 0.47 and 0.88, depending on the flow rate and season. Averaged heat pump coefficients of performance of 2.54 to 3.13 were observed. Overcast days experienced reduced coefficients of performance, between 2.24 and 2.44. However, on overcast days, upwards of 76% of the collected energy gain was from convection with the surroundings.   &#xD;
Based upon these experimental results, a model for the hybrid collector was developed. Annual simulations of the system were conducted to compare the performance of the solar heat pump system when fitted with the hybrid collector relative to cases with more conventional glazed and unglazed collectors commonly used in solar thermal systems.   Results were produced for three Canadian cities: Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. The heat pump with the hybrid collector outperformed the other collectors in the Toronto climate, with a free energy ratio of 0.548. Adding a thermally controlled valve to the hybrid collector was proposed to further increase the annual free energy ratio, and was shown to perform best in all three cities, with free energy ratios of 0.558, 0.576 and 0.559 for Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg, respectively. It is proposed that additional improvements could be achieved by allowing the collectors to deliver heat directly to the storage tank, by circumventing the heat pump if the conditions were favorable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Continuous sensation and reaction to environmental fluctuations is especially critical to the survival of unicellular organisms. Stress response mechanisms are essential for cells during the vegetative and sexual life cycles and quiescence. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe mitotic activator and stress response serine/threonine kinase Ssp1 acts independent of the major fission yeast Spc1 MAP kinase stress response cascade. Ssp1 is required at high temperatures in the presence of other stressors, ensures long-term viability in quiescent cells and allows efficient cell division in low-glucose conditions. Ssp1 is cytoplasmic but briefly localizes to the cell membrane after exposure to extracellular stress. It plays a role in actin depolymerization and is required for the change of growth polarity after cell division. &#xD;
After identifying 14-3-3 proteins Rad24 and Rad25 as putative Ssp1 binding partners, we confirmed the interaction with co-immunoprecipitation. Association of Ssp1 with Rad24 diminishes after 15 minutes of hyperosmotic stress, however Rad25 binding is retained. Loss of the rad24 gene product rescues both ssp1- mitotic delay at elevated temperatures and sensitivity to 0. 6M KCl. Conversely, overexpression of rad24 exacerbates ssp1  stress sensitivity and mitotic delay. Diffuse actin polarity and spheroid morphology in rad24- cells improves in an ssp1- background. Ssp1 localization to the cell membrane is negatively regulated by Rad24. &#xD;
Ssp1 does not co-localize with Arp3C (actin-related protein 3 homologue C) after osmotic stress, but instead appears to form a ring around the cell, suggesting localization to fission scars. &#xD;
Ssp1 is basally phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated after glucose deprivation. Ssp1 is shuttled in and out of the nucleus and accumulates in the nucleus in an exportin Cmr1 dependent manner. &#xD;
Ssp1-GFP levels are constant in all stages of the vegetative cell cycle and Ssp1-GFP is present in both the sexual life cycle and quiescence. C-terminal and N-terminal truncation of ssp1 alters its subcellular localization. The C-terminal region is the site of hyperphosphorylation following glucose deprivation and is also necessary for membrane localization following osmotic stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Digital tabletop computers are an ideal platform for games with the social advantages of traditional tabletop games, such as board games and card games, combined with the more streamlined and automated gameplay of video games. Implementing a board game digitally allows for aspects of the game, such as routine in-game activities, rule enforcement and game progression, to be automated. However, the effect of this automation on the players’ social experience and enjoyment is poorly understood. To explore this question, a mixed-method study was carried out in which 24 groups of participants played either the abstract strategy board game Checkers or the cooperative board game Pandemic using three different interfaces: the original physical game; a digital tabletop interface which provided minimal automation in an attempt to replicate play of the original game; and a digital tabletop interface which automated many in-game activities, enforced the rules and managed the progression of the game. The study revealed that while automation does have the potential to reduce the overhead to play the game, it can lead to player frustration in several ways. Automating routine in-game activities and game progression can lead to severe awareness deficits. Automation of rule enforcement and management of the game state can streamline gameplay, but can lead to scenarios where players would prefer more control over the game. The negative space around the active game area is important to consider for storage of digital artifacts and physical objects above the table. Finally the digitization and automation of the games did not reduce social interaction, making digital tabletops a promising platform for social games.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The construction of domestic violence shifted and changed as this issue was forced from the private shadows to the public stage. This dissertation explores how government policy initiatives - Bill 117: An Act to Better Protect Victims of Domestic Violence and the Domestic Violence Action Plan (DVAP) - shaped our understanding of domestic violence as a social problem in the first decade of the twenty-first century in Ontario. Specifically, it asks whose voices were heard, whose were silenced, how domestic violence was conceptualized by various stakeholders. In order to do this I analyzed the texts of Bill 117, its debates, the DVAP, as well as fourteen in-depth interviews with anti-violence advocates in Ontario to shed light on their construction of the domestic violence problem. Then I examined who (both state and non-state actors) regarded the work as ‘successful’, flawed  or wholly ineffective. In particular, I focused on the claims and counter-claims advanced by MPPs, other government officials, feminist or other women’s group advocates and men’s or fathers’ rights group supporters and organizations. The key themes derived from the textual analysis of documents and the interviews encapsulate the key issues which formed the dominant construction of domestic violence in Ontario between 2000 and 2009: the never-ending struggles over funding, debates surrounding issues of rights and responsibilities, solutions proposed to address domestic violence, and finally the continued appearance of deserving and undeserving victims in public policy. This exploration is important because it speaks to issues of power, given that within and between these advocacy groups certain voices are privileged and silenced to varying degrees, and the outcomes of these complex processes contribute to the shaping of public policy and perceptions outside the state apparatus.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Patterns of community assembly among organisms are highly influenced by the ecological traits and strategies of the species that make up those communities. The conservation of ancestral traits can be important in determining how closely related species partition space and habitat on a local scale. Shared ecological traits and strategies of closely related species suggest that they should overlap in space and use similar habitats. However, ecological similarity may result in fitness costs when closely related species live together. Previous work on birds suggests that close relatives avoid each other by using different habitats. I used the radiation of Dendroica wood-warblers to test these two alternative hypotheses and determine how closely related species partition space and habitat, and how patterns of spatial overlap and habitat use change over evolutionary timescales. I measured territory and habitat overlap among nine sympatric species of Dendroica, Setophaga and Mniotila to determine how time since common ancestry is related to patterns of spatial overlap and habitat use at the Queen's University Biological Station in eastern Ontario. I predicted that closely related species would separate by habitat and not overlap their territories. However, I found that the two most recently diverged species pairs overlap their territories and habitats significantly more than do pairs of more distantly divergent species. This pattern contrasts with previous studies on wood-warblers and the ecologically similar Phylloscopus leaf-warblers. These results suggest that during allopatric speciation Dendroica species do not differentiate in habitat on a local scale; rather, habitat differentiation occurs after closely related species have returned to sympatry.</dcterms:abstract>

Direct comparison of starting material and anionic leaving group free energies results in a poor approximation of βeq, however given that the βeq value for the equilibrium of phenol and phenoxide is -1, the comparison of computed free energies of neutral starting material with neutral phenol product provides βeq approximations that are satisfactorily close to the experimentally derived values.&#xD;
The detailed mechanism of base-promoted hydrolysis and methanolysis of O,Oʹ-dimethyl O-aryl phosphorothioates and phosphates was examined computationally. Generally, with increased leaving group acidity, the reactions showed a tendency toward being concerted (a single transition state) and while substrates with leaving groups with lower acidity tend to involve 5-coordinate phosphorane intermediates. Brønsted βlg values are also computed, and found to be similar to experimentally determined values.&#xD;
The mechanism of palladacycle-promoted phosphorothioate methanolysis is also modeled computationally, showing a change in rate determining step from substrate binding (sspKa of leaving group phenol &lt; 13) to leaving group departure (sspKa of leaving group phenol &gt; 13). The calculations also predict the existence of a stable metal-bound 5-coordinate thiophosphorane intermediate which has been tentatively verified experimentally by others.&#xD;
The preliminary results of a computational investigation into the mechanism for the methanolytic cleavage of a series of N-methyl N-aryl thiobenzamides catalyzed by a similar palladacycle complex is also presented, showing metal-assisted nucleophilic attack and leaving group departure.</dcterms:abstract>
