      <dcterms:abstract>Arsenic (As) contamination presents an ecosystem and human health risk at Giant Mine, a historic gold mine near Yellowknife, NWT currently undergoing the final stages of assessment for remediation.  Arsenic concentration is elevated in sediments at Giant Mine due to contamination from several forms of mine waste including flotation tailings, roaster calcine and impoundment spills. The Giant Mine Remediation Project has stated aims to remediate the surface of the site, including Baker Creek which runs through the property, to a condition that is a productive environmental habitat and spawning ground. &#xD;
Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) and synchrotron-based micro- X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (µXANES), micro-X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) and micro-X-ray diffraction (μXRD) techniques were employed to characterize the As-host phases and determine the solid-phase speciation of As in mine waste and sediments. Arsenopyrite, Fe-oxides, Fe-root plaque, and As_2 O_3 were the major phases identified.&#xD;
	Sediment toxicity was measured using 10-day Chironomus dilutes and 21-day Pimephales promelas exposure tests. The toxicity tests found responses ranging of from 100% mortality at the most contaminated site to no statistical difference to the control groups in the least As contaminated site. Toxicity test chamber conditions were directly monitored with dialysis probes (mini-peepers) and Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGTs).&#xD;
	DGT and mini-peeper deployment in the test beakers allowed for direct correlation of their measurements to trace metal uptake and bioaccumulation during the toxicity tests. Linear regression and ANOVA statistics were used to correlate, when possible, As tissue concentrations in Chironomus dilutes and Pimephales promelas to DGT, mini-peeper and surface water concentration measurements. Statistical analysis was also conducted for Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Sb though these other metal/metalloids were not always suitable for analysis due to constraints caused by detection limits.&#xD;
It was found that DGT As was statistically correlated (r2=0.836 and p&lt;0.0005) to uptake in Pimephales promelas but that total element concentrations were also statistically relevant and slightly better at predicting uptake (r2=0.873 and p&lt;0.0005). Mini-peepers could not be analyzed statistically due to challenges in their use within some highly vegetated sediment samples.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Preeclampsia (PE) is a maternal disorder of pregnancy, characterized by late-onset hypertension and proteinuria. It affects roughly 5-7% of all pregnancies worldwide and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Cigarette smoking in pregnancy is associated with a 33% reduction in the incidence of PE, and this is dose dependent. It is hypothesized that carbon monoxide (CO), a combustion product in cigarettes, may confer cytoprotective and regulatory properties leading to the decreased incidence of PE. CO is produced endogenously by the enzyme heme oxygenase (HO), and it is thought that the manipulation of the HO/CO system in pregnancy can ameliorate or reduce the pathophysiologic signs of PE. &#xD;
The exposure of pregnant mice to 250 ppm CO led to an increase in each of the maternal uterine blood flow, vascularity of the placenta and vessel diameter, with a shift towards angiogenesis in the placenta tissue proteins Exposure of human placental villous explants to 250ppm CO led to a decreased production and release of the soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor -1 (sFlt-1). This molecule is increased in maternal plasma and placenta tissue of women with PE and it binds with molecules of angiogenesis, limiting their ability to interact with the endothelium. Using an AdsFlt-1 PE-like mouse model, the exposure of mice to 250ppm chronic CO prevented the hypertension, proteinuria and glomerular alterations, supporting the use of CO as a future therapeutic for women with PE.&#xD;
We completed a pilot study to evaluate the exposure of healthy volunteers to two, one hour inhalations of 250ppm CO. We determined the half-life of CO and we provide baseline kinetics data for males and females following CO inhalation. These data are important for future therapeutic studies in order to better establish proper dosing, concentration of CO and method of delivery.&#xD;
The results of this thesis contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of PE and provide evidence to support the use of CO as a therapeutic for this disorder.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Piles are engineering structures which are subjected to axial and lateral loading. In this dissertation, pile load tests were performed on a full-scale fabricated pile to understand lateral pile responses under static and cyclic loading. The experiments were performed on a fabricated test pile at the Geo-Engineering Laboratory at Queen's University. Dry loose Olimag Synthetic Olivine sand was used as the test soil. &#xD;
Instrumentation  including axial strain gauges, null sensors (earth pressure sensors) and string potentiometers were used to monitor pile responses throughout the tests. What differentiates the current study from previous investigations is direct measurements of lateral earth pressure on a test pile using those null sensors with conventional measurements of curvature and deformation. The null sensors of Talesnick (2005) have ‘infinite stiffness’ and calibration that is almost independent of the soil type, soil condition and stress history, qualities that make the sensor superior to other commercially available sensors.&#xD;
The initial pile response under static loading was examined. Previous laterally loaded pile test programs have utilized curvature measurements to infer moments, and differentiation of moments to determine lateral forces. Comparisons with the directly measured pressures confirmed the effectiveness of differentiated moments. To understand offshore structures, the behaviour of a pile subjected to cyclic loading is examined and explained by elastic soil response at low load levels and the progressive development of inelastic response at higher load levels. In addition, the loading condition (i.e. two-way versus one-way loading) was found to have a substantial effect on pile responses. The pressure distributions for two-way cyclic loading suggest that the lateral pressure is proportional to displacement with peak pressures near the ground surface during elastic responses. The peak lateral pressures move deeper towards the point of rotation with increasing cyclic loads to generate inelastic responses. However, the lateral pressure response is consistently inelastic for one-way loading.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lakes in the Adirondack Park (NY, USA) are undergoing chemical recovery from acidification. There is now a pressing research need to define recovery targets for acid-impacted sites. Researchers attempting to designate such targets are hampered by two issues: 1) a lack of long-term monitoring data, and 2) the influence of multiple stressors on recovering lakes. This thesis addresses both difficulties by applying paleolimnological techniques within a regional reference lake framework. Using a set of stringent selection criteria, 31 lakes protected from acidification, eutrophication, road salt seepage, and piscivore introductions were identified from 1,469 Adirondack lakes. Ordination techniques showed that the lakes are representative of 24-36% of the chemical/morphological variation of Adirondack lakes. Qualitative and quantitative historic analyses found that many of the lakes experienced early watershed and/or fisheries disturbance, highlighting the danger of assuming that a lake’s condition remains static over time. A top-bottom paleolimnological study revealed that the reference lakes have undergone a ‘shifting baseline’ in species assemblages, with increases in colonial and/or warm-water chrysophyte taxa from pre-1900 to present, changes most likely due to regional warming and/or oligotrophication. A subset of three reference lakes were then paired with two Adirondack lakes that acidified and are undergoing chemical recovery from acidification. The acidified  lakes underwent a significant shift in species composition since the 1995 implementation of the US Acid Rain Program, indicating biological recovery from acidification.  However, both reference and acidified lakes showed increases in colonial chrysophytes since ca. 1970-1980, a trend correlated with mean annual air temperature and ice-cover measures in the two reference lakes. Long-term species changes in acidified/reference lakes suggest that the recovering lakes will not return to their pre-disturbance state but will instead move to a state characterized by an increased abundance of colonial taxa/warm-water species. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the utility of pairing paleolimnological techniques with a regional reference site dataset for tracking shifting baselines and defining recovery targets, a method that could be applied to examine other stressors in other regions, thereby addressing a critical management need.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A novel compacted, torrefied, spherical biomass pellet, known as the "Q'Pellet", is&#xD;
aimed at overcoming the challenges of modern biomass pellets by building on the&#xD;
bene fits of torrefaction and utilizing the durability of a sphere. Pellets were made&#xD;
from both untreated hybrid poplar sawdust and material that had been partially&#xD;
torrefied at 250 C, allowing the torrefaction and pelletizing stages to be decoupled.&#xD;
A pelletizing die pre-heated to 280 C was successfully used to heat and torrefy room&#xD;
temperature raw and pre-torrefi ed material, greatly reducing the time required to&#xD;
produce each pellet.&#xD;
All Q'Pellets demonstrated 100% mechanical durability, and did not abrade during&#xD;
a tumbling can test or fracture during an impact resistance (drop) test. The gross&#xD;
calori fic value (GCV), ash and nitrogen content of pellets produced from raw hybrid&#xD;
poplar were 21.29+/-0.08 MJ/kg, 2.42+/-0.23 wt%, and &lt;0.01 wt%, respectively.&#xD;
The GCV, ash and nitrogen content of pellets produced from pre-torre ed material&#xD;
were 21.25+/-0.34 MJ/kg, 3.58+/-1.11 wt%, and 0.42+/-0.03 wt%, respectively. The&#xD;
Q'Pellet was compared to biomass fuel speci fications in Europe and North America.&#xD;
The experiments performed herein provided an understanding of the material and&#xD;
process properties and limitations. Design speci fications for the development of a&#xD;
continuous pelletizing process were outlined. BGM Metalworks Inc has been hired by&#xD;
Queen's University to assist in the design and to fabricate the continuous pelletizing&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis digital control techniques for two receiver front-end components i.e. the downconverter mixer and the modulator are presented. With decrease in size of CMOS-based geometries, decrease in performance and yield of analog components has become an issue. Using the digital components on a System-on-Chip to account for the shortcoming in analog circuitry and thereby developing 'self-calibrating' systems has become a reliable way to address this issue. In the telecommunications industry, this is directly correlated to lower post-fabrication testing times, quicker product development and lower overhead costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first design presented is a 0.13 um CMOS mixer with variable gain capability. A Digital Assist system was put in place to extend the 3-dB bandwidth of the system using a microcontroller. An interpolation routine was used to predict the bias voltages based on variations in frequency and desired input power. The digital-to-analog converter on the  microcontroller was used to set the required bias voltages. The mixer's bandwidth was extended from 12GHz to 15GHz using digital assist. The gain of the mixer with the digital assist in place could be varied from 1.2-9.8dB.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second design presented is a 5.4GHz multi-scheme modulator fabricated in 0.13 um CMOS technology. The modulator is capable of carrying out quadrature amplitude modulation as well as phase-shift keying modulation. The modulator makes use of a novel OTA design to generate a set of orthogonal basis vectors which allows for facile mapping of the modulated data on the I-Q plane. The modulator  carries out modulation in 4-PSK, 8-PSK, 4-QAM and 16-QAM modes with a maximum error vector magnitude of only 8.51%. A digital assist model to attain ubiquitous operation inside a system is also presented for this modulator.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents adaptive control techniques to improve the stability and performance of grid-tied single-phase inverter systems. There are three main control systems involved in the conversion of DC to AC power: a synchronizer, a current-controller, and a DC-bus controller. The focus of this thesis is to create a control system which responds to the changing operating conditions.&#xD;
In order to adapt to changing operating conditions, estimations of the variables which influence stability and performance are necessary. A synchronization system is proposed, which delivers very accurate estimation of the grid frequency and voltage amplitude across all operating conditions. The synchronization system also provides an accurate and normalized set of orthogonal vectors for the AC output current reference phase. An adaptive parameter estimation technique is proposed to passively estimate the LCL-filter parameters and DC input current.&#xD;
Using the parameter estimations of the output filter, an adaptive state-feedback system is proposed. Next, a frequency-adaptive current controller is proposed, which dynamically tunes to the frequency provided by the synchronizer. Finally, the DC-bus controller is enhanced with the grid-voltage estimate and DC current estimator.&#xD;
The proposed techniques are verified for performance and stability though simulation and experimental results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An organism’s entire life history - the timing of development, reproduction, senescence and death - can depend on the nature of selection for reproductive age. The outcome of selection will depend both on the particular features of the selective environment and on the genetic architecture of life history in the population. The genetic architecture is highly complex and itself variable in response to selection. Various features of the architecture, including available genetic variation, pleiotropy, epistasis, intersexual genetic correlation, mitochondrial genomes and mito-nuclear interactions all play a role in determining the trajectory of life history evolution, and to interact with one another in doing so.&#xD;
Using eleven laboratory-adapted populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have been subject to controlled long-term selection for differing ages of reproduction, I undertook several experiments that help characterize how these aspects of genetic architecture have contributed to the life history of each population. These experiments combined assays of life history trait values in the standing genetic variation with manipulations of mutation accumulation rate and hybridization, to better understand the nature of selection shaping each life history.&#xD;
I found surprisingly strong positive pleiotropy between early reproduction and longevity, sufficient to maintain a stable ‘surplus’ life span lasting several weeks post-selection. Selection for extremely early reproduction, on the other hand, induced pleiotropic costs to reproductive traits in each sex in a trade-off with development time. Characterization of the intersexual genetic architecture for life span revealed it was largely sex-limited in nature, consistent with a history of intralocus sexual conflict affecting the trait. There was also evidence, however, that mutations affecting life span might interact to reinforce their effects, and that the resulting costs were manifested in both sexes. Selection on mitochondrial genomes in isolation did not contribute to evolution of age-specific reproduction, but mito-nuclear coadaptation was clearly important to its evolution for males in particular.&#xD;
Together, these results expand our understanding of how age-specific selection shapes life history in a popular model organism. They can be used to guide future research in this system and allow us to pose important questions to be tested in other species as well.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In today’s database server environments, multiple types of workloads, such as on-line transaction processing, business intelligence and administrative utilities, can be present in a system simultaneously. Workloads may have different levels of business importance and distinct performance objectives. When the workloads execute concurrently on a database server, interference may occur and result in the workloads failing to meet the performance objectives and the database server suffering severe performance degradation.&#xD;
To evaluate and classify the existing workload management systems and techniques, we develop a taxonomy of workload management techniques. The taxonomy categorizes workload management techniques into multiple classes and illustrates a workload management process.&#xD;
We propose a general framework for autonomic workload management for database management systems (DBMSs) to dynamically monitor and control the flow of the workloads and help DBMSs achieve the performance objectives without human intervention. Our framework consists of multiple workload management techniques and performance monitor functions, and implements the monitor–analyze–plan–execute loop suggested in autonomic computing principles. When a performance issue arises, our framework provides the ability to dynamically detect the issue and to initiate and coordinate the workload management techniques.&#xD;
To detect severe performance degradation in database systems, we propose the use of indicators. We demonstrate a learning-based approach to identify a set of internal DBMS monitor metrics that best indicate the problem. We illustrate and validate our framework and approaches using a prototype system implemented on top of IBM DB2 Workload Manager. Our prototype system leverages the existing workload management facilities and implements a set of corresponding controllers to adapt to dynamic and mixed workloads while protecting DBMSs against severe performance degradation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Much of the research in software engineering focuses on understanding the dynamic nature of software systems. Such research typically uses automated instrumentation or profiling techniques on the code. In this thesis, we examine logs as another source of dynamic information. Such information is generated from statements inserted into the code during development to draw the attention of system operators and developers to important run-time events. Such statements reflect the rich experience of system experts. The rich content of logs has led to a new market for log management applications that assist in storing, querying and analyzing logs. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated the importance of logs in understanding and improving software systems. However, developers often treat logs as textual data. We believe that logs have much more potential in assisting developers. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose Log Engineering to systematically leverage logs in order to support the development of ultra-large scale systems.&#xD;
To motivate this thesis, we first conduct a literature review on the state-of-the-art of software log mining. We find that logging statements and logs from the development environment are rarely leveraged by prior research. Further, current practices of software log mining tend to be ad hoc and do not scale well.&#xD;
To better understand the current practice of leveraging logs, we study the challenge of understanding logs and study the evolution of logs. We find that knowledge derived from development repositories, such as issue reports, can assist in understanding logs. We also find that logs co-evolve with the code, and that changes to logs are often made without considering the needs of Log Processing Apps that surround the software system. These findings highlight the need for better documentation and tracking approaches for logs.&#xD;
We then propose log mining approaches to assist the development of systems. We first find that logging characteristics provide strong indicators of defect-prone source code files. Hence, code quality improvement efforts should focus on the code with large amounts of logging statements or their churn. Finally, we present a log mining approach to assist in verifying the deployment of Big Data Analytics applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the relationship between wisdom and identity in Old English and Old Norse-Icelandic literature. At present, the study of medieval wisdom is largely tangential to the study of proverbs and maxims. This dissertation makes wisdom its primary object of study; it sees wisdom not just as a literary category, but also as a cultural discourse found in texts not usually included in the wisdom canon. I therefore examine both wisdom literature and wisdom in literature. The central characteristic of wisdom, I argue, is its liminality. The biblical question “Where is wisdom to be found?” is difficult to answer because of wisdom’s in-between-ness: it is ever between individuals, communities, and times (Job 28:12 Douay-Rheims). As a liminal discourse, wisdom both grounds and problematizes identity in Old English and Old Norse-Icelandic literature. After a preliminary chapter that defines key terms such as “wisdom” and “wisdom literature,” I examine heroic wisdom in three characters who are defined by their wise traits and skills and yet who are ultimately betrayed by wisdom to death or exile. The implications of this problematic relation to wisdom are then examined in the next chapter, which analyzes the composition of wisdom in proverb poems. Like the wise hero, the poets represented in these poems blend their own voices with the voice of community, demonstrating that identity is open and therefore in need of constant revision. Next I examine how the liminality of wisdom is embodied in the figure of the wise monster, who negatively marks the boundaries of society and its desires. This then leads to a study of the reception of wisdom in chapter six, which focuses on instruction poems. Like narratives of wise monsters, these texts present lore as the nostalgic remnant of a tradition that defines identity, in this case the identity of a community. However, nostalgia assumes loss, and these texts also reveal an underlying fear that wisdom, the basis of the community’s identity, will be forgotten. Whether communal or individual, identity in this literature is both formed and threatened by liminal wisdom.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multimode devices play an increasingly important role in both communication and sensing systems. Mode division multiplexing (MDM) in multimode fiber (MMF) is becoming a promising method to further increase the capacity of optical transmission link with a controllable mode coupler. Similarly, optic sensors based on core-cladding-mode interference can be widely used in measurement of refractive index (RI), temperature and strain.&#xD;
Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in single mode operation have been extensively studied as in-line optical components for both communication and sensing applications. In recent years, research has been extended to FBGs in few-mode operation as mode couplers in MDM applications. Experimentally, mode conversion from fundamental linear polarization (LP) mode LP01 to higher order LP11 mode in two-mode FBG (TMFBG) has been observed. Index asymmetry and electric field distortion induced by ultraviolet (UV) side illumination in fabrication of FBG make the two modes no longer orthogonal. However, its spectrum analysis mainly depends on experimental data and software simulation using the complex finite element method (FEM). Here a simpler theoretical model based on coupled mode theory (CMT) and Runge-Kutta method (RKM) is proposed. An analytical expression of the mode coupling coefficient is derived and the modeling results match very well with experimental data.&#xD;
 Abrupt fiber tapers allow power transfer between core and cladding modes and show promise as RI sensing components when two abrupt tapers are cascaded into an in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The main advantage of the MZI taper sensor is its low manufacturing cost. However, the optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) used as the receiver and demodulation device in the conventional setup is still expensive. Three simplified schemes of fiber taper MZI RI sensor systems are designed and demonstrated experimentally. The transmitter and the demodulation devices for the three schemes are a single wavelength laser and a photodetector (PD), two modulated lasers and a PD together with data acquisition and processing module, and a broadband source (BBS) and a PD together with matched MZI, respectively. In all those implementations OSA is not required, which significantly lowers the cost and leads to easy integration. Although extra modulation/demodulation devices are required, the second implementation has the best performance. Automatic operation is realized by LabVIEW programming. High sensitivity (2371 mV/RI unit (RIU)) and high stability are achieved experimentally. Those new schemes have great potential to be applied to other interferometric optic sensor systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Quantum dots and nanorods are becoming increasingly important structures due to their potential applications that range from photovoltaic devices to medicine. The majority of the research on carrier dynamics in these structures has been in the optical regime, with little work performed at Terahertz frequencies where excitonic dynamics can be more directly probed. In this work, we examine theoretically the interaction of Terahertz radiation with colloidal CdSe nanorods to determine the dynamics of excitons generated via a short optical pulse. We calculate the energies and wavefunctions for the excitons within the envelope function approximation in the low density limit where there is at most one exciton per nanorod. The linear Terahertz transmittance and absorbance is found for nanorods that are approximately 70 nm in length and 7 nm in diameter and are compared with experimental results that have shown the first observation of intra-excitonic transitions in nanorods. We find absorbance peaks at 8.5 THz and 11 THz that result from polarizations in the longitudinal (rod axis) and transverse directions respectively. Our theoretical results show that the 8.5 THz and 11 Thz peaks are due to 1s-2pz and 1s-2px transitions respectively. The theoretical absorbance spectra is in good agreement with the experimental one and show that only the ground state is significantly populated 1 ps after optical excitation. This provides strong evidence of rapid trapping of excited holes into the ligand used to passivate the nanorods. A full set of dynamical equations were then constructed from Heisenberg's equation of motion, and were used to model the excitonic correlations as a function of time. Transmittance and absorbance were calculated for different nanorod orientations and electric field strengths in both the linear and nonlinear regime. These results were then averaged over nanorod orientation in order to more accurately reflect experimental conditions. Nonlinearity was found to become significant at peak pulse field strengths of 7 kV/cm and greater. Due to two-photon processes, we predict the 2pz-3dz transition that is not observed in the linear regime will be clearly seen in the nonlinear absorbance spectrum.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used in many fault detection and identification (FDI) applications due to their pattern recognition abilities. In this study, two ANNs, a supervised network based on Backpropagation (BP) learning and an unsupervised network based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART-2A), were tested for FDI on an automated assembly machine and compared to a conventional rule-based method. Three greyscale sensors and two redundant limit switches were used as cost-effective sensors to monitor the machine's operating condition. &#xD;
&#xD;
To test each method, sensor data were collected while the machine operated under normal conditions, as well as 10 fault conditions. Features were selected from the raw sensor data to create data sets for training and testing. The performance of the methods was evaluated with respect to their ability to detect and identify known, unknown and multiple faults. Their modelling and computational requirements were also considered as performance measures. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results showed that all three methods were able to achieve perfect classification with the test data sets; however, the BP method could not classify unknown or multiple faults. In all cases, the performance depended on careful tuning of each method’s parameters. The BP method required an ideal number of neurons in the hidden layer and good initialization. The ART-2A method required tuning of its classification parameter. The rule-based method required tuning of its thresholds. Although it was found that the rule-based system required more effort to set up, it was judged to be more useful when unknown or multiple faults were present. The ART-2A network created new outputs for these conditions, but it could not give any more information as to what the new fault was. By contrast, the rule-based method was able to generate symptoms that clearly identified the unknown and multiple fault conditions. Thus, the rule-based method was judged to be the best overall method for this type of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is recommended that future work examine the application of computer vision-based techniques to FDI with the assembly machine. The results from this study, using cost-effective sensors, could then be used as a performance benchmark for image-based sensors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study aimed to gain an understanding of changing active layer dynamics in the High Arctic, specifically in terms of understanding the spatial distribution of mudboils to identify climatic and landscape controls, and active layer processes driving their formation. Systematic mapping of mudboils and sediment and water sampling was undertaken at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut in 2012 and 2013. Based on borehole stratigraphic profiles taken at CBAWO, three primary soil units were determined: mudboils at surface; overburden (soil) material; and a grey, fine-grained layer at approximately 80cm depth. These soil classes were used for comparison to gain an understanding of the properties and origins of the mudboil materials. Results indicate that these features only occur late in the melt season during exceptionally warm years (2007, 2011, and 2012) and in some cases closely follow major rainfall events. High-resolution satellite imagery was analyzed to determine landscape controls over mudboil formation. Notably, mudboils were significantly associated with bare soil and polar semi-desert vegetation settings, corresponding to increased active layer depth and rate of thaw when compared to more vegetated areas. Further, localized occurrence of mudboils appears to be related to differential soil moisture retention and spatially heterogeneous soil water pressurization due to thaw into the ice-rich transient layer in warm years. We hypothesize that the locally drier locations develop soil ped structures that contribute to diapir development and mud ejection when seasonal melt and hydraulic conditions pressurize soil water. Geotechnical and geochemical analysis of soil samples indicates that mudboils at surface do not significantly differ in terms of composition and physical properties from the undisturbed overburden material. This is consistent with a fine-grained slurry likely being generated in situ from a parent bed and subsequently ejected to surface. This research provides insights into the processes and landscape controls over mudboil formation to aid in understanding localized soil water response to deep summer thaw, with implications for surface water quality and predictions and potential mitigation of permafrost-related degradation and disturbance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Self-reported health (SRH) tends to decline slower as people age compared to the decline of their objective health. If individuals believe they are in good health but actually are in poor health, their perceived susceptibility to disease may be low. Consequently, those individuals may feel less compelled to improve their health, which would make them a higher risk population. This project aims to examine the association of SRH and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in senior women, and whether personal and interpersonal dimensions help explain the degree to which SRH corresponds with MetS. &#xD;
Data are from the Kingston Senior Women Study (KSWS, n=100, 65 years of age and older). KSWS participants completed a questionnaire on their social background, psychosocial conditions, health behaviours, and SRH. Participants also provided physiological measures and medical information, so that MetS could be assessed, following the harmonized definition. MetS is a cluster of at least three of the following criteria: obesity, elevated blood pressure, low level of HDL cholesterol, raised triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose. Two categories represented the correspondence between SRH and MetS: those who have a congruent perception of their health and those who overestimated it. &#xD;
Greater physical activity was associated with higher SRH (OR: 1.10; 95%CI: 1.01 – 1.20) and lower odds of MetS (OR: 0.64, 95%CI: 0.47 – 0.88) among the participants. However, only social network size was associated with lower odds of health overestimation (OR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.26 – 0.80). &#xD;
Larger social networks may give access older women to a greater source of information about their own health, leading possibly to more accurate assessments of health. Such information can be conveyed as feedback from close ties. This information can also be conveyed as a more accurate perception of the health of their reference group when self-assessing their own health. Findings of this study may help identify women who are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease but who may be less likely to participate in health promotion programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Software development is a largely collaborative effort, of which the actual encoding of program logic in source code is a relatively small part. Software developers have to collaborate effectively and communicate with their peers in order to avoid coordination problems. To date, little is known how developer communication during software development activities impacts the quality and evolution of a software.&#xD;
In this thesis, we present and evaluate tools and techniques to recover communication data from traces of the software development activities. With this data, we study the impact of developer communication on the quality and evolution of the software through an in-depth investigation of the role of developer communication during software development activities. Through multiple case-studies on a broad spectrum of open-source software projects, we find that communication between developers stands in a direct relationship to the quality of the software. Our findings demonstrate that our models based on developer communication explain software defects as well as state-of-the art models that are based on technical information such as code and process metrics, and that social information metrics are orthogonal to these traditional metrics, leading to a more complete and integrated view on software defects. In addition, we find that communication between developers plays a important role in maintaining a healthy contribution management process, which is one of the key factors to the successful evolution of the software. Source code contributors who are part of the community surrounding open-source projects are available for limited times, and long communication times can lead to the loss of valuable contributions.&#xD;
Our thesis illustrates that software development is an intricate and complex process that is strongly influenced by the social interactions between the stakeholders involved in the development activities. A traditional view based solely on technical aspects of software development such as source code size and complexity, while valuable, limits our understanding of software development activities. The research presented in this thesis consists of a first step towards gaining a more holistic view on software development activities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A research project submitted to fulfill the requirements of the Master of Environmental Studies (MES) degree in the School of Environmental Studies at Queen's University, Kingston ON -- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are found ubiquitously throughout the environment.

In particular, these compounds can be found in household consumer products such as paints and related organic solvents. Exposure to these compounds has been associated with adverse health effects. Of the BTEX compounds, benzene has been identified as a human carcinogen. Maternal inhalation of benzene may result in fetal exposure through transplacental migration from mother to fetus. To date, the specific mechanism of benzene toxicity remains unknown, but there is enough evidence to conclude that benzene exerts its toxic effects through reactive metabolites. Since pregnant mothers spend much of their time in the household environment, there is the possibility for in utero benzene exposure from indoor paints and paint solvents. Here, a review of VOC and BTEX properties is given, as well as current regulations and components of paints. This information is followed by a risk assessment for in utero exposure to paint fumes containing benzene as a model BTEX compound, using available data regarding human exposure and potential hazards to the fetus. Hazardous exposure of the fetus to paint fumes may occur at the earliest stages of gestation; however, as data used for risk quantification was limited, further research is needed to confirm this conclusion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Message Passing Interface (MPI), which dominates the supercomputing programming environment, &#xD;
is used to orchestrate and fulfill communication in High Performance Computing (HPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
How far HPC programs can scale depends in large part &#xD;
on the ability to achieve fast communication; and to overlap communication with computation or&#xD;
communication with communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation proposes a new asynchronous solution to the nonblocking Rendezvous protocol used&#xD;
between pairs of processes to transfer large payloads. On top of enforcing communication/computation&#xD;
overlapping in a comprehensive way, the proposal trumps existing network device-agnostic&#xD;
asynchronous solutions by being memory-scalable and by avoiding brute force strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Achieving overlapping between communication and computation is important; but each&#xD;
communication is also expected to generate minimal latency. In that respect, the &#xD;
processing of the queues meant to hold messages pending reception inside the MPI middleware is&#xD;
expected to be fast. Currently though, that processing slows down when program scales grow.&#xD;
This research presents a novel scalability-driven message queue whose processing skips &#xD;
altogether large portions of queue items that are deterministically guaranteed to lead to  &#xD;
unfruitful searches. For having little sensitivity to program sizes, the proposed message &#xD;
queue maintains a very good performance, &#xD;
on top of displaying a low and flattening memory footprint growth pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
Due to the blocking nature of its required synchronizations, the one-sided&#xD;
communication model of MPI creates both communication/computation and communication/communication&#xD;
serializations. This research fixes these issues and latency-related inefficiencies documented for &#xD;
MPI one-sided communications by proposing completely nonblocking  and non-serializing versions for &#xD;
those synchronizations. The improvements, meant for consideration in a future MPI standard, &#xD;
also allow new classes of programs to be more efficiently expressed in MPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, a persistent distributed service is designed over MPI to show its impacts&#xD;
at large scales beyond communication-only activities. &#xD;
MPI is analyzed in situations of resource exhaustion, partial failure and heavy use of internal&#xD;
objects for communicating and non-communicating routines. Important scalability issues are revealed&#xD;
and solution approaches are put forth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging liquid-handling technique that facilitates manipulation of discrete droplets across an array of electrodes. Although the working principle of droplet movement is still under debate, it has gained significant interest as the technique has been applied to various applications in biology, chemistry and medicine. With recent advances in rapid prototyping and multilayer fabrication techniques using printed circuit boards, DMF has become an attractive and alternative solution to conventional macroscale fluidics techniques with additional capability of sample size reduction, faster analysis time, full automation, and multiplexing.&#xD;
In this thesis, we explore the use of DMF for human plasma protein depletion due to its multiple advantages. The high abundance of human serum albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulins (Igs), which constitute 80% of total plasma proteins, is a major challenge in proteome studies. Unfortunately, conventional methods to deplete high abundant proteins (e.g. macro LC-columns) are labour-intensive, require dilution of sample, and run the risk of sample loss. Furthermore, most techniques lack the ability to process multiple samples simultaneously. Hence, we developed a new method of protein depletion using anti-HSA and Protein A/G immobilized paramagnetic beads manipulated by DMF to deplete HSA and IgG from human plasma. &#xD;
Toward this goal, prototype DMF devices and electronic controller were designed, built and characterized (Chapter 2). Preliminary depletion experiments were first optimized in-tubes and then adapted for DMF manually (Chapter 3). At last, the entire depletion process was performed on DMF using an automated controller system (Chapter 4). Results showed that the protein depletion efficiency for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and HSA in 10 minutes for four samples simultaneously was as high as 98%, and an approximately 3-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio after depletion was demonstrated by MALDI-MS analysis. The depletion process is sufficient for a tryptic digest to be performed on a model protein, cytochrome C, where 89% sequence coverage was obtained for a depleted sample. Although some improvements such as on-chip sample processing (e.g. digestion) need to be carried out as future work, we anticipate that the new technique is a significant alternative for applications involving protein depletion steps.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to explore ED nurses' experiences in caring for individuals with mental health concerns and their thoughts of what contributes to or inhibits their ability to care for this patient population.  &#xD;
Methodology: A qualitative study using a descriptive phenomenological tradition was guided by the following research questions: a) What are the participants' experiences of the care that is provided to the individual experiencing mental health issues in the ED?, &#xD;
b) What are the participants’ descriptions of elements that contribute to or inhibit their      ability to effectively care for individuals with mental health issues in the ED?, &#xD;
c) What are the participants’ educational experiences related to mental health issues?, and d) What are the participants’ recommendations for the enhancement of mental health nursing care  in the ED? Conclusion: Nurses practicing in the ED stated they lack psychiatric knowledge related to theory, and skills in assessment and least restraint interventions which are often utilized when providing care to mental health patients in the ED.  Mental health education at the undergraduate and practical level relevant for practice in non-psychiatric settings needs to be enhanced and supported at an organizational level.  The use of control interventions such as restraints and seclusion pose significant ethical issues for nurses.  Interventions are often chosen based on the need to ensure the perceived safety for the patient and those within the ED and not necessarily on least restraint practices.  Further barriers include a lack of time, role and responsibility confusion and a fast-paced environment that was not conducive to provide quality care for those with mental health issues.  These factors detracted from care practices, and ED nurses thought their care did not meet the needs of the mental health patient.  These findings will provide a platform for education and organizational efforts that support the ED nurse and optimize care of individuals with mental health issues seeking care in the ED.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examined the impact of active layer detachments (ALDs) on seasonal dissolved nitrogen (N) export from continuous permafrost headwater catchments at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut. Runoff samples collected throughout the summer of 2012 from an undisturbed catchment (Goose; GS) and from one that was disturbed by ALDs (Ptarmigan; PT) were analyzed for dissolved inorganic ions and species of total dissolved N (TDN), including dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved inorganic N (DIN; ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-), and nitrate (NO3-)). Rainfall samples were also collected for dissolved ions analyses. Select runoff and rainfall samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen in NO3- (δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3-, respectively) to determine its origin streamwater. Data from 2012 were compared to predisturbance data to assess the long-term effects of ALDs on N export.  &#xD;
ALDs increased the proportion of DIN/TDN in PT from 4% (predisturbance) to 37% in 2012. The increase in DIN/TDN in PT largely resulted from significantly higher NO3- in runoff. Values of δ18O and δ15N-NO3- as well as correlations between NO3- and major ions indicated that the higher NO3- in PT was due to the exposure of mineral soils in ALDs, which likely reduced NO3- sinks (e.g. plant uptake) and increased inputs of nitrified-NO3-. Values of δ18O-NO3- during initial runoff showed that NO3- supplied from the snowpack overwhelmed NO3- sinks in PT, leading to a twelve-fold higher peak NO3- concentration relative to GS. Low δ18O-NO3- values in runoff during stormflow indicated that inputs of DIN from rainfall (1545 ± 148 and 1838 ± 174 g N-DIN to GS and PT, respectively) supplied less than 30% of the NO3- in both streams, and that exceptionally high NO3- concentrations in PT resulted from flushing of mineralized-NO3- from the mineral soils. Seasonal DIN flux was 95% higher in PT relative to GS, because NO3- export from PT was 27 times that of GS. This is the first study to show that ALDs can have persistent impacts on DIN export from High Arctic watersheds, and that this results from enhanced export of mineralized-NO3-.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ubiquity of social media in today's highly connected society has brought about changes in our teaching and learning. Although there are negative aspects associated with increased connectivity through social media applications, there are also many positive characteristics of social media, which have the positional to engage students in a quality learning environment. Social media promote a sense of community through networking, the co-construction of knowledge through collaboration, and individualized spaces where learning can be differentiated to cater to a variety of learning needs. There are, however, issues surrounding media literacy and accessibility that must be addressed for social media to be effectively incorporated in education. Educator professional development on social media must also be adopted as some educators remain unfamiliar and uncomfortable with these emerging technologies. &#xD;
This project includes a literature review of research pertaining to the positive uses of social media, the societal concerns, potential uses of social media in the classroom, and educator professional development. The product of this project presents sample blog posts to demonstrate both how educators can use social media (in this case, blog posts), and discusses through the blog posts uses of social media in the classroom and issues educators may encounter in relation to social media adoption. &#xD;
The final reflection concludes the project and addresses my own social media use for personal and professional purposes, and my barriers to learning in relation to social media usage. Overall, however, findings suggest that social media have the potential to provide opportunities for teaching and learning in a formal educational setting.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It has always been acknowledged that Venetian art was one of the components from which Annibale Carracci formed his painting style.  There is little documentary evidence concerning Annibale’s career and no Venetian sources to inform us of his contact with Venice.  Taking his art as the primary source, this study examines the timing and nature of Annibale’s contact with Venetian art and artists.  It also investigates the works of his brother Agostino and his cousin Ludovico to discover their roles in directing Annibale towards Venetian art and communicating its qualities to him.  The working method used is comparative analysis between Annibale’s art and key paintings he could have seen in Venice and North Italian collections.  Sources such as the early biographies and the marginal comments in the Carracci’s copy of Vasari’s Vite supplement the primary artistic evidence.  This study compiles and critically engages with analyses from previous scholarship.  The thesis investigates the role of prints in the early orientation of the Carracci in Bologna, particularly those reproducing Titian’s work, and how these affected Annibale’s ideas about composition and the representation of figures and landscape.  It reconsiders Agostino’s role as an engraver of Venetian paintings in transmitting ideas about Venetian art to Annibale.  The Carracci practice of copying other artists is reviewed with a scenario tendered to explain why Annibale copied Correggio and Titian, but not Bassano, Veronese, or Tintoretto.  Annibale’s and Agostino’s early adoption of drawing and painting techniques are investigated, as is Ludovico’s later technical experiments.  Annibale’s travels in northern Italy as suggested by his annotations in Vasari’s Vite are explored in terms of which paintings he could have seen there and how this experience may be reflected in his art.   The most highly Venetianizing period of all three Carracci, from about 1587 to its zenith in 1592, is refined.  Annibale’s study of Venetian art is shown to have been more involved than suggested by previous scholars.  Together with his observation of nature, accomplished draughtsmanship and his study of Correggio, Venetian art informed his mature style before he relocated to Rome.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis we describe the acquisition of high resolution time resolved spectropolarimetric observations of 7 (bright and well understood) Ap stars in Stokes IQUV using the ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the 2m Telescope Bernard Lyot at Pic du Midi Observatory. We compare these observations with those obtained a decade earlier using the MuSiCoS spectropolarimeter to confirm consistency with the older data and provide evidence that both ESPaDOnS and Narval perform as expected in all Stokes parameters.  We demonstrate that our refined longitudinal magnetic field and linear polarisation measurements for these 7 stars are of much greater quality than was previously obtained with MuSiCoS and that the global magnetic properties of these stars are stable over a long timescale. The ultimate aim of these new data is to provide a basis from which mapping of both the magnetic field and abundance structures can be performed on our target stars. &#xD;
&#xD;
We then describe magnetic field mapping of the Ap star Alpha 2 CVn using these data. This mapping is achieved with the use of tomographic inversion of Doppler-broadened Stokes IQUV profiles of a large variety of spectral lines using the INVERS10 Magnetic Doppler imaging code.  We show that not only are the new magnetic field maps of Alpha 2 CVn consistent with a previous generation of maps of Alpha 2 CVn,  but that the same magnetic field topology can be derived from a variety of atomic line sets.  This indicates that the magnetic field we derive for Alpha 2 CVn is a realistic representation of the star's true magnetic topology.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally we investigate surface abundance structures for Alpha 2 CVn for various chemical elements. We investigate the correlation between the location of these abundance features and the magnetic field of Alpha 2 CVn. We will demonstrate that whilst the magnetic field plays a role in the formation of abundance structures, the current theoretical framework does not fully explain what we find from our maps. Ultimately this work motivates future mapping of Ap stars by confirming the reliability of both the instrument and associated data and the mapping technique itself.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ontario Ministry of Education’s guidelines for full-day kindergarten do not specifically mention naptime (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2010). This study sought to address the issue of naptime in full-day  kindergarten. Focus groups and interviews were conducted to understand the perspectives of eighteen parent and teacher participants. Seven of the participants were kindergarten teachers, nine were parents. Two participants qualified to be both teacher and parent.  &#xD;
The main findings from this study demonstrated that parents and teachers considered the following to be advantages of naptime: (1) a nap allows a break that enables students to focus on afternoon learning, (2) a nap allows the behaviour of children to improve (3) some children are young and require a nap, (4) teachers use naptime to complete preparation for the next lesson, and (5) since school is a long day for children, a nap is required to ensure students will remain awake in the afternoon. The disadvantages of kindergarten naptime were identified as: (1) an afternoon nap is not useful for all students, (2) it takes away from time devoted to academics, (3) it negatively affects bedtimes and, (4) managing naptime is problematic. Additionally, more appealing alternatives to a naptime session were suggested: (1) Down Time which refers to activities that are quiet without any expectation that children will sleep, (2) Rest Time which includes an option to sleep or participate in quiet, individual activities, and (3) Quiet Time which is a period of time dedicated to quiet, individual activities without any intention of sleeping. It was suggested that only Junior Kindergarten students need a chance to nap, since it will help them focus in the afternoon. A synthesis of my findings suggests that a 30-minute rest time could be incorporated in the full-day Junior Kindergarten, but not Senior Kindergarten, program at the midday point.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Increased demand for rare earth elements (REEs) for applications in modern technologies has led to an increase in REE exploration. Several deposits are expected to begin mining within a decade, but few studies have examined the possible environmental effects created by these mines.  Metal toxicity is thought to be greater in aqueous environments when metals occur as free ions rather than complexes, and the speciation can also impact the treatment technologies utilized to reduce metal concentrations. This research investigates the mineralogical source of REEs and the mechanism of REE mobility in low-temperature waters that have interacted with pilot plant tailings from the Nechalacho deposit, Northwest Territories. The Nechalacho deposit is owned by Avalon Rare Metals Inc. and located approximately 100 km east of Yellowknife. The deposit is hosted within a hydrothermally altered layered nepheline-sodalite syenite in the peralkaline Blatchford Lake complex. The main REE ore minerals are zircon, fergusonite, allanite, monazite, bastnäsite, and synchisite-parasite. Characterization of the tailings using mineral liberation analyzer (MLA) show that the ore minerals are fine grained and well liberated. Bastnäsite and synchisite-parasite are the only potentially soluble ore minerals at low temperature and near-neutral pH. Shake flask experiments were designed to simulate the interaction of tailings with three different leach waters to identify soluble phases and mobile elements. Decanted solutions from the shake flasks were filtered to 0.45µm and 0.01µm. Speciation modelling of the 0.01µm filtrate suggests that carbonate ligands will form the dominant complexes with the REEs, and &lt;2% occur as free metal ions. Higher proportions of LREEs (1-6%) occur as free metal ions than HREEs (&lt;1%) and LREEs occur in higher concentrations (2 to 8 times greater) than the HREE. REEs were found in the colloidal fraction ([REEcolloid] = [REE0.45µm] – [REE0.01µm]). Ionic strength is the dominant control on distribution of REEs between colloidal and dissolved fraction. Colloids captured on filters from ultrafiltration analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron microanalysis show REEs are hosted in colloidal rare earth minerals (e.g. zircon) and also show colloidal humic acid, Fe-oxides and Mn-oxides. Speciation modeling shows that REE sorption to these phases is probable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As a psychotherapist, my work with thousands of clients over the last two decades has illuminated a theme––when there is a misalignment between one’s values and beliefs and one’s lived experience, dis-ease, discomfort, dissonance and self-alienation take hold. The corollary often being true: An authentic life––living closely aligned with one’s beliefs and values––promotes experiences of health and happiness. Psychological research supports the notion that well-being and happiness are products of living authentically (Brown, Ryan, Laguardia, &amp; Rawsthorne, 2005; Kernis &amp; Goldman, 2006; Wood, Linley, Maltby, Baliousis, &amp; Joseph, 2008). This qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study was a response to my curiosity about the practice of living an aligned life and answered the overarching question: “What is the experience of the conscious practice of authenticity?” with the sub-question: “How does the conscious practice of authenticity relate to transformative learning?” Relevant literature is reviewed in the areas of transformative learning, authenticity, and complexity thinking: particularly the quality of emergence represented in the methodological orientation of the hermeneutic circle. Data collection strategies including interviews, an experiential component of “in the moment” recording, researcher field notes in the form of a commonplace book, and a web-based forum, as well as close readings of relevant literature. Data interpretation was based on a six stage integrative and creative hermeneutic analysis (adapted from Ajjiwa &amp; Higgs, 2007). The stages of interpretation were (1) immersion, (2) understanding, (3) abstraction, (4) synthesis and theme development, (5) illumination and illustration of the phenomenon, (6) integration and critique. The research findings introduced the terms querencia (home or source in a person) and querencetic living (living from one’s inner source or knowing). The findings indicate that querencetic living generates wellness, happiness and peace and is comprised of four parts: 1) knowing our querencia (values, beliefs, needs, feelings), 2) being attuned to our querencia, 3) trusting our knowing/not knowing/changing knowing and 4) enacting our querencia through voice and action. The nature of our querencia is emergent (ever-changing and fluid) where our relationship to our querencia (being attuned, trusting and enacting) is unbending.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Older adults who maintain their cognitive skills and abilities are able to live more independently than those whose skills have deteriorated. The costs (money, time, personnel) associated with providing cognitive stimulation programs to residents in long-term care homes often prohibit the delivery of these programs. The present study explored the efficacy of using volunteers to administer a stimulation program in two long-term care homes. The program focused on stimulating reasoning, attention, and memory abilities using uncomplicated, pen-and-paper exercises. Thirty-six resident participants and 16 volunteer participants were randomly assigned to one of two parallel groups, either the control or stimulation group. For eight weeks, three times each week, control group participants met for standard “friendly visits” (casual conversation between a resident and volunteer) and stimulation group participants met to work through a variety of exercises meant to stimulate the cognitive abilities of residents. Results were analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA and indicated statistically significant Group x Time interactions for Verbal Memory, Non-Verbal Memory, Learning, and in a screening test for verbal fluency. Volunteers completed a post-study questionnaire which indicated that the volunteers in the stimulation group found their skills-based interactions more stimulating for residents. Therefore this study demonstrates that a volunteer-administered cognitive stimulation program can provide measurable gains in the cognitive abilities of older adults. Further studies concerning the role of volunteers in the maintenance of the cognitive abilities of older adults are recommended.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Short annular diffusers were essential components for turbomachines that have been used to expand the air entering the compressor, as interstage ducts between gas generators and power turbines, and on the exhaust gases exiting the turbine. The industrial community was interested and invested in improving diffuser design that was challenging owing to the unfavourable fluid flow effects. Efficient design of fluid flow devices was possible through the complementary use of experimental testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A numerical shape optimization study was undertaken to determine preferential annular diffuser configurations. Experimental data were compared against CFD that simulated the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with two-equation turbulence models.&#xD;
&#xD;
This investigation reached equivalent conclusions with respect to the influences associated with diffuser geometry and swirl. Vorticity effects caused by square tabs, that were not as well understood, were investigated. The tabs were effective in reducing the central toroidal recirculation zone created by a swirling flow, but at a static pressure penalty for the area ratio, AR&lt;2.73, diffusers tested. Results identified several shortcomings in the CFD that typically over-estimated pressure recovery and outlet velocity uniformity; however, properly qualitatively predicted wall pressure distributions and outlet velocity profiles. The use of CFD on modest grids, with preference given to the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model, for annular diffusers that have length to inlet height ratio of 12 and at least AR=2.73 with up to 20-degrees inlet swirl was encouraged as a design tool.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this project was to develop a tool for students to seek professional help if they were suffering from a Major Depressive Episode (MDE). If depression is left untreated, it can affect students‘ academic performance, lead to risky behavior, and put students at a greater risk for suicide (Hankin &amp; Abramson, 2001; McGuffie &amp; Low, 1999). Inspired by recommendation 3.3 from the Principal‘s Commission on Mental Health Final Report to improve the health and wellness of students on the Queen‘s campus, I sought to identify the major barriers that prevented university students who are depressed from seeking professional help. Three major barriers were identified: a lack of perceived need to seek professional help; a lack of knowledge of counselling services; and perceived stigma. After considering the initiatives of other interventions that have attempted to improve professional help-seeking among university students who were suffering from an MDE, I created a tool that incorporates three features to improve help-seeking: self-identification mechanisms; mental health literacy content and destigmatization information; and help-seeking source information. I plan to present this tool to the Commission on Mental Health to improve the health and wellness of students at Queen‘s University.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The first essay shows the presence of discrimination in the allocation of doctoral scholarships using a unique dataset containing the 1901 recipients of 2004-2005 doctoral awards from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). I provide evidence that evaluators give higher scores to candidates in their own discipline and then proceed to distinguish between two types of discrimination: taste-based and screening. This paper is the first to find support for screening discrimination: better candidates have higher scores when they are assessed by evaluators from their discipline, while there is no significant effect for weaker candidates. Moreover, the weakest candidates, those close to the funding threshold, actually have a lower probability of receiving a large award when there is an evaluator from their discipline in their evaluation committee.&#xD;
The second essay models the optimal distribution of government spending when the electoral benefit accrues to the district incumbent and not to the party in power. The model shows that, under certain parameters, more money is spent in core support districts. I test this prediction using the distribution of projects undertaken in the scope of the 2009-2010 Canada Economic Action Plan.&#xD;
The third essay assesses the deterrence of demerit points on the behavior of drivers. To address driver heterogeneity, I use the expiration of points as quasi-exogenous variation in the number of points. I can then compare the probability of a traffic violation for drivers who had the same number of points but now have a different number of demerit points. I find that a 3-point decrease in the number of demerit points through the expiration process increases the probability of a violation in the following two months by 40 to 50 percent, but only for drivers close to the threshold.&#xD;
The last essay studies the impact of a non-refundable tax credit for public transit introduced in July 2006 in Canada. I find no evidence that this tax credit increased the number of trips done using public transit. There is, however, some suggestive evidence that it did induce commuters to purchase monthly passes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the demands of computational science and engineering simulations increase, the size and capabilities of High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are also expected to grow.  Consequently, the software providing the application programming abstractions for the clusters must adapt to meet these demands.  Specifically, the increased cost of interprocessor synchronization and communication in larger systems must be accommodated.  Non-blocking operations that allow communication latency to be hidden by overlapping it with computation have been proposed to mitigate this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this work, we investigate offloading a portion of the communication processing to dedicated hardware in order to support communication/computation overlap efficiently.  We work with the Message Passing Interface (MPI), the de facto standard for parallel programming in HPC environments.  We investigate both point-to-point non-blocking communication and collective operations; our work with collectives focuses on the allgather operation.  We develop designs for both flat and hierarchical cluster topologies and examine both eager and rendezvous communication protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
We also develop a generalized primitive operation with the aim of simplifying further research into non-blocking collectives.  We propose a new algorithm for the non-blocking allgather collective and implement it using this primitive.  The algorithm has constant resource usage even when executing multiple operations simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
We implemented these designs using CORE-Direct offloading support in Mellanox InfiniBand adapters.  We present an evaluation of the designs using microbenchmarks and an application kernel that shows that offloaded non-blocking communication operations can provide latency that is comparable to that of their blocking counterparts while allowing most of the duration of the communication to be overlapped with computation and remaining resilient to process arrival and scheduling variations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
Background  The decrease in children’s outdoor activity and its associated health impacts form the basis for health promotion initiatives to encourage children's outdoor activity.  As gatekeepers to their children’s participation in registered programs, parents must be convinced that the benefits of enrollment in such programs outweigh the costs. A guiding framework is thus needed to help recreation providers identify critical program components and effective messages to attract parents. Purpose The main purpose of this study was to gain insight into parental perceptions of barriers and facilitators to enrolling their children in an outdoor activity program in order to inform the development of an action planning framework for recreation providers. A secondary purpose was to apply the framework to an existing summer activity program implemented by the City of Kingston department of recreation. Methods This qualitative study was guided by Social Marketing principles (i.e., the “4 P’s”: Product, Price, Promotion, Place). Key informants, 18 parents of children 4 to12 years old from 16 different neighbourhoods located in a mid-size Canadian city, participated in 4 focus groups and 7 interviews. Sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis involved both deductive and inductive content analysis. Results Parental intentions to enrol their children in an outdoor activity program were shown to be influenced by barriers and facilitators, related to Product and Price, contained within the following themes, ranked from most to least influential: program safety, program social environment, program structure, child preferences, cost and convenience, skills development, variety of activities, community, the local level, and, staff engagement. The influence of these themes on parental intentions seems to be moderated by the theme of Information transfer, related to Promotion.  Place was not found to influence intentions.  For each theme, a continuum emerged, encompassing both positive and negative influences (e.g. high program safety to lack of program safety) upon parents’ intentions to enrol their children in an outdoor activity program. Conclusions The Social Marketing Framework is useful to inform the development of an action planning framework for recreation providers seeking to enhance enrollment in their outdoor activity programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sign language interpreters (SLI) provide a vital service to the deaf community but also experience high levels of pain and suffer from career threatening musculoskeletal disorders. Balancing work and rest (recovery) may be a useful intervention to help address these concerns. This thesis addresses two specific questions, parsed out of a larger study seeking to determine ideal work to rest ratios for sign language interpreting. The aims of this specific body of work were to evaluate sign language interpreters (SLIs) perceptions of the mental and physical demands associated with different work to rest ratios; and, to measure kinematics during signing, comparing kinematic outcomes between novice and experienced SLIs and over time using the work to rest ratio that was perceived as the least demanding (as identified in aim 1). Nine novice and nine experienced interpreters participated in the study, each interpreting the same ten hours of a university level lecture, over the course of six visits to the laboratory. During each session interpreters worked (“hands in the air”) for 60 minutes, but used a different work to rest strategy in each session. These strategies ranged from 10-minute work, 10-minute rest, to 60 minutes of continuous work with no rest. During each session, participants were instrumented with motion capture and electromyography sensors while interpreting in a simulated working environment. In addition, SLIs were asked to provide feedback about their perceptions of the mental and physical demands associated with each session. The first study in this thesis reports on participant’s subjective feedback about the six different sessions (paper #1); where participants identified the 15-minute work to rest ratio as ideal. The second paper reports on kinematic data from this perceived ideal work to rest ratio (paper #2). Despite interpreting in a work to rest ratio that SLIs perceived as ideal, kinematic variables with known associations to injury risk (joint position, velocity, micro-breaks) readily exceeded reported thresholds.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The vast majority of Adirondack lakes have been impacted since pre-industrial time through either regional (e.g. acidification) or local (e.g. fish stocking, liming, seepage of road salt, cultural eutrophication) environmental disturbances.  Inferring changes related to climate are difficult due to the possible complexities associated with multiple stressors.  Thirty minimally-disturbed ‘reference’ lakes were identified from a database of 1469 lakes using the following selection criteria: &lt;5% shoreline development; a circumneutral pH; and no records of introduction of non-native piscivores (protecting against eutrophication, chronic lake acidification and modifications of trophic structure, respectively).  As such, these ‘reference’ lakes may be useful for isolating the effects of regional changes, including climate warming, from other anthropogenic influences.  A ‘top-bottom’ paleolimnological analysis of diatom assemblages was undertaken to identify changes since pre-industrial times.  The uppermost sediment layer was used to represent present-day diatom assemblages, and a sediment sample from a depth of 20cm was used to represent pre-industrial conditions.  Discostella stelligera, a planktonic diatom taxon, is presently the dominant species in 50% of the lakes, and showed the greatest change.  D. stelligera increased by &gt;10% in 11 of the 30 study lakes.  The measured present-day chemical and physical limnological variables in the study lakes could not predict changes in the abundance of D. stelligera, suggesting that unmeasured variables, such as decreased ice cover, and changes in mixing and stratification patterns, are likely driving the observed changes in diatom assemblages.  Heavily silicified tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species declined by an average of 8.3% across the dataset.  In three of the relatively deep lakes with higher concentrations of phosphorus, another planktonic diatom, A. formosa, was found to increase in abundance.  Additionally, some lakes that were dominated by a high proportion of benthic taxa experienced increases in the relative abundance of benthic taxa over time.    Observed changes in the relative abundances since pre-industrial times are significantly higher than the variation between replicate cores, and between  two ‘pre-industrial’ sediment intervals.  Further studies on the timing of changes in diatom assemblages are necessary to confirm that such changes are consistent with recent changes in climate in the Adirondacks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A Deep Geologic Repository is proposed for a site on the eastern margin of the Michigan Basin at a depth of 680 metres in the Cobourg Formation. A study of the paleo-hydrogeolgical conditions for the area was conducted using numerical simulation of the distribution of natural tracers and the observed hydraulic head. To conduct the study, simulations of the groundwater flow systems were developed for hydraulic head generated from glacial loading cycles to study its effects on advective solute transport. The hydro-mechanical loading during the glacial cycles is assessed using numerical analysis of coupled stress and porewater pressure. The effect of density-dependent flow was assessed in a second study to estimate the degree of penetration of glacially-derived water driven into the basin during periods of glacial loading. Numerical simulations were used to explore the potential freshwater invasion pathways under a variety of conditions. Finally, profiles of 18O and 2H measured in porewater were combined with our understanding of the paleo-hydrogeological conditions derived from the studies above to test the hypothesis that solute transport was diffusion-dominated in this setting.  A series of pure diffusion and advection-diffusion models were developed and the results were compared with profiles of natural water isotopes obtained from the study area.&#xD;
The results of the hydro-mechanical study of glacial impact show the development of significant underpressure during the interstadial periods, especially in the lowest permeability formations. The results also show that the formations have not reached hydrostatic conditions at the present time. These results were verified by comparison to measured environmental heads obtained from the study site. The density-dependent modeling showed that freshwater is capable of reaching the location of the study site through several permeable features. The transport simulations showed that the evolution time starting from a uniform initial condition, and using boundary conditions that are defined by freshwater invasion at several depths agrees with the hydro-geological history of this part of the Basin. The results also show the importance of advection on solute transport from the upper and lower boundaries even in rock of extremely low permeability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this project was to generate a set of actionable recommendations to assist school districts and school administrators and staff to support new occasional teachers during the early stages of their professional careers.  This was done by giving voice to six elementary occasional teachers who were working at the Kindergarten to Grade 6 level in a single school board in southeastern Ontario who reported their shared “entry to the profession” experiences. This project describes the challenges faced by novice supply teachers, and the nature of support systems currently available to new occasional teachers (including their ease of access) and articulates practical suggestions to improve the unique induction to the teaching profession experienced by entry-level Ontario teachers.&#xD;
Phenomenology was used as a framework for this project’s research design which included six semi-structured interviews with participants who had at least one, but not more than five, years of experience as an occasional teacher. Qualitative inductive analysis was used for the interview transcripts to discover patterns, themes, and categories. The six participants in this study described how they approach managing student behaviour in their classrooms, the extent to which they see themselves as professionals, and their overall perspectives regarding occasional teaching in elementary education.  Findings suggest that communication could be established or improved in the following areas: mentor/mentee programs, document accessibility, clear expectations for procedures and day plan formats and contents. The participants of this study suggested 11 different practical recommendations for the improvement of the occasional teacher experience. &#xD;
This research offers three main implications for practice in the field of elementary education. First, teacher preparation programs must work to ensure that prospective occasional teachers are aware of both the challenges that they may face in the field as occasional teachers and approaches for addressing those challenges. Second, supervisors such as principals, vice-principals, and lead teachers in the field of elementary education should be made aware of the challenges faced by occasional teachers. Lastly, schools and school districts should consider establishing formal or informal mentorship opportunities for occasional teachers who are entering the profession or encountering difficulties associated with being a new occasional teacher.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The SNO+ experiment is a kilo-tonne scale liquid scintillator detector located at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. As the successor to the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, SNO+ will use linear alkylbenzene (LAB) as the scintillator to study neutrinos. During the solar phase, ux measurements will be made of low energy neutrinos originating in the Sun. In another phase, 800 kg of tellurium will loaded into the scintillator to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. Measurements will also be made of neutrinos coming from nearby nuclear reactors and from inside Earth's mantle and crust.&#xD;
To enable these multiple physics goals, a sensitive calibration procedure must be carried out in order to fully understand the detector. The optical and energy responses of the detector will be measured with calibration sources deployed throughout the acrylic vessel. These sources must be connected to the observatory deck above the vessel by gas capillaries, optical bres, and signal wires housed in specially designed submersible umbilical cables. The design and fabrication of these umbilical cables is presented. Development work on a deployed radon calibration source will also be described.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The use of Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) is becoming increasingly common in geomechanical practice in addition to their continuing role in hydrogeology.  These models can serve as useful tools for estimating interconnectedness of fractures, leading to estimates of probable block sizes and shapes for a set of input parameters.  However, the development of these models is reliant on assumptions made about collected field data and while constructing the model themselves.  The implications of these biases and assumptions are not well documented.  &#xD;
This work investigates the variables involved in building a Discrete Fracture Network model in order to provide insight into the decisions and assumptions made during the modeling process.  Select assumptions required within the FracMan DFN software pertaining to model selection and construction are evaluated; biases and assumptions relating to field data and how it is collected that may impact the development of DFN input parameters are investigated and limits of the effects of these models on block sizes are determined.  The parameters determined to be critical in determining the overall geometry of the fracture network are ranked according to their relative importance in DFN modelling and according to the relative accuracy of each parameter.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this study, I employ a combination of social semiotics and critical discourse analysis to examine the marketing media from corporate social responsibility campaigns focused on food bank philanthropy and awareness-raising for the issue of hunger. I use media from a sample of six of the largest and most visible corporate food bank philanthropy campaigns to represent a broad range of their differences. Each campaign is analyzed for how the problem of hunger and the solution as food banks are represented. Hunger is represented by these corporations as a problem of a lack of food that can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere, for which families and/or local communities bear responsibility. This typification of the problem of hunger comes packaged conceptually with a characterization of the solution to that problem in food banks represented as a food-focused, charity-based, volunteer-run response that relies on corporate sponsorships and corporate social responsibility programs to harnesses the marketability of hunger to increase donations. These representations are evidence form the basis on an analysis of how the problem of hunger is currently thought about and acted upon in Canada. Claims about hunger exist at a juncture between the resources available and the kinds of responses to hunger that are likely to arise. This study demonstrates what corporate claims about hunger mean in relation to the ongoing development of food banking. This study is also an analysis of a particular case of corporate food bank philanthropy as an example campaign to highlight how the corporate construction of hunger is deployed to obscure, marginalize, and foreclose on the possibility of the emergence of alternative understandings of hunger and approaches beyond food banking based on a charity model. The dominant typification of the problem of hunger by corporations further institutionalizes an inadequate food banking paradigm that cannot address the social underpinnings that lead to the expression of hunger.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In Canada, as in many other affluent nations, private well water consumers remain at risk for gastrointestinal (GI) illness due to fecal contamination of groundwater. There have been numerous documented outbreaks of GI illness related to contaminated drinking water. While the general risk to well water consumers has been established, the risk in southern Ontario is poorly understood. As a preliminary step towards understanding this risk, a study of Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination in private well water was undertaken. Spatial scan statistics were employed to determine the extent of contamination for over 30,000 private wells in southeastern Ontario between 2008 and 2012, inclusive. This analysis revealed one large, temporally stable elevated risk region, and three significant smaller regions within it. The methodology utilized in the primary investigation was then applied to a 2012 dataset for all of southern Ontario, resulting in the identification of three regions of elevated risk.&#xD;
 The presence of E. coli, a traditional fecal indicator organism, indicates lack of water potability. To provide knowledge regarding the origins of fecal contamination in southeastern Ontario, a molecular microbial source tracking (MST) study was undertaken. A quantitative real-time Bacteroidales PCR assay specifically targeting human, bovine, and general (specific to 10 hosts) was optimized and applied to 716 private well water samples. Almost half of the samples showed evidence of human fecal contamination, whereas only 13% contained evidence of bovine fecal contamination. Approximately one quarter of well samples tested positive for the general host Bacteroidales assay, with an additional one quarter testing negative for all MST assays. Additionally, spatial scan statistics revealed a region of human-sourced contamination, which geographically corresponded with the E. coli contamination cluster for the same study year. &#xD;
The presence of E. coli contamination clusters among private wells reveals an at-risk group of well water consumers. As such, public health practitioners may use this information to target well stewardship programs in higher risk regions. Humans were the predominant contributors of fecal contamination to private wells within the primary study region. These findings may enable future preventative measures by providing insight into the true origins of groundwater fecal pollution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In post-conflict settings real and imagined boundaries do a great deal to determine who is inside and who is outside of state-based narratives of peace and prosperity. Based on case studies in Rwanda and Northern Ireland, I provide an analysis of the post-conflict periods and the impact of neoliberal-styled governance on the dynamics of power. I argue that as power shifted, ‘peace’ also entailed a general social pacification, and prosperity equated to greater private profit. However, top-down social engineering has not contained the entire field of social struggle. I examine micro-level interventions taking place on the margins of mainstream discourse that trouble the moralizing state-narratives that seek to legitimate structural violence. Such spaces facilitate alternative values and practices that contribute to sustained social and cultural resilience, as well as forms of resistance.&#xD;
Post-conflict Rwanda and Northern Ireland have been impacted by both coercive and consensual forms of social engineering. In Rwanda, state-based framework laws and forceful regimes of local implementation rely on stark contingencies of reward and punishment to shape and control behaviour in the public sphere. In Northern Ireland, the power-sharing structure of the Belfast Agreement has reinforced ethnic politics, while depoliticizing and instrumentalizing civil society in support of its neoliberal policies.&#xD;
I present ethnographic research and interviews conducted with community organizations in Northern Ireland (Ikon) and Rwanda (Student Association of Genocide Survivors - AERG) that demonstrates how alternative discourses and practices are emerging in the cracks of these top-down systems. I explore Ikon’s use of creative performances and radical theology to create socially resonant cultural spaces that function as temporary autonomous zones. These TAZs unsettle aspects of individual identity while intentionally seeking to destabilize mainstream power dynamics. Unlike Ikon, AERG faces greater public scrutiny and higher political stakes. They demonstrate an adherence to the dominant social script in the public sphere, while exhibiting micro- level agency through trauma healing, and material support in private day-to-day practices. AERG’s performance in the public sphere creates temporary spaces of encounter that exceed the boundaries of official discourse, making their alternative presence felt while remaining illegible to the dominant surveillance frameworks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Movement variability that occurs while performing repetitions of any particular motion can be due to errors in one’s ability to select the required parameters for executing the movement.  However, it has been suggested that an optimal amount of variability exists in a healthy system providing adaptability to varying situations while producing negligible errors.  Investigation of the consistency of movement variability in a system may provide information regarding joint control and integrity since the functionality of a system can be disrupted by injury.  Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is associated with deficits in knee joint stability and mobility, as well as altered movement patterns.  There is value in developing a simple clinical test that can measure knee joint stability and evaluate the degree of knee damage and rate of progress during rehabilitation.  The main objectives were to investigate the normal range of variability during repeated knee extensions in healthy subjects and subjects with a reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament, and to evaluate the reliability of the method.&#xD;
There were 30 participants in the control group and 8 in the subject group.  All were physically active a minimum of 2-3 times per week for a total of 2-3 hours.  Mean variance and mean correlation were used to evaluate variability in this study.  Change in mean variance and mean correlation, standard error of measurement and intra-class correlation coefficient were used to evaluate reliability.&#xD;
The results showed the range of values for movement variability in control and subject groups.  Standard error of measurement indicated mean correlation (1.31% to 2.38%) was more reliable than mean variance (21.80% to 54.87%).  Mean variance and mean correlation significantly increased with speed, and mean correlation was significantly higher for dominant legs during trials at 70 beats per minute.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Historical gold mine tailings at several sites in Nova Scotia, Canada are publicly accessible and may pose a threat to human and ecosystem health because of high arsenic (As) concentrations in the tailings (max 25 wt.%) and associated pore waters (up to 100 mg/L). Two of these sites, Montague and Goldenville, are under consideration for remediation. Similar tailings sites have been cleaned up by covering the mine wastes with soil. However, the tailings at Montague and Goldenville have been weathering for at least 70 years, leading to a wide range of As-bearing secondary minerals which may dissolve under a soil cover, releasing As to local waters. The challenge of remediating these heterogeneous tailings lies in the different Eh-pH niches in which iron arsenates (oxidizing, acidic), calcium-iron-arsenates (oxidizing, alkaline), and sulfides (reducing) are stable. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) characterize pre-remediation geochemical controls on As mobility in subsurface tailings; 2) establish hydrogeological influences on As mobility; and 3) identify geochemical changes that result when a low organic soil cover is applied to the tailings.&#xD;
Pore water measurements were combined with bulk chemistry, scanning electron microscopy, and synchrotron micro-X-ray diffraction analyses, which were used to characterize the mineralogical composition of the tailings. Groundwater and surface water flow regimes throughout the tailings were defined through the use of piezometers and hydraulic conductivity measurements. Laboratory leaching experiments were used to assess the effects of a soil cover on the tailings.&#xD;
Variable weathering conditions over time have resulted in a continuum of saturation and redox environments and a range of As hosts in the tailings. In some areas, tailings pore waters are mixing with stream waters leading to As transport beyond the tailings. Applying a low organic soil cover does not induce reducing conditions in the tailings or cause dissolved As concentrations to increase compared to field pore water concentrations. This type of soil cover is effective in slowing sulfide mineral oxidation while maintaining stable conditions for secondary As-phases. The results of this research can be used to inform remediation decisions and guide ongoing environmental management of historical gold mine sites.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inquiry into fairness of a test has been recognized as an important research activity to direct efforts to reduce bias and discrimination against certain groups of test takers, create equal opportunities for test takers to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, and promote social justice. Given the importance of fairness in testing, my research examined the fairness of one large-scale high-stakes test in China—the Graduate School Entrance English Exam (GSEEE). To guide this doctoral research, I first drew on four sources of conceptual and empirical work to identify key issues encompassing test fairness. Informed by Willingham’s conceptual framework, I investigated the fairness of the GSEEE in two studies. In Study 1, I examined whether the GSEEE test items functioned differentially and brought potential bias towards test taker groups based on gender and academic background. In Study 2, I investigated perceptions of the fairness of the GSEEE as expressed by program administrators, teachers, and test takers. In conclusion, this research offers empirical information with regard to the fairness of the GSEEE from psychometric and stakeholder perspectives. The research also provides evidence that the conceptualization of test fairness is mediated by contextualized beliefs and traditions. Whether a test is perceived as fair or not is derived from considerations in both the testing process and the broad socio-cultural context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, there are various electrokinetic phenomena which are utilized in a wide range of applications, ranging from microfluidics and colloid and interface science to electrochemistry. However, even after 200 years of research on electrokinetic phenomena, there are still open questions with respect to fundamental understanding. The focus of this thesis is on three different phenomena, i.e., streaming potential, streaming current and electroosmosis. Hence, the thesis is divided in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
The first part focuses on the applicability of the classical Helmholtz-Smoluchowski theory on streaming potential and streaming current measurements of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) wafers, to infer the zeta potential of this substrate in contact with liquids of defined pH and ionic strength. In detail, we perform electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements to infer the electrical resistance in a PMMA microchannel and derive novel correlations for the electrokinetic characterization of the substrate. We conclude that convection can have a significant impact on the electrical double layer configuration which is reflected by changes in the surfaces conductivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second part of the thesis is concerned with electroosmotic flows in porous substrates where we develop a phenomenological correlation which is based on dimensional reasoning. A large set of experiments is carried out using a relatively simple and cost-effective setup including different sintered packed beds of borosilicate microspheres. A centre-of-mass model of the experimental setup allows for the interpretation of various effects. Streaming current measurements result in a correlation for the zeta potential of borosilicate depending on ionic strength and pH of the liquid.  Finally, a quantitative expression for electroosmotic flow in packed beds of granular material is derived from the experiments. This correlation can be employed with other materials as well.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Given the overwhelming financial and human costs of crime committed through the incorporated entity, this thesis explores corporate criminal liability in criminal law as a mechanism of social control for corporate crime. First, this thesis traces the fundamental claims regarding corporate criminal liability in both the jurisprudential and sociological literatures in an effort to explore how law applies liability in a criminal context to the incorporated entity. Second, the contemporary corporate criminal liability landscape in Canada is examined. In particular, an examination of Bill C-45 as codified corporate criminal liability and as criminal law in action is empirically grounded in a detailed review of both the black letter law of corporate criminal liability and the judicial case documents on prosecutions against incorporated entities for corporate crimes. Finally, this thesis analyzes the socio-legal environment of corporate criminal liability through its construction and operation within Canadian criminal law. Overall, as a result of the legal, cultural, political, and economic privileges of the incorporated entity, corporate criminal liability is a product of a socio-legal environment that inhibits the ability of criminal law to be an effective mechanism of social control for corporate crime. Only when corporate criminal liability recognizes the complexities of the social, economic, and organizational structures and practices that are shaping corporate criminal activities can it become an effective mechanism for regulating the most harmful corporate misconduct. Otherwise, as this thesis demonstrates, corporate criminal liability will continue to be all bark and no bite.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The City of Vancouver has created guiding principles in attempts to create more park amenities and public space beneath the Georgia and Dunsmuir Viaducts. In response to this, this report aims to evaluate two similar case studies within North America and identify successful aspects of their design and make recommendations that could potentially be incorporated into the Vancouver study site. The City of Vancouver is seeking to fill the intended space with a vibrant entertainment district that would combine both residential and commercial opportunities with increased parks and public spaces. The two case studies analyzed were the Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York and the West Don Lands in Toronto. The Brooklyn Bridge Park and West Don Lands provided excellent examples of design features that help create successful parks and public spaces. From environmentally friendly design to preservation of culture and heritage, these case studies helped this report identify successful design features that create parks and public spaces, which consistently attract a wide array of visitors. These case studies guided recommendations made in this report for the City of Vancouver to use in its future design plans for the proposed study area.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite nearly twenty years of official peace in Guatemala since the signing of the 1996 Peace Accords, violence continues to remain a grave problem throughout the country. In particular, extreme forms of gender-based violence have been reportedly problematic over the past two decades, with a conversation on femicide, the targeted killing of women by men based on their gender, emerging in recent years between activists, politicians and practitioners alike.  To respond to the crisis around femicide, in 2008, the Law on Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against Women was passed by Guatemala’s congress, mandating the creation of a specialized justice system to criminalize such acts.&#xD;
Guatemala’s legal innovations around femicidal violence is widely believed by many observers as a victory for human and women’s rights defenders in the country. However, despite these legal interventions, femicidal violence has continued unabatedly in Guatemala.&#xD;
In this thesis, I present a two-pronged argument. First, I will argue that the tensions inherent to neoliberalism in Guatemala create a landscape in which women are vulnerable to experiencing femicidal violence, beyond the scope explored by both the mainstream and critical literature, and moreover, beyond the scope of the Law on Femicide. Second, I posit that the Law on Femicide, which is inserted as a neutral, technical fix to the ongoing and pervasive issue of femicide and violence against women, depoliticizes femicide in Guatemala, removing it from neoliberal capitalist context and individualizing the responsibility of the crime to perpetrators, rather than the neoliberal state. Simultaneously, the rule of law as expressed through the Law on Femicide must be understood in the context of the neoliberal landscape in Guatemala, in particular, in the context of neoliberalism’s “crisis of social reproduction” (LeBaron and Roberts 2012, 26).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis consists of two parts; the first part pertains to fractoluminescence as a potential background in crystal scintillator detectors, and the second part bears on the simulation of a 24Na source to be used during the liquid scintillator phase of the SNO+ experiment.&#xD;
I participated in early work to develop a test-bed to study fractoluminescence in scintillators, and report here on preliminary results I obtained before I shifted my focus to SNO+. Full results obtained by the group have since been reported in PRL 111 154301 [1]. This project follows the discovery that mechanical stress on a dark matter detector’s crystals was causing a background signal. The response of inorganic crystal scintillators (Bi4Ge3O12, ZnWO4 , CdWO4 ) compressed to the point of rupture was studied. The double cleavage drilled compression geometry was used to create controlled cracks in 20×5×3 mm3 samples. A correlation between a sudden drop of the force, a burst of photonic and of acoustic emissions was discovered and a lower bound was set on the conversion efficiency from strain energy to light energy.&#xD;
SNO+ is a large underground experiment that aims primarily to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. The SNO+ detector consists of an acrylic vessel of liquid scintillator surrounded by light detectors. A tagged 24Na source was proposed as one of several radioactive sources to be deployed within the vessel to calibrate the detector. To achieve this an activated NaI(Tl) crystal would be coupled to a photomultiplier tube and lowered into the center of the vessel. The second half of this thesis explores options for implementing this plan and presents the detector response to a 24Na source as simulated by the Monte Carlo software developed by SNO+. The size of the crystal influences the type of information that can be gleaned from using this source so four different crystal sizes are presented for comparison. The simulations show that the source can be used to test the linearity of the energy scale and the simulation’s quenching model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the increase in Canada’s seniors population (age 65 and over), there is a need to understand the residential requirements of this population. Almost 90 percent of seniors in Ontario reside in urban areas (Hodge 2008) and the majority live in the Greater Toronto Area. Of particular concern is the decrease in availability of informal care for aging and weakening individuals due to changes in economy and family relations. These changes are likely to result in a large influx of seniors into residential care facilities (RCFs) because not everyone is able to stay at home or is eligible to live in a long term care (LTC) facility. Seniors’ reasons for relocating as well as an analysis of their experiences after the move are required as the need for RCFs increases. Cultural and/or religious groups have become important providers of RCFs in Canada by offering necessary services for an aging population. &#xD;
The goal of this thesis is to analyse the importance of culture and the built environment within a push-pull framework associated with the decision to move to an RCF through a case study. The guiding question of the research is: Why do seniors choose facilities with cultural affiliations? In 2013, interviews were conducted with 15 residents, who were currently residing in a Ukrainian RCF called Ivan Franko. The results show that seniors move because of certain limitations (e.g., health, difficulty doing housework, family events, etc.). When an older person decides that they want or need to move, they will move to a facility that provides a physical and social environment while reinforcing cultural values (i.e., built environment), assuming a place is available.&#xD;
Acknowledging the limitations of a qualitative case study approach, the findings are important to consider as the multicultural population of the GTA and other large Canadian cities continue to age. The growing demand for places in RCFs reflects social, cultural and religious needs of a diverse older population. A challenge will exist for cultural and religious not-for-profit voluntary organizations, the for-profit sector, and governments at all levels to seek new ways to develop facilities in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is a collection of three essays that use economic tools to address policy-relevant issues related to ageing, population health, and education. The use of economic modelling and econometric analyses has the potential to provide information on the consequences and effectiveness of policy interventions in these areas and enables policymakers to make better informed decisions. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to these topics and is followed by the three essays.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 2, I analyze how providing informal care to an elderly parent affects the caregiver's labour market outcomes, cognitive ability, and health; and study the influence of the institutional background on the caregiving decision and the effects of caregiving. My results show that negative effects on labour market outcomes can be avoided by the provision of formal care alternatives, but  negative effects for caregivers' mental health persist. These findings give useful insights into the optimal provision of formal care in today's ageing societies. &#xD;
&#xD;
Self-reported health measures are commonly collected in numerous surveys but might be influenced by respondents' definitions and frames of reference of health. In Chapter 3, I address the issue of response bias in population surveys by constructing an objective measure of health. I find that using a common definition of health nearly eliminates the reported health differences between the U.S. and Canada. Socioeconomic differences in health are stronger in the U.S., but remain an issue in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 4 studies the effect of post-secondary education on the continued development of reading proficiency during adolescence and young adulthood. Reading proficiency is essential for labour market success in a knowledge-based economy, but little is known about how advanced reading skills such as text interpretation and text evaluation are developed. The results show that university graduation increases students' reading proficiency relative to high school graduation, which demonstrates the importance of cognitive skill investments later in the life cycle.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Throughout my teaching career, I have worked closely with students with exceptionalities and have observed, time and time again, the need for change within our special education system.  My students often struggle academically and socially as they lack both a sense of self and sense of place.  It is this lack of self and place that my students experience that has made me worked tirelessly to address this issue in both my classroom and as an academic.&#xD;
The purpose of this project is to highlight my learning process during a camp unit plan that I created for students with exceptionalities and its transformation from land to classroom.  It is also about explaining how traditional Indigenous pedagogy can contribute to the special education field.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Within ecotourism there is a built in assumption that tourists are the only ones who gain knowledge from an interpretive service. I sought to fill in that gap by looking at the ways the experiences of providing nature interpretation influenced interpreters’ professional practice. To accomplish this, semi-structured interviews involving 5 Ontario-based nature interpreters were conducted. Their narratives were analysed and coded using the method known as template analysis, the results of which were then used to make a comparative analysis. The results of this study indicate that there are two avenues through which nature interpreters learned from their experiences: through reflection initiated by emotions and through a realisation made from the experience. For the four participants who reported a change to their professional practice, that change came in the form of more inclusive practices being incorporated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The overall objectives of this thesis are to determine if Indirect and Direct Design methods currently used for reinforced concrete pipe are able to accurately predict the capacity of  the pipe, to identify discrepancies between the two methods, and to provide potential modifications to the methods to reduce inconsistencies.  As part of this investigation, two 0.6 m pipes (nominal strength classes 100-D and a 140-D) and two 1.2 m pipes (a 65-D with Wall B and a 65-D with Wall C) were tested under single wheel pair loading at burial depths of 1.2, 0.6 and 0.3 m. The test pipes did not crack at the applied service load of 110 kN and did not pass the crack width limit until between 2.5 and 4 times the service load. A 0.6 m 100-D pipe was also tested under simulated deep burial and it was found that the calculated test D-Load is 1.9 times greater than the designated D-Load of the test pipe. It was found that both methods were conservative and that the Direct Design method should be modified to more closely align with the Indirect Design. An investigation of the Direct Design parameters found that by considering thick ring theory and the Modified Compression Field Theory with two layers of reinforcement, the required amount of steel from Direct Design could be made to align very closely with the Indirect Design. An additional test was completed to further assess the Direct Design method on a 0.6 m 140-D pipe to measure the pressure around the circumference of the pipe and compare this measured pressure to the commonly used pressure distribution for Direct Design. The results show that at the minimum cover (0.3 m) the test pressure is higher than predicted at the crown, lower than predicted at the invert, and nearly zero at the shoulder, springline, and haunch, which is inconsistent with most of the predicted results at these locations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis aims to tackle the theoretical challenges of characterizing the fundamental performance limits of amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative networks and to resolve the practical challenges in the receiver design for AF systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
First of all, we study the Shannon-theoretic channel capacity which serves as a benchmark for practical wireless communications systems. Specifically, we derive exact expressions of the ergodic capacity in a single-integral form for general multi-branch AF relay networks with/without the direct link (DL). Moreover, we derive closed-form and tight upper bounds on the ergodic capacity, which facilitate the evaluation of the ergodic capacity. These expressions provide useful theoretical tools for the design of practical wireless AF relaying systems. &#xD;
&#xD;
We then tackle the practical challenges involved in the design of AF receivers, aiming to substantially reduce the channel state information (CSI) signaling overhead yet achieving satisfactory error performance. &#xD;
&#xD;
We take the maximum-likelihood (ML) and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) approaches to develop detectors under four typical wireless communications scenarios with little/no knowledge of the CSI. Firstly, for a semi-coherent scenario where only the product of channel coefficients of each relay branch is known, we develop the ML symbol-by-symbol (SBS) detector, which reduces the instantaneous CSI signaling overhead by 50% while achieving comparable performance to the ideal coherent receiver. Secondly, for the noncoherent scenario with only the (second-order) channel statistics and noise variances, we develop a noncoherent ML SBS detector for AF networks employing differential modulations. Thirdly, for AF networks with only the knowledge of the noise variance, we develop a sequence detector using GLRT. Lastly, for a completely blind scenario where the instantaneous CSI, channel statistics, and noise variances are all unknown, we develop a GLRT-based sequence detector. The proposed detectors achieve significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
The conducted theoretical analysis and practical design will facilitate the design of reliable communications over wireless AF networks with reduced CSI requirement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Land vehicle navigation is primarily dependent upon the Global Positioning System (GPS) which provides accurate navigation in open sky. However, in urban and rural canyons GPS accuracy degrades considerably. To help GPS in such scenarios, it is often integrated with inexpensive inertial sensors. Such sensors have complex stochastic errors which are difficult to mitigate. In the presence of speed measurements from land vehicle, a reduced number of inertial sensors can be used which improve performance and termed as the Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS).&#xD;
&#xD;
Existing low-cost RISS/GPS integrated algorithms have limited accuracy due to use of approximations in error models and employment of a Linearized Kalman Filter (LKF). This research developed an enhanced error model for RISS which was integrated with GPS using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for improved navigation of land vehicles. The proposed system was tested on several road experiments and the results confirmed the sustainable performance of the system during long GPS outages.&#xD;
&#xD;
To further increase the accuracy, Differential GPS (DGPS) is employed where carrier phase measurements are typically used. This requires resolution of Integer Ambiguity (IA) that comes at computational and time expense. This research uses pseudorange measurements for DGPS which mitigate large biases due to atmospheric errors and obviate the resolution of IA. These measurements are integrated with the enhanced RISS to filter increased noise and help GPS during signal blockages.&#xD;
&#xD;
The performance of the proposed system was compared with two other algorithms employing undifferenced GPS measurements where atmospheric effects are mitigated using either the Klobuchar model or dual frequency receivers. The proposed system performed better than both the algorithms in positional accuracy, multipath and GPS outages.&#xD;
&#xD;
This research further explored the reduction of Time-to-Fix Ambiguities (TTFA) for land vehicle navigation. To reduce the TTFA through inertial aiding, previous research used high-end Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). This research uses MEMS grade IMU by integrating the enhanced RISS with carrier phase measurements using EKF. This algorithm was also tested on three road trajectories and it was shown that this integration helps reduce the TTFA as compared to the GPS-only case when fewer satellites are visible.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis focuses on the investigation of the optoelectronic, photo and thermal- responsive properties of organoboron compounds. In search of blue phosphors for phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes, new triarylboron functionalized phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes were synthesized and their device performances were evaluated. In Pt(II) complexes with the 2-phenylpyridyl N,C-chelate ligand and an acetylacetonato ancillary ligand, it was found that BMes2 substitution at the 4’ position of the phenyl ring can increase the phosphorescent emission energy, compared to the 5’-BMes2 substituted analogue. This occurred without substantial loss of luminescent quantum efficiency. At 100 cdm-2 luminance, electroluminescence devices with the newly synthesized Pt(II) complexes as emitters have achieved external quantum efficiency of ~ 4.7-13.4%.&#xD;
Tuning of the photo-responsive properties of biaryl N,C-chelate dimesitylboron compounds was achieved by functionalization with either a bisthienyl moiety or ferrocene unit. It was demonstrated that the bisthienyl unit has the ability to completely stabilize a N,C-chelate boryl chromophore toward photoisomerization. With the ferrocene unit being part of the chelation backbone of BMes2 moiety, the B−N bond of molecule B(2-ferrocenyl-N-Me-benzimidazolyl)Mes2 was found to undergo a dynamic dissociation/association process in solution, leading to its slow hydrolysis under ambient conditions. The oxidized ferrocenium species has a notable spin delocalization through space from the Fe(III) center to a flanking mesityl group. &#xD;
	To further expand the photochromic family based on pyridyl N,C-chelate dimesityboron compounds, a systematic study was carried out with the pyridyl N donor replaced by N-heterocyclic carbene donor and azolyl, benzoazolyl N donors. These new classes of organoboranes all underwent transformation to their corresponding dark isomer in a similar fashion as the pyridyl N,C-chelate dimesitylboron. However, a second-step photoisomerization was observed in the NHC,C-chelate dark isomer via a “borylene”-like intermediate. The thiazolyl, benzoazolyl N,C-chelate dark isomers demonstrate multi-structural transformations, which include hydrogen atom transfer, 1,3-boryl shift and diastereomer interconversion via a spiropyran type ring-opening/closure process. The imidazolyl N,C-chelate dark isomer exhibits a consecutive photochromism phenomenon, namely an interconversion between azaboratabisnorcaradiene and azabenzotropilidene derivatives. The calculated mechanism for this bares an interesting resemblance to that of the “walk” rearrangement in norcaradiene.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to: a) describe the current context of Ontario’s employment policies by conducting a policy analysis to understand the ways in which the Ontario Human Rights Code, the Labour Relations Act, and Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) function together to provide a framework for action to guide employer attitudes towards disabilities in the private sector of Ontario, and b) investigate employer knowledge/understanding and application of these three policies in the Ontario private sector by conducting interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: To perform the policy analysis, relevant documents were systematically collected and qualitatively analyzed. In addition to the policy analysis, semi-structured interviews were conducted with three employers to investigate the policy knowledge and application in the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: From the policy analysis, ten themes arose: anti-discrimination and accommodation, the individual complaint system of the Ontario Human Rights Code, the need for government participation, education, and awareness in the AODA, the application of the Labour Relations Act, required employer knowledge of the three Ontario policies, minority group treatment of people with disabilities in policy, the collectivist responsibility under the AODA, the definition of disability, the impact of the definition of disability on employers, and the cost of accommodation. The themes arising from employer interviews were: view of disability, knowledge and application of the three policies, the “fit” of a prospective employee, the importance of a human resources department, and the presence of accessibility in the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
Summary: Together, the three policies addressed anti-discrimination in the workplace for employees with disabilities by mandating reasonable accommodation for all. Under the AODA, standards of accommodation were established and enforced through random government inspections, and under the Ontario Human Rights Code, accommodation challenges were addressed by a case-by-case method. Employers must be privy to the responsibility to provide accommodations for people with disabilities, as the enforcement mechanisms differ. In reality, there is a large variance in the application of the central policies, and employers without a human resources department appear to understand fewer details of the policy requirements. This understanding did not appear to impede accommodation for employees with disabilities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis conducts empirical studies related to financial institutions and corporate finance. Specifically, I look at banks’ lending behavior, performance of leveraged buyouts (LBOs), and the cultural impact on cross-border LBOs. Following an introduction in Chapter 1, in Chapter 2, I study U.S. commercial banks’ herding behavior in their domestic loan decisions, where herding is defined as the extent to which banks deviate from the industry average lending decisions and collectively increase or decrease loans to certain categories. I find significant evidence that herding exists and that banks tend to herd more when the economic condition is less favorable, regulation is tight, and when banks are struggling . Overall, these findings support the hypotheses of information asymmetry and regulatory arbitrage as motivations for herding.&#xD;
Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive study of LBO deal characteristics, participants’ involvement, and their impact on target firms’ performance. I find that better post-buyout operating performance is associated with larger amounts of leverage added during the LBO process, tighter LBO loan covenants, and equity contribution by target firms’ incumbent management. LBOs are more likely to exit through an IPO or a sale if they use more bank debt with tighter covenants and are sponsored by private equity (PE) firms of high reputation. These results suggest that the main source of value creation in LBOs is the reduced agency costs through the disciplining effect of debt, closer monitoring by lenders, and the better aligned management incentives. PE reputation is also important in ensuring successful deal outcomes. &#xD;
Chapter 4 (co-authored) examines the impact of cultural differences between PE firms and target firms on the completion of cross-border LBOs. We find that cultural distance between PE and target firms reduces the likelihood of buyout completion and increases the time between buyout announcement and completion. We also find that club deals moderate the negative (positive) impact of cultural distance on the likelihood (the duration) of LBO completion. This mitigation effect is through the increased familiarity channel of club formation. Our findings contribute to the literature that underscores the importance of culture in economic outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Activation-tagging is a powerful functional genomics technique used to identify plant genes and their functions. The random introduction of gene enhancers into the plant genome results in the overexpression of nearby genes, thus the gene responsible for a mutant phenotype can be determined based on the location of the enhancers. In a screen for activation-tagged Arabidopsis lines with aberrations in trichome morphology, a mutant (named P330) with unbranched trichomes was identified. In this thesis, the actin- encoding gene ACT11 was found to be upregulated by T-DNA pSKI015 in P330. Additionally, this line also produces a second mutant phenotype, characterized by a significant reduction in seed set. The findings presented in this thesis build upon previous work that has shown ACT11 is strongly expressed in reproductive organs (such as pollen and ovules) and rapidly elongating tissues in Arabidopsis. The role of actin has been characterized in Arabidopsis trichome morphogenesis, however much remains unclear about actin dynamics in sexual reproduction. Our investigation on the effects of increased ACT11 expression adds to our understanding of these processes and also provides the framework for future studies into trichome morphogenesis and sexual reproduction in flowering plants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Model Driven Development (MDD) is a paradigm introduced to overcome the complexities of modern software&#xD;
development. In MDD we use models as a primary artifact that is being developed, tested and refined,&#xD;
with code being a result of code generation. Analysis and verification of models is an important&#xD;
aspect of MDD paradigm, because they improve understanding of a developed system and enable discovery of&#xD;
faults early in the development. Even though many analysis methods exist (e.g., model checking, proof&#xD;
systems), they are not directly applicable in the context of industrial MDD tools such as&#xD;
IBM Rational Software Architect Real Time Edition (IBM RSA RTE). One of the main reasons for this&#xD;
inapplicability is the difference between modeling languages used in MDD tools (e.g. UML-RT language in IBM&#xD;
RSA RTE) and languages used in existing tools. These differences require an implementation of a transformation&#xD;
from a modeling language to an input language of a tool.&#xD;
UML-RT as well as other industrial MMD models, cannot be easily translated, if the target languages do not&#xD;
directly support key model features.&#xD;
To address this problem we follow a research direction that deviates from the standard approaches and instead of bringing&#xD;
MDD models to analysis tools, the approach brings  analysis "closer" to MDD models. We introduce&#xD;
analysis of UML-RT models dedicated to this modeling language.&#xD;
To this end we use a formal internal representation of UML-RT models that preserves the important features of&#xD;
these models, such as hierarchical structures of components, asynchronous communication and action code. &#xD;
This provides us with formalized models using straightforward transformation. In addition, this approach &#xD;
enables the use of MDD-specific abstractions aiming to reduce the size of the state space necessary. To this&#xD;
end we introduce several MDD-specific types of abstractions for: data (using symbolic execution), structure&#xD;
and behavior. The work also includes model checking algorithms, which use the modular nature of UML-RT models.  The proposed approach is implemented in&#xD;
a toolset that enables analysis directly of UML-RT models. &#xD;
We show the results of experiments with UML-RT models developed in-house and obtained&#xD;
from our industrial partner.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies the impact of geographic mobility on the decision of a household to whether to buy or to rent a house, and sheds light on the efficiency of mortgage default prevention policies. The first chapter provides an introduction and an overview of the ongoing policy debates on homeownership and mortgage terms. In the second and third chapters, I study the housing tenure decision in the context of a life cycle model with uninsurable individual income risk, plausibly calibrated to match key features of the U.S. housing market. I find that the relatively low ownership rate of young households is mainly explained by their high geographic mobility. Downpayment constraints have minor quantitative implications on ownership rates, except for old households. I also find that idiosyncratic earnings uncertainty has a significant impact on ownership rates. Based on these results, I argue that the long term increase in ownership rates observed over the period 1993-2009 was not necessarily due to mortgage market innovations and the relaxation of downpayment requirements, as is often argued. Instead, it was simply an implication of U.S. demographic evolution, most notably the decline in interstate migration and, less importantly, population aging. Finally, in Chapter 4, I study the impact of the relaxation of downpayment requirement on homeownership and default risk. Given its quantitative success in matching the U.S. homeownership curve, my model represents a reasonable benchmark to asses the efficiency of mortgage default prevention policies. I find that both income and mobility are the main trigger factors for default decisions. In fact, households with a higher mobility (ie. young households) rate are more likely to default. According to the welfare analysis, I suggest that policymakers include a minimum downpayment requirement of 9.5% in the new definition of the Qualified Residential Mortgage. This number should, however, be viewed with some caution, since I focus on a steady state economy, in which house prices are constant. In fact, the house price represents an important factor influencing the default rate. Potentially, the optimal minimum downpayment requirement should be set at higher value than 9.5%.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a study of the combat motivation and morale of infantrymen in the Canadian Army during the Second World War. Using battle experience questionnaires, censorship reports, statistical analyses, operational research, and other contemporary sources, this study offers a “big-picture” look at the human dimensions of warfare as experienced by Canadian infantrymen during the Italian and Northwest Europe campaigns of 1943 to 1945. The myths and realities of who the Canadian soldiers were provides the background, as does an exploration of their training and organization. Each core chapter explores one segment of the Canadian campaigns in Europe: the Sicilian and Italian campaign of 1943, the Italian campaign of 1944-45, the Normandy campaign of the summer of 1944, and the Northwest Europe campaign of 1944-45. Each of these chapters analyzes the force structure, behaviour in battle, morale, cohesion, and motivation of Canadian infantrymen during that particular segment of the campaign, setting them in comparison with one another to demonstrate continuities and change based upon shifting conditions, ground, and circumstances. In doing so, this thesis offers an original interpretation of Canadian combat motivation in the Second World War. Due to high infantry casualty rates, influxes of new reinforcements, and organizational turmoil, Canadian soldiers in many campaigns frequently fought as “strangers-in-arms” alongside unfamiliar faces. In spite of being strangers, however, the Canadians maintained remarkably high levels of cohesion, morale, and effectiveness (despite setbacks and periods of malaise) throughout the fighting. These successes can be attributed to the phenomenon of “swift trust” cohesion, the preservation of NCO leadership even in the face of heavy casualties, and effective training.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of percutaneous image-guided interventions over open surgical interventions. The conventional image-guided procedures are limited by the freehand technique, requiring mental 3D registration and hand-eye coordination for needle placement. The outcomes of these procedures are associated with longer duration and increased patient discomfort with high radiation exposure. Previously, a static image overlay system was proposed for aiding needle interventions. Certain drawbacks associated with the static system limited the clinical translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
To overcome the ergonomic issues and longer calibration duration associated with static system, an adjustable image overlay system was proposed. The system consisted of monitor and semi-transparent mirror, attached together to an articulated mobile arm. The 90-degree mirror-monitor configuration was proposed to improve the physician access around the patient. MicronTracker was integrated for dynamic tracking of the patient and device. A novel method for auto-direct calibration of the virtual image overlay plane was proposed. Due to large mechanical structure, the precise movement was limited and consumed useful space in the procedure room. A mobile image overlay system with reduced system weight and smaller dimensions was proposed to eliminate the need for mechanical structure. A tablet computer and beamsplitter were used as the display device and mirror respectively. An image overlay visualization module of the 3D Slicer was developed to project the correct image slice upon the tablet device. &#xD;
&#xD;
The system weight was reduced to 1 kg and the image overlay plane tracking precision (0.11mm STD=0.05) was similar to the printed physical markers. The auto-calibration of the image overlay plane can be done in two simple steps, away from the patient table and without additional phantom. Based on the successful pre-clinical testing of the previous static system, the mobile image overlay system with reduced weight, increased tracking precision and easier maneuverability, can be possibly hand-held by the physician to explore the image volume over the patient and be used for a wide range of procedures. The mobile image overlay system shall be classified as Class II device as per FDA regulations, do not require extensive verification and validation efforts and further improves the commercialization opportunities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As electric vehicles (EV) continue to gain market traction, more research is being conducted in the control of the power conditioning system. This thesis focuses on control strategies for the front-end AC/DC converter. Current EV chargers in the market are unidirectional which limits the opportunity for EV owners to participate in vehicle –to-grid services. The core work on this thesis is two bi-directionally capable controllers for EV chargers that have improved performance or added functionality over the traditional chargers on the market. The controllers were simulated and implemented on a single-phase full bridge converter.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first controller focuses on improving the dynamic performance of EV chargers compared to the conventional linearly regulated chargers. This nonlinear controller is designed based on Lyapunov control theory which guarantees that the energy of the system is always decreasing thereby guaranteeing stability. A better version of this controller is designed by adding integral terms into the system. These terms compensate for parameter variations and converter model inaccuracies. Finally, a practical version of the controller is implemented by using the Tikhonov theorem to decouple the fast current loop and the slow voltage loop of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second part of the thesis focuses on the design of a controller which allows for four quadrant operation of the AC/DC converter by directly controlling the active and reactive power. This will allow EV owners to participate in ancillary services such as voltage control of the grid. This has potential to generate additional revenue for the owners and can also benefit the utility operators. This controller was designed in the synchronous frame using the Alpha-Beta to DQ transformation. In order to design this controller, an orthogonal version of the system had to be created. Several methods of orthogonal signal generation were compared and the one most suitable for this application was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
The result of this work is two controllers for EV chargers that tackle current challenges that exist in EV chargers. These controllers were simulated in PSIM and experimentally verified on a 1kW single phase full-bridge active rectifier.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inflammation plays an important role in responding to injury and combating infections.  In this thesis, I examine how inflammation is regulated by cytokines responsible for driving initial immune responses to combat infections. Toll-Like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells can lead to the co-expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-23, and IL-27. IL-23 and IL-27 belong to the IL-12 cytokine family yet have distinct functions; IL-23, along with IL-1β, regulates TH17 cell differentiation, while IL-27 supports TH1 proliferation and inhibits TH17 differentiation. Our lab has previously demonstrated that IL-27 can modulate inflammasome activation, the multi-protein regulatory complex that produces bioactive IL-1β; however, the mechanism behind this is poorly understood. Similarly, the effect of IL-27 on IL-23 expression has not been well described. Using the CD14+ THP-1 monocytic cell line as a model system, I investigated the role of IL-27 on LPS-mediated inflammasome activation and IL-23 expression. To induce inflammasome activation, CD14+ THP-1 cells were treated with LPS and/or IL-27, followed by treatment with ATP. I demonstrated that IL-27-enhanced inflammasome activation, which is associated with increased surface expression of LPS and ATP receptors: TLR4 and P2X7 respectively. Furthermore, costimulation resulted in increased secretion of ATP from CD14+ THP-1 cells. Inhibition of ATP signaling and inflammasome activation significantly decreased secreted IL-1β, suggesting that an ATP autocrine feedback loop is driving IL-1β secretion. Moreover, LPS and IL-27 costimulation increased IL-23 expression concurrent with that of IL-1β and ATP secretion. Furthermore I showed that IL-23 secretion is dependent on inflammasome activation and IL-1β, and ATP signaling following IL-27 and LPS priming. My data point to a novel mechanism of IL-27 enhanced LPS-induced IL-1β and IL-23 secretion from CD14+ THP-1 cells through an ATP autocrine feedback loop.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Insufficient physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle are major contributors to health risks for Canadian youth. Adolescents, particularly girls, tend to experience major drop-offs in physical activity levels during high school. However, there is minimal research examining the extent to which Physical and Health Education (PHE) courses promote physical activity and mitigate against this decline. Grounded in the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), the purpose of this quantitative short-term longitudinal study is two-pronged: (a) examine the effectiveness of Grade 9 PHE for 197 students’ reports of TPB constructs, physical activity intentions, and physical activity behaviour; and (b) explore the utility of TPB in predicting physical activity intentions and behaviour. For the first set of research questions, results were analyzed using 2 (time: Time Point 1 [T1], Time Point 2 [T2]) x 2 (condition: in PHE/not in PHE) x 2 (TPB status: higher or lower than the mean) MANCOVAs with boys and girls examined separately. There was no effect of PHE over time. There was no interaction among time, condition, and TPB status. There was a significant effect of condition for girls in PHE, with Attitude and Physical Activity Behaviour higher at both time points. For the second set of research questions, results were analyzed using multiple linear regressions to examine TPB in a Grade 9 setting. Findings provided support for the theoretical structure of the TPB in a Grade 9 context, with the three TPB constructs accounting for a minimum of 59% of Intentions, and a minimum of 25% of Behaviour for boys and girls. Attitude was the strongest independent predictor of Intentions with Intentions and Attitude the strongest predictors of Behaviour. PHE teachers should potentially focus attention on changing attitudes for this age group, given the importance of this construct.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This Master of Applied Science thesis presents an inverter control system design and implementation with active damping of LCL filter resonance for a single phase grid-connected Distributed Power Generation (DPGS). The focus of the thesis is to actively damp the LCL filter resonance while keeping inverter control variables well regulated. The mathematical model of the LCL filter is analyzed and the filter is designed. Then, a PLL, and a PI compensator in the synchronous reference frame, and a PR compensator in stationary reference frame along a notch filter in cascade are designed and implemented. System level simulation and implementation are conducted. The idea of systematic applying the low loss power conversion topology, effective grid condition detection, grid synchronization, and advanced signal processing theory provides some advantages for single phase grid-connected inverter control design to meet the standard specifications of the interaction between the DPGS and utility grid.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates strengthening slender steel columns with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates of various moduli.  Three different types of CFRP were used in the study: Ultra-high modulus (430GPa), High modulus (212GPa) and Normal modulus (168GPa).  In this study, specimens were grouped according to measured initial out-of-straightness values.  The first section examines the effect of adding CFRP plates to the column flanges when buckling about the weak axis.  Twelve columns, with a slenderness ratio of 197, were tested, of which nine were strengthened with CFRP.  The main parameters tested were the level of initial out-of-straightness (length (L)/8387 to L/1020), CFRP modulus (168 to 430 GPa), CFRP reinforcement ratio (13% to 34%) and the length of CFRP plate (33% to 95% of L). The gain in axial strength due to CFRP retrofitting ranged from 11% to 29%, depending on the various parameters. The gain generally increased as CFRP modulus, initial out-of-straightness, or CFRP reinforcement ratio increased.  Global buckling consistently governed the maximum load. In the case of the 430 GPa CFRP, buckling was followed by CFRP crushing in compression, then rupture in tension.  &#xD;
The second section of the thesis examines the effect of CFRP plates added to the flanges and tested for buckling in the strong axis.  Eight columns, with a slenderness ratio of 83, were tested of which five were strengthened with CFRP.  The main parameters examined were the level of initial out-of-straightness (L/28889 to L/1635), CFRP modulus (168 to 430 GPa), CFRP reinforcement ratio (13% to 34%) and the axis of bending.  The gain in axial strength due to CFRP retrofitting ranged from 0% to 25%, depending on the various parameters. The gain generally increased as initial out-of-straightness, or CFRP reinforcement ratio increased.  The higher modulus did not perform as expected, showing no gain in strength, because the compressive strains were too large and the CFRP crushed before the specimen experienced any gain.  Specimens compared with the weak axis, strengthened with normal modulus CFRP, had similar percentage gains in strength.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rationale: The pathophysiologic differences between classic asthma (CA), cough variant asthma (CVA), and methacholine (MCh)-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity (COUGH) are poorly understood and may relate to differences in small airway function. We hypothesized that the bronchodilating and bronchoprotective effects of DIs are:  (a) absent or impaired in individuals with CA; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; and (c) preserved in those with COUGH.&#xD;
Purpose: To compare the effect of DIs in individuals with CA, CVA and COUGH using high-dose methacholine (MCh).&#xD;
Methods: Individuals aged 18-65 years with CA, or suspected CVA attended 3 visits. On visit 1, subjects performed body plethysmography and high-dose MCh testing to a maximum change (Δ) in FEV1 of 50% from baseline (MAX). On visits 2 and 3, subjects performed one of two modified single-dose MCh challenge tests with or without DIs prior to MCh administration. Partial and maximal-flow volume curves (used to calculated a DI index), impulse oscillometry (IOS) measurements and breathlessness (Borg scale) were recorded at baseline and at each dose of MCh. Lung volumes were measured by body plethysmography at baseline and MAX. Responses from baseline to a 20% decline in FEV1 (PC20) or MAX, and between visits with or without DIs were compared using paired t-tests. Between group differences were assessed by analysis of variance.&#xD;
Results: 19 subjects (14 female; 45.1±13.1 years (MEAN±SD)) completed the protocol (n=8 CA, n=7 CVA, and n=4 COUGH). At the dose nearest to PC20, the DI index was positive in all 3 groups, indicating preserved bronchodilation (CA: 0.88±0.67; CVA: 0.33±0.39; COUGH:  0.016±0.46; P=.0.076). There were no significant differences in: the Δs in spirometry, lung volumes, airway resistance, IOS measurements, closing indices, the DI index, or dyspnea when the single dose of MCh was preceded either by five DIs or by DI avoidance in CVA and COUGH. DIs in CA resulted in greater Δs in mid-to-late flows.&#xD;
Conclusion: The bronchodilating effect of DIs is preserved in CA, CVA and COUGH. The bronchoprotective effect may fall along a continuum. A larger study including subjects with more severe CA is required to definitively test the hypotheses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Examining the emergence and growing popularity of parenting programmes among states and international development agencies, this thesis explores the effectiveness of parenting interventions as a solution to high levels of social disorder, poverty, and violence that influence how poor families survive and carry out the “messy” work of social reproduction. Drawing on a case study of Jamaican parenting programmes and poor young women and men who participate in them, this thesis seeks to explore the relationship between these programmes and the neoliberal development strategies that the country has pursued for the last thirty years. Focusing specifically on the effects of liberalization on everyday practices of social reproduction among the urban poor, I argue that parenting programmes represent an institutional strategy aimed at shaping the behaviour of the poor, rather than addressing the structural causes that contribute to an ongoing crisis of social reproduction. Furthermore, I argue that parenting interventions reproduce racial and gender discourses and practices that target and pathologize poor, black Jamaicans as deficient and dysfunctional. Drawing on a critical policy approach, I contend that parenting cannot solve the larger anxieties created by the limited support given to spaces of social reproduction, especially when there is a commitment to social protection programmes and austerity measures that are encouraged by international institutions. Research findings demonstrate that parenting interventions contribute to positive parent-child relationships and confidence building. However, the daily experiences of parents are still complicated by socioeconomic stressors and structural barriers such as unemployment and poverty. In this context, community organizations also face uncertainty and fatigue in delivering support to parents. The broader significance of this study speaks to the necessity for social reproduction to be given as much priority as economic production in any socially sustainable strategy of development. The study also exemplifies how developing countries are largely controlled through mechanisms of debt servicing and donor funding especially when implementing and allocating collective resources to support families. Thus, a system where parenting intervention is rejected as a sufficient structural solution to collective issues in Jamaica is required in both local and international institutions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an injury of the brain most often caused by blunt force trauma to the head and typically characterized by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation, and hemorrhaging. Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the breakdown of heme into carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin which is further reduced to bilirubin, and ferrous iron. There are two active isoforms: HO-1 which is inducible and found predominantly in liver and spleen tissue; and HO-2 which is constitutive and found predominantly in the brain and testis. The metabolites of heme possess cytoprotective properties that can limit damage resulting from TBI. Our laboratory has found a selective HO-2 activator known as menadione (MD) that has been found to increase HO-2 activity by 4-fold while not affecting HO-1 in vitro. Given the higher amounts of HO-2 found in the brain and the cytoprotective properties of heme metabolites, we postulate that activation of HO-2 using menadione would mitigate further damage after TBI. The rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was used to simulate TBI with spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA), spontaneous alternation behaviour (SAB), and beam balance (BB) as the behavioural tasks to assess cognitive and motor function. A dose-response study (25, 50, 100, 200 μmol/kg) was performed to ascertain the effect of MD treatment on injured animals comparing to uninjured controls and injured animals treated with the vehicle (saline). We found that BB performance improved to control levels after MD treatment at 25 μmol/kg and 50 μmol/kg whereas animals treated with saline did not improve. SLA and SAB performance did not improve after treatment with MD. The findings suggest that HO-2 activation may be a viable method in mitigating further injury after TBI.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Following the Capture of Rome and suspension of the First Vatican Council in 1870, the Roman Catholic Church, as a global institution, desperately needed to rethink its relationship to modernity.  Catholics had attempted to do so throughout the nineteenth century: applying faith-based principles to matters of social and economic organization and reorienting traditional notions of charity to ones based on social justice.  ‘Social Catholicism’ became a groundswell within the Church, culminating in papal encyclicals such as Rerum Novarum (1891) and later Quadragesimo Anno (1931).  Concurrently, Catholic scholars had been looking to the medieval philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas for inspiration to confront post-Enlightenment Western Civilization, an initiative reflected by Pope Leo XIII’s Aeterni Patris (1879).  These developments became intertwined.  These encyclicals argued for a ‘third way’ most often associated with an economic and social philosophy of ‘corporatism.’  However, a corporatist reading came alongside other interpretations in Catholic social thought, which included British distributism and French personalism.  Outside of fascist regimes, moreover, the idea of a ‘third way’ must more accurately be repositioned as occupying a ‘liminal’ space between the liberal and socialist traditions.  Within this conceptual space came an engagement with modernity—one which created the preconditions for Vatican II.  &#xD;
	This dynamic affected the universal Church, but, as a via media, one that developed within local and national experiences of Catholicism.  Using this framework, this study explores social Catholicism within English Canada from 1912 to 1961.  It discerns three streams of social Catholic thought and action associated within the Antigonish Movement of Nova Scotia, the work of Henry Somerville in the Archdiocese of Toronto, and the educational initiatives of the Congregation of Priests of St. Basil.  Through these streams, social Catholics experience a space of liminality between a social order predicated on liberalism and attempts by the left to live outside of an established set of economic and social relations conditions created by liberalism and capitalism since the 1840s in Canada.  For the Canadian Church, this engagement leads to intellectual and institutional restructuring—a middle way, experienced in concert with Catholicism throughout the west, which led to the Second Vatican Council.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite declining marriage rates and an increased acceptance of common-law couples in North America (Milan, 2013), the wedding is still constructed  as a meaningful life event through the use of reality wedding shows, which have increased in number in recent years. Wedding-related media, which is funded by the wedding industry, is responsible for communicating the expectations and standards of the modern wedding which couples are expected to follow (Boden, 2001; Engstrom, 2008;2012; Mead, 2007). Bridal media, as wedding-related media is often called, positions brides as the focal point of the wedding and encourages them to create not just a standard wedding but a “perfect” wedding (Engstrom, 2012). This “perfect” wedding is positioned by bridal media as something that all brides can obtain through the purchase of material goods during the process of wedding planning. Given the emphasis placed on individualism in a neoliberal capitalist context (Hasinoff, 2008; Tudor, 2012), while there is a common notion of what the “perfect” wedding includes, each couple is expected to add their own personal touches, so long as they fall within wedding standards. As women are the focal point of the wedding celebration, it is important to consider how consumption-based feminine gender roles and norms effect wedding consumption given the high costs of the “perfect” wedding. For the purposes of this study, a multi-theoretical approach is taken that focuses primarily on Angela McRobbie’s (2009) take on postfeminism and a critical take on Goffman’s dramaturgy (1959; Paolucci &amp; Richardson, 2006). A critical ethnographic content analysis was done using twenty episodes of the reality wedding television series Rich Bride Poor Bride. The findings of the study suggest that women are responsible for driving wedding-related consumption which relates to consumption-based feminine gender roles in the neoliberal postfeminist context. This study also finds that perfection and happiness also relate to wedding spending and tend to be of particular importance to the bride. As the bride becomes the focal point of the wedding, grooms are excluded, although they do wish to be involved.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Global climate change is threatening both our water quality and quantity. Specifically, the influence of climate change on freshwater lakes includes decreased water availability, increased evapotranspiration, changes in nutrient availability, and shifts in species composition. Understanding the changes that are occurring to our freshwater ecosystems is imperative to understanding the full impact of climate change on both the environment and society.&#xD;
This thesis examines a shift in sedimentary diatom assemblages towards increased relative abundances of Discostella species, a phenomenon that has been documented across the Northern Hemisphere. One of the central tenants of this work is that it has been done at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in the boreal region of Canada, a study site that is uniquely devoid of large-scale anthropogenic disturbances. An analysis of the long-term monitoring records at the ELA show that Discostella species are primarily spring bloomers, and recent increases in their abundance is linked to changes in spring thermal conditions.&#xD;
To link the changes recorded in the sedimentary records of eight lakes to climate change, and assess whether Discostella species are in fact showing a response to climate change, a novel approach utilizing the theory of temporal synchrony was applied to eight paleo records. Discostella stelligera was found to be synchronous in all eight lakes studied, suggesting that a broad-scale forcing factor is influencing its abundance. Further, it was significantly correlated with annual and winter temperatures, supporting a link to changes in spring thermal conditions as a possible explanation.&#xD;
To assess the relative sensitivity of the study lakes, particularly in comparison to other boreal and temperate region lakes, an analysis was conducted of the timing of the first change in Discostella species. Several statistical techniques were employed and all approaches showed that the study lakes from ELA responded earlier in comparison to other lakes studied from other boreal and temperate regions (ca. 1900 vs ca. 1970), but later than Arctic and Sub-Arctic lakes. We suggest that this may be due to the lack of local disturbances at the ELA and/or the comparably small size of our study lakes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the Internet becomes more pervasive, the content and services are increasing in quantity as well as improving in quality. This trend is fostered by the advancement of technologies, such as RESTful services, Web 2.0, and Mashups. Service composition integrates services to fulfill specific tasks using a set of tools. The existing service composition techniques and tools are mainly designed for the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) professionals. The business processes used in the service composition systems are primarily designed by business analysts who have extensive process knowledge. Due to the lack of process knowledge, novice business analysts and end users face challenge to identify and orchestrate service into a well-defined business process. Even for the experienced users, it is challenging to select appropriate services from a set of functionally similar services as the quality information of services may not be available. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we propose a framework that allows a non-technical user to combine web services to achieve a goal. Our approach helps users to find the process knowledge from the web. We index web services based on the semantic concepts available in the service description documents and help users to formulate a web service search query. We use online reviews to choose a web service from a set of functionally similar web services. Our approach automatically finds the data flow between web services and generates a user interface to execute a composite service. The effectiveness of our proposed approaches is demonstrated through a series of case studies. The results of our case studies show that our approaches for process knowledge extraction, service discovery, and service selection make it easier for people with less technical knowledge to compose services.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite the increasing attention given to the issue of sexual harassment by organizational scholars, important questions remain unanswered, particularly when it comes to the unique experiences of those who witness the sex-based mistreatment of their peers. Further still, as the sexual harassment of males has only recently captured the attention of researchers, much remains to be learned about situations involving this form of sexual harassment. My dissertation focuses on employees who witness the sex-based mistreatment of their male colleagues. More specifically, three studies focus on same-sex (male-on-male) and/or opposite-sex (female-on-male) male sexual harassment and the impact that observing this phenomenon has on female and male employees. First, I examine how witnessing the sexual harassment of a male colleague impacts one’s well-being, emotions, and collective self-esteem. Second, I investigate what observers of male sexual harassment believe motivates an aggressor to harass a male colleague, and how such beliefs are impacted by (a) the form of the harassment they witness, and (b) who perpetrates this harassment. Demonstrating what conditions will lead to an evaluation of a male sexual harassment incident as unethical is also a primary goal of this investigation. Last, I explore the behavioral responses of witnesses to male-on-male gender harassment. More specifically, I aim to identify factors that affect whether observers will choose to intervene on behalf of the target, or participate in the male sexual harassment that they witness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Solar assisted heat pumps (SAHPs) can provide higher collector efficiencies and solar fractions when compared against standard solar hot water heaters. Vapour compression (VC) heat pumps require environmentally hazardous refrigerants and moving parts which increase maintenance costs and place limits on operating conditions. Thermoelectric modules (TEMs) use solid state electronics to pump heat without moving parts or refrigerants. This study investigated the performance of a SAHP system utilizing an array of thermoelectric modules as the heat pump.&#xD;
A component model was developed to simulate the TEM heat pump performance using TRNSYS software and results were compared against those determined experimentally. A simplified model was unable to accurately predict TEM performance. The model was therefore refined to incorporate empirically determined parameters. An apparatus was constructed to measure the performance of a small photovoltaic array driven TEM heat pump and simulation results using the component model were found to be in agreement.&#xD;
Several SAHP configurations were simulated using TRNSYS and compared with vapour compression SAHPs previously studied at the QSCL. The TEM ISAHP provided a Free Energy Ratio (FER) of 46% and a collector efficiency of 36% whereas the VC ISAHP provided 54% and 76% respectively. The photovoltaic (PV) driven ISAHP system was able to achieve a higher FER of 50% with the use of a 2 module PV array and a reduced thermal collector area.&#xD;
Further optimization is required to improve TEM heat pump performance in this configuration and reduce the photovoltaic array size. The use of a maximum power point tracker into the PV/TEM system should be investigated as panel efficiency losses reached up to 30% in the configuration studied. The possibility of incorporating combined PV/T modules could decrease costs and also warrants further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
Critical factors in the success of a TEM driven solar assisted heat pump will include the improvement of thermoelectric materials performance, the optimization of TEM modules for efficient heat pumping applications, and the design of high performance heat exchangers for the TEM heat pump hot and cold faces.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant, yet Hg biomagnification, the increase in Hg with trophic level, remains poorly characterized in many regions, especially at subtropical latitudes. The present study assessed subtropical reservoirs of eastern China, which provided an opportunity to quantify Hg biomagnification under highly altered conditions that included high atmospheric Hg deposition, use of reservoirs for fisheries, manipulation of food webs through stocking and high fishing pressure, and increasing eutrophication. Despite China’s Hg emission and deposition rates that are among the highest worldwide, low fish Hg concentrations and Hg biomagnification rates were found; this was explained by food web structure and fish species characteristics. Stocked species occupied lower trophic levels and had significantly lower Hg concentrations relative to wild fishes. Evidence of decreased Hg concentrations with eutrophication (as indicated by chlorophyll-a) was observed, suggesting algal biodilution and/or somatic growth dilution. Relative to temperate lakes, zooplankton density dilution may also be causing reduced Hg concentrations in subtropical biota. Hydrogeomorphic features, such as water retention time and percent crop cover, explained Hg bioaccumulation factors and Hg concentrations at the base of the food web. Eutrophication and hydrogeomorphic features also influenced the bioavailability of selenium, which can protect against the toxicity of Hg at adequate concentrations, and the concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid, a beneficial fatty acid, in the planktivorous Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis). This may indicate that the risk of exposure to the neurotoxicant methylmercury relative to&#xD;
benefits of fish consumption may increase with eutrophication in some fish species. Overall, the findings of this study suggest food web structure, eutrophication, and hydrogeomorphic features together explain low Hg concentrations in anthropogenically modified subtropical reservoirs in eastern China.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Taking a telescopic view of the multifaceted struggles of the workless prior to Black Tuesday challenges the myopic picture of the Great Depression as the sudden, unexpected eruption of unemployment protest.  Out of all proportion to their size and political strength, radical unemployment agitators between 1875-1928 proved to be vital protagonists in forcing relief measures, thrusting socialist values into public discourse and inspiring working-class resistance during economic crises and at times when the labour movement was at its weakest.  This dissertation examines hundreds of unemployment protests in urban centres across Canada during the 1872-1896 long depression, and the economic slumps of 1907-1909, 1912-1915 and 1921-1926.  These protests and the organizations of the workless challenged three distinct but overlapping stages in the evolution of the liberal-capitalist state: producer, progressive, and authoritarian.  Although always vulnerable and contingent, the mobilized workless responded with innovation to the evolution of liberal capitalism and, by gravitating towards the developing socialist alternative, gained greater coherence and uniformity as they moved from the local and spontaneous “les Misérables” (1875-1896) to an ad hoc “Organized Mob” (1907-1915) to a militant and sporadically nationally-organized “Unemployed Army” (1919-1935).  This study contends that the persistence of a moral economy, the strategies of disruption, and working-class anguish and indignation were key resources for the radical and socialist organizers of the unemployed.  Sensitive to the ways in which a culture of whiteness and masculinity often precluded greater solidarity amongst the workless, this dissertation also traces the ways unemployed diaspora socialists, socialist feminists and their allies encouraged a more diverse and inclusive movement.  Far from reactionary or apathetic, the mobilized unemployed were every bit as important to the vitality of the left as unions or political parties – their struggles were crucial elements in the development of Canada’s earliest socialist experiments.  Similarly, Canadian social policy history is unintelligible without an acknowledgment of the fundamental role that unemployment movements played in wresting concessions from the liberal order and as disruptive agents in the shaping of the welfare state.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences and associated proteins that cap the ends of chromosomes. Functional telomeres protect genetic information and maintain chromosomal stability. Critically short telomeres are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Telomeres shorten at every DNA replication and due to the nature of their molecular structures are also particularly sensitive to oxidative damage. Consequently, oxidative stress accelerates age-dependent telomere shortening. Certain lifestyle factors affect the oxidant/anti-oxidant balance and can promote oxidative stress. The objectives of this thesis were to determine the effect of alcohol, smoking and physical activity on telomere length in a healthy adult population and to explore an interaction with CYP2E1 and alcohol on telomere length. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to recruit 678 healthy volunteers from 2006 to 2008 from Kingston and Ottawa, Ontario, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. This sub-study included 477 individuals with an available DNA sample and complete questionnaire data. Alcohol consumption, smoking and physical activity were assessed by self-administered questionnaire and CYP2E1 was genotyped by the TaqMan® drug metabolism genotyping assay in the larger study. Relative leukocyte telomere length was measured using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the effect of lifestyle on telomere length while controlling for important covariates. Effect modification by CYP2E1 genotype, specifically the CYP2E1*5B polymorphism, in relation to alcohol was investigated by the inclusion of a product term in the model. RESULTS: Alcohol consumption was not associated with telomere length. The interaction with CYP2E1 was not statistically significant; however, the effect of alcohol on telomere length was qualitatively stronger among those with the normal form of CYP2E1. Current smoking and pack-years smoking were inversely related to telomere length. After adjustment for confounders telomere length was not associated with total physical activity; however, higher vigorous physical activity was associated with longer telomeres. CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, research has demonstrated a relationship between shorter telomeres and age-related diseases, including many forms of cancer. This study found that smoking was inversely associated and vigorous physical activity was positively associated with leukocyte telomere length.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My dissertation conducts a conceptual investigation into Judith Butler’s (1990/1999,1993) theory of performativity and Julia Kristeva’s (1982) theorizing on the abject. I use the concepts gleaned from my theoretical exploration to construct an analytical framework that offers ways of explaining the subversion of dominant discourses in the context of autonomous activism. The purpose of this endeavour is to develop a framework for how activist practices can be both more fully autonomous from – and more effectively subversive to – dominant discourses. I apply my framework to the autonomous elements within the Idle No More Movement in order to elucidate the subversive potential of this type of activism for subverting dominant discourses and how it can be strengthened. This application does not seek to define or analyze the movement itself, but rather to offer an explanation for the repression of autonomous-based activism within mainstream Canada. Overall, I find that activism within Western society is caught up in a discursive struggle whereby the suppression of social movements is enacted, in part, through a multitude of abjection processes that are executed through such practices as social interactions, psychological mechanisms, written text, and visual representations. In order to work against this abjection, I develop and present a subversive strategy that calls for the performative repetition of what is abject to dominant discourses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background/Purpose/Objectives: The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between metal exposure during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy and the risk of small for gestational age (SGA). Size for gestational age is an important predictor of early childhood morbidity and mortality. Genetic polymorphisms in glutathione s transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and pi 1 (GSTP1) were explored as possible effect modifiers of this relationship. Study Design/Methods: This research is nested within a larger study called The Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study. The MIREC study is a biomonitoring study being conducted by Health Canada, the Sainte Justine hospital in Montreal, and clinical researchers from various other cities. The study population is a sample of 2000 pregnant women, recruited during the first trimester of pregnancy from across Canada between 2007 and 2011. Blood lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic were all measured in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Arsenic in urine was measured in the first trimester. A log binomial regression model was used to investigate the relationship of interest. Product terms were used to explore the gene polymorphisms. Results: No association was found between blood lead, cadmium or arsenic and risk for SGA. Increased risk for SGA was observed between the ≤.0.8 µg/L and the ≥1.6 µg/L exposure groups for mercury (RR=1.56; 95% CI = 1.04-2.58) and, between the ≥22.56 µg/L and ≤.75 µg/L exposure groups for arsenobetaine (RR= 1.65; 95% CI = 1.10-2.47) after adjustment for the effects of parity and smoking. A marginally significant interaction was observed between the GSTP1 polymorphism and blood lead level in relation to risk for SGA (p for interaction =0.06). No other SNPs were found to modify the relationship between any metal exposure and SGA risk.&#xD;
 Conclusions: These results suggest that increased levels of mercury in a pregnant woman’s blood or of arsenobetaine in a pregnant woman’s urine, are associated with giving birth to an infant that is SGA. These results are suggestive of increased risk for an adverse effect of low-level lead exposure during pregnancy on fetal size in those with the GSTP1A114V variant genotype.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Telerobotic systems are designed to extend the manipulation capability of users at different scales to remote and dangerous environments. In the past decade, the availability of higher computational power, larger variety of commercial haptic devices and faster means of communication at lower costs have facilitated the rapid development of haptic technology and new applications that would require an interconnection of more than one master and slave. Examples of such applications are telementoring of surgical residents and dual-arm tele-manipulation of objects. These networked systems are dynamically involved and are often represented by multi-port networks; as such, the coupled stability analysis and the design of multilateral controllers for these systems pose a great challenge. This thesis proposes new stability analysis tools and control architectures for networked telerobotic systems, modelled by lumped multi-port networks, distributed multi-port networks, and a cascade of two-port networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first methodology deals with extending the Zeheb-Walach absolute stability theorem, originally developed for microwave systems, to robotic systems represented by a lumped network. The extended Zeheb-Walach theorem allows for studying a larger class of networks with marginal stability, such as robotic systems with position feedback. In the second methodology, a distributed framework for the development of a stability-guaranteed telerobotic system with any number of masters and slaves is proposed. The proposed architecture allows for any number of master or slave networks, all connected to a simple sharing protocol that governs the dynamic interaction among them. Modular stability analysis of each master or slave network, regardless of the underlying sharing paradigm, is conducted using the notion of absolute k-stability. In the third approach, Mobius transformation is used to develop a chain-wise stability analysis methodology to verify the coupled stability of a cascade of networks. The proposed methodology tracks the transmitted passivity unit disk of the load through the cascade to the user network and allows for networks in the cascade that are not passive nor absolutely stable. Due to the modularity of this methodology, it is more suitable for dynamic distributed systems in which a network block in the cascade is modified, added or taken out.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is well established that throughout the nineteenth century Spanish painting of the Golden Age played a central role in the formulation of the painterly idioms of French artists that adhered to diverging, even opposed, styles of painting. Spanish motifs in painting were championed by artists like Manet and the painterly techniques of these Old Masters became a fertile source of inspiration for artists like Courbet. Less recognized, however, are the complexity and implications of the relationship between French painters and Spanish painting and the highly personal character of such a relationship. The work of Théodule Augustin Ribot (1823-1891) demonstrates a peculiarly steadfast debt to the Spanish Old Masters. A close study of his oeuvre provides valuable insight into the nature of his relationship with Spanish painting. Conversely, it also elucidates the concerns and tensions imbricated in the relationships of his artist-friends, the critics that assessed his work, and the collectors that owned some of France’s most magnificent displays of Spanish painting, with Spanish painting. At a time when a young generation of artists searching for truthfulness and verisimilitude turned to the Spanish Old Masters for their compelling renditions of Saints and beggars; at a time when Spanish painting became a viable alternative to the classicizing motifs endorsed by the Academy; at a time when the search for a new national art conclusively impacted the relationships between artists and the art of the past; at a time when France’s interventionist policy in Spain congealed into an unprecedented influx of Spanish paintings in France; at such a time, what did it mean for Ribot to so steadfastly inform his work with Spanish painting? This dissertation focuses on the ways in which Spanish painting impacted the work of Ribot and in so doing it complicates established notions on the relationship between seventeenth-century Spanish painting and French painting of the nineteenth century.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The production of organic acids in solid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) is challenging, as acids absorb into amorphous polymers only in their undissociated form. Thus, at near-neutral fermentation pH values, where dissociated conjugate base species are dominant, partitioning is restricted. This thesis utilizes high pressure CO2 to achieve temporary pH reductions during the production of butyric acid (pKa=4.8) by Clostridium tyrobutyricum, permitting acid absorption and in situ product recovery (ISPR), reducing end-product inhibition and improving fermentative performance.&#xD;
A growth medium with minimized buffering was developed which did not interfere with pH reductions, and using CO2 sparging a pH of 4.8 was achieved, compared to 5.3 in the original medium, with no difference in cell growth. Buffering from the accumulation of butyric acid during fermentation was observed, however, ISPR of butyric acid was demonstrated using CO2 at atmospheric pressure, yet this did not achieve improvements in reactor performance, and it was concluded that high pressure CO2 may overcome buffering to improve recovery.&#xD;
To determine what pH would need to be reached with CO2, a first-principles study of pH-dependent partitioning was performed, identifying partition coefficient (PC), polymer fraction (F) and pH as variables for determining organic acid recovery. Through polymer screening based on thermodynamic affinity for butyric acid, an absorptive polymer was selected (Pebax®2533), and partitioning tests for both butyric acid (PC=4.2) and benzoic acid (PC=70, pKa=4.2) validated pH-dependent partitioning models. 60 bar pCO2 was shown to achieve up to 40% recovery of butyric acid, yielding a distribution coefficient (D) of 1.8, and 90% recovery of benzoic acid (D=24), demonstrating clear improvement over atmospheric pressures.&#xD;
Finally, exposure of cell populations to 60 bar pCO2 showed no adverse biological effect, and at this pressure medium buffering effects were substantially overcome. During fed-batch production of butyric acid the use of high pCO2 provided the necessary pH reductions to achieve substantial acid recovery during fed-batch production of butyric acid, as overall yields, titres, and volumetric productivities were increased by 35%, 60%, and 96%, respectively. High pCO2 represents a novel method for achieving ISPR of butyric acid, which could be extended to the production of other organic acids.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hamilton, Ontario has provided a testing ground for social historians exploring questions about labour, working-class conflict, and shop-floor politics. These studies, though extensive, have largely overlooked the political culture of the city, especially outside these boundaries. Despite the hopes of its left-wing political parties, mid-twentieth century Hamilton fostered a flourishing political culture centred on the rhetoric of traditional liberalism. This political rhetoric was nurtured by the dominant Conservative Party politicians, the traditional trades and crafts-based union movement, a growing middle class, and fervent boosters. This political tradition was strongly informed by the shared British heritage touted by these same groups. These ideals were flexible and mutable, which allowed them to be adopted with versatility as the political climate demanded. This dissertation examines how this political culture survived through decades of economic, social, and labour unrest between 1929 and 1953. Through focusing on municipal government and local politics, this dissertation is able to explore how these political ideals were incorporated in practice, and repeated and reformed in the city’s many elections. This exploration incorporates questions about how these political ideals responded to the inclusion of women, immigrants, and the growing labour movement. It also traces how these values were adapted to suit the political climate of the Great Depression, Second World War, and the post-1946 labour crises that rocked the city’s industries and shaped collective bargaining practice across the country.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>At the Renaissance noble court, particularly in the principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, alchemical pursuits were wildly popular and encouraged. By the reign of Rudolf II in the late sixteenth century, Prague had become synonymous with the study of alchemy, as the emperor, renowned for his interest in natural magic, welcomed numerous influential alchemists from across Europe to his imperial residence and private laboratory. Given the prevalence of alchemical activities and the ubiquity of the occult at the Habsburg court, it seems plausible that the art growing out of this context would have been shaped by this unique intellectual climate.&#xD;
In 1562, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, a previously little-known designer of windows and frescoes from Milan, was summoned across the Alps by Ferdinand I to fulfil the role of court portraitist in Vienna.  Over the span of a quarter-century, Arcimboldo continued to serve faithfully the Habsburg family, working in various capacities for Maximilian II and later for his successor, Rudolf II, in Prague. As Arcimboldo developed artistically at the Habsburg court, he gained tremendous recognition for his composite portraits, artworks for which he is most well-known today. Through a focused investigation of his Four Seasons, Four Elements, and Vertumnus, a portrait of Rudolf II under the guise of the god of seasons and transformation, an attempt will be made to reveal the alchemical undercurrents present in Arcimboldo’s work. This is not to say that Arcimboldo’s puzzle portraits reference specific alchemical treatises, or that the artist participated actively in alchemical experiments. Rather, in their transformative configuration and subject matter, Arcimboldo’s composite portraits reflect the very ethos of alchemical philosophy and spirituality that so permeated the early modern Habsburg court, an intellectual environment to which he belonged and contributed for a considerable span of time.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Modelling is widely used in traditional engineering. Models also serve as the founda- tion of theoretical computer science—from computational models to formal languages. However, even though software designers use formal systems of software, a dominant modelling methodology—model-driven development (MDD)—has not yet penetrated into the industry. This can be attributed to the practitioners’ flawed understanding of the benefits of MDD, the practitioners’ programming-centric mindset, and current complex and expensive tools. Thus, this project aims at providing education and simple tools for the public to appreciate MDD. The product of this project is Urml, which is an educational toolkit for utilizing MDD to develop models for reactive sys- tems. There are four steps in using this toolkit: first, one specifies the metamodel that serves as the language to build models; secondly, one builds a model for reactive systems using the language that one has built; thirdly, one analyzes the model for cor- rectness and consistency; and fourthly, one executes the model for testing through a custom-made interpreter. These four steps—(1) language design, (2) model building, (3) model analysis, and (4) model execution—serve as the pillar of MDD and thus provide students a comprehensive overview of what MDD entails. This toolkit is com- plemented with identifications of extensions and customizations suitable as student projects in a graduate course in MDD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Unlike the existing detectors for decode-and-forward (DF) relaying in the ideal case&#xD;
without interference, this thesis considers a more practical scenario where arbitrary&#xD;
interference is present. We consider a DF cooperative diversity network consisting of&#xD;
one source, multiple relays, one destination and multiple interferers affecting the relays&#xD;
as well as the destination. Under this scenario, for the  first time in the literature, we develop the exact closed-form rules for optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) detectors&#xD;
for DF systems employing any one- or two-dimensional modulations in the presence&#xD;
of interference. In particular, we derive the optimum ML detection rules for two&#xD;
transmission schemes: simultaneous transmission and orthogonal transmission. In&#xD;
each transmission scheme, we derive the detection rules by considering two different&#xD;
cases of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI): the CSI of the second-hop&#xD;
is known or unknown at the relays. Numerical results demonstrate that the developed&#xD;
optimum detectors significantly outperform the conventional detector which simply&#xD;
ignores the existence of interference.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the design of regulation for financial institutions fol- lowing the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In the aftermath of the crisis, regulators in many countries tightened regulations governing financial institutions in order to pre- vent future financial panics. The aim of this dissertation is to determine how some of these new regulations will influence the behaviour of financial institutions, and if these regulations will result in a safer and sounder financial system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the current thesis study it is intended to investigate the potential effect of the inert condensing agent (ICA) of n-hexane used in condensed mode operation on the solubility of ethylene in produced polyethylene (PE) and consequently the quality and rate of gas phase ethylene polymerization on supported catalyst under reactive conditions. This is the first time for such a study. Performing the set of designed polymerization reaction experiments using a lab-scale stirred-bed gas phase reactor, it is observed that the instantaneous rate of ethylene polymerization increases in the presence of n-hexane, thus supporting the initial speculation of the effect of n-hexane on the enhancement of the ethylene solubility in polymer known as “cosolubility” phenomenon. In order to have a better picture and understanding, the averaged instantaneous rate of polymerization in presence of n-hexane is normalized with the one without any n-hexane. Consequently, this helps to see that while the effect of n-hexane increases proportionally to its partial pressure in the gas phase composition, this effect is more pronounced at the initial steps during the course of polymerization.&#xD;
In the current thesis study for the first time, the Sanchez-Lacombe EOS as one of the most widely applied thermodynamic models in polymer industry is adapted and developed in order to study not only the solubility but also concentration of ethylene in polyethylene in the absence and presence of an inert condensing agent in order to quantify the speculated cosorption phenomenon under the reactive polymerization condition. By incorporating this thermodynamic model to describe the solubility of ethylene in polymer into a single particle model like Polymer Flow Model (PFM) to estimate the concentration and temperature gradient through a growing polymer particle, it is ultimately attempted to predict the effect of change in the process operating condition by addition of n-hexane as the ICA to the gas phase composition.&#xD;
Finally in the current thesis study, it is demonstrated how the thermal effect associated with the heat of sorption of ICAs can have a positive effect in terms of avoiding particle over-heating under certain circumstances like its temporary exposition to the defluidized regions inside a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) as a possible undesirable operating condition for this type of reactor set-ups.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A translocation between chromosomes 1 and 19, referred to as t(1;19), results in expression of the chimeric, oncogenic transcription factor E2A-PBX1 in cases of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Previous studies have shown that E2A-PBX1 functions as an activator of target gene transcription and that oncogenesis requires direct binding of E2A-PBX1 with the histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300. However, the transcriptional targets of this complex remain largely unknown.  To identify and characterize genomic sites bound by E2A-PBX1 we performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for E2A-PBX1, p300 and the functional histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 in the t(1;19) leukemic cell line RCH-ACV. Putative E2A-PBX1 binding sites were validated by site-specific ChIP-qPCR. Bioinformatics tools were used to perform “integrative analysis” and characterize E2A-PBX1 binding on a genome-wide scale.&#xD;
This analysis resulted in the identification of 555 high-confidence E2A-PBX1 sites in the RCH-ACV genome most of which occur distally (&gt;10kb) relative to the TSSs of known genes. Ontology and pathway analysis showed that candidate E2A-PBX1 target genes are involved in hematopoiesis, lymphopoiesis, and cancer progression. Binding of E2A-PBX1 to a random sampling of these sites was performed using site-specific ChIP-qPCR. Consistent with earlier results, E2A-PBX1-bound sites were strongly associated with p300 recruitment and the activating chromatin marks H3K4me1 and H3K4me3; analysis of RNA-seq data confirmed a strong association between proximate binding by E2A-PBX1 and gene transcription. Surprisingly, rather than associating with consensus PBX1 binding sequences as expected, E2A-PBX1 associated with sites bound by the B-lymphopoietic transcription factors EBF1 and wild-type E2A; EBF1, E2A and E2A-PBX1 were confirmed to co-localize at selected E2A-PBX1 binding sites.  The results of this study identify hundreds of E2A-PBX1 genomic binding sites, confirm CBP/p300 recruitment and transcriptional activation in association with these sites, and raise the novel and surprising possibility that E2A-PBX1 disrupts the transcriptional regulation of B-lymphopoiesis through physically associating with the lymphopoietic transcription factors EBF1 and wild-type E2A.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis considers a time-varying extremum seeking control algorithm that adjusts set-points provided to a model predictive controller for a vapour compression system. While perturbation-based extremum seeking methods have been known for some time, they suffer from slow convergence rates---a problem emphasized in application by the long time constants associated with thermal systems. The proposed method uses time-varying extremum seeking, which has faster and more reliable convergence properties for this application. In particular, we regulate the compressor discharge temperature using a model predictive controller with set-points selected from a model-free time-varying extremum seeking algorithm. We show that the relationship between compressor discharge temperature and power consumption is convex (a requirement for this class of real-time optimization), and use discrete-time extremum seeking control to drive these set-points to values that minimize power. The results are compared to the traditional perturbation-based extremum seeking approach. Further, because the required cooling capacity (and therefore compressor speed) is a function of measured and unmeasured disturbances, the optimal compressor discharge temperature set-point must vary according to these conditions. We show that the energy optimal discharge temperature is tracked with the time-varying extremum seeking algorithm in the presence of disturbances.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this dissertation, I develop and study a dynamic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with housing and banking. The framework is used to explore several sets of issues related to housing and financial markets. In Chapter 2, I investigate the extent to which a disruption in banks' balance sheets affects the behavior of the housing market and the macroeconomy in an experiment that mimics the Great Recession. The model can qualitatively capture key features of the phenomenon of the Great Recession in response to a financial shock. In Chapter 3, I investigate the model's ability to more generally account for important features of the business cycle observed in the data. In particular, the model with estimated shocks replicates well several key features of housing and financial markets and the macroeconomy observed in the data. It can quantitatively account for the volatility and procyclicality of consumption, investment, house prices and some financial variables. It can also reproduce the co-movements among the quantities of interest. Moreover, I find that technology shocks are the main driving forces of fluctuations in the housing market and the macroeconomy, explaining more than 95 percent of the volatility in housing investment and house prices, and more than 85 percent of the volatility in consumption and GDP. Financial shocks and housing technology shocks are the primary driving forces of fluctuations in the financial market at business cycle frequencies, explaining more than 90 percent of the volatility in loans and net worth. In Chapter 4, I evaluate various macroprudential policies that might help to mitigate the volatility of house prices and household debts, both of which are perceived to be reliable indicators of financial distress historically. My simulation results show that countercyclical policies specifically designed to react to credit and house price growth are useful in stabilizing the financial and housing markets. Moreover, an asymmetric tax schedule that favours impatient households can reduce the volatility of both house prices and household debts without causing excess volatility in other macroeconomic variables. In this regard, this macroprudential policy can be viewed as an effective tool that can successfully contain both financial imbalances and housing market instability in a booming economy exhibiting rapid house price appreciation and credit expansion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The bag cell neurons of Aplysia initiate reproductive behaviour by secreting egg-laying hormone during a prolonged period of synchronous and repetitive firing known as the afterdischarge. Electrical coupling facilitate the functional syncytium between bag cell neurons. We used dual tight-seal whole-cell recording to examine the biophysical properties and modulation of electrical synapses between pairs of cultured bag cell neurons. Transjunctional voltage did not influence junctional conductance. Presynaptically evoked action potentials transferred through gap junctions to elicit postsynaptic electrotonic potentials (ETPs). Bag cell neurons did not show dye coupling; hence, the permeability of electrical synapses was tested using block of K+ current. Presynaptic neurons were whole-cell loaded with Cs+ or TEA and transfer measured by suppression of postsynaptic K+ current. Cs+, but not TEA, reduced the K+ current in electrically-coupled neighbours. In addition, the gap junction blockers meclofenamic acid, niflumic acid, and nitrobenzoic acid, but not glycyrrhetinic acid and quinine, considerably attenuated junctional current.&#xD;
The afterdischarge is accompanied by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and upregulation of PKC. Elevating Ca2+ with a train of voltage steps, which mimics the onset of the afterdischarge, decreased junctional conductance. The inhibition was most effective when Ca2+ entry occurred in both electrically-coupled neurons. Depletion of Ca2+ from the mitochondria, but not the endoplasmic reticulum, also attenuated junctional communication. Buffering Ca2+ with high intracellular EGTA prevented uncoupling, as did inhibition of CaM kinase. Application of a PKC activator modestly decreased junctional current, while elevating Ca2+ along with PKC inhibited electrical synapses to an even greater extent than Ca2+ alone. Our results suggest that PKC and Ca2+-dependent activation of CaM kinase inhibit electrical signalling. This may contribute to an enhancement of neuronal excitability leading to the secretion of reproductive hormone. Ca2+ influx also decreased the amplitude and time course of the ETP, which may improve synchrony by preventing lengthy ETPs and out-of-phase postsynaptic action potentials. Thus, modulation of electrical coupling may act as a means to enhance and sustain the release of reproductive hormone.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We formulate Global Shape Descriptors for object classifi cation in range data. The goal of object class recognition is to identify and localize objects of interest in a 3D point cloud.This work focuses on the automatic classifi cation of objects that lie within the vicinity of streets in 3D point clouds of urban environments. The system first successfully segments objects of interest from the scene through a combination of ground segmentation and road extraction using a Kalman  filtering approach, and cluster extraction using a region growing technique. Those clusters that fall close to the road are then passed to a classification phase, where they are compared against a labelled database of such clusters. The comparison of clusters is based upon Variable-Dimensional Global Shape Descriptors, which encode the geometry of the objects into multi-dimensional histograms, the similarities of which are measured against the database clusters using a variety of metrics including Earth Movers Distance and Bhattacharya similarity. The technique was tested on a dense data set acquired from central New York City, containing 110 objects partitioned into 5 classes. The method had an average successful recognition rate of 94.5% for a rich set of vehicles, pedestrians, and street furniture such as  re hydrants, street signs, and poles.</dcterms:abstract>
