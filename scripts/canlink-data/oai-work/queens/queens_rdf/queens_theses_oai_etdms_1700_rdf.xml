      <dcterms:abstract>In 2009, 4.1 million Canadians over the age of twelve experienced an activity-limiting injury.  Of these injuries 35% occurred from sport or physical activity (Canadian Community Health Survey, 2009).  Although injuries occur most commonly in sport and exercise activities, it is difficult to study injured athletes with similar injuries all occurring within the same time frame.  Therefore, a scenario protocol was used in the study which described the occurrence of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.  The purpose of this study was to compare a modeling, an imagery, and a control group on psychological factors related to a hypothetical injury.  Healthy athletes (N=86; M age = 22.06 years; SD = 4.37) who had no recent experience of an injury and had not experienced an ACL injury were included in the study.  At baseline, athletes read a scenario that described the occurrence of an ACL injury.  Participants then completed questionnaires including, demographic information, expected pain, task and coping efficacy, projected rehabilitation adherence, and movement imagery ability.  Within two weeks of completing the baseline testing, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: control, modeling, or imagery.  Participants either met with the primary researcher or were sent a link via email in order to complete the follow-up.  At the beginning of the follow-up, all groups were given the scenario to read over.  Then participants were given the respective treatment.  The modeling condition consisted of a video of an athlete who described his experience of an ACL repair.  The guided imagery condition involved a recorded script that detailed the recovery process of an ACL injury.  The control condition only read the scenario.  Afterwards, participants completed the questionnaires involving expected pain, task and coping efficacy, and rehabilitation adherence.  Four separate 3 (group) x 2 (time) repeated measures ANOVAs and two ANCOVAs were conducted to examine between group differences in athletes’ perceptions of pain, task and coping efficacy, and rehabilitation adherence before and after the intervention was administered.  No group by time interactions were found for any of the dependent variables.  However, there were changes over time for pain, F(1, 81) = 5.97, p = .017, task efficacy, F(1, 79) = 193.23, p &lt; .001, coping efficacy, F(1, 79)  = 11.16, p = .001, and frequency of adherence, F(1, 32) = 5.17, p = .03. Findings from manipulation check questions suggest that modeling and imagery could serve as pre-injury education tools for athletes to use if they are faced with an injury in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:&#xD;
Previous literature has found mixed results concerning the relationship between depression, and anxiety, and length of hospital stay among cardiac surgical patients.  Given the high prevalence of these psychiatric illnesses and cardiovascular disease in Canada, a better understanding of the relationship between these variables has the potential to influence medical and psychiatric outcomes for countless individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives:&#xD;
The objectives of this manuscript style thesis are to (a) describe the prevalence of mild and moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders in a sample of cardiac patients (Manuscript 1) and (b) analyze the effects of these symptoms on post-operative length of stay while controlling for potential confounding variables (Manuscript 2). &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods:&#xD;
This secondary analysis used data collected from a consecutive series of consenting patients attending Foothills Hospital Pre-operative Assessment Clinic (August 1998-March 2002).  Patients completed the Zung Self-Rating Depression and Anxiety scales, and a questionnaire assessing potential confounders.  Manuscript 1: Prevalence values and 95% intervals were calculated for mild and moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety while logistic regression was used to determine predictors of these conditions. Manuscript 2: The relationship between symptoms of depression, anxiety and length of stay was analyzed using multiple linear regression. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Results:&#xD;
Manuscript 1:  We estimated that moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were present in 10.66% and 3.42%, respectively.  Mild depression (21.90%) and anxiety (32.89%) were also present.  Common predictors of both conditions included sex, general health, and a recent myocardial infarction.  Depression was further associated with co-morbid illness, as was type of surgery with anxiety. Manuscript 2: Patients with depression experienced a significant increase in length of stay compared to mentally healthy patients.  Age, general health, type of surgery and education also predicted hospital stay, while anxiety did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions:&#xD;
Manuscript 1:  The prevalence of depression and anxiety in our sample demonstrates the need to address the burden of psychiatric illness in this population.  Predictors of these disorders may assist in determining risk groups that would benefit most from psychiatric testing and interventions. Manuscript 2:  The elevated length of stay observed among patients with depression supports the implementation of screening and treatment in this population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Given two sets of points $A$ and $B$ ($|A| = m$, $|B| = n$), we seek to find a minimum-weight many-to-many matching which seeks to match each point in $A$ to at least one point in $B$ and vice versa.  Each matched pair (an edge) has a weight.  The goal is to find the matching that minimizes the total weight.  We study two kinds of problems depending on the edge weight used.  The first edge weight is the Euclidean distance, $d_1$.  The second is edge weight is the square of the Euclidean distance, $d_2$.  There already exists an $O(k\log k)$ algorithm for $d_1$, where $k=m+n$.  We provide an $O(mn)$ algorithm for the $d_2$ problem.  We also solve the problem of finding the minimum-weight matching when the sets $A$ and $B$ are allowed to be translated on the real line.  We present an $O(mnk \log k)$ algorithm for the $d_1$ problem and an $O(3^{mn})$ algorithm for the $d_2$.  Furthermore,  we also deal with the special case where $A$ and $B$ lie on a circle of a specific circumference.  We present an $O(k^2 \log k)$ algorithm and $O(kmn)$ algorithm for solving the minimum-weight matching for the $d_1$, and $d_2$ weights respectively.  Much like the problem on the real line, we extend this problem to allow the sets $A$ and $B$ to be rotated on the circle.  We try to find the minimum-weight many-to-many matching when rotations are allowed.  For $d_1$ we present an $O(k^2mn \log k)$ algorithm and a $O(3^{mn})$ algorithm for $d_2$.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous studies of the left have tended to focus on groups or movements within the confines of national boundaries.  Yet the adherents of these organizations were often migrants who traveled to and lived in multiple states.  The Italian anarchist movement emerged during the latter half of the nineteenth century during the process of that country’s unification.  As the need for cheap labour in the industrializing nations of north-western Europe and North and South America grew, a mass exodus of migrants left Italy.   Among those migrants were anarchists who established networks that spanned continents and the Atlantic Ocean.  Wherever Italian anarchists settled they began to publish journals, engage in anarchist activism, and re-create the radical culture that had its roots in Italy.  This dissertation examines a portion of the transnational anarchist movement that existed in Canada and the United States between 1915 and 1940.  The themes explored in this work include the formation of these transnational anarchist networks, the divisions within the Italian anarchist movement and their repercussions, how transnational activism was conducted, and the culture these transnational radicals created.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Atomic vapors condensed onto solid surfaces form a remarkable category of condensed matter materials, the so-called thin films, with a myriad of compositions, morphological structures, and properties.&#xD;
	The dynamic process of atomic condensation exhibits self-assembled pattern formation, producing morphologies with atomic-scale three-dimensional structures of seemingly limitless variety. &#xD;
	This study attempts to shed new light on the dynamical growth processes of thin film deposition by analyzing in detail a previously unreported specific distinct emergent structure, a crystalline triangular-shaped spike that grows within copper and silver thin films.&#xD;
	I explored the deposition parameters that lead to the growth of these unique structures, referred to as ``nanospikes'', fabricating approximately 55 thin films and used scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis.&#xD;
	The variation of parameters include: vapor incidence angle, film thickness, substrate temperature, deposition rate, deposition material, substrate, and source-to-substrate distance.&#xD;
	Microscopy analysis reveals that the silver and copper films deposited at glancing vapor incidence angles, 80 degrees and greater, have a high degree of branching interconnectivity between adjacent inclined nanorods.&#xD;
	Diffraction analysis reveals that the vapor incidence angle influences the sub-populations of crystallites in the films, producing two different [110] crystal texture orientations.&#xD;
	I hypothesize that the growth of nanospikes from nanorods is initiated by the stochastic arrival of vapor atoms and photons emitted from the deposition source at small diameter nanorods, and then driven by localized heating from vapor condensation and photon absorption.&#xD;
	Restricted heat flow due to nanoscale thermal conduction maintains an elevated local temperature at the nanorod, enhancing adatom diffusion and enabling fast epitaxial crystal growth, leading to the formation and growth of nanospikes.&#xD;
	Electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis, and comparisons to related scientific literature, support this hypothesis.&#xD;
	&#xD;
	I also designed a highly modular ultrahigh vacuum deposition chamber, capable of concurrently mounting several different pieces of deposition equipment, that allows for a high degree of control of the growth dynamics of deposited thin films. &#xD;
	I used the newly designed chamber to fabricate tailor-made nanostructured tantalum films for use in ultracapacitors, for the Cabot Corporation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Teleoperation systems broaden human ability to perform a task in a real or virtual, local or remote environment. &#xD;
An emerging application of  such systems is in dual-user teleoperation or haptic simulation systems in which two users collaboratively perform a task  in a shared real or virtual environment. Examples of this application are in human haptic guidance for rehabilitation therapy and medical surgical training. In such collaborative systems, users interact with each other and a user's decision is affected by the other user's decisions.&#xD;
This interaction between users bring out the need for new control architecture design methods. In addition, the controller should maintain system stability and achieve desired performance under various operational conditions, including contact with a wide range of environments and being interfaced with two users displaying highly variable arm dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
To this purpose, a class of shared control architectures &#xD;
for human haptic guidance has been developed. The architectures feature a dominance factor that adjusts the supremacy of the trainer over the trainee in the execution of a task. &#xD;
To tackle the stability issue, a novel robust stability analysis framework for unconditional stability analysis of multi-user teleoperation/haptic systems has been proposed. &#xD;
In terms of performance these systems have been evaluated kinesthetically, referring to the dynamics felt by the users, or task-based, referring to the quantities that measure task efficiency and effort.&#xD;
For kinesthetic performance evaluation of dual-user systems as opposed to the single-user systems, there are two users interacting with the environment and with each other.&#xD;
In these systems it may be desirable for a user to not only feel the environment but also to sense the other user dynamics. Hence, some of the previously defined performance measures for single-user systems have been extended for dual-user systems. Furthermore, two novel performance measures for multilateral dual-user systems have been introduced.&#xD;
Finally, to assess the task-based performance of the proposed architectures, a user study has been conducted for trajectory following tasks on a developed dual-user haptic simulation testbed under various environmental conditions, such as different environment geometries, environment view points and environment dynamics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Described here are detailed kinetic studies probing the structural elements which are crucial for the catalytic activity of dinuclear Zn(II) complexes towards phosphate diester cleavage. First, two sets of dinuclear Zn(II) complexes (a member with and without a bridging oxyanion linker group) were synthesized and their ability to promote the cyclization of 2-hydroxypropyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, a common model for RNA, was compared. Kinetic studies indicated that the complexes without the oxyanion linker were more active in promoting the cyclization in methanol under pH controlled conditions at 25 degrees. Quantitative energetics analysis shows that the rate reduction is attributable to a decrease in the second-order rate constant for the cyclization reaction, which adds 3.7 and 6.5 kcal/mol of activation energy to the respective reactions mediated by the complex with the oxyanion linker. Secondly, we have investigated a series of dinuclear Zn(II) complexes that incorporate various substituents including hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding ones. Analysis of the data at the pH optimum for each reaction indicates that the presence of the H-bonding groups and alkyl groups provides similar increases (at least an order of magnitude) of the kcat terms over the unfunctionalized complex. There is also no clear trend that H-bonding groups or the alkyl groups provide stronger binding to the substrate than the parent complex. We also describe here the preparation and kinetic analysis of a series of solid supported transition metal catalysts for the cleavage of P=O chemical warfare simulants and P=S pesticides. We report a kinetic study of a 1,10-phenanthroline:Zn(II) complex immobilized on macroporous polystyrene which is capable of accelerating the cleavage of G-agent and V-agent simulants in methanol at neutral and ambient temperature by up to one hundred thousand-fold. The materials are recoverable and can be recycled at least ten times. We have also devised a methodology for simple immobilization of an ortho-palladated dimethylbenzylamine complex on macroporous polystyrene and amorphous silica gel. We report the catalyst preparation and a detailed kinetic study of their catalysis of the methanolysis of five P=S pesticides at neutral and ambient temperature. The polymeric catalysts give over billion-fold acceleration compared to the uncatalyzed background reaction at the same pH.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study engages with select disease narratives of the Anglophone Caribbean through the lens of post/colonial theory, cultural criticism and the social history of medicine. Focusing on the biological image and metaphor of infection, as opposed to its more popular associations with hybridity and creolization in post/colonial theory, I argue that disease discourses facilitate more complex iterations of identity than the less dynamic, more static categories of ‘race’ (black versus white), cultural affiliation  (British, Indian, African or West Indian) or political identity (coloniser versus colonised) and propose a theory of infectious entanglements, by which I demonstrate and interrogate complex and transphenomenal representations of West Indian identity across ‘racial’, cultural and political boundaries. Primary texts include eighteenth- and nineteenth-century medical tracts on leprosy and tropical fevers; contemporary medical and cultural texts on HIV/AIDS; and works of fiction by writers such as Harold Sonny Ladoo (Trinidad/Canada), Frieda Cassin (Britain/Antigua) Lawrence Scott (Trinidad/Britain) and Jamaica Kincaid (Antigua/United States).&#xD;
My literary, cultural and historical analyses of biological representations of leprosy, tropical fever and HIV/AIDS suggest that each disease facilitated the construction of multiple cordons sanitaires, whose conceptual boundaries intersected and overlapped in different ways. These points of entanglement, I demonstrate, are useful sites for interrogating post/colonial constructions of identity in light of the relative fluidity of some boundaries (such as changing ideas about who is infectious and who can become infected, as with HIV/AIDS and leprosy) and the hardening lines of others (such as intersecting ideas about tropical fever, pathogenic environments and the emergence of medical cartography). More importantly, such intersections sometimes revealed the entanglement of medicine and other organs of post/colonial authority in past and ongoing othering projects and their legitimising roles in the articulation of essential difference.&#xD;
This dissertation is divided into three parts, each focusing on a particular disease that is iconic in post/colonial narratives about the Caribbean. Part 1 focuses on leprosy, Part 2 on tropical fever and Part 3, framed as a conclusion to this study, focuses on contemporary narratives of HIV/AIDS in the context of earlier narratives of leprosy and tropical fevers.</dcterms:abstract>

As a result, arthroscopic surgeons require extensive training and experience.  &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis describes a computer system to help improve target acquisition in arthroscopy by visualizing the location and alignment of an arthroscope using augmented virtuality.  A 3D computer model of the patient's joint (from CT) is shown, along with a model of the tracked arthroscopic probe and the projection of the camera image onto the virtual joint.  &#xD;
&#xD;
We performed a user study to determine the effectiveness of this navigated display; the study showed that for novice residents, the navigated display improved target acquisition. However, residents with at least two years of experience performed worse. For surgeons, no effect on performance was found.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Among the different types of flows encountered in practical applications, the physics of turbulent separated flows and turbulence induced secondary motion are not fully understood despite the large amount of previous experimental and numerical work.&#xD;
The objectives of this work are to study theoretically and computationally the&#xD;
conditions at the separation and reattachment point, the numerical simulation of turbulence induced secondary motion in non-circular ducts, and to provide a comprehensive test of different RANS models of these types of flow.&#xD;
In a theoretical study of flow separation, a Lagrangian approach was first used to&#xD;
derive an Eulerian criterion, which associates separation and reattachment points to a critical point in the eigenvalues of the Cauchy-Green tensor.&#xD;
A turbulent separated boundary layer under the influence of an adverse pressure&#xD;
gradient was simulated using DNS and LES techniques. A bootstrapping method&#xD;
was used to obtain high fidelity results at a relatively high Reynolds number with&#xD;
which the performance of some of the most commonly used eddy-viscosity turbulence&#xD;
models was evaluated. The DNS and LES results were used to assess the consistency&#xD;
of the different terms in the k−e , ζ −f , k −ω and Spalart-Allmaras models. Different&#xD;
wall-modelling techniques were employed for the calculation of separated boundary&#xD;
layers. The exact values of the modelled terms were calculated using the reference&#xD;
DNS and LES dataset. These results were used for both a priori and a posteriori&#xD;
tests. It was determined that the eddy-viscosity assumption works well, and that anisotropic effects are not significant in separated boundary layer.&#xD;
For the secondary flow calculation in non-circular ducts, direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow in square and skewed ducts were carried out to determine&#xD;
the effect of the duct (rhombus) included angle on both the mean and turbulence&#xD;
energy budgets. Two skewed ducts, with included angles of 30 and 60 degrees, were&#xD;
simulated. The capability of different turbulence models to predict the secondary&#xD;
velocity field was investigated. Results obtained from a non-linear stress-strain constitutive relation was found to be fairly accurate for the flows at the range of Reynolds number considered in this study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cobalt 60 (Co-60) radiation therapy is a simple and reliable method of treating cancer by irradiating treatment volumes within the patient with high energy gamma rays. Medical linear accelerators (linacs) began to replace Co-60 units during the 1960’s in more developed countries, but Co 60 has remained the main source of radiotherapy treatment in less developed countries around the world. As a result, technological advancements made in more developed countries to deliver more precise radiation treatment that improves patient outcome have not been clinically applied to Co-60 machines. The medical physics group at the Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario has shown that these same technological advancements can be applied to Co-60 machines which would increase the accessibility of these modern improvements in radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
However, for these modern treatments to improve patient outcome they require more precise localization of the patient prior to therapy. In more developed countries, this is currently provided by comparing computed tomography (CT) used for treatment planning with images acquired on the linac immediately before treatment. In the past decade, cone-beam CT (CBCT) has been developed to provide 3D CT images of the patient immediately prior to treatment on a linac. This imaging modality would also be ideal for patient localization when conducting modern Co-60 treatments since it would only require the addition of an imaging panel to produce CBCT images using the Co-60 source.&#xD;
A prototype Co-60 CBCT imaging system was implemented and characterized. Image noise, contrast, spatial resolution, and artifacts were studied. Algorithms to reduce the image artifacts were implemented and found to improve perceived image quality. The imaging system was found to have a ~1.8 mm high-contrast spatial resolution and the ability to detect 3 cm low-contrast soft-tissue structures in water. Anthropomorphic phantoms were also imaged and the observed anatomy in Co-60 CBCT images was comparable to kilovoltage CT. These results are comparable to clinically relevant linac-based CBCT using high energy X rays of similar energies to Co-60 gamma rays. This suggests that Co-60 CBCT should be able to provide the necessary images to localize patients for modern Co-60 radiation treatments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A conventional scanning tunneling microscope (STM) provides topographical and tunneling spectra information of atomic structures. However, the extremely small lateral dimension of the tunneling filament is also responsible for locally exciting photon emission with low-energy electrons. By combining an optical system to capture emitted photons with a conventional STM a powerful tool is realized. Optical, in addition to the geometrical and electrical, properties of atomic structures may be studied simultaneously at sub-Angstrom spatial resolution. This information could potentially be used as a means for chemically identifying individual molecules on surfaces. Furthermore, a complete understanding of luminescent molecules at the nanometer length scale could have implications with regard to nanoscale electronic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents an innovative design of a novel STM in conjunction with an optical system to study the electroluminescence of nanoscale objects. The STM features (1) a parabolic mirror as the primary optical component for photon capture, (2) simplified miniature piezoelectric actuated inertial z-motors and xy-positioning stage used to position the tunnel junction at the focal point of the parabolic mirror, (3) high photon collection efficiency equal to 0.90pi steradians and (4) capacitive displacement sensors monitoring the position of the tunnel junction in three-dimensions. This document reveals how the combination of these features makes this STM design superior to existing designs. The design of the STM, the importance of its features and the characterization of its performance are discussed in detail.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chemical reactions usually involve the conversion of reactants to products by&#xD;
overcoming an energetic barrier. Most commonly, this process can be assisted by adding energy through heat (thermochemistry), light (photochemistry) or electric current (electrochemistry).&#xD;
The fourth option is to overcome the reaction barrier through application of mechanical work, termed mechanochemistry. This method has received much attention from the scientific community in the last decade. Both theoretical and experimental studies have been performed, demonstrating the ability of mechanochemistry to activate reactions, with a strong focus on ringopening&#xD;
reactions. The vast majority of studies have focused on unimolecular reactions involving&#xD;
bond-rupture, which is very intuitively activated by the application of tensile stress. However, bimolecular reactions, which often involve bond formation as well as rupture, have received much less attention. In this thesis, we seek to change this by undertaking an in-depth study of&#xD;
mechanochemical activation of addition reactions to carbon-carbon double bonds, which involve the formation of two single bonds while the double bond becomes a single bond. We observe that large barrier changes can be induced by applying external force to reactions of this type, and the magnitude of these changes can be controlled by the choice of alkene substrate. By studying the&#xD;
changes induced in the geometry of the substrate, we are able to begin explaining the origins of the barrier reduction effect. In addition, by studying the contributions to the barrier change from mechanical work and the contributions from geometry changes, we discover that steric hindrance to a reaction can play a very significant role in the mechanochemical activation of the reaction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding how consumers evaluate products is of great interest to market researchers. Different approaches focus on how consumers compare, combine or process attributes (Bettman, Luce and Payne 1998, 2008; Chen and Chaiken 1999; Cohen, Fishbein and Ahtola 1972). While attribute evaluation is clearly central to these approaches, what makes particular product attributes influential to consumers’ overall evaluation of the product is not entirely clear. One of the central goals of the current work is to examine why certain product attributes are appealing or unappealing, and to explore the implications of this for product evaluation research, including work on choice and persuasion, and more focused investigations on the role of trivial attributes.&#xD;
I structure this framework around two broad issues: First, I suggest that product evaluation is based on an attribute’s ability to fulfill a particular goal. Furthermore, I examine the specific processes by which activated goals influence the role of product features on the evaluation of the product itself. Specifically, I suggest that goals are more likely to influence the impact of product attributes on product evaluation when goals are activated and perceived to fit with the product.&#xD;
Second, I focus on three product related features within the consumption environment that are likely to activate certain goals, especially extra-consumption goals (i.e. goals that are not directly relevant to the function of the product, but that may nevertheless exert an important influence on product evaluation). Those aspects include the context in which the product is evaluated (e.g. choosing between multiple products versus evaluating an individual product), product category associations (e.g. fair trade and coffee), and even specific features of the product being evaluated (e.g. shampoo with “eco-friendly” ingredients). These aspects can activate goals that influence the role of the product’s specific features on overall evaluation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background.  Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent chronic cardiovascular disease that is characterized by progressive functional decline.  Given the known links between high levels of support and positive health outcomes the objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the levels and patterns of social support, and related gender differences, 2) to determine the influence of support on functional outcomes as defined by a deterioration in physical function over 1-year following exacerbation of HF, and 3) to describe the effects of gender on social support in influencing adverse outcomes. Methods.  Data were obtained from a 1-year prospective cohort study that included male and female participants ≥ 65 years of age (n=435; 164 females; 271 males) with HF.  Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, 6 and 12-months containing clinical and demographic information and validated measures of 1) physical function, using derived scores from the Medical Outcome Study SF-12, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and 2) social support using the Medical Outcome Study, Social Support Survey.  Results. Women were more likely to be single, widowed or divorced, living alone and earned less annual income compared to men (p &lt; .01).  Women tended to report lower mean social support scores than men at all time points.  When controlling for clinical and demographic variables, being married (OR 12.2; 95%CI: 5.1, 19.2), living with someone (OR 13.6; 95%CI: 6.2, 21.0), and higher income (OR 0.08; 95%CI: .01, .15), were significantly associated with higher levels of social support at baseline. Although women reported significantly lower disease-specific (p= .01) and generic (p= .01) physical function scores, no significant gender differences existed in the proportion of men or women that experienced functional decline or death at 1-year of follow-up. In a multivariate logistic regression modeling, men with lower levels of social support were more likely to experience generic functional decline or adverse outcomes.  This was not the same for women. Conclusions.  Women, reported less social support and poorer functioning, but the impact of social support on functional decline was more pronounced in men.  Gender-sensitive management should be considered to optimize function for men and women living with HF.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation traces a shift in the Communist Party of Canada, from the 1929 to 1935 period of militant class struggle (generally known as the ‘Third Period’) to the 1935-1939 Popular Front Against Fascism, a period in which Communists argued for unity and cooperation with social democrats.  The CPC’s appropriation and redeployment of bourgeois gender norms facilitated this shift by bolstering the CPC’s claims to political authority and legitimacy.  ‘Woman’ and the gendered interests associated with women—such as peace and prices—became important in the CPC’s war against capitalism. What women represented symbolically, more than who and what women were themselves, became a key element of CPC politics in the Depression decade. Through a close examination of the cultural work of two prominent middle-class female members, Dorothy Livesay, poet, journalist and sometime organizer, and Eugenia (‘Jean’ or ‘Jim’) Watts, reporter, founder of the Theatre of Action, and patron of the Popular Front magazine New Frontier, this thesis utilizes the insights of queer theory, notably those of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Judith Butler, not only to reconstruct both the background and consequences of the CPC’s construction of ‘woman’ in the 1930s, but also to explore the significance of the CPC’s strategic deployment of heteronormative ideas and ideals for these two prominent members of the Party.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spacer-filled channels are employed in membrane modules in many industrial applications where feed-flow spacers (employed to separate membrane sheets and create flow channels) tend to enhance mass transport characteristics, possibly mitigating fouling and concentration polarization phenomena. In this work direct numerical simulation was performed for the flow in the spacer-filled channels to obtain a better understanding of fluid flow and mass transfer phenomena in these channels. A solute with a Schmidt number of 1 at Reynolds numbers of 300, 500 and 800 (based on the bulk velocity and spacer diameter) was considered. The effect of spacer location was also studied for three different configurations, spacer at the centre of the channel, at off-centre location, and attached to the wall. Instantaneous velocity fields and flow structures such as separation of boundary layer on the walls and on the cylinder, eddies on the walls, recirculation regions and vortex shedding were investigated. A Fourier analysis was carried out on the time series velocity data. Using this analysis the Strouhal number was calculated and the development of the flow towards a broader turbulent state at higher Reynolds number was captured. Other statistical characteristics such as time-averaged velocities and wall shear rates are obtained and discussed.  The average pressure loss which represents the operation cost of membrane modules was calculated for the channels and found to be highest for spacer at the centre of the channel and lowest for spacer attached to the wall. Scalar transport equation is directly solved along with Navier-Stokes equation to get the concentration field. Local Sherwood number is obtained on the walls and the relationship between shear stress, vortex shedding, and mass transfer enhancement was explored. The overall Sherwood number and Stanton number of the channels, which indicate the mass transfer performance of the channels, are obtained. It was observed that as spacer approaches the wall mass transfer rate is decreasing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Drawing on Berman’s (1972, 1988) political-cultural view of creativity, this thesis contextualizes consumer creativity in the context of a consumer community wrought with paradoxes and conflicts.  Adopting a netnography methodology and empirically examining how individual free/open source software (FOSS) community members interpret their own creative activities, this thesis finds that consumer creativity is a journey toward a moral destiny, with morality arising from the interplay between rationalism and Romanticism and the cultural, historical baggage of these two ideological systems (e.g., sexism in the domains of science and art). Along this journey, individual FOSS community members (i.e., FOSS programmers) co-create and negotiate their common identity—a craftsperson who is a scientist, artist, and moral warrior, an identity embodied by FOSS, their creative product and a form of technology.&#xD;
This journey is both sweet and bitter and full of paradoxes and conflicts, all of which have rich implications about the power relationships within the community. On the one hand, FOSS programmers recreate a mythologized paradise where they re-merge with the natural world and return to human nature and where they are re-actualizing the moral values of freedom, public interests, and egalitarianism. On the other hand, in this community, sexism against female programmers is rampant; some programmers could perceive that their creativity is constrained and exploited by powerful project owners and thereby feel alienated, frustrated, and trivialized; individual programmers could confront each other due to their different technological preferences and doubt each other’s motivations; and this community’s creative process is infused with politics. &#xD;
This thesis (1) enriches the marketing literature on consumer creativity which is dominated by an instrumental perspective of creativity by introducing the moral dimension of consumer creativity; (2) contributes to the marketing literature which is dominated by the view that the creative process is enjoyable and harmonious by examining paradoxes and conflicts in the creative process; and (3) enriches the marketing literature on the impact of  technology on human well-being and the natural environment by illustrating a contextualized view that the impact of a technology depends on the moral values of the creator and the user of this technology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In vivo, adipose tissue demonstrates only a limited capacity for self-repair, and the long-term treatment of subcutaneous defects remains an unresolved clinical problem. With the goal of regenerating healthy tissues, many tissue-engineering strategies have pointed to the potential of implementing three-dimensional (3-D), cell-seeded scaffolds for soft tissue augmentation and wound healing. In particular, microcarriers have shown promise as both cell expansion substrates and injectable cell-delivery vehicles for these applications. However, limited research has investigated the engineering of tissue-specific microcarriers, designed to closely mimic the native extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. In this work, methods were developed to fabricate microcarriers from decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) via non-cytotoxic protocols. Characterization by microscopy confirmed the efficacy of the fabrication protocols in producing stable beads, as well as the production of a microporous surface topography. The mean bead diameter was 934 ± 51 μm, while the porosity was measured to be 29 ± 4 % using liquid displacement. Stability and swelling behavior over 4 weeks indicated that the DAT-based microcarriers were effectively stabilized with the non-cytotoxic photochemical crosslinking agent rose bengal, with only low levels of protein release measured within a simulated physiological environment. In cell-based studies, the DAT-based microcarriers successfully supported the proliferation and adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) in a dynamic spinner flask system, with a more favorable response observed in terms of adhesion, proliferation, and adipogenesis on the DAT-based microcarriers relative to gelatin control beads. More specifically, dynamically-cultured hASCs on DAT-based microcarriers demonstrated greater lipid loading, as well as higher glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity, a key enzyme involved in triacylglycerol biosynthesis, at 7 days and 14 days in culture in an inductive medium. Overall, the results indicated that the DAT-based microcarriers provided a uniquely supportive environment for adipogenesis. Established microcarrier sterility and injectability further support the broad potential of these tissue-specific microcarriers as a novel, adipogenic, clinically-translatable strategy for soft tissue engineering.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Controlled radical polymerization (CRP) has emerged as a powerful method of creating polymers with tailored molecular architectures under mild reaction conditions. However, production of these polymers efficiently at an industrial scale will likely require them to be synthesized in the dispersed phase. Three types of CRP are explored, Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP), Nitroxide Mediated Polymerization (NMP) and Catalytic Chain Transfer (CCT) to elucidate the intricacies of creating these novel polymer colloids. Compartmentalization in an ATRP dispersed phase system is explored theoretically to understand the effects of particle size and catalyst concentration on the polymerization. The results suggest that there is an optimal range of particle sizes where the rate of polymerization is greater than that in an equivalent bulk system while maintaining both a lower PDI (polydispersity index) and higher livingness. All three factors are desirable in ATRP but generally cannot be achieved simultaneously in bulk. Compartmentalization manifests itself differently in CCT dispersed phase systems, where the segregation of the CCT agents into different polymer particles leads to multimodal molecular weight distributions. Control over the particle size is notoriously difficult for nitroxide mediated polymerization, as it is challenging to decouple an increase in the particle size with an increase in target molecular weight using a two stage emulsion polymerization approach. This often leads to colloidally unstable latexes for low molecular weight, high solids conditions which are the result of superswelling. We offer several strategies to minimize this problem and create colloidally stable, high solids, n-butyl acrylate latexes by NMP with moderate to high molecular weight targets (&gt;70 kg/mol). Using this synergy between target molecular weight and particle size, high solids (&gt;40 wt.%), high molecular weight (&lt;200 kg/mol) microemulsions (~20 nm) of methyl methacrylate-co-styrene were prepared. Finally, the monomer type and nucleation mechanisms also play a role in determining the particle size distribution in NMP emulsion systems. Using n-butyl methacrylate in emulsion with surfactant concentrations above the critical micelle concentration yields latexes with bimodal particle size distributions. However a surfactant-free approach allows monomodal latexes to be created.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The impact of thermally and chemically enhanced biostimulation of indigenous bacteria in a fractured rock aquifer and the resulting changes in hydraulic properties of the discrete fracture network were investigated at the field scale in this study. A field trial was conducted using five 30 m deep vertical boreholes drilled into limestone and granite geological units in a 100 m2 section of a field in Kingston, Ontario. Prior to a 14 day biostimulation experiment, pulse interference tests and tracer experiments were conducted between the various boreholes to characterize the fracture permeability and connections.&#xD;
Biostimulation methods were applied using a semi-passive injection withdrawal flow field. During periods of injection withdrawal, groundwater was recirculated at 15 ±2 Lpm through an aboveground reservoir (460 L) and gravity drainage system. Recirculating groundwater temperature was raised to 20°C - 25°C and a 4.5 L sodium lactate based nutrient solution was injected once daily. During biostimulation the groundwater temperature, geochemistry, microbiology and fracture hydraulic properties between the recirculating borehole pair were monitored.&#xD;
Hydraulic testing results showed that borehole transmissivity was reduced by up to 92% (injection borehole) of pre-biostimulation values and transmissivity of multiple borehole connections had been reduced by up to five orders of magnitude. The results of the tracer experiments showed an increase in solute tortuosity and arrival time and a decrease in peak concentration following biostimulation. The changes in transport observed in the tracer experiments are corroborated by heat transport measurements in the recirculation borehole pair. Microbiological and geochemical evidence of biological growth were observed in recirculating groundwater, but absent in the groundwater samples analyzed. Visual observations confirmed the increase in biological growth, although no direct characterization of the microbial community was performed.&#xD;
This study indicates the semi-passive operation of thermally and chemically enhanced biostimulation can provide a successful method for bioclogging a discrete fracture network. Pulse interference tests and tracer experiments were necessary to effectively evaluate the growth and distribution of the biobarrier, which developed beyond the influence of the injection well. Additional research is required to develop a better understanding of the factors governing biobarrier formation and longevity prior to industrial application.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sulfenic acids figure prominently in biological and natural products chemistry as important intermediates. For example, cysteine derived sulfenic acids are key intermediates in cell signaling and play both catalytic and structural roles in enzymes. Due to the ubiquitous nature of protein sulfenic acids in cells, methods have been developed to detect and quantitate them. Although they can be detected, the mechanisms by which they form and react remain unclear. &#xD;
In addition, sulfenic acids are important enzymatic intermediates in Allium chemistry. Garlic, a member of the Allium genus, is known to have powerful antioxidant activity and this has recently been attributed to allyl sulfenic acid. Allicin, the thisolufinate that gives garlic its characteristic odor and flavor, decomposes to yield allyl sulfenic acid, which is believed to trap chain-carrying peroxyl radicals by readily donating a hydrogen atom, thus inhibiting autoxidations of hydrocarbons. &#xD;
Despite their important biological roles, little is known of the physicochemical properties of sulfenic acids. This is primarily due to their instability in air and high reactivity as both electrophiles and nucleophiles, giving them the tendency to self-condense and form thiosulfinates. Few persistent sulfenic acids, stabilized by alkyl steric protecting groups surrounding the sulfenic acid functional group, have been reported in the literature. Herein we report our synthetic efforts toward two such sulfenic acids, 9-triptycene sulfenic acid, and trans-9-decalinsulfenic acid, which were expected to be appropriate models for cysteine-derived and allyl sulfenic acids. Using 9-triptycene sulfenic acid, we were able to provide insight into the thermodynamics (O-H BDE) and kinetics (kinh) of the reactions of sulfenic acids with peroxyl radicals, which provide a clear connection between the antioxidant activity in garlic and sulfenic acids. We also preliminarily characterized the electrochemical behaviour of this compound, as well as determined its pKa.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In patients with normal hearts, increased vagal tone is associated with the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Vagal denervation of the atria renders AF less inducible. Circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA), with or without isolation (CPVI), is effective for treating paroxysmal AF, and has been shown to impact HRV indices, in turn reflecting vagal denervation.&#xD;
We examined the impact of CPVI on HRV indices over time, and evaluated the relationship between vagal modification and rate of recurrence of AF. High resolution ECG recordings were collected from 64 patients (49 male, 15 female, mean age 57.1±9.7) undergoing CPVI for paroxysmal (n=46) or persistent (n=18) AF. Recordings were made pre-procedure, and at intervals up to 12 months. Success was defined as no recurrence.&#xD;
After CPVI, 27 patients presented recurrence. Pre-procedure HRV variables did not differ from controls in patients with a subsequent successful procedure. However, patients with recurrence demonstrated significantly-reduced pre-procedure HRV compared both with controls, and with patients having successful procedures (39.6±23.4 &amp; 33.7±19.2 vs 21.8±11.8, P =0.01 &amp; P=0.04). Following the procedure, HRV was reduced vs pre-procedure in patients with successful procedures (33.7±19.2 vs 18.6±15.8, P=0.01), and did not differ from unsuccessful procedures over a 12 month FU. Both groups were reduced compared with a control value. There was no significant difference in HRV between patients who experienced recurring AF (n=9), and those who experienced AT or flutter (n=18).&#xD;
Our data suggests that patients experiencing recurrence after one procedure have reduced HRV that is not changed by CPVI; whereas patients with a successful single procedure experience a change in HRV variables that is sustained over a long period, but is no different post-procedure from patients experiencing recurrence. These data suggest that denervation associated with CPVI may benefit patients with normal vagal tone prior to the procedure, but that sustained denervation is not a critical factor in successful outcome after CPVI.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is an ideal target for detailed studies of galaxy structure and tests of stellar population models. This thesis presents deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope WIRCam near-infrared J- and Ks-band photometric maps of M31. These near-infrared data alleviate the age-metallicity-dust degeneracy that plagues stellar population analysis of optical-only maps. For the sake of calibrating stellar population models, a detailed reconstruction of the M31 near-infrared surface brightness and a study of sky subtraction uncertainties is needed. The analysis of our 2007 and 2009 WIRCam data has revealed unexpected spatial variations in the sky background shapes over the width of the WIRCam fields. In order to solve for the offset caused by such fluctuations, we have used couplings between images. Scalar sky offsets are optimized to produce a mosaic that is seamless within 0.02% of the sky background. These offsets are solved hierarchically, to reduce the dimensionality of optimizations, and an adaptation of the Nelder Mead downhill simplex ensures a globally optimal solution. Variations in sky shape are well-characterised in median sky images built by nodding to a random ring of sky fields every 1.2 minutes. Sky shape appears consistent across the 3˚ ring of sky fields, while levels do change by ~2%, suggesting that the dominant sky structures extend beyond the M31 survey region. Planar sky offset optimization was tested and promises to significantly improve continuity across the outer disk of M31. Our near-infrared data are part of an effort to assemble a multi-wavelength data set for M31 to study a broad suite of topics in stellar and galaxy evolution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Obesity and physical inactivity are major risk factors for numerous chronic diseases, conditions, and early mortality.  Healthy body weight and physical activity (PA) are also positively associated with health-related quality of life (HRQL).  However, obesity and physical inactivity levels in Canadian youth and adults are high.  This thesis comprises five studies exploring the burden of obesity and physical inactivity, focusing on HRQL.&#xD;
	The first study assessed PA research productivity in Canada from 1990-2005.  Canada produced approximately 5% of global PA research, 50% originating from Ontario, the biomedical and clinical areas accounting for 40% each; however, research in population health and health services was lacking.  &#xD;
	The second study used data from the Physical Activity Longitudinal Study (PALS), the 22-year follow-up of the 1981 Canada Fitness Survey, to assess PA and obesity tracking from youth to adulthood.  Over 80% of overweight/obese youth became overweight/obese adults, while the majority of overweight/obese adults had not been overweight/obese youth; almost all healthy weight adults had been healthy weight youth.  PA did not track over 22 years.&#xD;
	The third study used the PALS data to examine the long-term effect of youth BMI and PA on adult HRQL (SF-36), using dichotomized outcomes based on Canadian norms.  Contrary to expectations, overweight youth were more likely than healthy weight youth to score at/above the norm in adult HRQL, especially in the mental health domains.  Youth PA was not associated with adult HRQL.&#xD;
	The fourth study used the same data to explore the youth BMI-adult HRQL relationship using continuous outcomes, by sex.  Youth BMI was positively associated with mental HRQL in adult females only; no negative impacts emerged.&#xD;
	The fifth study used the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 3.1 data to investigate the combined association of PA and BMI to HRQL among Canadian adults, including self-rated health, participation/activity limitation, and total disability days, by age and sex.  Inactive individuals had increased odds of adverse HRQL, regardless of weight status; underweight, overweight, and obesity were of little consequence for active individuals.&#xD;
	Collectively, these results help to better understand the health burdens created by the current epidemics of obesity and physical inactivity in Canadians throughout their lifespans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the use of inter-racial relationships as emblems of political reconciliation in South African fiction from and about the transition from apartheid to democracy.  Positive representations of the relationships that apartheid prohibited would seem to constitute a rejection of apartheid itself, but through an analysis of novels by Lewis DeSoto, Elleke Boehmer, Zoë Wicomb, Marlene van Niekerk, Ivan Vladislavić, and J.M. Coetzee, I argue that the trope of the redemptive inter-racial relationship in fact reinscribes what Foucault would designate a biopolitical obsession with race as a foundational construct of the nation. &#xD;
Chapter 2 examines an attempt to write against the legacy of apartheid by repurposing the quintessentially South African genre of the plaasroman, but Lewis DeSoto’s A Blade of Grass (2003) fails to reverse the narrative effects created by the plaasroman structure, implicated as the plaasroman is and has been in a biopolitical framework.   &#xD;
	Chapter 3 examines Elleke Boehmer’s rewriting of South African history to insist on the genealogical “truth” of the racial mixing of the country and its inhabitants, but Bloodlines (2000) yet retains the obsession with racial constructs that it seeks to dispute.  Zoë Wicomb’s Playing in the Light (2006), meanwhile, invokes genealogical “truth” as a corrective to apartheid constructions of race, but ultimately disallows the possibility of genealogical and historical narratives as correctives rather than continuations of apartheid.&#xD;
	Chapter 4 discusses the structure of Marlene van Niekerk’s Triomf (published in Afrikaans in 1994; English translation 1999) as a collage of Afrikaner nationalist narratives, narratives of trauma, and narratives of inter-racial reconciliation that is able to put powerful local tropes on display while simultaneously preventing their reinscription.	&#xD;
Chapter 5 argues for a turn away from the bonds of affect symbolized by the inter-racial relationship as the basis of the nation in favour of an attention to justice.  Readings of Ivan Vladislavić’s The Restless Supermarket (2001) and J. M. Coetzee’s Disgrace (1999) substitute for the romance of the inter-racial relationship the exigencies of the South African philosophy of ubuntu and of the duty to justice posed by the figure of the monstrous neighbour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation consists of three essays that study mergers and consolidation in the Canadian cable television industry. The first essay provides a historical overview of regulatory and technical change in the industry, and presents the dataset that I constructed for this study. The basic pattern of interest in the data is regional consolidation, where dominant cable companies grow over time by acquiring the cablesystems of small cable operators. I perform a reduced-form empirical analysis that formally studies the determinants of mergers, and the effect that acquisitions have on cable bundles offered to consumers. The remaining essays develop and estimate structural econometric models to further study the determinants and welfare consequences of mergers in the industry. The second essay estimates an empirical analogue of the Farrell and Scotchmer (1988) coalition- formation game. I use the estimated model to measure the equilibrium impact that economies of scale and agglomeration has on firms’ acquisition incentives. I also study the impact entry and merger subsidies have on consolidation and long-run market structure. The final chapter estimates a variant of the Rochet and Stole (2002) model of multi-product monopoly with endogenous quality and prices. Using the estimated model I compute the impact mergers have on welfare. I find that both consumer and producer surplus rise with acquisitions. I also show that accounting for changes both in prices and products (i.e., cable bundle quality) is important for measuring the welfare impact of mergers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many opportunities exist in medical ultrasound research for experimenting with novel designs, both of transducers and of signal processing techniques. However any experiment must have a reliable platform on which to develop these techniques. In my thesis work, I have designed, built, and tested a high-speed reconfigurable ultrasound beamforming platform. &#xD;
The complete receive beamformer system described in this thesis consists of hardware, firmware, and software components. All of these components work together to provide a platform for beamforming that is expandable, high-speed, and robust. The complexity of the operations being performed is hidden from the user by a simple to use and accessible software interface.&#xD;
Existing beamformer hardware is usually designed for real-time 2D image formation often using serial processing. The platform I built uses parallel processing in order to process ultrasound images 100 times faster than conventional systems. Conventional hardware is locked to a single or small number of similar transducers, while my design can be on-the-fly reprogrammed to work with nearly any transducer type. The system is also expandable to handle any size of device, while conventional systems can only handle a fixed number of device channels. The software I have created interfaces with the hardware and firmware components to provide an easy way to make use of the system’s reconfigurability. It also delivers a platform that can be simply expanded to host post-processing or signal analysis software to further fulfill a researcher’s needs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis documents and discusses the analysis of material properties and pavement performance for Highway 17 and Highway 655 pavement trial sections located in northern Ontario. The object of this work was to compare laboratory-aged material with recovered asphalt cement and to develop an improved chemical aging method that provides asphalt cement that more closely reflects properties after 8-10 years of service. Physical testing of the asphalt cements was done using a bending beam rheometer (BBR) and double-edge-notched tension (DENT) test for laboratory aged material as well as recovered material from the road. The comparison of the regular BBR, extended BBR and elastic recovery test in BBR is also done for the laboratory-aged and recovered material.&#xD;
Two simple modifications to the regular pressure aging vessel (PAV) aging protocol were investigated as possible ways to improve the correlation between field and laboratory material properties. The length of the PAV aging was doubled to 40 hours and the weight for each pan was halved to 25 grams. It was observed that the presently used RTFO/PAV aging protocol does not produce sufficient aging. Hence, the conditions chosen were more severe and therefore are likely to bring the laboratory aging closer to the field aged condition. It was found that both the increase in time and the reduction in weight were able to accomplish the stated objective for most but not all asphalt cements.&#xD;
A separate investigation involved the infrared (IR) analysis of asphalt cements recovered from a large number of contracts in eastern and northeastern Ontario. This study indicated that those asphalts with a largely paraffinic structure (low aromatics index) showed excessive and premature cracking even at lower levels of oxidation (carbonyl index). In contrast, those pavements that were largely spared of thermal distress were constructed with asphalt cements that contained more aromatics (high IR aromatics indices). Aromatics allow the largely aromatic asphaltenes that are formed upon oxidation to remain well peptized rather than flocculated. Peptized asphaltenes allow for good stress relaxation during winter and spring thaw and thus such materials show a reduced tendency for cracking.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this study was to compare different modifiers in two asphalt cements, namely Cold Lake 80/100 obtained from the Edmonton, Alberta refinery of Imperial Oil Limited and a PG 58-28 obtained from a now closed refinery in the Montreal, Quebec area. The modifiers investigated were polyphosphoric acid (PPA), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), and reactive ethylene terpolymer (Elvaloy® RET). The comparisons were done based on both unaged and laboratory-aged materials.   &#xD;
The investigation covers high temperature grading using a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), low temperature grading using a bending beam rheometer (BBR), ductile strain tolerance as measured in the double-edge-notched tension (DENT) test and percentage recovered strain using multiple shear creep recovery (MSCR) test. &#xD;
The Superpave® performance grade span was increased for all modifiers with substantial increases in the high temperature rutting parameter G*/sin while the BBR parameters, T(S = 300 MPa) and T(m = 0.3), remained largely unchanged. In the PG 58-28 base asphalt, Elvaloy® modifiers were able to reduce the intermediate Superpave® grade temperature by significant amounts. &#xD;
All polymer modifiers were good at improving the ductile strain tolerance as measured in the DENT test. In contrast, PPA alone reduces the strain tolerance due to the formation of extra asphaltenes and the likely gelation of the asphaltene-rich phase.  &#xD;
Nearly all the modified samples passed the MSCR test except those with poor compatibility (i.e. SBS blended with Cold Lake without sulfur, Elvaloy® systems without acid catalyst, and pure PPA modified systems) or no modifier, which did not reach the required elastic recovery at high levels of non-recoverable compliance. &#xD;
In the BBR test done at low temperatures, all modified systems showed similar elastic recovery and viscous (non-recoverable) compliance. However, in the ductile-to-brittle range the Elvaloy® RET-modified binders showed a definite advantage of a few degrees over the unmodified base asphalts.&#xD;
Finally, chemical aging tendencies, as measured by weight gain and carbonyl formation, turned out to be very similar for all the investigated compositions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Titanium dioxide films were deposited on aluminum by flame assisted chemical vapour deposition.  The photocatalytic performance of these films when the air flow rate to the flame and thickness of silicon oxides under-layer were varied, was compared against a film of electrophoretically deposited Degussa P25, a titanium dioxide powder.  At a high air flow rate, only powder was deposited on the substrate and the films had no measurable photocatalytic activity.  When the air flow rate was lower, and the flame cooler, titanium dioxide was successfully deposited.  Samples with a silicon oxides under-layer had more titanium dioxide deposited than with no undercoating, but titanium dioxide content did not increase as the layer of silicon oxides thickness increased.  Films deposited at a low air flow rate, and with a silicon oxides under-layer, were shown to act as self-cleaning surfaces through the mineralization of a stearic acid film, successfully removed organic compounds from water through the oxidation of methylene blue as a model compound, and effectively inactivated Vibrio fischeri in water.  However, in all cases the performance was found to be moderate when compared to Degussa P25 films.  The successful use of films produced under these conditions in various applications suggests that they may also be effective in an air sterilization unit.   An air sterilization reactor system was designed with considerations to reactor geometry, relative humidity and air flow rate.  Bioaerosol generation and capture experiments were performed while varying pressure supplied to a Collison Nebulizer, the nebulizer optical density of Bacillus subtilis, and the sample period using a modified AGI-4 impinger.  A model was developed to correlate these parameters to expected bacterial capture.  Different methods of assessing cell viability in the capture solution were examined, and the use of the Live/Dead assay was recommended over traditional plate counts because of lower associated error.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The recent decade has witnessed great advances in microarray and genotyping technologies which allow genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to be captured on a single chip. As a consequence, genome-wide association studies require the development of algorithms capable of manipulating ultra-large-scale SNP datasets. Towards this goal, this thesis proposes two SNP selection methods; the first using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and the second based on a modified version of Fast Orthogonal Search. &#xD;
The first proposed technique, based on ICA, is a filtering technique; it reduces the number of SNPs in a dataset, without the need for any class labels. The second proposed technique, orthogonal search based SNP selection, is a multivariate regression approach; it selects the most informative features in SNP data to accurately model the entire dataset. &#xD;
The proposed methods are evaluated by applying them to publicly available gene SNP datasets, and comparing the accuracies of each method in reconstructing the datasets. In addition, the selection results are compared with those of another SNP selection method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which was also applied to the same datasets. &#xD;
The results demonstrate the ability of orthogonal search to capture a higher amount of information than ICA SNP selection approach, all while using a smaller number of SNPs. Furthermore, SNP reconstruction accuracies using the proposed ICA methodology demonstrated the ability to summarize a greater or equivalent amount of information in comparison with the amount of information captured by the PCA-based technique reported in the literature. &#xD;
The execution time of the second developed methodology, mFOS, has paved the way for its application to large-scale genome wide datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ecological land classification (ELC) is used to classify forest types in Ontario based on ecological gradients of soil moisture and nutrient fertility determined in the field.  If ELC could be automated using terrain surfaces generated from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing, it would enhance our ability to carry out forest ecosite classification and inventory over large areas.  The focus of this thesis was to determine if LiDAR-derived terrain surfaces could be used to accurately quantify soil moisture in the boreal forest at a study site near Timmins, Ontario for use in ELC systems.  Analysis was performed in three parts: (1) ecological land classification was applied to classify the forest plots based on soil texture, moisture regime and dominant vegetation; (2) terrain indices were generated at four different spatial resolutions and evaluated using regression techniques to determine which resolution best estimated soil moisture; and (3) ordination techniques were applied to separate the forest types based on biophysical field measurements of soil moisture and nutrient availability.  The results of this research revealed that no single biophysical measurement alone could completely separate forest types; furthermore, the best LiDAR-derived terrain variables explained only 36.5% of the variation in the soil moisture in this study area.  These conclusions suggest that species abundance data (i.e., indicator species) should be examined in tandem with biophysical field measurements and LiDAR data to improve classification accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Quality of patient care includes both technical and non-technical elements of care, referred to as personal care. Previous work has focused on assessing the quality of technical care in prostate cancer radiotherapy, but little work has been done to assess the quality of personal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose: The purpose of this project was to create a self-administered questionnaire to measure the quality of personal care for patients undergoing radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Dimensions and candidate indicators of the quality of personal care were identified through a comprehensive literature search. The indicators were assigned to dimensions and then arranged into steps in the radiotherapy care continuum. A questionnaire was constructed using the indicators to assess patients’ views about the quality of their care as well as the importance of each indicator. Cognitive interviews were conducted with four health care professionals and eight patients to determine the clarity, comprehensiveness and appropriateness of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then pilot tested on patients undergoing radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: A total of 176 indicators of the quality of personal care were initially identified representing 10 dimensions of care. Cognitive interviews identified problems with the questionnaire primarily related to the clarity and redundancy of the indicators and the appropriateness of the response categories. To reduce burden, the questionnaire was divided into three modules, corresponding to appropriate steps in the continuum of care. Each module was pilot tested on at least 10 patients with an overall response rate of 84%. Most patients responded to all indicators on the questionnaire without difficulty and without distress; however patterns of missing responses indicate a few particular indicators need revision. The results suggest that the design of the questionnaire is appropriate since patients seem to be using the range of response options that are offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: The results suggest that this questionnaire is feasible to administer in a clinic setting and that it does not place a large burden on patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Members of the Sco protein family have been proposed to function in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the respiratory chain of all aerobic life forms. The Sco protein in Bacillus subtilis, BsSco, is characterized for its folding/unfolding behavior in the presence or absence of Cu(II) in this study. The folding/unfolding of apo-BsSco is investigated by CD and fluorescence spectroscopies. BsSco follows an apparent two-state mechanism in both folding and unfolding processes. The two apo forms of BsSco, reduced and oxidized, exhibit similar equilibrium stabilities suggesting that the formation of an intramolecular disulfide in oxidized apo-BsSco does not add to BsSco’s overall stability. In contrast, Cu(II) binding to reduced apo-BsSco results in extreme stabilization and resistance to unfolding in urea. However, when Cu(II) is present with unfolded, reduced apo-BsSco, the protein is rapidly oxidized. Another widely used denaturant, GdnHCl, is able to unfold Cu(II)-BsSco by allowing the loss of Cu(II) from the  metal/protein complex. When the presence of Cu(II)-BsSco complex and the protein’s folded state are monitored simultaneously, the unfolding of Cu(II)-bound BsSco occurs coincidently with Cu(II) dissociation. We suggest that the loss of Cu(II) binding and the loss of BsSco’s native conformation are coincident, which leads to the conclusion that Cu(II)-BsSco does not unfold until it forfeits Cu(II). The kinetics of folding/unfolding of reduced, oxidized and Cu(II) bound BsSco are explored by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The rate constants at which the two apo forms of BsSco fold and unfold are measured and plotted versus denaturant concentration. Reduced and oxidized forms of apo-BsSco are similar in folding and unfolding kinetics. Cu(II)-involved refolding kinetics of BsSco show that Cu(II) is able to accelerate the rate of refolding. However, the involvement of Cu(II) in the refolding process results in two competing processes: oxidation and Cu(II) binding. Which process predominates depends on the refolding rate which further depends on the denaturant concentration. This study has provided direct evidence for metal-involved stabilization of BsSco which is beneficial to efficiently fulfill its copper trafficking duty in a cellular environment.</dcterms:abstract>

This study focussed on two predicted outcomes of climate change in the western Canadian High Arctic: the occurrence of a permafrost disturbance termed active layer detachments (ALDs), and increased air temperature and precipitation.  &#xD;
To study the effects of ALD formation twenty 1 m2 plots were established within two ALDs.  One ALD (ALD05) was formed in July 2007 and represented the initial impact of slope failure caused by an exceptionally warm year.  The other (ALD04) was formed at least sixty years ago and represented the long-term impact of slope failure.  Physical soil measurements and vegetation surveys were completed in both disturbances.  &#xD;
ALD formation creates depressions on the landscape that increase snow accumulation.  Snow accumulation was greater in the more recent ALD than in the older one and this resulted in greater changes to the physical environment.  Vegetation was not significantly impacted by disturbance, although phenology was delayed due to snowcover retention.&#xD;
To study the effects of increased air temperature and precipitation an International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) site was established at CBAWO in July 2008.  Snow fences and open-top chambers (OTC) were erected to increase snow accumulation and air temperature.  Physical soil measurements and vegetation surveys were completed through the summer of 2009.  Soil temperature and active layer depth were affected by snow and phenology was delayed in plots with snow enhancement.  Experimental warming also had some effects on the parameters measured but only in conjunction with snow enhancement.  This study found that in the first year of experimentation snow enhancement has a greater effect than increased air temperature.&#xD;
	These studies represent the beginning of two long-term projects at CBAWO and the results from this study represent baseline data for future research.  Continued monitoring will show the evolution of vegetation in the ALDs and the potential long-term effects of temperature and snow manipulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study explores how the poetry of Else Lasker-Schüler (1869-1945) creates a personal space—a Heimat—through the poetic process. Through close readings of a selection of the poet’s works, I demonstrate the paradoxical relationship between physical structures and emotional or psychic freedom. I show how this association between form and fluidity reflects the poetic genre itself, while also drawing parallels to Lasker-Schüler’s biography and her relationships with the Berliner Bohème.&#xD;
 Lasker-Schüler’s work has been viewed through many different lenses: Expressionism, Judaism, and feminism. Such interpretations can be problematic, as they impose limitations on the poet’s work and are thereby contradictory to the fluid qualities conveyed in her poems. Through close analysis of the formal and aesthetic aspects of Lasker-Schüler’s poetry, I illuminate this often neglected, but most important aspect of the fluctuating, creative space.&#xD;
 Lasker-Schüler’s life circumstances forced her to live an unsettled life, but poetry seems to have functioned as a means of accessing the internal Heimat or Seelenlandschaft. The lyrical “I” of Lasker-Schüler’s poetry wanders throughout the poet’s collective works, her voice undergoing metamorphoses, leaving the reader to question this elusive poetic identity. The bohemians, who offered Lasker-Schüler an inspiring creative community, mirror this internal poetic world externally, as they embraced art and performance to create their chameleon-like identities. In turn, the bohemian mentality is reflected in the poet’s work; this constant movement and state of flux creates a poetic space, the very transience of which is what allows it to become a personal utopia, a Heimat, for the homeless soul.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Late Devonian was a significant period in Phanerozoic reef evolution.  Reef complexes reached their acme in the Middle Devonian and then declined in numbers and complexity thereafter.  This change was accompanied by a shift in reef composition characterized by an increase in calcified microbes in the reef milieu.  Late Devonian Nisku Formation reefs in the Cynthia Basin at Meekwap, Alberta are composed of calcimicrobes (Renalcis, Epiphyton, Girvanella, Rothpletzella, and Wetheredella), stromatoporoids, and corals.  Accessory organisms include brachiopods, benthic foraminifera, molluscs, sponges, bryozoans, and crinoids.  Calcimicrobes generate dorsal or ventral crusts on stromatoporoids, and form oncolites in open marine facies.  Dorsal crusts are either Girvanella and Rothpletzella, or non-calcimicrobial, spongiostromate or cemented calcisilt encrustations.  Ventral crusts are cryptic and composed of Renalcis and Epiphyton.  Oncolites comprise layers of Girvanella and Rothpletzella and occur in lagoon and upper-foreslope facies.  Girvanella and Rothpletzella are thought to have been photosynthetic because of their preference for interpreted well-lit settings (oncolites and dorsal surfaces) and possible competition for light as expressed by alternating layers of Girvanella and Rothpletzella as well as domal, accretionary growths of either Girvanella or Rothpletzella in oncolites.  Renalcis and Epiphyton are viewed as non-photosynthetic or light sensitive because they are rare on upper surfaces and are instead found in cryptic environments.  The abundance of calcimicrobes in Meekwap limestones is interpreted to have reflected elevated nutrient levels.  Nutrients were likely terrestrially sourced and brought onto the shelf via fluvial runoff and submarine groundwater discharge.  Geometry of the Cynthia Basin, as well as the presence of local nutrient sources at Meekwap is thought to have enhanced more regional nutrification via ocean upwelling.  The change in the composition of reefs throughout the Late Devonian is attributed to paleoenvironmental changes, such as a colder climate and falling ocean temperatures, as well as increasing nutrient levels, prior to the Late Devonian mass extinction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Significant advances have been made in the understanding of living/controlled radical polymerization processes since their discovery in the early 1990’s.  These processes enable an unprecedented degree of control over polymer architecture that was previously not possible using conventional radical polymerization processes, and this has made possible the synthesis of many new and interesting materials.  However, there has been only limited success in commercializing these new methods.&#xD;
Recently there has been increased focus on the development of more industrially viable processes.  Dispersed aqueous phase reactions have received much attention because these water-based processes have several technical, economic, and environmental benefits over the more common solution and bulk reactions that were originally developed.  Likewise, there has been some investigation of using continuous reactors that have potential technical and economic benefits over the more commonly employed batch reactors.&#xD;
This thesis presents an in-depth study that combines the three aforementioned technologies: living/controlled radical polymerization, dispersed phase aqueous reactions, and continuous reactors.  Specifically, the system of interest is a nitroxide-mediated miniemulsion polymerization reaction in a continuous tubular reactor to produce polymer latex.  &#xD;
Design of the continuous tubular reactor is discussed in some detail with a focus on specific technical challenges that were faced in building a functional apparatus for this system.  Scoping experiments are described which identified a significant effect of temperature ramping rate that is critical to understand when moving to larger scale reactors for this system.  The unexpected phenomenon of room temperature polymerization initiated by ascorbic acid is also described.  There is demonstration for the first time that bulk and miniemulsion polymers can be produced in a tubular reactor under controlled nitroxide-mediated polymerization conditions, and copolymers can be produced.  A detailed residence time distribution study for the tubular reactor is also shown, and several interesting phenomena are discussed that have implications on the practical operating conditions of the tubular reactor.  This particular study makes it clear that one should experimentally verify the residence time distribution within a continuous system with the reactants of interest, and that model systems may not give an accurate picture of the real system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Dark Matter Experiment with Liquid Argon Using Pulse Shape Discrim- &#xD;
ination (DEAP) is a dark matter experiment based in the SNOLAB facility in &#xD;
Sudbury, Ontario. Its aim is to detect WIMPs, Weakly Interacting Massive Par- &#xD;
ticles, that may make up the missing component of the matter in our universe by &#xD;
the scintillation of liquid argon from nuclear recoils. A 7 kg prototype, DEAP-1, &#xD;
is currently in operation with work underway to scale up to a 1 tonne detector, &#xD;
DEAP-3600, by 2012.  For DEAP-3600 to be a competitive dark matter search, &#xD;
a limit of 0.2 fiducial surface alpha events is required in the energy region of interest for three years of run time,&#xD;
 or 150 total surface events. Of particular concern to the DEAP experiment is 222Rn and its daughter prod- &#xD;
ucts, as the alpha decays of these isotopes may create events in the detector that &#xD;
mimic a WIMP signature. The ﬁrst half of this thesis concerns the testing and suc- &#xD;
cessful use of an activated carbon trap to eliminate 222Rn from the argon gas source &#xD;
in DEAP-1. The Carbo-Act F2/F3 grain activated carbon brand was tested as a &#xD;
potential ultra-low activity candidate for a DEAP-3600 ﬁltration system and was &#xD;
found to have an upper limit for its 222Rn emanation rate of 284 atoms/day/kg. &#xD;
A temperature swing system is proposed. If operated at 110 K, an upper limit of &#xD;
ﬁve atoms of 222Rn can be expected to enter the detector from the trap. &#xD;
An indirect relationship between the number of low energy nuclear recoil events &#xD;
in the DEAP WIMP region of interest and the number of radon alpha decays was &#xD;
found. The ratio between the low energy events in the WIMP region of interest and &#xD;
the high energy alphas was found to be 0.18 ± 0.03 in the detector. &#xD;
From this, the upper limit of the contribution from the proposed radon trap to the WIMP&#xD;
background in DEAP-3600 will be be ten events for three years of run time, which &#xD;
is within acceptable limits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Consumer concerns regarding food safety and quality, a crippling farm crisis across North America, and growing criticisms of the environmental consequences of intensive agricultural practices are leading to increased scrutiny of the dominant, industrialized food system.  Faced with uncertainty, many communities are pioneering new, decentralized models of food production, with a view to designing systems that are more economically, ecologically and socially sustainable. At their essence, these local food systems appear to embody a new form of ‘capitalism’, one that values, depends upon, and seeks to strengthen or preserve all stocks of community capital: natural, human, social, and economic. &#xD;
Employing a case study approach, this research explores ways in which a local food system’s development depends upon the interplay of a community’s capital stocks, as well as ways in which a local food system may serve as a site for the creation or strengthening of these capital stocks, with a particular focus on social capital. The two communities studied are: Kingston, Ontario and Hardwick, Vermont.  Both communities have been actively pursuing local-food system development through various initiatives. Face-to-face interviews, participant observations, and a review of written information served as the main sources of data for this study. A conceptual framework was also developed and served to guide the research, including the analysis of findings. &#xD;
	Case study findings revealed the interdependent nature of community capital stocks, highlighting the importance of maintaining or enhancing all capital stocks over time.  Social capital proved to be particularly integral to development efforts, with social networks sourcing economic and human capital for local-food system initiatives. Notably, many of the local-food initiatives carried out served to strengthen social and human capital, highlighting the potential for a restorative system. Overall, findings suggest that a more all-encompassing valuation of capital stocks is necessary to capture the ways in which a local-food system can contribute to community betterment and sustainability.  It is anticipated that the case studies of Kingston and Hardwick will provide practitioners and scholars with insight regarding how community capital stocks are deployed and created through local-food initiatives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chapter 2 of the thesis describes a highly efficient in situ method for the reduction of amides to aldehydes and aryl O-carbamates to phenols and other transformations involving hydrozirconations. The method, as a three-component-type reaction, involves in situ generation of the Schwartz reagent (Cp2Zr(H)Cl) from Cp2ZrCl2 and the reductant, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3, and immediate reaction with a substrate. Substrates include aliphatic and aromatic tertiary amides which are reduced to aldehydes, aryl O-carbamates which are reduced to phenols, and alkynes which undergo other transformations via hydrozirconation. Compared to prior methods, this method has advantage in that reagents are inexpensive and stable, reaction times are short, and reaction temperatures are generally conveniently at room temperature. The use of the in situ method described herein instead of the requirement for the synthesis of the commercially available Schwartz reagent is estimated to provide more than 50% reduction in cost.&#xD;
Chapter 3 of the thesis describes the discovery and development of efficient and regioselective Ru-catalyzed amide-directed C-H, C-N, C-O activation/C-C bond forming reactions, ester-directed C-O activation/C-C bond forming reaction, and amide-directed C-O activation/hydrodemethoxylation reactions under a simple RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3/toluene catalytic system. Of these, the amide-directed C-H activation/cross coupling reaction proceeds well but uniquely on furan 3-amide substrates while the ester-directed C-O activation is effective on the 2-MeO-1-naphthoic acid methyl ester. On the other hand, the amide-directed C-N and C-O activation/coupling reactions are broadly applicable on benzamides and naphthamides. All of these achievements of directed C-H, C-N, C-O activation/coupling reactions complement and may supercede the DoM (directed ortho metalation)-cross coupling strategy, and establish the catalytic base-free DoM-cross coupling process at non-cryogenic temperature as a convenient, economical and green alternative. The new catalytic amide-directed ortho-hydrodemethoxylation reaction has potential value in links to aromatic electrophilic substitution and DoM chemistries. Furthermore, a new borylation reaction via Ru-catalyzed amide-directed C-H activation/C-B bond forming process is also reported herein.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Primates, including humans, explore their visual environment with sequences of gaze fixations interrupted by saccadic eye movements that re-orient the fovea to objects of interest. This visual behavior is thought to involve two separate processes. First, the current foveal image is analyzed and the next object of interest is selected as a saccade target. Second, previously examined objects are retained to prevent their re-examination. Visual behavior has been studied successfully using the visual search paradigm, in which subjects locate a unique target stimulus from amongst multiple distracting stimuli. Models of visual search posit that the process of saccade target selection is guided by a visual salience map. This map receives both stimulus-driven and goal-directed inputs to form representations of visual objects, and a competition between those representations is played out to determine the next saccade target. Neurophysiological studies using nonhuman primates have suggested that the salience map is distributed across a network of brain areas that includes the midbrain superior colliculus (SC). These studies, however, have not ruled out the possibility that selective activity for a saccade target may instead be related to the preparation of the saccade. Moreover, not much is known about the selection of a saccade target beyond the first in a sequence of gaze fixations. Finally, the mechanisms underlying the process of saccade target retention are not well understood. In this thesis, I will investigate the role of the primate SC in visual behavior by recording the activity of single neurons while monkeys perform visual search tasks. The major findings will describe 1) how SC sensory-motor neurons instantiate the visual salience map; 2) how this salience map is dynamically updated so that saccade targets are retained; and 3) how multiple representations on this salience map are processed in parallel for saccade target selection. Given SC’s role in the control of visual behavior and its position within the network involved in cognitive processes, these findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural basis of human cognition and of its dysfunctions in disease states.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A mathematical model for polymer gel dosimeters was extended to simulate the effects of radiation depth doses of various radiation beams on the mass of polymer formed.  The influences of monomer diffusion and temperature variation were investigated and predicted by the model.  Simulation results indicate that both diffusion and temperature effects are most noticeable at the depth of maximum dose.  Diffusion effects are larger for steep depth-dose curves with large dose gradients, while temperature effects are larger for extensive depth-dose curves that deliver high doses of radiation to a greater depth.  Based on simulation results, involving a maximum dose of 5 Gy, the amount of additional polymer formed due to diffusion is small, ranging from 0.1 % for 15 MV x-ray photons to 2.6 % for Co60 γ-radiation.  This small amount of additional polymer should not cause significant problems for the accuracy of depth-dose calibration curves, particularly if the depth of maximum dose is avoided.  Inaccuracies caused by temperature effects are expected to be smaller than those caused by diffusion.&#xD;
Experimental studies were undertaken to improve the radiation dose response using x-ray Computed Tomography (CT).  A new polymer gel dosimeter recipe with enhanced dose response was achieved by using a large quantity of N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) (15 wt%) to help dissolve the N,N’-methylene bisacrylamide (Bis) crosslinker.  The solubility of Bis was substantially increased, allowing for large quantities of dissolved NIPAM and Bis in the system.  The new dosimeter exhibits an enhanced dose sensitivity and dose resolution for x-ray CT imaging, which holds promise for clinical applications.  The dose resolution of approximately 0.1 Gy, for up to absorbed doses of 50 Gy, for the new recipe is superior to that for previous dosimeter formulations developed for x-ray CT.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite the documented sensitivity of polar environments, long-term monitoring data are especially sparse in these regions. Diatom-based paleolimnology has contributed significantly to understanding the response of Arctic lakes to climate change, but most studies have been conducted in regions with relatively high lakewater buffering capacity. As such, Pim Island (Nunavut, Canada) is a region of limnological interest because, due to the local geology, its surface waters are of relatively lower pH and previous research suggests that such softwater lakes may be especially responsive to climate fluctuations and therefore provide the best paleoclimate records. This thesis has two separate but related chapters, as well as an exploratory study included in appendix. First, a novel approach using visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) was used to infer lakewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC), from a 160-lake calibration set from the Canadian Arctic. Historically sound and similar trends were reconstructed when compared against a Canadian diatom-based DOC and Swedish VNIRS-based total organic carbon (TOC) model on Arctic Holocene sediment records. Second, a diatom and spectroscopically-based multi-proxy approach was utilized on Holocene sedimentary records from two lakes on Pim Island to assess long-term environmental change from this region. Benthic and epiphytic diatom taxa dominated the pre-19th century assemblages, although marked shifts in dominant species were recorded during the mid-Holocene. The mid-Holocene diatom assemblages underwent an abrupt ecological shift from alkaliphilous Fragilaria sensu lato to slightly acidophilous Achnanthes and Navicula. The post-19th century was characterized by an increase in the planktonic species (Cyclotella radiosa), indicating marked lakeice reductions. Third, the limnological properties and modern diatom assemblages of ponds and lakes surveyed from 1979 to 2009 on Pim Island were examined as part of an exploratory study. The ponds and lakes displayed typical characteristics observed in high Arctic lacustrine environments (i.e. oligotrophic, very dilute) but with overall relatively low alkalinity. Poorly-buffered sites had diatom assemblages that were distinct from well-buffered lakes elsewhere in the High Arctic. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the interactions between local environments and limnological changes, and also provide insight on the biological responses of lakes to Holocene environmental change and allow us to compare responses to those in more alkaline sites.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ironman triathlon began in 1978, according to popular accounts the result of an argument among a group of athletes about who was the fittest. Thirty years later, participation in the Ironman has grown exponentially despite the physical and mental demands of the sport. In my dissertation I examine the ways different types of pain and pleasure function in the production of bodies and selves within this sporting practice and how these understandings of pain and pleasure intersect with neoliberal discourses. My study adds to an important body of literature in the sociology of sport that has explored pain and injury. This literature has revealed the normalization of pain and injury in sport, at the expense of athletes’ short and long-term health. Exploring pain and pleasure in a recreational sport and fitness practice and in light of neoliberal governmentality offers new insights.&#xD;
I conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 recreational Ironman triathletes and incorporated my own Ironman experiences into the project. Mediated representations of the sport helped to contextualize the interview and autobiographical materials. I subjected the information that I gathered to a critical discourse analysis informed by the theoretical perspectives of Michel Foucault. &#xD;
My findings reveal that there are multiple ways that people construct their experiences of pain and pleasure in the Ironman context. Athletes strive to negotiate “positive” and “negative” kinds of pain in an effort to produce skilled, disciplined bodies, capable of finishing the event and claiming an “Ironman identity.” Pleasure in this sport seems mostly connected to ideas of challenge, achievement, rewards, and recognition. The constructions of pain and pleasure largely reify dominant sport and exercise discourses which promote discipline, toughness, and achievement. Considering the Ironman in light of neoliberalism, it was evident that values of health, self-esteem, the use of pain, and the primary use of non-work/leisure time for training and racing were intricately connected to ideas about individual responsibility. I argue that as the “Ironman identity” becomes more normalized, our understandings of bodies and health shift in problematic way. This reinforces neoliberal ideologies of self-responsibility and makes diminished State responsibility for citizens more insidious than it is already.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the behavior of geomaterials under explosive loading is essential for several applications in the mining and oil industry. To date, the design of these applications is based almost solely on empirical equations and tabulated data. Optimal designs require accurate and complete knowledge of rock behavior under various loading conditions.&#xD;
The vast majority of the properties available in the literature have been gathered by deforming the specimen slowly. These properties have been used to establish constitutive models which describe the behavior of rocks under static and quasi-static loading conditions. However, the dynamic properties and material constitutive models describing the behavior of geomaterials under high strain-rate loading conditions are essential for a better understanding and enhanced designs of dynamic applications.&#xD;
Some attempts have been made to measure dynamic properties of rocks. Also, some trials have been made to devise material models which describe the behavior of rocks and the evolution of damage in the rock under dynamic loading. Published models were successful in predicting tensile damage and spalling in rocks. However, there are no established models capable of predicting compressional damage in rocks due to dynamic loading.&#xD;
A recently-developed model, the RHT model, was formulated to describe the behavior of concrete over the static and dynamic ranges. The model was also formulated to predict compressional damage based on the strain rate at which the material is subjected to. The RHT model has been used successfully in several applications.&#xD;
The purpose of this research was to characterize one rock type as an example of a hard brittle rock. The physical properties of the rock as well as the static and dynamic mechanical properties were investigated. These properties were used to calibrate the RHT model and investigate its potentials to predict compressional damage in brittle materials.&#xD;
The calibrated model showed good precision reproducing the amplitude of the strain signals generated by explosive loading. It was also capable of predicting compressional damage with acceptable accuracy. Unfortunately, due to implementation restrictions, tensile and spall damage could not be captured by the model. The duration and shape of the strain pulse were also poorly modeled.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sir John A. Macdonald has been a political figure frequently referenced in Canadian history. Yet no study has explored the evolution of his public memory. This study provides a focused examination of the attempts by Canada’s federal political parties to shape Macdonald’s public memory. The period of study began immediately following the death of Sir John A. Macdonald on June 6, 1891 and continued until the Centennial Celebrations of Confederation in 1967. The study first aims to identify and analyze events and activities organized or supported by Canada’s federal political class which allowed them opportunities to shape Macdonald’s public memory. The study then explores through the lens of official memory their motivation to engage in his commemoration and to shape his memory in specific ways. The objective of this study is to answer two specific research questions. The first asked if Canada’ federal political leaders were interested and successful in shaping Macdonald’s public memory during the period of study to allow the emergence of a seemingly national hegemonic figure acceptable to both political parties. The second asked if the federal political parties’ attempts to depict Macdonald as a unifying national symbol were picked up in the media in Ontario and Quebec and in both official languages, thereby reinforcing his hegemonic status for the federal political class. The study argues that Macdonald became on a single occasion a seemingly national hegemonic figure acceptable to both political parties and to the media in both official language communities in Ontario and Quebec.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The inextricable link between muscularity and masculinity has been increasingly accentuated over the past fourty years, resulting in behaviours that can become unhealthy from a variety of perspectives. Gender is often enacted through manipulating and altering morphologies which can ultimately affect the way one perceives her or his own body. This thesis introduces the term megamusculinity, embodying the links between corporality, muscularity and masculinity. Primarily affecting men, megamusculinity is an exemplar of gender performance where one follows strict dietary and exercise regimens in the pursuit of (gross)muscularity. Much of the academic discussion of gender and body perception focuses primarily upon body size. Shifting the emphasis from body size to regimes of the self, this analysis posits megamusculinity and eating disorders as parallel pursuits, not antithetical realms of extreme morphologies. &#xD;
          Foucauldian logic will be blended with Anthony Giddens’ structuration theory to examine megamusculinity as gender performativity with a multitude of social underpinnings. In a world where rules and resources (following Giddens’ articulation of structures) shape everything individuals do, what is occurring in the case of megamusculinity is individuals are actively creating a hypertrophied reality by negotiating their way through the disciplinary constraints of various social structures. This thesis builds upon the psychological construction of muscle dysmorphia as a clinical disorder and introduces megamusculinity, situated not as a “personal trouble of milieu” but a “public issue of social structure” (Mills 1959: 8). In doing so, this thesis will demonstrate that the body perception disturbances of certain men are influenced by experiences with particular social factors/institutions, and positions megamusculinity parallel to eating disorders by focusing upon the regimes of the self involved in altering one’s morphology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Miocene Nullarbor Limestone is the most recent formation in the Cenozoic Eucla Group and was deposited in the Eucla Basin, southern Australia, at ~38°S paleolatitude during the early to middle Miocene.  The rocks form the modern surface of the vast, karsted Nullarbor Plain.  Older Eucla Group marine carbonates (Eocene-earliest Miocene) are cool-water in nature and dominated by bryozoans and echinoderms.  The Nullarbor Limestone is subtropical in composition and rich in coralline algae (rhodoliths and articulated types), large and small benthic foraminifera and molluscs.  Diverse zooxanthellate corals are also present but not numerous.  Deposition is interpreted to have taken place in three main paleoenvironments: rhodolith gravels, seagrass banks, and open seafloors.  &#xD;
	The Southern Ocean extended inboard ~450 km from the shelf edge during Nullarbor Limestone deposition.  Interpreted paleodepths ranged from the top to the base of the photic zone, implying a small slope over a wide shelf.  The Miocene Eucla platform is therefore interpreted to have been epeiric in nature. Paleoenvironment distribution is explained using epeiric platform sedimentation patterns and comparisons with modern environments.  Open seafloor environments, the deepest settings, are thought to have been below fair-weather wave base.  Rhodolith gravels accumulated at intermediate depths, where waves frequently swept the seafloor.  Seagrass banks developed in the shallowest waters farthest inboard, where wave energy had been largely dissipated. &#xD;
	Diverse corals, large benthic foraminifera and micrite envelopes inboard and in the western part of the basin support the notion of paleotemperatures generally above 20°C, the upper limit of subtropical carbonate accumulation.  Although deposition occurred during the Miocene Climatic Optimum, a simple overall temperature increase cannot completely account for the subtropical nature of these sediments at mid-latitudes.  Tropical components decrease from west to east, implying a temperature gradient, probably due to the warm proto-Leeuwin Current.  Thus, these subtropical carbonates were deposited at mid-latitudes and their presence did not simply reflect a change in global climate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Global polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population numbers are expected to decline steadily over the next 50 years. A noninvasive genetic survey of polar bear numbers may be a useful addition to traditional aerial capture mark recapture (CMR) surveys undertaken throughout the Canadian polar bear population. We attempted a pilot study of noninvasive genetic survey techniques in M’Clintock Channel between May-June 2006-2009. Throughout the survey, we compared our values to the most recent (CMR) survey, conducted by Taylor et al. (2006) between March-June 1998-2000 where 133 cubs, sub-adults and adults were tagged. A total population size of 300 bears was estimated from this aerial CMR survey (Taylor et al. 2006). We found noninvasive sampling stations are sufficient for the capture of a large amount of data on individual bears in an area. Across 4 years, we collected a total of 300 hair samples, and found between 59 and 82 individual bears entered our sampling stations, depending on the stringency of our identification parameters. We estimated genotyping error from duplicated samples, and found this was low (range: 0%-6%), but large enough to not be ignored. There appeared to be a discrepancy between the capture ratio of male adult bears; the CMR survey (1998-2000) captured 25% male bears, while we estimated approximately 64% of our captured bears were male. We felt the most likely explanation of this result is that our traps have a sex bias. However, further research is required to confirm this hypothesis. On the whole, our methods are very important for the management of polar bears, but more research must be done before it can be fully implemented.</dcterms:abstract>

Chapters 1 and 2 constitute a review of background material, while Chapters 3, 4, 5 contain new results, with additional review sections as necessary.  In Chapter 3 we demonstrate, via the Nijenhuis tensor, the integrability of a system of hydrodynamic type derived from the classical Volterra system.  In Chapter 4, families of Hamiltonian structures of hydrodynamic type are constructed, as well as a gauge transform acting on Hamiltonian structures of hydrodynamic type.  In Chapter 5, we present necessary and sufficient criteria for a three-component system of hydrodynamic type to be Hamiltonian, and classify the Lie-algebraic structures induced by a Hamiltonian structure for four-component systems of hydrodynamic type.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>From the mid eighteenth-century introduction of printing presses in Halifax (1751) and Québec City (1764), printers, readers and print contributors informally coalesced around the newspapers and magazines produced in the British American capitals.  This group was an eclectic mix of close friends, acquaintances and complete strangers of varied education, backgrounds and professions.  Whether they realized it or not, print drew these individuals together, uniting them in their literacy and a shared belief in the power of the press to shape opinion, regulate behaviour and inspire action.  The individuals who were drawn to the domestic press in the two colonial capitals can be considered as comprising a colonial print ascendancy.   As we will see, some of the most active members of this print ascendancy appealed to the colonial press — and the British traditions it communicated — to create a cohesive vision of privileged, English-speaking conduct.  Indeed, in both colonial capitals, those who envisaged and aspired to this elite conflated British gentility, literature and elevated sociability with civility and modernity.  Print was not only used by some as a means of privileged sociability, it was also used to debate or promote the objectives of other select fora such as the theatre, coffee houses, clubs and societies.  The domestic press forged social networks that lay claim to erudition and refined sociability believed requisite to colonial advancement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rasmussen et al. (2001) observed that Sb concentrations were enriched in household dust relative to outdoor garden soil samples and suspected the enrichment may be due to anthropogenic internal sources. Antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) is commonly found in various halogen flame-retardants and is a suspected carcinogen (IARC, 1989). North Americans spend a significant proportion of their time indoors, and are frequently exposed to dust. Therefore, characterizing potentially harmful metal(loid)s (i.e. Sb2O3) has become of increasing priority to various governmental agencies.  &#xD;
A combination of micro-analytical synchrotron techniques (micro X-ray fluorescence (µXRF), micro X-ray diffraction (µXRD), micro X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (µXANES)) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) were used to characterize five archived samples provided by Health Canada. Two samples were in the 90th percentile for Sb content in household dust from a suite of 50 houses studied by Rasmussen et al. (2001). The corresponding garden soils of these houses were also analysed. The fifth sample was a children’s bedroom from a house studied in detail by Walker et al. (2010). &#xD;
Synchrotron microanalysis of Sb presents many challenges, given its high absorption energy (31 KeV), and the relatively low concentrations and small particles in house dust. An appropriate experimental set-up was optimized after several trials. Antimony within household dust is currently not of toxicological concern (EU, 2008). Micro-XRF maps of household dust samples and corresponding garden soils from sample to sample displayed distinct element correlations of Sb with other elements. This suggests that Sb species present within homes are not restricted to a single source. Potential sources are Pb based or Sb containing pigments (Naples Yellow), metal alloys and possibly flame-retardants. The lack of correlation between Sb hot spots in the garden soil sample compared to the household dust suggests the source of interior Sb may not be external. &#xD;
A collaborative project with another student in the Environmental Studies Masters program was conducted to examine the potential for interdisciplinary work. Effective communication was the greatest barrier but there was success in the creation of a forum where people could critically think about the various nuances of household dust.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The moisture contents of the final coal products from processing plants are often too high and do not meet the requirements of the client. In many cases, drying becomes a necessary step to control the moisture content. Conventional thermal drying is inefficient and is not environmentally friendly. This study investigates the application of microwaves as an alternative heat source for drying coal. The rate of drying was determined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique. Several variables that have significant effects on the drying kinetics were investigated, including incident microwave power, initial moisture content and the sample mass. Microwave drying tests were performed under various conditions and the mass change was monitored continuously. The percentage mass loss, moisture fraction and drying rate were obtained for each experimental condition. The final temperature was measured and drying efficiencies were calculated. For comparison purposes, some conventional thermal drying tests were also carried out at temperatures ranging from 130 to 220oC and with coal masses ranging from 10g to 100g. The TGA results show that microwave drying has distinct advantages over conventional drying such as reducing the overall required time and increasing the drying efficiency. A multiple-regression analytical method was used for both microwave and conventional drying to find the best fit model among eleven different types. Finally, the sample mass, which proved to be the most dominant factor in microwave drying, was incorporated into the equation of the best fit model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two identified strategies to reduce GHG emissions that threaten the global climate stability include 1)the utilization of renewable sources of energy such as solar electricity from photovoltaic (PV) devices and 2)more efficient use of fossil fuels. While electricity production through PV is considerably less harmful than conventional sources of electricity, its intermittency and frequent mismatch between peak production and peak loads has proven to be a major obstacle to wide-scale implementation. As such, coupling PV with more reliable base load electricity production technologies such as combined heat and power (CHP) has been proposed to have a significant positive impact on increasing utilization and penetration levels. To test this theory, first the simulation and optimization platform was developed to utilize these strategies for a hybrid PV and combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems aimed at both reducing life cycle costs (LCC) and emissions using multi-objective genetic algorithms. The developed platform was focused on Canada‘s residential end-use energy sector and was created as a stepping stone for larger decentralized communal residential, commercial/institutional, and industrial applications. Simulations run with the platform found that the optimization of the PV-CCHP system led to a fuel energy utilization of 83%, compared to a theoretical upper limit of 85%. These values can be compared to 68% for PV+CHP systems that did not account for cooling loads, which show the technical superiority of CCHP systems hybridized to PV. In addition, these results showed that photovoltaic grid penetration can be increased to 24% with the implementation of a distributed network of hybrid PV-CCHP systems. Furthermore, the optimized systems demonstrated significantly lower emission intensities when compared to centralized and residential scale electricity plants and residential heating equipment. While implementation of these systems provide the highest benefits in emission-intensive grids such as Alberta and Halifax, their use in hydro-intensive provinces (ie. Quebec and British Columbia) was found to have potentially rewarding environmental benefits as well depending on fuel types and efficiencies of heating systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Social media services like Facebook mark the continued domestication of surveillance technology. Facebook has been remarkably successful at establishing a presence within a variety of social settings, including the interpersonal sphere, the academic sector, and the marketplace. As a platform shared by these spheres, Facebook distributes personal information beyond intended contexts. This research will develop a sociological understanding of individual, institutional, and aggregate surveillance through social networking sites. A series of semi-structured face-to-face interviews with students, university administrators and business employees provides a detailed understanding of surveillance practices on Facebook. Three kinds of surveillance are considered. First, lateral – or peer-to-peer – surveillance refers to interpersonal scrutiny between individuals. Second, institutional surveillance is the scrutiny of key populations by universities and other institutions. Third, aggregated surveillance is used primarily by businesses to study relevant markets. I propose that mutual augmentation exists between individual, institutional, and aggregate forms of surveillance on social media. These three models are situated within the same informational platform. By sharing not only the same information, but also the same interface used to access that information, formerly discrete surveillance practices feed off one another. New personal details, criteria, and searching techniques become common knowledge. Marketers and institutions now benefit from ‘user-generated value’ when individuals exchange relevant information amongst themselves. Likewise, university-age users have adopted new criteria like ‘employability’ and ‘liability’ to assess their peers as well as themselves.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation investigates how dramatic performance affects satire, its forms of authorisation, adaptation, and interpretation. Focusing on Restoration and eighteenth-century dramatic satires and film adaptations of eighteenth-century satires, I reassess literary criticism that claims the incommensurability of satire and performance based on a particular understanding of satiric authority as unidirectional and didactic, and therefore incompatible with the multi-dimensional nature of film and theatrical authority. In Chapter One, I establish how satire inquires into the nature of authority itself, exposing its “truths,” disciplinary modalities, and mediations, rather than correcting social behaviour. By putting authorised discourses into conflict, satire renders the contingencies of authority and destabilises its own authority through reflexivity and indirection, which counteract clear communication. Satire then invites multiple readings, even disagreements, instead of imposing consensus or compulsory meaning. In its diffusion and fracturing of perspectives, satire becomes amenable to the multiple agents and conditions of theatre and film performances. The task of satiric film and theatre becomes to “tear the seams” of performance and to apply the same reflexivity that satire applies to other authorities to performance's seamless authorisation in order to pursue its broader inquiry into power and discipline. &#xD;
In Chapter Two, I focus on the Collier Controversy, a pamphlet war in the late seventeenth century, which debated representations of vice in the theatre. I use the controversy to demonstrate what dramatic satire is not: uniform in intention, exposition, and interpretation. In Chapter Three, I examine Henry Fielding’s dramatic satires from 1730s to further debunk the idea of controlled and controlling relations between satirist and audience. I revise criticism of Fielding’s plays as “anti-theatrical” by demonstrating how his self-reflexive performances produce satiric theatre rather than negate theatrical performance. Chapter Four reviews adaptations of Gulliver’s Travels and here I emphasise the need to combine satiric self-reflexivity in film authorship with critical content in satiric films. In the final chapter, I demonstrate how the mockumentary form used in Michael Winterbottom’s 2005 film adaptation of Tristram Shandy successfully produces satiric effect by questioning the premise of its own authority alongside modes of authority and authorship satirised in Sterne’s book.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Within the past decade, two major events raised the national profile of the experiences of black youth and the realities of racism in the city of Kingston, Ontario.  The first event occurred in the spring of 2001 and involved the dramatic “high-risk takedown” by Kingston Police of two innocent black male youths who were wrongly profiled as suspects in an assault case.  The second event involved the subsequent release of a report commissioned by Kingston Police which confirmed that black male youth in Kingston were almost four times more likely to be stopped and questioned by Kingston police than any other racial group (Wortley and Marshall, 2005).  &#xD;
This research, while not addressed to the specifics of racial profiling and policing in Kingston, focuses on the marginalized voices of male and female black youth in Kingston.  Eight youth volunteered to participate in this study.  Participants took part in one-on-one interviews with the researcher and three participated in a follow-up focus group session.  Themes explored in the one-on-one interview and focus group sessions included factors influencing the construction of  black identities within a predominantly white city, the negotiation of friendships and relationships, and interactions with public authorities such as teachers and the police.  &#xD;
This study addresses the various ways in which black youth, male and female, experience life in their city – at home, at school, and in the community – and how they feel their blackness  affects these experiences.  It highlights the perspectives and insights of black Kingston youth. The findings of this research can help us better understand how black identities develop in small Canadian cities, how blackness is policed, and the internal and external “regimes of power” that govern these relations. (Foucault, 1977, p.112).  The study offers a medium by which these voices may be heard and may contribute to long-term community-based anti-racism work in Kingston.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“The most dangerous form of ‘white supremacy’ is not the obvious and extreme fascistic posturing of small neo-nazi groups, but rather the taken for granted routine privileging of white interests that goes unremarked in the political mainstream” (Gilbourn, 2005, p.485). This genealogical (Foucault, 1979; 1990) research study interrogates the political nature of universities and their role in the maintenance of racial oppression. Using Queen’s University, Ontario, Canada as a case study, it analyzes and explores the racist historical underpinnings of the institution and the response of the university to incidents of racial discrimination in the early 1990’s— particularly the creation of the 1989 Principals Advisory Committee (PAC) on Race Relations. This work documents and examines the institutional, political, and ideological obstacles in implementing this comprehensive, university-wide anti-racism policy. This research reveals and traces the discourses of racism at Queen’s University. It analyzes how the histories, ideologies, and institutional policy responses toward racism have produced and perpetuated processes that function to control and oppress racialized minorities. The study begins with a chronological analysis of racism at the university and identifies and examines the discursive strategies and techniques that are employed to sustain racist practices. The study concludes with an analysis of qualitative interviews with original members of 1989 Principal’s Advisory Committee on Race Relations who drafted the 1991 Race Relations Report, and captures their reflections on the institutional challenges and obstacles in implementing this monumental anti-racism policy at Queen’s University.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The re-usability and modularity of components reduce the cost and complexity of the software design. It is difficult to predict run-time scenarios covering all possible circumstances to ensure that the components are full compatible with the system. Monitoring run-time behaviours of components presents a close view of the component qualities. The existing monitoring approaches either implement applications with built-in monitoring features, or observe the external resource and events to predict the status of the components. In this thesis work, we propose an approach to monitor the run-time behaviours of components with aspect-oriented wrappers and contracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
We design monitoring wrappers to encapsulate the monitored components. The wrapper has the access to interfaces and properties of the wrapped component. We adopt the methodology of Design by Contract to enforce security policies on component wrappers. The contracts define the mutual obligations of two interacting components. The policies implemented in contracts are woven into component wrappers as separate aspect modules. If the component contains any flaws, the wrappers can monitor the behaviours and prevent failures propagating into the wrapped components and the rest of the system. This approach assures that the system is running in a safe environment with the erroneous behaviours or failures detected appropriately. Secure access between the wrappers guarantees a secure environment for the wrapped components.&#xD;
&#xD;
We conducted experiments on the run-time monitoring of SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting attacks. We designed cross-cutting concerns such as logging for components to illustrate monitoring components without&#xD;
touching the underlying components. Monitoring on access control is also possible and feasible to add as an additional concern and is also demonstrated in the experiments. The results show that the framework is very flexible to impose separate policies as aspects on component wrappers without the modifications of the underlying components.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sexual selection and the maintenance of species diversity in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes are greatly dependent on optical communication, which is influenced by environmental, physiological and endocrinological factors. The diversity in spectral sensitivity of cichlids has been partially attributed to differences in opsin gene expression, with each species preferentially expressing a subset of seven possible genes. Hormones such as gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) can mediate changes in gene expression and the presence of GnRH immunoreactive fibers and GnRH receptors throughout the retinal layers make it an excellent candidate for mediating changes in visual processes. Effects of exogenous GnRH administration on the visual system of zebra cichlids (Metriaclima zebra) via prolonged release cholesterol implants and intubation was investigated using electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Three week and ten week sampling periods were used in the intubation study. No obvious differences in spectral sensitivity were evident when looking at a-wave, b-wave and d-wave components of the ERG waveform in any of the treatment groups. A multiple mechanism model was used to describe the cone mechanisms mediating spectral sensitivity and this analysis showed that the activity of cones was shaped by opponent and non opponent cone interactions based on subsets of five opsin genes previously described in cichlids (SWS1, SWS2b, RH2b, RH2aβ, and RH2aα). Although differences in the spectral sensitivity between control and GnRH-treated fish were not evident on a functional level, there were changes in the gonadosomatic index in the intubation group. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization demonstrated that treatment with a synthetic GnRH3 analogue using the oral intubation delivery system resulted in statistically significant changes in opsin gene expression in both three week and ten week treatment groups, specifically the upregulation of RH2b and the downregulation of RH2a opsin genes. Moreover, in situ hybridization analysis showed that the pattern of labeling for the RH2a and RH2b riboprobes corroborated the changes in opsin gene expression found in the qRT-PCR data. In contrast, GnRH treatment using the cholesterol implant delivery system did not result in significant changes in spectral sensitivity or opsin gene expression.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the Bogoliubov de Gennes equations for a double well potential in order to model the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a Josephson junction.  First, the two dynamical regimes of the Josephson junction, that is, Josephson oscillations and self-trapping, are investigated under the application of a large sudden perturbation.  It is found that the Josephson dynamics have a strong dependence on the strength of the interatomic interaction, and we observe the breakdown of the two-mode approximation.  Second, we study the control of the dynamics through the use of a time-dependent, tilted double well potential.  In the context of complete population transfer, the effect of the interactions on the adiabaticity and self-trapping is discussed in terms of a Landau-Zener-like model.  We then explore the splitting of the condensate and the resulting dynamical behaviour by keeping the interaction strength constant, but changing the rate of the tilt sweep.  Lastly, we examine the effect of the tilt sweep rate on the dynamics of population transfer.  We observe a dependence of the self-trapping on the adiabaticity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the events and processes responsible for patterns of within species diversity, provides insight into major evolutionary themes like adaptation, species distributions, and ultimately speciation itself. Here, I combine ecological, genetic and spatial perspectives to evaluate the roles that both historical and contemporary factors have played in shaping the population structure and genetic variation of foxsnakes (Pantherophis gloydi).&#xD;
First, I determine the likely impact of habitat loss on population distribution, through radio-telemetry (32 individuals) at two locations varying in habitat patch size. As predicted, individuals had similar habitat use patterns, but restricted movements to patches of suitable habitat at the more disturbed site. Also, occurrence records spread across a fragmented region were non-randomly distributed and located close to patches of usable habitat, suggesting habitat distribution limits population distribution. &#xD;
    Next, I combined habitat suitability modeling with population genetics (589 individuals, 12 microsatellite loci) to infer how foxsnakes disperse through a mosaic of natural and altered landscape features. Boundary regions between genetic clusters were comprised of low suitability habitat (e.g. agricultural fields). Island populations were grouped into a single genetic cluster suggesting open water presents less of a barrier than non-suitable terrestrial habitat. Isolation by distance models had a stronger correlation with genetic data when including resistance values derived from habitat suitability maps, suggesting habitat degradation limits dispersal for foxsnakes.&#xD;
    At larger temporal and spatial scales I quantified patterns of genetic diversity and population structure using mitochondrial (101 cytochrome b sequences) and microsatellite (816 individuals, 12 loci) DNA and used Approximate Bayesian computation to test competing models of demographic history. Supporting my predictions, I found models with populations which have undergone population size drops and splitting events continually had more support than models with small founding populations expanding to stable populations. Based on timing, the most likely cause was the cooling of temperatures and infilling of deciduous forest since the Hypisthermal. On a smaller scale, evidence suggested anthropogenic habitat loss has caused further decline and fragmentation. Mitochondrial DNA structure did not correspond to fragmented populations and the majority of foxsnakes had an identical haplotype, suggesting a past bottleneck or selective sweep.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Deliquescence is the process whereby a solid interacts with a humid atmosphere and begins to dissolve when the partial pressure of H2O in the atmosphere exceeds the partial pressure of H2O at which the solid is in equilibrium at a given temperature.  Deliquescence of sulfate minerals poses a risk to both plant and animal life as metals and acid that are stored in the mineral structure are released.  Detailed solid-solution transition boundaries for sulfate minerals aid in the understanding of acid mine waste behavior in the event of environmental changes.  The deliquescence behaviors of ferricopiapite, melanterite, halite and epsomite have been studied as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A device has been developed to determine the onset of deliquescence as the temperature and/or relative humidity around a sample of sulfate mineral is varied.  Experiments were conducted on several synthetic analogues of minerals. Ferricopiapite was studied as it is the most likely mineral to exhibit this behavior in common acid mine drainage sites where sulfates are present. Because no experimental data exist for the deliquescence of ferricopiapite, in order to properly test the device experiments in which the relative humidity was raised above the deliquescence point and then reversed were conducted using synthetic melanterite and halite for which solid-vapor equilibrium constants for temperature and relative humidity are known.  Results of the reversal experiments for melanterite and halite show that the surface resistivity probe designed for this study accurately determines the onset of deliquescence as predicted by the known solid-liquid-vapor phase diagrams.  The deliquescence of copiapite is not a reversible process as it does not re-precipitate from the liquid created by deliquescence as the relative humidity is lowered.  Epsomite was studied to determine if there was any crystallographic control of the onset of deliquescence between different crystal faces. A significant and consistent difference in the onset of deliquescence was observed between the {111} and {100} faces with the {111} face always being the first to deliquesce as a function of increased relative humidity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Synaptic plasticity reflects the capacity of synapses to undergo changes in synaptic strength and connectivity, and is highly regulated by age and sensory experience. This thesis focuses on the characterization of synaptic plasticity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of rats throughout development and following sensory deprivation. Initial experiments revealed an age-dependent decline in plasticity, as indicated by reductions in long-term potentiation (LTP). The enhanced plasticity of juvenile rats appeared to be mediated by NR2B subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), as NR2B antagonist application reduced LTP to adult-like levels in juveniles, yet had no effect in adults. The importance of sensory experience in mediating plasticity was revealed in experiments using white noise exposure, which is a sensory deprivation technique known to arrest cortical development in A1. Notably, adult rats reared in continuous white noise maintained more juvenile-like levels of LTP, which normalized upon subsequent exposure to an unaltered acoustic environment. The white noise-induced LTP enhancements also appeared to be mediated by NR2B subunits, as NR2B antagonists reversed these LTP enhancements in white noise-reared rats. Given the strong influence that sensory experience exerts on plasticity, additional experiments examined the effect of shorter episodes of white noise exposure on LTP in adult rats. Exposure to white noise during early postnatal life appeared to “prime” A1 for subsequent exposure in adulthood, resulting in enhanced LTP. The necessity of early-life exposure was evident, as repeated episodes of white noise in adulthood did not enhance plasticity. In older rats that typically no longer express LTP in A1, pharmacological methods to enhance plasticity were explored. Moderate LTP was observed in older rats with cortical zinc application, which may act through its antagonism of NR2A subunits of the NMDAR. Additionally, current source density and cortical silencing analyses were conducted to characterize the distinct peaks of field postsynaptic potentials recorded in A1, with the earlier and later peaks likely representing thalamocortical and intracortical synapses, respectively. Together, this thesis emphasizes the critical role of sensory experience in determining levels of cortical plasticity, and demonstrates strategies to enhance plasticity in the mature auditory cortex.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Squeezing ground in tunnelling is a unique method of failure, typically occurring in ductile rock at depth.  To accommodate this mechanism of failure, liners have been designed such that they reduce in circumference as the support takes on initial load.  Technological development in this area is all the more important for tunnels mined in heterogeneous rockmasses.  Currently, the state of practice is to design support based on a normalised average of the strength parameters of the rock units present in the tunnel face.  Under many configurations of heterogeneity, this approach is perfectly valid, however there are styles and magnitudes of heterogeneity that require deeper analysis.  The purpose of this study is to introduce an empirical relationship between liner response in heterogeneous rockmasses and liner response in the homogenised equivalent.  A suite of parameters that define heterogeneity were numerically modelled, using finite element analysis, such that a comprehensive set of the various permutations was evaluated.  The three styles of heterogeneity that were modelled were chaotic structure, folded structure and laminar structure, these represent common and discrete structures found in alpine regions.  Laminar structure was considered at three orientations, and all structures were considered under hydrostatic and differential stress regimes.  Granularity, or scale, and contrast ratio of units were also varied.  These data were analysed with respect to mean axial thrust, range of axial thrust and range of moment on the liner.  Liner response analysis was also conducted on the case study of St. Martin-la-Porte, an adit to the Lyon-Turin Ferroviaire base tunnel in southern France.  This adit has been excavated in a highly variable, heterogeneous rockmass and provides realistic examples of the nature of heterogeneity present in current tunnelling projects.  Ultimately, three equations were developed to provide preliminary predictions of heterogeneous axial thrust and moment variability from the analysis of homogeneous equivalents.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zirconium alloy pressure tubes are an important component in CANDU nuclear reactors.  During operation these tubes can pick up hydrogen as a result of a corrosion reaction, which can eventually lead to the precipitation of a secondary, brittle zirconium hydride phase.  Hydrides tend to first form at flaws (stress concentrations), and when they fracture can initiate a time-controlled crack growth mechanism known as delayed hydride cracking (DHC).  Since DHC is a known failure mechanism for pressure tubes, and an ongoing concern in the nuclear industry, more fundamental knowledge is required about the behaviour of hydrides precipitated at flaws.  Several approaches were employed in this thesis to better characterize the effects and behaviour of hydrides at such stress concentrations.  &#xD;
&#xD;
High energy X-ray diffraction, as well as in-situ SEM testing coupled with digital image correlation, were used to map the strains around stress concentrations where hydrides were present.  These studies highlighted important differences in the behaviour of the hydride phase and the surrounding zirconium.  To gain greater insight into hydride morphology, neutron tomography was used in an attempt to measure the through-thickness hydride distribution at flaws.  A finite element model was also developed and verified against the X-ray strain mapping results.  This model provided greater insight into details that could not be obtained directly from the experimental approaches, as well as providing a framework for future modeling to predict the effects of hydride precipitation under different conditions.  Taken as a whole, these studies provide important information for improving service guidelines and avoiding conditions that favour embrittlement due to hydride precipitation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A recent theory of motor control, based on optimal feedback control, posits that voluntary motor behaviour involves the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback. Although this theory can explain how people move in the world, it does not specifically describe how this control process is implemented by the nervous system. In this thesis, we propose and explore one physiological implication of this theory. Specifically, we hypothesize that rapid feedback responses should possess the key functional attributes of voluntary control because these two systems share a common neural pathway through motor areas of cerebral cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our first four studies were designed to elaborate the functional attributes of the long-latency stretch reflex, a fast feedback response which occurs 50-100ms following the mechanical stretch of a muscle. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the&#xD;
long-latency response possesses many attributes commonly reserved for voluntary&#xD;
control: the long-latency response is continuously modulated by subject intent (Chapter 2), it compensates for the size-recruitment principle of the motoneuron pool (Chapter 3) and it accounts for the mechanical properties of the upper-limb (Chapter 5). Further investigation revealed that the long-latency response can be decomposed into two functionally-independent processes (Chapter 4), and that one of these components contributes all of the sophistication observed in Chapters 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
The goal of our fifth study was to investigate the neural basis of the long-latency response (Chapter 6). Our results provide strong evidence from both single-neuron recordings in non-human primates and transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans that primary motor cortex, which is known to be a critical node for voluntary control, also contributes to the sophistication of the long-latency response.&#xD;
&#xD;
Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis demonstrate that the long-&#xD;
latency response possesses several functional attributes typically reserved for voluntary control and that this sophistication likely arises via a transcortical pathway through primary motor cortex.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Advances in analytical chemistry have resulted in a growing body of literature showing measurable concentrations of pharmaceuticals in both drinking and wastewater. Removal of such chemicals is typically inefficient and often poorly characterized. To characterize one such method of removal (micellar enhanced ultrafiltration, (MEUF)), interactions of a cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) surfactant and sulfonamide antibiotics were examined by NMR and semi-equilibrium dialysis (SED).&#xD;
The locus and orientation of binding in a micelle was established for seven sulfonamides by 1H NMR, and it was found that hydrophilic sulfonamides showed weak coordination with the micelle, whereas hydrophobic sulfonamides penetrated into the micellar interior with coordination of the SO2NH group to the charged surface layer. &#xD;
Binding constants were determined by 1H NMR and showed apparent order of magnitude differences between nuclei. Several compounds were unable to be characterized in this manner due to low change in chemical shift with addition of CTABr. SED was performed as an alternative method to determine binding constants. Values determined in this manner were higher than those determined by 1H NMR. Binding constants were converted into changes in Gibbs free energy and used to evaluate and, where necessary, modify the orientation and locus proposed by 1H NMR.&#xD;
Attempts are made to correlate binding constants with octanol-water partition coefficients to determine if a free energy relationship can be derived. Characterization of these systems may allow for a predictive methodology to determine the MEUF removal efficiencies of new sulfonamide and surfactant combinations. It is also hoped that this work may be generalized to predict MEUF efficiency for a wide range of contaminants that might be found in wastewater.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The growing prevalence of childhood and adolescent physical inactivity and obesity are major concerns in Canada. Physical activity promoted within schools should be seen as a way to address these problems, since the majority of children receive public schooling. Research highlighting in-school physical activity helps influence school board and public health officials to create a physically active school environment. Consequently, this study has two objectives. The first is to describe the prevalence of in-school physical activity and four dependent variables in a nationwide sample of 9717 students, using data from the Health Behavior in School–aged Children survey. Dependent variables include life satisfaction, self-rated health, academic performance, and out-of-school physical activity. The second objective examines the association between in-school physical activity levels and these dependent variables, while controlling for potential confounders. Using existing data from the 2005/06 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey, a partial proportional odds model form of ordinal logistic regression was fitted in order to investigate the relationship between in-school physical activity and self-rated health, life satisfaction, academic performance, and out-of-school physical activity, while controlling for potential confounders. The results showed a significant positive relationship between in-school physical activity and life satisfaction (OR range: 1.18 – 1.50), in-school physical activity and self-rated health (OR range: 1.10 – 2.86), in-school physical activity and academic performance (OR range: 1.20 – 1.40), and in-school physical activity and out-of-school physical activity (OR range: 1.09 - 6.68). Consequently, it is recommended that school environments which encourage physical activity continue to be promoted, and future studies continue to explore the benefits of in-school physical activity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A verified elasto-viscoplastic finite element model is used to develop a better understanding of the performance of embankments with geosynthetic reinforcement constructed over rate-sensitive soil. The interaction between reinforcement and prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) and their effects on time-dependent behaviour of embankments are examined. For rate-sensitive soils, the generation of creep-induced pore pressures following the end of construction is evident along the potential slip surface. As a result, the minimum factor of safety with respect to embankment stability occurs after the end of construction. The combined use of reinforcement and PVDs are shown to provide an effective means of minimizing creep-induced excess pore pressure, increasing overall stability, and decreasing deformation of the embankments.&#xD;
	The combined effects of the viscoelastic properties of geosynthetic reinforcement (polyester, polypropylene and polyethylene) and the rate-sensitive nature of foundation soils on the performance of embankments are examined. The effect of various factors, including reinforcement type (i.e., stiffness and viscosity), soil viscosity, construction rate and allowable long-term reinforcement strain, on the time-dependent behaviour of embankments are considered. The long-term performance of reinforced embankments is investigated for different maximum allowable long-term reinforcement strains. From a series of finite element analyses, the ideal allowable reinforcement strains to minimize embankment deformation while providing optimum long-term service height of the embankment, considering the effect of soil and reinforcement viscosity, are proposed for soils similar to those examined in this study.&#xD;
	The currently proposed design methods for embankments with creep-susceptible reinforcement over rate-sensitive soils appear to be overly conservative. This study proposes a refined approach for establishing the allowable long-term reinforcement strains that are expected to provide adequate performance while reducing the level of conservativeness of reinforced embankment design. &#xD;
	Finally, a previously developed elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model is modified to incorporate the effect of soil structure using a state-dependent fluidity parameter and damage law. The model was evaluated against data from a well-documented case study of a reinforced test embankment constructed on a sensitive Champlain clay deposit in Saint Alban, Quebec. The benefit of basal reinforcement and the effect of reinforcement viscosity are then discussed for these types of soil deposits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Key studies of apocalypse in previous years have consciously and unconsciously understood the genre in terms of its paradigmatic consistency across examples. This emphasis points out valuable similarities among a wide range of texts, but also diminishes the significance of a text’s locally and historically rooted ways of depicting experience. This study reflects an effort to rebalance the meaning of apocalypse by looking at a specific locale – the North American West Coast. I examine popular, critical, and literary representations of the West Coast to trace out the unique ways that they configure regional identities. Ultimately, I make the case for site-specific criticism, which values provisional, locally rooted terminologies and tropes for analyzing cultural problems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The abiotic leaching behavior of a chalcopyrite ore, from Asarco’s Ray-Mine, was conducted in shake flasks and miniature columns at elevated temperatures.  The shake flask tests, with an ore particle size of 1.18mm-2.38mm, found the highest Cu extraction was obtained using 1M NaCl in a 9.8g/L sulphuric acid solution at 60°C, with 69% Cu extracted in 16 days. The next highest extraction, 59% Cu extracted in 16 days, was achieved by adding fine pyrite at a 4:1wt ratio with the chalcopyrite content, in a 9.8g/L sulphuric acid solution at 60°C. Flask tests using other lixiviants and additions found copper extractions in the range of 30-40% Cu after 16 days. In the mini-column tests, the rates of copper extraction were similar for all test conditions. The rate of Cu extraction, even with a small particle size of 1.18mm-2.38mm and an elevated temperature of 50°C, was slow for all test conditions with an average rate of ~0.15% Cu per day.&#xD;
The conceptual engineering of a hot, abiotic heap-leach for low-grade chalcopyrite ore, including hypothetical heat and mass balances was conducted.  The leaching time for a commercial operation was estimated from published data on laboratory column leaching of chalcopyrite ores and extrapolated to a commercial heap-leach by analogy with known leaching times for chalcocite ores. In commercial abiotic heap-leaches of chalcopyrite ore, the partial oxidation reactions generate insignificant heat to maintain an elevated heap temperature therefore the heat required to maintain the elevated temperature must be provided externally. In commercial biotic chalcopyrite heap-leaches, the in-situ total oxidation reaction generates more heat than the abiotic reactions but is still insufficient to rapidly raise and maintain an elevated heap temperature. For a low-grade Chalcopyrite heap-leach the most practical method of providing this heat is by injecting steam into the base of the heap using current air injection pipes. An external oxidant is required and for an abiotic heap-leach external ferric generation will be required.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Migration acts as a selective force on the ecology and evolutionary trajectory of species, as well as presenting fundamental challenges for conservation.  My thesis examines the impact of migration by exploring patterns of differentiation among and within migratory and non-migratory populations of the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus).  First, I use morphological, genotypic, stable isotope and leg band recovery data to quantify migratory connectivity in the species.  Comparison across markers reveals a generally concordant pattern of moderate connectivity to the Gulf Coast, but overall mixing among populations on the wintering grounds.  Combining data from multiple markers in a Bayesian framework improves the resolution of assignment of wintering birds to a breeding ground origin.  Information on the species’ migratory patterns provides an explicit framework for interpreting patterns of genetic and ecological variation.  I test two hypotheses regarding the interaction of gene flow and migratory habit:  (1) migration facilitates gene flow; and (2) gene flow will occur most often along the axis of migration.  Genetic population structure in migratory populations is weaker than in non-migratory populations, with gene flow facilitated by dispersal movements of females and first year breeders.  As predicted, gene flow occurs most often along the north-south axis of migration, likely due either to opportunistic settling of dispersers or potentially, pairing on the wintering grounds.  I investigate variation in the extent and scheduling of moult in relation to underlying genetic differences among populations, age, sex, body size, food availability and migratory habit.  I find a pattern of interrupted moult across migratory populations, which may represent a trade-off between time allocated to breeding versus molt and migration.  Loggerhead Shrikes in eastern and more southerly migratory populations undergo a greater extent of their moult on the breeding grounds and non-migratory individuals undergo a more extensive pre-formative moult than migratory individuals. I interpret this as suggesting a trade-off between resources allocated to molt versus those required for reproduction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This phenomenological study of a First Nations to First Nations reciprocal student&#xD;
exchange elicited and explored the meanings of a reciprocal intercommunity exchange for grade&#xD;
7 and 8 students in two First Nations schools. Representative student research participants from&#xD;
one of the schools shared their pictures, stories and memories of their experiences through&#xD;
photo-story (Truchon, 2007; Wang &amp; Burris, 1997) and in a sharing circle (Lavallee, 2007).&#xD;
The students‟ journeys were not only physical and geographical, but also emotional and&#xD;
cultural. I also journeyed to an acceptance of my outsider/insider status growing up in a First&#xD;
Nations community. As a non-Aboriginal researcher, I negotiated a space between the demands&#xD;
of the academic institution and the First Nations community; and chose research methods that&#xD;
were congruent with Indigenous Research Methodology (Wilson, 2008; Kovach, 2009; Smith,&#xD;
1999).&#xD;
The four themes that emerged from the data: community and relationships; culture and&#xD;
ceremony; connections with place, and confidence building are congruent with AFN‟s vision of&#xD;
“reciprocal inter-community exchanges promoting sharing of culture” (AFN, 2007) and with&#xD;
Cajete‟s (1999) vision of “igniting the sparkle.” These students said that: “learning about&#xD;
another culture made me want to learn more about my own.” Listening to these students share&#xD;
what was gained through this exchange and their dreams for the future revealed their hope and&#xD;
persistence. The example of a practice such as a reciprocal exchange which encouraged and&#xD;
iii&#xD;
engaged these youth could stimulate other First Nations communities to seek out similar&#xD;
educational practices that would benefit their youth.</dcterms:abstract>

   (i) The optimal use vaccination and isolation resources under the assumption that these resources are limited. Specifically we address the problem of minimizing the outbreak size and we determine the optimal vaccination-only, isolation-only and mixed vaccination-isolation strategies.&#xD;
  (ii) The optimal use of a single antiviral drug to minimize the total outbreak size,     under the assumption that treatment causes de novo resistance.&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Osteoarthritis is the end result of damage to articular cartilage, which lacks the ability to self-repair.  Tissue engineering of cartilage is a promising field of study that aims to promote healing of cartilage in vivo by manipulation of the chondrocytes that maintain the tissue, or through in vitro production of new cartilage for implantation into cartilage defects.  Tissue-engineered cartilage constructs require mechanical stimulation to produce matrix components in quantities and proportions similar to native cartilage tissue, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is thought to be an autocrine/paracrine biochemical mediator of these mechanical forces on the cell, after its release from chondrocytes under mechanical stress.  This study determined culture conditions for chondrocytes in 3D agarose scaffolds from mature donors undergoing total joint arthroplasty for the treatment of osteoarthritis, then supplemented these cells in vitro with exogenous ATP in concentrations varying from 50 nM to 1 mM in the presence of the radioisotopes [35S] and [3H]-proline, with radioisotope incorporation acting as markers of proteoglycan and collagen synthesis respectively.   The basal concentrations of ATP in the chondrocyte cultures as well as the ATP half-life in the cultures were determined by lucifer/luciferase assay and luminometry.  The P2Y receptor expression on the populations of chondrocytes from 8 donors was determined by flow cytometry, with largely varied individual expression and heterogeneity of P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors.  Exogenous ATP was found to increase synthesis of matrix components by 200% of the control cultures at doses of 100 nM to 1 µM.  Patients with worse arthritis patterns, who were on chronic narcotic medications and who smoked were more likely to have a negative response to the exogenous ATP supplementation.  The basal concentration of ATP in the cultures was less than 1 nM, and the ATP half-life varied from 1-2 hours, depending on the expression of P2Y1 receptors expressed by the donor’s chondrocyte population (R2 = 0.99).  Supplementation of exogenous ATP to tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro appears to be a promising technique for improving the matrix synthesis of these constructs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accurate, practical, and affordable pose tracking on manually operated C-arm fluoroscopes is a major technical challenge.  Conventional tracking methods, such as optical cameras and radiographic fiducials, are hampered by significant shortcomings.   Optical cameras are delicate, costly, and have a complex system setup that is easily susceptible to camera obstruction in cluttered operating room.  Radiographic fiducials occupy a significant portion of the fluoroscopic imaging space.  Using fiducials also requires segmentation that limits clinical use.   In this thesis, an alternative form of tracking is proposed to encode the rotational joints of manually operated C-arms using a tilt sensing accelerometer for tracking the C-arm rotational pose.  The technique is evaluated by affixing an accelerometer to a full-scale C-arm where a webcam is used as a substitute for X-ray imaging.  Ground truth C-arm rotational poses were obtained from the webcam by tracking a checkerboard plate.  From these rotational poses, a series of angle and structural correction equations were formulated that can properly relate the accelerometer angle readings to the C-arm rotational pose in real-time and compensate for systematic structural C-arm deformations, such as sagging and bending.  Real-time rotational pose tracking of the primary and secondary joint rotations of the C-arm showed an accuracy of 0.5 degrees in the entire range of interest.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The archaeal flagellum is a rotating prokaryotic motility apparatus used for swimming motility and adhesion; however, it is more closely related to the bacterial type IV pilus system than its bacterial namesake. Methanococcus maripaludis is a highly flagellated, obligately anaerobic methanogen and is used as the archaeal model system during this study. The identified structural genes of the archaeal flagella are transcribed by a single fla operon; however, the interactions between the majority of the Fla proteins has yet to be elucidated. In this work, several&#xD;
techniques were attempted to determine the protein-protein interactions between Fla proteins, including membrane fractionation experiments and in vitro dimerization assays. Evidence from these experiments suggests that two proteins, FlaC and FlaE, have the ability to self-associate. The M. maripaludis flagella system is also used as a model for the study of the N-linked&#xD;
glycosylation pathway in the domain, due to the presence of a tetrasaccharide N-linked to flagellin monomers. Previous work has identified several of the processes involved in the assembly of this glycan, including glycosyltransferases, the oligosaccharide transferase and several of the key components involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar residue precursors. However, many of the enzymes responsible for biochemical modifications to the sugar residues remain to be determined. The operon structure of the genes between mmp1080 and mmp1095 was experimentally confirmed using RT-PCR, and each of the operons contains at least one gene involved in the biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan. In-frame deletions of genes in this region&#xD;
were characterized for effects on the N-linked glycan. Evidence suggests that Mmp1082 and Mmp1083 are acting in conjunction with Mmp1081 in the addition of an acetamidino functional group to the third sugar residue. Mmp1085 was determined to be a methyltransferase responsiblefor the methylation of the terminal sugar residue. Additionally, Mmp1087 and Mmp1094 were identified as potentially having an effect on the glycan.&#xD;
Though this work, the breadth of knowledge in regards to both the archaeal flagella and the N-linked glycosylation process in the domain has been increased.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two Paleoproterozoic basins, the western Thelon Basin, and the Otish Basin, Canada, were investigated using basin analysis to evaluate critical factors for the formation of unconformity-related uranium deposits. The results serve to guide ongoing exploration at two under-studied uranium prospects in each basin, and help predict whether or not these basins have the potential to host high-grade uranium deposits in other locations.&#xD;
	Sequence stratigraphy, in combination with mineral paragenesis indicates that unmetamorphosed basinal sandstones overlying the Boomerang Lake prospect, western Thelon Basin, were compacted and occluded by kaolinite and muscovite during diagenesis, and became diagenetic aquicludes that were unable to effectively conduct uranium-bearing basinal brines. Based on the high δ18O values of basinal and basement-influenced fluids, and the preservation of pre-Thelon-Basin 40Ar/39Ar dates of poorly-crystalline phyllosilicates in the basement rocks, hydrothermal alteration and uranium mineralization must have occurred at low water/rock ratios. This produced uneconomic amounts of U-bearing phosphate that was misidentified as uraninite in a previous report. A significant uranium deposit is unprobable based on the lack of unsupported radiogenic Pb near the prospect. However, intersections of thick, stratigraphically-higher diagenetic aquifers, which are marked by abundant dickite, and structurally-reactivated basement rocks on a different exploration trend remain the most prospective locations for a uranium deposit in the area.&#xD;
	At the Camie River prospect, Otish Basin, diagenesis of basinal sediments in thick diagenetic aquifers was associated with fluids that were isotopically similar to seawater-derived basinal brines. The 1721 ±20 Ma Pb/Pb date obtained for Camie River uraninite coincides with intrusions of the Otish Gabbro, which triggered basinal fluid flow in diagenetic aquifers and uranium mineralization throughout the basin. The effects of late hydrothermal, metamorphic, and meteoric fluid events are restricted to fractures and faults. These zones also preferentially host radiogenic Pb and pathfinder elements that dispersed from the prospect, which can be utilized to vector towards additional deposits. The unconformity-type deposit model can be extended to basins as old as 2.0 Ga, as the Otish Basin demonstrates that atmospheric oxygen contents were high enough at this time to allow the evolution of U-leaching oxidizing basinal brines.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Business processes describe a set of tasks for accomplishing business objectives of an organization. Business applications automate business processes to improve the productivity of business users. Nowadays, the business environment changes fast due to rapid market growth and technological innovations. Business processes are continuously updated to reflect new business initiatives. Business applications are frequently evolved to add features to meet new requirements and fix defects. Quite often, business processes and business applications evolve independently without direct reference to each other. Over time, it becomes more and more challenging to maintain the consistency between a business application and the corresponding business processes. Moreover, the existing development approaches rely on software developers’ craftsmanship to design and implement business applications. Such a development paradigm is inefficient and leads to inconsistency between business processes and business applications.&#xD;
To facilitate the alignment between business applications and business processes, we present an approach that automatically generates software architecture and code skeletons of business applications from business processes. We identify architectural components from business processes by analyzing dependencies among tasks. To verify the achievement of quality requirements, we extend a set of existing product metrics to automatically evaluate the quality of the generated software architecture designs. Eventually, we apply refactoring strategies, such as software architectural styles or design patterns, to optimize the generated software architecture designs and resolve identified quality problems. Moreover, we also present an approach to automatically refine software architecture to design models and code skeletons of business applications. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is illustrated through case studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the identity development and adjustment among young adult Transracial adoptees. To achieve this purpose, I conducted two separate interviews with four Transracially adopted adults (ages 19 to 28) and spoke about their perceptions and experiences regarding their respective identities, and their adjustments in interpersonal contexts such as education.&#xD;
Although the participants have positive affect about their adoption placements, the participants continue to face challenges regarding their identities. However, as adults, the participants no longer dwell on such hurdles; they consider their identities to be continuously evolving, and their maturity has enabled their adjustment to be within their control. They suggest that a key aspect to this adjustment was their early knowledge of their adoption status. The participants also feel that educators should be aware of sensitivities with respect to Transracial adoption but not intervene specifically with Transracial adoptees except in the case of bullying. Future research should expand the current study by taking a more expansive view of the topic in respect to range of participants and data collection methods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: I examined two labour force disparities – unemployment and underemployment, among working-aged individuals (20-64 years) with self-reported disabilities using the 2006 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (PALS). As disability type was the predictor of interest, two groups were compared: individuals with one or more physical disabilities (e.g. mobility, agility, pain) exclusively vs. those with one or more physical disabilities and a co-morbid mental disability (including depression, phobias or substance use). &#xD;
Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of the 2006 PALS, a cross-sectional survey conducted by Statistics Canada to gather information about individuals whose everyday activities are limited due to a physical or mental condition that used the 2006 census as a sampling frame. I estimated the prevalence of unemployment (last week) and underemployment (last five years) and used multiple logistic regression to measure the association between disability type and each outcome, while considering other relevant covariates. &#xD;
Results: Disability type was significantly associated with both unemployment and underemployment. Other significant effects were age, education level and family income quintile (in addition to current labour force status and frequency of health services access in underemployment), in both the bivariate and multivariate analyses. Those with a mental co-morbidity had approximately double the odds of being unemployed, relative to those with exclusively physical disabilities and the effect continued to be significant when disability severity was included in the model. Individuals with a mental co-morbidity also experienced greater odds (OR: 2.92) of reporting underemployment, compared to those with exclusively physical disabilities, though when disability severity was accounted for, the effect was reduced (OR: 1.52) and no longer significant. &#xD;
Conclusion: To my knowledge, this is the first large-scale investigation using Canadian data to explore the association of disability type and two labour force disparities. In support of my hypothesis, individuals with a mental co-morbidity were found to be more disadvantaged in terms of both accessing employment and probability of encountering stigmatizing experiences in the workplace. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the nature of these outcomes in order to progress toward the removal of significant barriers that persist in this population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bullying has received much attention among researchers; however, the research produced has predominantly involved peer bullying. This project addressed the issue of authority abuse in schools by teachers, an area of research that is currently limited. &#xD;
The reviewed literature demonstrated a need for a program that would educate pre-service teachers and provide an opportunity for self-reflection. What resulted was the development of a module called ‘Power Play’, which provides teachers with an opportunity to reflect on their teaching philosophy and teaching styles. Also, the module stresses the importance of maintaining a balanced life-style and provides information on effective stress management.&#xD;
The module was presented on three separate occasions to pre-service educators. The feedback received has prompted future changes to the Power Play module.  The core message of the project is that teachers must take care of themselves if they hope to be effective educators in the classroom.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As a software project ages, its source code is improved by refining existing features, adding new ones, and fixing bugs. Software developers can attest that such changes often require accompanying changes to the infrastructure that converts source code into executable software packages, i.e., the build system. Intuition suggests that these build system changes slow down development progress by diverting developer focus away from making improvements to the source code.&#xD;
&#xD;
While source code evolution and maintenance is studied extensively, there is little work that focuses on the build system. In this thesis, we empirically study the static and dynamic evolution of build system complexity in proprietary and open source projects. To help counter potential bias of the study, 13 projects with different sizes, domains, build technologies, and release strategies were selected for examination, including Eclipse, Linux, Mozilla, and JBoss.&#xD;
&#xD;
We find that: (1) similar to Lehman's first law of software evolution, Java build system specifications tend to grow unless explicit effort is invested into restructuring them, (2) the build system accounts for up to 31\% of the code files in a project, and (3) up to 27\% of source code related development tasks require build maintenance. Project managers should include build maintenance effort of this magnitude in their project planning and budgeting estimations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Diabetic pregnant women have an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia, a late gestational syndrome, although the reason for this gain is unknown. Placental pathology in pre-eclampsia is linked with insufficient spiral arterial modification, a process triggered by uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, an abundant pro-angiogenic cell type found in early pregnancy decidua (endometrium of the pregnant uterus). UNK cells effect spiral arterial modification, the blood supply to the placenta, through the release of interferon gamma (Ifng), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Peripheral blood precursors of uNK cells employ a unique pattern of homing molecules to traffic to the decidua. The goal of this thesis was to advance the understanding of how homing and functions of uNK cell precursors might be modified in diabetic pregnancy. Studies employed both murine and human models. &#xD;
Pregnancies were studied microscopically in normoglycemic (n-) and hyperglycemic (d-) non-obese diabetic (NOD) and NOD.Ifng-/- (NOD strain with a genetic deletion of Ifng) mice. Pre-implantation embryo development was impaired in n- and d-NOD.Ifng-/- mice. Hyperglycemia decreased both numbers of uNK cells and spiral artery remodelling within d-NOD and d-NOD.Ifng-/- decidua. This decrease in spiral artery remodelling was independent of Ifng and linked with hypertrophy of smooth muscle in implantation sites.&#xD;
Blood leukocytes from control and diabetic pregnant women were evaluated for adhesive function and expression of key homing molecules. Diabetic leukocytes had decreased CD56+ (uNK cell lineage) cell adhesion to decidua, increased CD56+ cell adhesion to pancreas, and comparable adhesion to lymph node compared with control leukocytes, suggesting impaired decidual homing in vivo. Of 8 lymphocyte subsets resolved by flow cytometry, type 1 cytokine CD56bright cells expressed appropriate homing molecules most abundantly. Diabetes did not alter levels of expression of these receptors. &#xD;
These data show that diabetes alters the potential capacity for decidual homing of pre-uNK cells but that this is not achieved through reduction in levels of key homing molecules. Diabetes also reduced spiral arterial modification in mice through hypertrophy of smooth muscle. The reproductive challenges of diabetic women who have co-morbid immunological diseases merit further study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising application of local protein delivery.  Poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC) is an interesting polymer due to its special degradation mechanism and good immunocompatibility and cytocompatibility.  Its biggest advantage over commonly used aliphatic polyesters is that it does not degrade to acidic products implicated in protein denaturation and tissue inflammation.  The degradation mechanism of linear PEC is thought to be oxidative, however the in vivo degradation rate is inappropriately rapid for angiogenic growth factor delivery.  To reduce the PEC degradation rate, low molecular weight PEC diacrylates were formed and then UV photocrosslinked to form elastomers.  The aims of this thesis were to evaluate the degradation and biocompatibility of these elastomers, and to determine formulation parameters that control the release of a model protein, bovine serum albumin, from porous elastomer matrices.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Diacrylated prepolymers were successfully prepared with molecular weights from 2,000 Da to 12,000 Da.  Elastomers were prepared from these prepolymers and characterised using NMR, DSC, ATR-FTIR, sol content and tensile testing. As hypothesized, crosslinking PEC slowed its degradation rate signifficantly compared to 60 kDa linear PEC (37 ± 4% mass loss in 12 weeks as compared to 78 ± 11% in 3 weeks). This result suggested that PEC degradation properties can be tuned for a range of tissue engineering or drug delivery applications.  For both linear and elastomeric PEC, a typical foreign body reaction was observed.  The degradation mechanism observed for the elastomer was the same as that for linear PEC and was consistent with the literature: cell-mediated surface erosion, which is demonstrated by linear mass loss, SEM observations, and pitted surface features. &#xD;
&#xD;
The in vitro release of BSA-loaded porous formulations was rapid and/or incomplete.  The most promising formulation (12% BSA) produced a more prolonged release of two weeks than the other formulations tested, however the total fraction of BSA released was only 23%.  The formulation parameter that most significantly affected the release of BSA was the amount of DMSO used to vortex BSA particles.  These findings provide insight into the potential and limitations of PEC elastomers in protein delivery applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We examine the globular cluster system (GCS) of the isolated elliptical NGC 720 using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) and have obtained spectra for 241 candidate globular clusters (GCs) extending to a galactocentric radius of 40 kpc. Of the 241 candidates, 120 are confirmed GCs, where 46 are members of the metal-poor, blue, population and 74 are members of the metal-rich, red, population. A (g-i)=0.50 colour split is used to identify the blue and red populations. We measure the full GCS to have a rotational velocity (Vrot) of 50 +/- 7 km/s with a position angle (PA) of 170 +/- 69 degrees. The red population has a Vrot = 97 +/- 14 km/s with PA = 147 +\- 18 degrees and the blue population has a Vrot = 79 +/- 7 km/s with PA = 89 +/- 18 degrees. The full GCS has an average velocity dispersion of 168 +/- 22 km/s, for&#xD;
the red population is 156 +/- 30 km/s and for the blue population is 181 +/- 33 km/s.&#xD;
The velocity dispersion pro file for all populations is constant with increasing radius, suggesting the presence of a dark matter halo. Using a tracer mass estimator, we have measured the mass out to 40 kpc as 1.8(+0.6/-0.1)x10^12 Msun  for a potential which traces the dark matter pro file. We also estimate the M/L_V = 30 - 70.

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis advances our understanding of how ideas play a role in policy making by examining the processes and conditions that facilitate their international diffusion into domestic debates, their acceptance by policy actors, and the ways in which their acceptance alters policy processes and policy itself. Specifically, the thesis studies the impact of labour market policy ideas from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its large-scale study on unemployment, the Jobs Study, in three OECD member states: Canada, Denmark and Sweden. This thesis shows that ideas play a number of roles: sometimes they are simply employed to help legitimize pre-determined policy positions; but sometimes a process of learning takes place, and new ideas change actors’ beliefs about what is and what ought to be, and as well their conception of their own interests and goals. Consistent with previous research, policy failure and uncertainty open actors up to the policy learning process and acceptance of new ideas. More than earlier studies, however, this thesis highlights the role of pre-existing beliefs. Accepting one new idea over another is largely determined by the values and beliefs actors bring to bear when judging new ideas; and thus, the cases show a pattern of acceptance for OECD ideas that largely follows along professional boundaries and/or ideological leanings. Moreover, pre-existing beliefs that are intertwined with an actor’s identity tend to be more resistant to change. As other ideational scholars argue, a change in individuals’ beliefs can alter both  the policy process and policy itself. When acceptance of an idea is widespread, problems of collective action can be overcome. When beliefs are not as widely shared, their impact on policy depends on many factors. Fragmentation of power and accountability can create “veto players,” and previous policies can create constituencies of supporters, some of whom may resist change. However, during a policy paradigm change, a shift in authority over policy can alter the political landscape and whose ideas matter. Given all these variables, the impact that a belief in new ideas can have on policy is highly mediated, and policy reforms, therefore, may not resemble the ideas which triggered the acceptance of change in the first place.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>SuperCDMS is the next generation of the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search experiment (CDMS), aimed at the detection of the Weakly Interacting dark matter Particles (WIMPs) with the use of phonon and ionization signals in germanium detectors operated at about 40 mK. The current experiment is operating in the Soudan underground laboratory in northern Minnesota. However, due to limitation of cosmic ray muons, in the next stage of SuperCDMS, the whole experiment will be moved to a deeper site at SNOLAB. This could reduce the influence of extraterrestrial high energy particles to a negligible level, leaving the natural radioactivity locally existing in the laboratory wall rock as the dominating background source. Along with this relocation, newly designed detectors will be implemented to further increase the sensitivity. The prototype of this kind of detector has been manufactured, but it needs to be carefully tested prior to its formal application. To thoroughly examine its performance, especially in an environment that is less affected by cosmic rays, a new detector testing facility is to be built underground at SNOLAB (STF) surrounded by a water tank serving as the passive shield against the natural radioactivity. A series of Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to investigate the effectiveness of the water tank shield, the background level and also the energy spectra of events in the detectors. The goal of 1 neutron/day and 1 Hz of gammas for external sources can be achieved.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation deals with smooth feedback stabilization of control-affine systems via Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC). The IDA-PBC methodology is a feedback control design technique that aims to establish or manipulate a port-Hamiltonian structure of the closed-loop system.&#xD;
For a mechanical control system, a port-Hamiltonian system is a natural description of the dynamics, and several effective controller designs have been presented for this class of systems. In other fields of engineering, the development of such controller design is an active area of research. In particular, applications of IDA-PBC techniques prove to be difficult in practice for process control applications where the concept of energy is usually ill-defined.&#xD;
This thesis seeks to extend the application of the IDA-PBC methodology beyond mechanical control systems. This is achieved by following three directions of research.&#xD;
First, we establish conditions under which a port-Hamiltonian system can be written as a feedback interconnection of two port-Hamiltonian system. We identify such an interconnection structure for linear control systems based on their intrinsic properties.&#xD;
Second, as observed in application of IDA-PBC to non-mechanical systems, several additional assumptions on the structure of the desired port-Hamiltonian system can effectively reduce the complexity of the matching problem. We establish a unified approach that considers these additional assumptions. Third, we connect the matching problem to the classical feedback equivalence approach. We show that feedback equivalence between control-affine systems can be employed to construct some feasible interconnection and damping structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) circulate in the blood as a non-covalent complex.  VWF plays an important role in primary hemostasis through its interactions with components of the extracellular matrix and platelet glycoproteins, as well as through its stabilization of FVIII.  FVIII plays a crucial role in the intrinsic coagulation cascade and in the propagation of coagulation.  The significant role of these two proteins in hemostasis is established, whereas little is known about the thrombotic effect of quantitative and qualitative variability in these proteins, particularly in the development of arteriolar thrombosis.  Therefore, we established a ferric chloride induced arteriolar thrombosis injury model to evaluate the thrombotic effect associated with elevated FVIII levels and with gain of function mutations in VWF.   &#xD;
The thrombotic effect of acute and extended elevations of FVIII level were evaluated using complementary in vitro and in vivo assays of thrombogenicity.  Acute elevations in FVIII levels were associated with non-linear increase in thrombogenic potential as measured by our ferric chloride induced injury model.  In addition, the elevation of FVIII levels for an extended time period did not further enhance the thrombogenic potential associated with elevated FVIII levels. &#xD;
Type 2B von Willebrand disease (2B VWD) is a bleeding disorder that arises as a result  of gain of function mutations, leading to the enhanced affinity of the mutant protein for platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα).  We created transient transgenic mouse models of 2B VWD and were able to reproduce the 2B VWD phenotype in mice.  The circulating 2B VWF did not act as a prothrombotic stimulus: there was little or no thrombus formation after vascular injury and a marked failure of platelet accumulation at the sites of endothelial damage. &#xD;
Finally, modified transient transgenic models of type 2B VWD were created, in which the circulating VWF shows enhanced binding affinity for GPIbα and resistance to ADAMTS13 mediated proteolysis. This protein was hypothesized to act in as a prothrombotic stimulus, but instead it inhibited thrombogenicity; there was no vessel occlusion following vascular damage and platelet accumulation was similar to that seen in the injured arterioles of VWF-/- mice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Performance regression refers to the phenomena where the application performance degrades compared to prior releases. Performance regressions are unwanted side-effects caused by changes to application or its execution environment. Previous research shows that most problems experienced by customers in the field are related to application performance. To reduce the likelihood of performance regressions slipping into production, software vendors must verify the performance of an application before its release. The current practice of performance verification is carried out only at the implementation level through performance tests. In a performance test, service requests with intensity similar to the production environment are pushed to the applications under test; various performance counters (e.g., CPU utilization) are recorded. Analysis of the results of performance verification is both time-consuming and error-prone due to the large volume of collected data, the absence of formal objectives and the subjectivity of performance analysts. Furthermore, since performance verification is done just before release, evaluation of high impact design changes is delayed until the end of the development lifecycle. In this thesis, we seek to improve the effectiveness of performance verification. First, we propose an approach to construct layered simulation models to support performance verification at the design level. Performance analysts can leverage our layered simulation models to evaluate the impact of a proposed design change before any development effort is committed. Second, we present an automated approach to detect performance regressions from results of performance tests conducted on the implementation of an application. Our approach compares the results of new tests against counter correlations extracted from performance testing repositories. Finally, we refine our automated analysis approach with ensemble-learning algorithms to evaluate performance tests conducted in heterogeneous software and hardware environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this work is to develop mathematical models for predicting the thermal stability of commercial diagnostic assays. These assays are a product of the Point of Care division of Abbott laboratories, and are used for analyzing patient blood samples for specific substances. The accuracy of the results from these diagnostic tests relies on the activity of specific biological and/or chemical components of the sensors. Mathematical models that describe the stability of these active components are useful for supporting product shelf-life claims and for the design and implementation of accelerated testing protocols. In the thesis, the stability of two diagnostic assay systems of interest to Abbott Point of Care is investigated using mathematical modeling. For the first assay system investigated, the biosensor associated with the assay is identified as an important factor for product stability. A second-order dynamic model is developed to describe the thermal stability of this biosensor. The model corresponds to a reversible reaction followed by an irreversible reaction, with rate coefficients having Arrhenius temperature dependencies. The second-order dynamic model provides improved predictions relative to a first-order dynamic model, based on a comparison between model fits for two experimental datasets, and a comparison of predictive ability for a validation dataset. The second-order dynamic model is used to extend the concept of Mean Kinetic Temperature concept from the pharmaceutical industry to systems with higher-order dynamics. For the second assay system investigated, the calibration fluid is identified as a key factor in assay stability. A first-order model is developed to describe the stability of the analyte within the calibration fluid. The first-order model captures most of the trend present in the data from calibration fluid incubation experiments. Finally, model predictions are used to investigate the amount of change in assay response that can be attributed to changes in concentration of analyte in the calibration fluid (after storage at elevated temperatures). The results show that the changes observed in assay responses are consistent with the magnitude of changes in calibrant analyte concentrations predicted by the model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Acute brain cell swelling (cytotoxic edema) can occur in the first minutes of stroke, presumably as a result of brain cells taking up water. In extreme hypo-osmotic situations such as excessive water-loading by patients, uptake by brain cells can expand the brain, causing seizures. But is ischemic brain cell swelling the same as hypo-osmotic swelling?&#xD;
Water can passively diffuse across the plasma membrane. However the presence of water channels termed aquaporins (AQP) facilitates passive water diffusion by 10-100 times. Unlike astrocytes, there is no evidence of water channels on neuronal plasma membrane. However, there is still much debate about which cells (neurons or astrocytes) swell during over-hydration or during stroke and if neurons and astrocytes can volume-regulate during osmotic stress. &#xD;
The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the volume responses of PyNs and magnocellular neuroendocrine cells (MNCs) to acute osmotic challenge and to OGD. We examined MNCs because they are intrinsically osmosensitive to small changes (2-3 mOsm) of plasma osmolality. We also examined if the same neurons behave similarly in brain slices or  when dissociated and if they respond differently to acute osmotic stress and stroke-like stress. &#xD;
Our results indicate that during acute osmotic stress (±40 mOsm) half of dissociated PyNs and MNCs tended to show appropriate responses. MNCs  in brain   slices showed similar responses to when they  were dissociated, while brain slice PyNs were less responsive than when dissociated. Exposure to OGD resulted in obvious differences between the two types of in vitro preparations. Dissociated PyNs and MNCs showed no consistency in their volume responses to 10 minutes of OGD. Dissociated neurons swelled, shrunk or were unchanged in about equal numbers. In contrast, brain slice PyNs underwent profound swelling whereas, brain slice MNCs showed minor volume decreases. &#xD;
We conclude that about half of our dissociated neurons were too variable and unpredictable in their osmotic volume responses to be useful for osmotic studies. They also were too resistant to stroke-like stress to be good models for ischemia. Brain slice neurons were similar in their osmotic responses to dissociated neurons but proved to have consistent and predictable responses to stroke-like stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The field of food intake and satiety has received increasing interest from the research community in recent years. The mechanisms and factors that regulate satiety gains their importance from the crucial role they play in food consumption and consequently control of body weight. &#xD;
Leukotrienes are mediators that are released in inflammatory conditions. One of the receptors on which Leukotrienes perform their actions is Cysteinyl Leukotriene Receptor Type 2 (CysLT2Rs). Recently, our colleagues made the observation that CysLT2Rs are expressed in vagal afferent neurons. In addition, CysLT2R-/- mice appeared to be heavier than WT (Moos and Funk, unpublished observations). Based on these findings, I hypothesized that CysLT2Rs play a role in regulating food intake via vagal afferent activity. In-vivo studies were performed to characterize body weight gain and investigate whether weight gain was associated with increased food intake. I found that CysLT2R-/- mice not only have significantly higher body weight, but also eat significantly more than CysLT2R+/+ mice. Using calcium imaging techniques, I demonstrated that LTD4 and LTC4 increased calcium Ca2+ influx in nodose ganglion neuron. Moreover, the level of neuronal activation in the brainstem (NTS area) was measured in both groups of mice using immunohistochemical techniques, which suggested less postprandial neuronal activity in KO mice.&#xD;
These data suggest that CysLT2Rs take part in regulating body weight and food intake. In addition these results implicate vagal afferents as a possible pathway.  These findings may have implications for the control of food intake in both health and disease and may lead to novel insights in the causes and treatment of disordered weight such as overweight and obesity, or even anorexia.</dcterms:abstract>
