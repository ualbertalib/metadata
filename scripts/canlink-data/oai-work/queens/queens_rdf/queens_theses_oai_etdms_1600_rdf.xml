      <dcterms:abstract>Background: In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified shift-work involving circadian disruption as a “probable carcinogen.” One proposed pathway for this relationship involves nighttime light exposure and subsequent decreases in melatonin production. It is postulated that melatonin, a cancer-protective hormone, may influence patterns of sex hormone production that in turn influence breast cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between night shift-work history, melatonin and sex hormone levels among shift-working women. &#xD;
Methods: 82 pre-menopausal nurses who work a rotating shift pattern of two days (7AM-7PM), two nights (7PM-7AM), followed by five days off participated in two study periods approximately six months apart (in summer and winter), each taking place during a day shift of the normal rotating shift pattern. Creatinine-adjusted melatonin metabolite concentrations were measured from morning void urine samples, and estradiol, estrone, progesterone and prolactin concentrations were measured from fasting blood samples taken at the same time. Other pertinent information was collected by measurement (weight, height) and by self-report via questionnaire. We examined melatonin-sex hormone relationships within each of two seasons, and across seasons, to investigate two hypothesized latency periods for influences of melatonin levels on sex hormones. Multivariate linear regression was used to explore relationships, with adjustment for confounders including age and body mass index. &#xD;
Results: An inverse relationship between melatonin and estradiol was suggested in winter (β = -0.13, p = 0.11), and a positive relationship was suggested for increasing estrone with increasing melatonin tertile in summer (p = 0.07), after multivariate adjustments. Melatonin was not associated with other hormones in either season. On investigation of a longer latency period, melatonin in the first season was not associated with sex hormones in the second season. While those working night shifts for 20 years or more had higher mean levels of estradiol, estrone and progesterone, results were not statistically different from those with a shorter history of night work. &#xD;
Conclusions: The results of this study do not provide evidence to support the proposed biological pathway involving altered melatonin and sex hormone levels as intermediates between shift-work and breast cancer risk.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hydrated sodium-magnesium sulfate minerals are common in many continental evaporite settings around the world. The crystallization sequence of these minerals depends on such parameters as the composition of the parent brine, the temperature, the evaporation rate of the brine, and the differences in the atomic structure and water content of the minerals. The atomic structures of konyaite [Na2Mg(SO4)2·5H2O] and sodium-magnesium decahydrate [Na2Mg(SO4)2·10H2O], a newly described sulfate salt, have been determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The refined structures are discussed and compared to that of blödite [Na2Mg(SO4)2·4H2O]. The arrangement and importance of hydrogen bonds within all three structures are also discussed, and have been further investigated by infrared spectroscopy. Löweite [Na12Mg7(SO4)13·15H2O] was included in this experiment to provide a low-hydration end-member. Differences in water content and the importance of hydrogen bonds in the respective structures were clearly reflected in the generated infrared spectra. The growth conditions of the decahydrate, konyaite, blödite, löweite, and other phases of the Na2O-MgO-H2O system, as well as their stability relationships, were studied in a temperature-controlled crystal-growth experiment. Konyaite and the decahydrate phase were found as first precipitates over a range of temperatures and brine compositions where they are not considered to be the thermodynamically stable phase. The importance of evaporation rate in the formation of these, and other metastable phases, is discussed in relation to inland saline systems. Possible localities where the decahydrate could exist in nature are discussed, and challenges for future research are presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The side-on dioxygen adducts of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) containing rhodium complexes, [ClRh(IPr)2(O2)] and [ClRh(IMes)2(O2)], previously synthesized in our laboratories possess a square planar geometry and O-O bond lengths of 1.323(3) and 1.341(4) Å, respectively.  Both of these attributes are uncharacteristic of Rh(O2) complexes, which are typically octahedral and possess O-O bond lengths of approximately 1.45 Å.  Full characterization by NMR, IR, Raman, DFT and XAS confirmed the short O-O bond lengths of these structures and revealed that they were rhodium(I) coordination complexes of singlet oxygen with no net oxidation/reduction process having taken place. The unique bonding mode appears to result from the interaction of a filled Rh d orbital with one of the two degenerate O2 * orbitals, which causes splitting of the O2 * orbitals, favoring spin pairing in the O2 HOMO, and the inability of Rh to donate electron density to the empty * orbital. Initial investigations of these complexes as catalysts for the reduction and oxidation of C-O bonds, as well as singlet oxygen generation were also undertaken. Rh(IPr)2 coordination complexes of N2, H2 and CO were also synthesized and characterized by X-ray crystallography, NMR and elemental analysis. Interestingly, the addition of hydrogen gas to rhodium did result in oxidation of the metal.&#xD;
A Rh(NHC) complex featuring an anionic acetate ligand, [(AcO)Rh(IPr)(CO)2], was synthesized and characterized by NMR, IR and X-ray crystallography.  This complex proved to be an effective catalyst for the regioselective hydroformylation of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes, which occurred without isomerization of the alkene. Initial rates of hydroformylation with our catalyst were compared to the chloride analogue, [ClRh(IPr)(CO)2], and demonstrated the beneficial nature of replacing the halide with a carboxylate ligand, which is less inhibiting of the reaction.&#xD;
The synthesis of a bifunctional hydrogenation catalyst featuring a protic-NHC was attempted by addition of benzimidazoles to [Cl2Ru(diphosphine)].  Although these attempts were unsuccessful, a large number of complexes of the formula [Cl2Ru(diphosphine)(-N3-benzimidazole)2] were synthesized and proved to be effective catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation of ketones versus alkenes.  Use of chiral diphosphines and 1-triphenylmethylbenzimidazole yielded catalysts capable of producing secondary alcohols with moderate enantioselectivity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We have compiled a large sample of 3041 spiral galaxies with multi-band $gri$ photometry from the the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 archive. We compare our own extracted photometry with data products provided through the SDSS pipeline algorithms. This comparison benefits from an extensive compilation of galaxy rotational velocities, $V$, derived from HI linewidths. Galaxy sizes and luminosities can thus be compared against an unbiased and independent metric. We find the SDSS radial ($R$), and luminous, ($L$), data products to be unreliable for the construction of tight scaling relations of $R$ and $L$ with velocity ($V$). We use our own robust scaling parameters to yield the tightest $VRL$ relations possible. We further compile the largest scaling relation of galaxy baryonic mass (stars + gas) with velocity to find that the relation is not tighter, and thus no more significant, than the luminous $VL$ relation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Manufactured nanoparticles (NPs) are a class of small ( ≤ 100 nm) materials that are being used for a variety of purposes, including industrial lubricants, food additives, antibacterial agents, as well as delivery systems for drug and gene therapies.  Their unique characteristics due to their small size as well as their parent materials allow them to be exploited in convenience applications; however, some of these properties also allow them to interact with and invade biological systems.  Few studies have been performed to determine the potential harm that NPs can inflict on reproductive and developmental processes in organisms.  In this study, Drosophila melanogaster and CD-1 mice were orally exposed to varying doses of titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs, silver (Ag) NPs, or hydroxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNTs) and Drosophila were also exposed to microparticles (MPs) as a control for particle size.  The subsequent effect of these materials on reproduction and development were evaluated.  Strikingly, each type of NP studied negatively affected either reproduction or development in one or both of the two model systems.  TiO2 NPs significantly negative effected both CD-1 mouse development (100 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg) as well as Drosophila female fecundity (0.005%-0.5% w/v).  Ag NPs significantly reduced mouse fetus viability after prenatal exposure to10 mg/kg.  Ag NPs also significantly decreased the developmental success of Drosophila when they were directly exposed to these NPs (0.05% - 0.5% w/v) compared to both the vehicle and MP controls.  fCNTs significantly increased the presence of morphological defects, resorptions and skeletal abnormalities in CD-1 mice, but had little effect on Drosophila.  We speculate that the differences seen in the effects of NP types may be partially due to differences in reproductive physiology as well as each organism’s ability to internalize these NPs.  Whereas the differing response of each organism to a NP type was likely  due in part to varying durations of exposure.  Since NPs are a popular commodity in today’s consumer world, the research presented here accentuates the need for further studies on the detrimental effects that these particles may have on a variety of developing organisms and on female reproductive health.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The following thesis is concerned with the contemporary debate in the philosophy of mind surrounding the nature of phenomenal consciousness (viz. subjective experience, or qualia).  My primary aim is to adjudicate the ongoing dialectic between dualists and physicalists regarding the ontological status of phenomenal consciousness — physical or nonphysical — by examining the two major arguments most commonly deployed against physicalism: namely, the zombie argument (Chalmers), and the knowledge argument (Jackson).  I conclude by showing that once physicalism has been shorn of the various doctrines that it need not and ought not accept — that is, once we are clear about what, precisely, the fundamental doctrine of physicalism actually is — it becomes clear that these arguments do not go through, and that the case for dualism has not been made.  I also argue that the task of actually disarming these arguments (in the right way) is potentially critically instructive to contemporary physicalists, as this helps to nourish a clearer overall understanding of what physicalism (properly understood) is, and is not, committed to.&#xD;
	In Chapter One I lay the groundwork for the aforementioned anti-physicalist arguments by explaining precisely what is meant by the phrase “phenomenal consciousness” and its various synonyms.  I then briefly summarize the mind-body problem and articulate the so-called “explanatory gap” therein.  Chapter Two looks at the zombie argument (as articulated by David Chalmers, 1996) and finds that the argument itself, as stated, actually has very little to do with defending dualism against physicalism, but rather is ultimately an argument for epiphenomenalism — which, I argue, is untenable.  Chapter Three examines Frank Jackson’s knowledge argument against physicalism (1982).  Here I show why the argument itself fails to support property dualism, but also why the standard physicalist objections to it fail.  I argue that Mary does indeed learn facts about the world upon her release, and that physicalists must face up to this squarely.  I then suggest that physicalism (properly understood) is entirely compatible with this admission.  Chapter Four examines a kind of rehabilitated version of the zombie argument in the context of a larger discussion about the relation between conceivability and possibility.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The field of eyewitness memory has long been concerned with identifications but functioned in the absence of an explanatory theory. Recently Charman and Wells (2007) developed applied lineup theory to address this deficiency. They argue that quality of memory and the decision process interact to determine lineup decision accuracy. In a series of experiments I tested whether their theoretical assumptions hold for face recognition tasks and tested the theory using simple manipulations with lineups. Experiments 1 through 7 utilized a face recognition paradigm. In Experiments 1 through 5, the relationship between quality of memory and face recognition accuracy was explored as a function of frequency of viewing, duration of viewing, and depth of processing. The results indicated that, as expected, increased frequency of viewing and deeper processing of faces at encoding led to better recognition memory. Unexpectedly, increasing the duration of viewing did not increase recognition memory. In the remaining experiments (Experiments 6 to 9) I manipulated the decision process by manipulating the match between a face image shown at encoding and retrieval and how quickly participants were able to respond. The results of Experiments 6 and 7 only weakly supported applied lineup theory. In Experiments 8 and 9 I used a lineup paradigm and again found little support for applied lineup theory. Notably, the manipulations of decision process were relatively unsuccessful in Experiments 6 to 9. The stimulus manipulations used may not have been sufficient to produce differences in the decision process or applied lineup theory may not account for lineup decisions. Suggestions for future research on lineup decision processes to clarify whether applied lineup theory can account for lineup decisions are made.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Educational research on students with mild and moderate hearing loss (MMHL), who represent up to 15% of the student population in regular classrooms, provides neither consistent nor meaningful attention to their learning and social-emotional experiences in school contexts. The purpose of this research is to investigate the perspectives of students with MMHL to gain insight into how they, as learners, conceptualize and manage their hearing loss at school and to develop recommendations for researchers and educators. Reviewed literature includes both quantitative and qualitative research which relies heavily on teachers’ and parents’ perspectives and achievement scores over student perspectives. Literature also indicates that there are discrepancies in student reporting depending on methods of data collection. Three students with MMHL were asked directly during in-depth interviews to describe their experiences in educational contexts. Self Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985) provides an analytical and organizing framework for social-emotional elements of these learners’ experiences based on three psychological needs: relatedness, competence, and autonomy. In addition to SDT, a discussion of disability identity development research (e.g., Gill, 1997) provides a supplementary conceptual tool to expand the latent meanings of these experiences and socially constructed elements that students with hearing loss negotiate. Findings provide descriptive accounts of participants’ lived experiences with MMHL in educational contexts. Emergent patterns and themes identify broadly defined yet coherent messages highlighting the importance that educators (a) understand the lived experience of students with MMHL, (b) recognize the inherent contradictions that can accompany this disability, and (c) attend to needs, to communication, learning, and social-emotional needs. Each case indicates that student needs are met inconsistently resulting in adverse consequences for self-determined learning and social-emotional well-being. It is recommended that classroom teachers proactively facilitate potential learning outcomes for students with MMHL by attending to not only academic and communication needs, but to social-emotional needs as well. Researchers in education must further investigate the population of students with MMHL to assess their strengths and to ascertain the type of supports and interventions from which they could benefit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  Farming is an hazardous occupation.  The underlying determinants of farm injury are not well understood among adolescent populations, particularly from a gender lens.   &#xD;
Objectives:  (1)  To evaluate the association between gender and occupational health and safety practices reported for hazardous work among working adolescent farm children; and, (2) to evaluate the association between use of such practices and time to farm injury, and also whether such associations vary by gender.&#xD;
Methods:  Survey data from an existing farm injury cohort were available for analysis.  Occupational health and safety practices were:  non-use of personal protective equipment, non-use of training and supervision for work with heavy equipment, non-use of training and supervision for work with large animals, and conduct of hazardous tasks.  Logistic regression was used to examine associations between gender and use of safety practices, and Cox regression was used to examine relationships between occupational health and safety practices and time to first injury.&#xD;
Results:  Girls reported increased odds for the non-use of personal protective equipment (adjusted OR 2.39 [95% CI: 1.16, 4.94]). There was no evidence of an association between gender and the conduct of hazardous tasks (adjusted OR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.28, 1.73]). Gender patterns surrounding non-use of training and supervision for work with equipment (adjusted OR 2.38 [95% CI: 0.53, 10.66]) and with animals (adjusted OR 1.52 [95% CI: 0.75, 3.06]) were not significant.  Use of personal protective equipment (adjusted HR 1.25 [95% CI: 0.76, 2.06]) did not significantly reduce the risk of farm injury, neither did use of training and supervision during equipment work (HR 1.25 [95% CI: 0.69, 2.28]), nor during animal work (HR 1.06 [95% CI: 0.59, 1.92]), or the conduct of hazardous tasks (HR 1.04 [95% CI: 0.67, 1.63]).  Further, there was no significant modification of these associations and injury by gender.&#xD;
Conclusions:  Among adolescents, farm occupational health and safety practices appear to vary by gender.  Girls on farms report fewer exposures to hazards, and receive less training and supervision and less use of personal protective equipment, consistent with assigned tasks.  While gender appears to play a role in the assignment of farm tasks and occupational health and safety practices, these practices did not reduce the likelihood of subsequent injury.  As well, the latter associations did not appear to vary by gender.  A public health approach that recognizes gender as a determinant of hazardous farm exposures and associated occupational health and safety practices is needed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the Karnali valley of west Nepal, detailed mapping, thermobarometry, quartz-petrofabrics, vorticity analysis, and thermochronology delineate three tectonometamorphic domains separated by structural and metamorphic discontinuities. The lowest domain, the Lesser Himalayan sequence, is weakly metamorphosed and preserves evidence of primary sedimentary features and a polydeformational history. The Greater Himalayan sequence (GHS) is pervasively sheared and metamorphosed and overlies the Lesser Himalayan sequence along the Main Central thrust. The Greater Himalayan sequence is sub-divided into two tectonometamorphic domains that display contrasting metamorphic histories. The lower portion of the Greater Himalayan sequence contains garnet- to kyanite-grade rocks whose peak metamorphic assemblages developed during top-to-the-south directed shear and a metamorphic pressure gradient that increases up structural section. The upper portion of the Greater Himalayan sequence contains kyanite and sillimanite-grade migmatites that preserve polymetamorphic assemblages and a metamorphic pressure gradient that decreases up structural section. The upper and lower portions of the Greater Himalayan sequence are separated by a metamorphic discontinuity that roughly coincides with the bottom of the lowest migmatite unit. Vorticity estimates indicate roughly equal contributions of pure and simple shear during deformation of the upper and lower portions of the GHS. Quartz petrofabrics suggest deformation temperatures are equivalent to peak metamorphic temperatures in the lower Greater Himalayan sequence. These observations are consistent with channel flow tectonic models whereby the upper portion of the Greater Himalayan sequence is ductily extruded to the south while ductily accreting the subjacent lower portion of the Greater Himalayan sequence across a metamorphic discontinuity. 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology indicates Miocene homogeneous cooling of the Greater Himalayan sequence. Cooling rates of the GHS and the homogeneous cooling profile suggest east-west extensional exhumation followed peak-metamorphism and south-directed shearing and supports the hypothesis of the southeast propagation of the Gurla-Mandhata-Humla fault system into the Karnali valley.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prosocial behaviours are a diverse group of actions that are integral to human social life. In this dissertation I propose and test a three-factor model of prosocial behaviour. Specifically, in a series of four studies I examined the ability of infants and toddlers to engage in helping, sharing, and comforting behaviour.  Additionally, I examine the consistency with which children produce these behaviours longitudinally over time and the associations between these three subtypes of prosocial behaviour and social cognitive perspective taking, effortful control, affective perspective taking, and temperament.&#xD;
In Study 1, I found that 18-month-old infants were able to engage in helping and sharing, but not comforting behaviour. In Study 2, I found that between 18 and 30 months, there was no individual consistency in the production of prosocial behaviours, either across types (helping, sharing) or times (18, 24, or 30 months). Moreover, I found that even at 30 months of age, young children were not recognizing and responding to the emotional needs of others. In Study 3, I examined the relation between helping and sharing and three measures of social cognitive perspective taking and general cognitive development. I found unique relations between the behavioural correlates and the measures of prosocial behaviour. Specifically, I found that sharing was associated with imitation and that helping was associated with general cognitive development. &#xD;
Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that helping was the most frequent prosocial behaviour that the children engaged in, and it did not increase over time. I also observed a significant developmental increase in comforting behaviour from 2 to 3 years. Additionally, I found low rates of sharing behaviour that were stable over time. Importantly, I observed consistency in the production of prosocial behaviour within each subtype and defined a three-factor structure that differentiated between the helping, sharing, and comforting tasks. Further, I observed a significant association between effortful control and comforting behaviour, but no other significant associations between any of the subtypes of prosocial behaviour and the behavioural correlates (effortful control, affective perspective taking, and temperament). The implications for the construct of prosocial behaviour and the presence of a “prosocial disposition” are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Philosophers have considered and debated the topic of wisdom for centuries.  Now, as we face an ageing world population, a need for the scientific exploration of the topic has arisen. Over the past 30 years, the challenge to understand and define wisdom has been taken up and studied mainly by the fields of psychology and sociology. A body of wisdom literature has emerged and this thesis addresses an identified gap in that literature concerning the development of wisdom.   &#xD;
 This thesis examines the process of acquiring wisdom across the human lifespan. Specifically, this qualitative exploratory case study examines the process employed by wise nominees when transforming a personal life experience into a life lesson. The opinions, experiences, and relationship descriptions of their nominators are uniquely included in the study’s findings. Each of the four cases in the study is comprised of a dyad, a nominator and their wise nominee. Data were collected from the study participants through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.&#xD;
A framework, comprised of three components, that begins to describe the wisdom acquisition process emerged from the study’s findings. The first element of the emerging wisdom acquisition framework is a new succinct definition of wisdom. The second element is a model that describes the iterative process of learning from life experiences. This model was hypothesized at the outset of the study and obtained some corroboration from the study’s data. The third element of the emerging framework is the life management practices that wise individuals employ to deal with life experiences. These practices emerged as four central themes from the data. Three of those four life practices revolve around self-reliance whereas the fourth theme addresses the spiritual balance in the participants’ lives. &#xD;
	This study is a first attempt to unravel the complex phenomenon of the acquisition of wisdom.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Benzene is an environmental pollutant and a known human leukemogen. It is also suspected to be associated with in utero-initiated leukemia. However, the mechanisms of benzene-mediated toxicity and carcinogenicity in both adults and fetuses are not well understood. Two main research hypotheses were tested in this thesis work. The first was that exposure to the benzene metabolite, benzoquinone, leads to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage in cultured mouse fetal liver cells, and that epigenetic changes in CD-1 mouse fetal livers would result from in vivo exposure to benzene. The second was that exposure to the phytochemical, sulforaphane (SFN), would induce detoxification enzymes in CD-1 mouse fetal livers in vitro and in vivo, and that this would confer protection against benzene-induced cellular damage. Our data demonstrated that exposure to benzoquinone increased ROS levels, increased DNA damage, and altered DNA repair gene expression in cultured CD-1 mouse fetal liver cells. Additionally, although we found that SFN induced various metabolizing enzymes involved in the detoxification of benzene metabolites, SFN did not protect against the deleterious effects of benzene found in this study. In a separate study, we examined whether SFN could induce fetal and/or maternal enzymes involved in benzene detoxification in vivo in CD-1 mice and how this compared to non-pregnant CD-1 mice. While we found that chronic SFN exposure induced both gene expression and activity of liver detoxification enzymes of both pregnant and non-pregnant mice, SFN had no effect on expression levels or activity of these genes in fetal livers exposed in utero. Lastly, we investigated the effect of benzene exposure on DNA methylation and histone modifications in vivo. Benzene exposure decreased global DNA methylation in maternal bone marrow only, having no effect on any other epigenetic modifications measured in these studies. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis only partially supported our hypotheses; nevertheless, they provide valuable information for future research directions pertaining to benzene-associated transplacental carcinogenesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Entry into elementary school marks the beginning of a crucial shift in the amount and quality of time that children spend with their peers (Coie &amp; Dodge, 1988). For many 5-year olds, kindergarten provides the opportunity to encounter their first stable peer group. It is in the context of these interactions that children practice essential social skills, as well as develop a capacity to interact with others. For various reasons, however, many children have difficulty gaining acceptance into fundamental peer groups. For these children, the opportunities for peer interactions present in the early school years are limited and often characterized by a high degree of aggressive affect (Coie &amp; Dodge, 1988). Although previous research has reliably identified the individual affective states characteristic of rejected children during a typical peer interaction (Newcomb, Bukowski, &amp; Pattee, 1993), it should be kept in mind that these expressions are embedded within a larger peer context, which plays an important role in how these dynamic processes unfold in real time (O’Connell, Pepler, &amp; Craig, 1999). The purpose of the present study was to explore the application of a dynamic systems (DS) technique, state space grids (SSG), to the study of kindergarten peer processes and their impact on long-term psychopathology. Participants were 267 kindergarten children from a single school serving a predominantly low socioeconomic neighbourhood. In order to examine the social dynamics of interacting triads, moment-to-moment changes in affect were documented. Parent and teacher ratings of child conduct problems were also obtained at four measurement points. Consistent with previous research, both controversial and rejected children were more likely to express aggressive affect. Differential effects across sociometric groups were also replicated for both externalizing and internalizing ratings, where rejected children were found to have significantly higher scores. Extending upon past research, the expression of particular triadic affective states were found to differ significantly across sociometric groups. Furthermore, specific triadic affective states were found to be related to the developmental trajectories of clinical outcomes. Overall, results of the present study extend previous findings on the expression of individual affective states through the application of DS principles and methodology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The representation of ourselves and our environment is based on the combination of information from multiple sensory systems. Each sensory modality is represented within a different frame of reference, in other words each sensory system uses a different code to represent the same properties of the environment (ex. visual stimuli in an eye-centered frame of reference; hand position would be shoulder-centered). Combing this information into a singular coordinate frame is complex. For instance, the eye and shoulder have different centers of rotation, therefore any changes in eye position or body posture will affect the relationship between them. What is still unknown is how the brain integrates these different sources of information into an internal representation, and what effect extra-retinal signals can have on this process. This thesis was designed to investigate the effect of head roll on action and perception. In Experiment 1, we wanted to determine how the integration of vision and proprioception for action was affected by changes in head roll. To investigate this question subjects performed a reaching task at three different head roll positions, where they would experience conflicts between their viewed and actual hand position. In Experiment 2, we examined the influence of head roll on sensory perception. To explore this idea subjects performed a task where they needed to judge the position of their unseen index fingertip relative to a visual target. Our findings reveal that eccentric head roll conditions influence both action and perception – revealed by an increase in movement variability and a decreased ability to discriminate the position of the unseen fingertip relative to visual targets. In summary, we have discovered that introducing eccentric head roll positions affects the perception of ourselves within the environment and the way that we integrate sensory information.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Densification behaviour and mechanical properties (hardness, fracture toughness and flexural strength) of the SiC-TiC composite system were studied. Pressureless sintering experiments were conducted on samples containing 0 to 30 vol % TiC created through an in-situ reaction between TiO2 and C: TiO2 + 3C -&gt; TiC + 2CO.  Sintering of the compacts was carried out in the presence of Al2O3 and Y2O3 sintering additives which promoted densification at sintering temperatures ranging from 1825 to 1925°C. It was determined that the presence of synthesized TiC particles served to effectively toughen the composite through crack deflection, impedance and bridging. An increase in fracture strength and hardness was also observed. Densities in excess of 98 % theoretical density were achieved depending on the sintering conditions and volume fraction of TiC phase.  The SiC grain size and morphology was analyzed as a function of TiC volume fraction. The presence of TiC particles in the SiC matrix inhibited the exaggerated grain growth of the SiC grains and activated additional toughening mechanisms. The SiC grains were found to be roughly equiaxed with very fine TiC particles preventing significant elongation. The optimal sintering conditions for room temperature mechanical properties required slow heating through the reaction zone  (1300 to 1520°C) followed by a 1 h dwell at 1885°C. At this temperature, the maximum flexural strength of 566 MPa was measured in samples containing 5 vol % TiC. Conversely, a maximum fracture toughness of 5.7 MPa·m0.5 was measured in samples containing 10 vol % TiC sintered at 1900°C. The hardness was shown to increase very little, from ~19.8 GPa in the monolithic SiC samples to 20.1 GPa in samples containing 5 vol % TiC. A theoretical analysis was conducted to model the effect of porosity and grain morphology on the mechanical properties of the SiC matrix and was experimentally verified.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study addresses the flexural performance of sandwich panels composed of a polyurethane foam core and glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins. Panels with and without GFRP ribs connecting the skins have been studied. While the motivation of the study was to develop new insulated cladding panels for buildings, most of the work and findings are also applicable to other potential applications such as flooring, roofing and light-weight decking. The study comprises experimental, numerical, and analytical investigations.&#xD;
The experimental program included three phases. Phase I is a comprehensive material testing program of the polyurethane core and GFRP skins and ribs. In Phase II, six medium size (2500x660x78 mm) panels with different rib configurations were tested in one-way bending. It was shown that flexural strength and stiffness have increased by 50 to 150%, depending on the rib configuration, compared to a panel without ribs. In Phase III, two large-scale (9150x2440x78 mm) panels, representing a cladding system envisioned to be used in the field, were tested under a realistic air pressure and discrete loads, respectively. The deflection under service wind load did not exceed span/360, while the ultimate pressure was about 2.6 times the maximum factored wind pressure in Canada.&#xD;
A numerical study using finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out. The FEA model accounted for the significant material nonlinearities, especially for the polyurethane soft core, and the geometric nonlinearity, which is mainly a reduction in thickness due to core softness. Another independent analytical model was developed based on equilibrium and strain compatibility, accounting for the core excessive shear deformation. The model also captures the localized deformations of the loaded skin, using the principals of beam-on-elastic foundation. Both models were successfully validated using experimental results. Possible failure modes, namely core shear failure, and compression skin crushing or wrinkling were successfully predicted.&#xD;
A parametric study was carried out to explore further the core density, skin thickness, and rib spacing effects. As the core density increased, flexural strength and stiffness increased and shear deformations reduced. Also, increasing skin thickness became more effective as the core density increased. The optimal density was 95-130 kg/m3. Reducing the spacing of ribs enhanced the strength up to a certain level; It then stabilized at a spacing of 2.9 times the panel thickness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Microbes have a remarkable ability to adapt to a host of environmental stressors, including low temperature, high pressure and osmotic stresses.  The adaptations of resistant microbes to low temperatures are varied, and may include the accumulation of solutes to maintain osmotic balance, the production of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) or ice nucleation proteins (INPs) to manipulate ice growth or formation.  AFPs depress the freezing point, inhibit ice recrystallization, and have been reported to inhibit or delay the growth of gas hydrates.  Conversely, INPs precipitate ice formation at relatively high subzero temperatures.  Collectively, these activities can be described as ‘ice-association’ activities.  Here, ice-affinity and/or freeze-thaw cycling were used to either select for isolates with ice association properties or to assess the low temperature resistance of microbial consortia derived from various environments.  Ice-affinity successfully selected psychrotolerant microbes from cultured temperate and boreal soils, some of which had been previously reported in glaciers and Arctic/Antarctic sites.  Many of the recovered microbes demonstrated ice-association activities.  Freeze-thaw selection also greatly decreased the abundance and diversity of consortia from distinct sites, and allowed the recovery of individual isolates, many of which demonstrated ice-association.  Freeze-thaw selection was also used to assess the role of cross-tolerance between osmotic and freeze-thaw stresses, based on the common challenge of desiccation.  Microbial consortia from lakes with varying degrees of salinity were subjected to freeze-thaw stress, and the consortia from more saline lakes tended to show greater low temperature resistance.  While few of the recovered microbes demonstrated ice-association activities, those from the more saline lakes tended to contain a higher intracellular solute concentration and were more likely to form biofilms.  This underscores the diversity of resistance strategies and supports the notion of cross-tolerance.  To determine if these selective regimes would have applications for hydrate growth inhibition, microbes derived from an oil well sample were subjected to freeze-thaw stress.  Selection reduced microbial abundance, shifted the diversity, and resulted in the recovery of microbes with some ice-association activity.  Taken together, this thesis demonstrates that the application of low temperature stress can be used to successfully investigate stress resistance mechanisms within microbial communities from distinct environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Increasing obesity rates in Canadian women are at an all time high with more than 50% of Canadian women falling into one of the four overweight to obese categories. Further to this 11-21% of Canadian women who are of child-bearing age are being described as overweight or obese. Along with the increasing rates of obesity is an increase in the number of operative deliveries experienced by pregnant women in Canada. Canadian women experience cesarean section (CS) approximately 21% of the time while women in Ontario experience an even higher rate of CS (26%). While currently there are several studies examining the relationship between pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity and its association with CS, there is little research examining the relationship between excess weight gain in pregnancy and operative delivery methods.&#xD;
Data were collected through a retrospective chart review to examine the relationship between excess weight gain in pregnancy and operative delivery methods. Mean weight gain throughout pregnancy was measured. Data analysis was conducted using t-tests, Chi-Squared analyses and Fisher’s Exact test of significance, accepting a significance level of alpha = 0.05 with a 95% Confidence Interval of difference. The analysis conducted demonstrated no significant relationship between weight gain in pregnancy and operative delivery methods. When examining maternal weight and labour type, statistical significance was reached (p = 0.04) demonstrating increased likelihood of induction with excess weight gain in pregnancy; statistical significance was also reached with maternal age greater than 35 years and increased risk for operative delivery(p = 0.04). Further analysis demonstrated statistically significant results when examining one minute Apgar scores between the group of women with recorded weights in comparison to those women whose charts did not contain weights. The lack of findings in this study may be largely attributed to the small sample size.Important practice issues were identified. It is important that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy weight and height be recorded on all women in hospital databases as well paper charts.&#xD;
Consistency in recording weight units in either pounds or kilograms is imperative. Dietary consultation is an important component of prenatal care and women who enter pregnancy overweight or obese should have immediate access to nutritional counseling.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) can be used to assess the risk of atherosclerosis; however, an inverse relationship between vessel size and FMD has been identified using reactive hyperemia (RH) to create a shear stress (SS) stimulus in human conduit arteries. RH creates a transient and uncontrolled SS stimulus that is inversely related to baseline arterial diameter.  It is therefore unclear whether differences in FMD between groups with non-uniform artery sizes are indicative of differences in vascular health or due to the creation of a greater SS stimulus in smaller vessels. Unlike RH, exercise can effectively create sustained and controlled increases in conduit artery SS. The purpose of this study was to compare the FMD responses of two differently sized upper limb arteries (brachial (BA) and radial artery (RA)) to matched graded levels of SS. Using exercise, three distinct sustained shear rate stimuli were created ((SR)=blood flow velocity/vessel diameter; estimate of SS) in the RA and BA. Artery diameter and mean blood flow velocity were assessed with echo and Doppler ultrasound respectively in 15 healthy male subjects (19-25yrs). Data are means ±SE. Subjects performed 6-min each of adductor pollicis and handgrip exercise to increase SR in the RA and BA respectively. Exercise intensity was modulated to achieve uniformity of SR between the RA and BA at three SR targets (40s-1, 60s-1, 80s-1).  Three distinct SR levels were successfully created (steady state exercise: 39.8±0.6s-1, 57.3±0.7s-1, 72.4±1.2s-1; p&lt;0.001 between SR levels). The %FMD at the end of exercise was greater in the RA vs. BA (SR40 RA: 5.4±0.8%, BA: 1.0±0.2%; SR60 RA: 9.8±1.0%, BA: 2.5±0.5%; SR80 RA: 15.7±1.5%, BA: 5.4±0.7%; p&lt;0.001). The mean slope of the within-subject FMD-SR dose-response regression lines was significantly greater in the RA (RA: 0.33±0.04, BA: 0.13±0.02; p&lt;0.001) and a strong within-subjects relationship between FMD and SR was observed in both arteries (RA r2: 0.92±0.02; BA r2: 0.90±0.03). These findings suggest that the response to SS is not uniform across differently sized vessels, which is in agreement with previous RH studies. Future research is required to investigate the potential mechanisms that mediate the functional differences observed between differently sized vessels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The SNO+ experiment will be the SNO detector filled with a neodymium-loaded liquid scintillator instead of heavy water. SNO+ will be used to detect neutrinos of much lower energy. Also, SNO+ will conduct a search for neutrinoless double beta decay with Nd-150. The Nd-loaded scintillator in SNO+ will be made from linear alkylbenzene (LAB). Both the LAB solvent and the Nd loading are new developments. The optical properties of this scintillator and information about radioactive backgrounds should be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
A calibration source known as the scintillator bucket was deployed in the water-filled SNO detector in order to study some optical properties of Nd-loaded scintillator, raw LAB scintillator and distilled LAB scintillator. Using a neutron source attached to the bucket to produce events with known energy, with a model of the scintillator bucket simulated by an analysis tool called RAT, the light yield of the scintillator could be determined by comparing data measurements with simulations. This allowed the light yield, one of the main optical properties of the scintillator, to be measured and that value to be corrected in the Monte Carlo.&#xD;
&#xD;
The bucket was deployed both at the centre of the detector and at the bottom. After subtracting backgrounds from radon introduced in the scintillator during preparation and filling, constraints on the amount of Po-210 were obtained. Estimates on the K-40 content of the Nd-loaded scintillator were obtained by analyzing the radon-subtracted background spectra. By comparing the background spectra with the bucket deployed at the bottom of the acrylic vessel with spectra from the bucket at the centre, it was possible to estimate the K-40 content of the acrylic vessel.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: Burnout is a familiar term for today’s health care professionals with emotional, psychological, physical, and social consequences for those who experience it. It leads to job dissatisfaction, low organizational commitment, absenteeism, as well as inter personal conflict in teams and patient care.  &#xD;
Objectives: This mixed methods study has 3 objectives:&#xD;
1.	To determine the levels of burnout being experienced by a sample of occupational therapists practicing in Ontario.  &#xD;
2.	To describe the practice issues faced by participants in their day-to-day work and &#xD;
3.	To describe the coping strategies participants employ to maintain their practice.&#xD;
Methods: A concurrent embedded mixed methods research design was used. The mixed methods design collected quantitative and qualitative data. In the first phase, 63 participants completed a survey, which collected demographic information, responses on Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey and Areas of Worklife Survey, and their use of coping strategies. In the second phase, focus groups and interviews with 7 occupational therapists were conducted to learn about practice issues, and coping strategies used to address the identified demands.&#xD;
Results: 34.8% of the participants reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, 43.5% of the participants reported high levels of cynicism and 24.6 % report low professional efficacy. Unmanageable workload predicted 29.9% of the variance in emotional exhaustion. Rewards predict 15.5% of the variance in professional efficacy. Demands on time, lack of autonomy, lack of respect and conflict were identified as practice issues participants grapple with on a daily basis.  Spending time with spouse/partner/family, maintaining balance between professional and personal lives, maintaining sense of control over work responsibilities and maintaining sense of humor were rated highly by participants as coping strategies they utilize to maintain their practice. Maintaining self awareness / self monitoring, focusing on satisfying aspects of work, importance of workplace/home community and boundaries emerged as additional coping strategies from the focus groups and interviews. &#xD;
Conclusion: This study contributes to understanding the practice challenges for occupational therapists in the contemporary healthcare arena. It provides valuable insights into factors that contribute to therapist burnout and strategies they employ to maintain competent practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In a noisy environment, speech intelligibility is greatly enhanced by seeing the speaker’s face. This enhancement results from the integration of auditory and visual signals, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This thesis describes the results from four studies investigating the enhancement of speech comprehension in an open-set, word-in-noise identification task. In the first study, we examined how the auditory signal-to-noise ratio impacts audiovisual performance in a large participant sample. Consistent with the majority of previous studies, we found high inter-individual variability, whose magnitude increased monotonically with increasing signal-to-noise ratio. We also found that audiovisual performance was highly variably across studies, even after normalizing with auditory-only performance, suggesting that experimental factors strongly affect performance. In the second study, we replicated the findings from the first study and developed a measure of audiovisual ‘integration enhancement’ that captures how much of the audiovisual performance cannot be accounted for by performances in visual-only and auditory-only tasks. Contrary to the principle of inverse effectiveness, this integration enhancement was found not to decrease with auditory signal-to-noise ratio but to peak at an intermediate ratio. In the third study, we developed a model based on the congruency of response errors (confusions) observed in auditory-only and visual-only task conditions to predict audiovisual performance enhancement. This relatively simple categorical model was found to account for audiovisual performance enhancement in 60% of our stimuli, lower level processing was likely responsible for the enhancement in the remainder of the words. In the fourth study, we investigated how much of the audiovisual performance enhancement can be predicted by the integration of auditory and visual signals, a process that we estimated from the susceptibility of one’s auditory perception to be altered by incongruent (McGurk) visual stimuli. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between the McGurk illusion susceptibility for nonsense syllables and our measure of audiovisual integration enhancement for words. Altogether, these findings suggest that a large amount of performance enhancement in speech comprehension is attributable to categorical constraints rather than to a discrete integration process. This work also highlights the importance of developing standardized approaches for future investigations of audiovisual speech perception.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Tissue engineering holds great promise for developing functional tissue to repair damaged articular cartilage.  However, cartilaginous tissues formed in vitro typically possess poor mechanical properties in comparison to native tissue due to the inability of chondrocytes to accumulate adequate amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM).  While mechanical stimuli can enhance the properties of engineered cartilage, it may be more efficient to harness the underlying mechanotransduction pathways responsible.  Substantial evidence suggests that the mechanotransduction signaling cascade is initiated by rapid adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) release from chondrocytes (purinergic receptor pathway).  Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exogenous ATP supplementation on the biochemical and mechanical properties of tissue engineered cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
Primary bovine articular chondrocytes, seeded on MilliporeTM filters, were grown in the presence of 0, 62.5 or 250 µM ATP for a period of four weeks.  Both anabolic and catabolic effects were examined and a therapeutic dose range of ATP was determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
ATP stimulation (62.5 - 250 µM) enhanced ECM synthesis by 23 - 43% and long-term collagen accumulation by 16 - 26%, in a dose-dependent manner; however, long-term proteoglycan accumulation decreased as a result of 250 µM ATP.  In addition, ATP supplementation significantly improved the mechanical properties of the developed tissues (5- to 6.5-fold increase in tissue stiffness).  Interestingly, high doses of ATP (250 µM) also elicited a 2-fold increase in MMP-13 gene expression, 39% increase in MMP-13 activity, and 54% more extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi) – an ATP degradation product.  Dose-dependent increases in MMP-13 activity suggested that catabolic effects were occurring alongside anabolic effects, which initiated the investigation of a therapeutic dose of ATP.  Doses of 31.25 µM and 125 µM ATP were added to cartilaginous tissues and investigated in terms of MMP-13 activity and ECM synthesis.  Tissues supplemented with 62.5 – 125 µM ATP exhibited a balance between anabolic and catabolic effects.   &#xD;
&#xD;
By harnessing the purinergic receptor pathway, anabolic effects of mechanical stimuli were achieved in the absence of externally applied forces. Understanding how the catabolic effects of ATP are manifested would be valuable in order to further maximize the therapeutic potential of ATP stimulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Contractors and tunnelling engineers consistently seek to identify techniques and equipment to improve the efficiency and lower the cost of tunnelling projects. Based on the recent successes of rock slope characterization with laser scanning techniques, the author proposes 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) as a new tool for geotechnical assessment in drill and blast tunnels.&#xD;
 It has been demonstrated that practical deployment of a phase-based LiDAR system at the face of an active tunnel heading is possible with a simple tripod setup. With data collection requiring only 5 minutes at the tunnel face, it was shown that this technique could be integrated into geotechnical evaluation without interruption of the excavation cycle.  Following the successful scanning at two active tunnelling projects and two completed unlined tunnels, the research explored the applications of the data. With detailed geometric data of the heading as it advanced, the author identified applications of interest to the contractor/on-site engineer as well as the geotechnical engineer or geologist responsible for rockmass characterization. Operational applications included the extraction of information about tunnel geometry and installed support, while geomechanical information provided important elements of rockmass characterization. Building on the success of retrieving joint network information, the research investigated the potential for LiDAR-derived structural databases to be the basis for highly-representative 3D discrete element models. These representative models were found to be useful for back-analysis or as predictive tools for future tunnel design. &#xD;
The primary implications of the thesis are that a) LiDAR data collection at the face of a drill and blast tunnel operation is practical and potentially has great value, b) data extraction is possible for a wide range of applications, and c) that discontinuum stability analysis becomes a much more powerful tool with the integration of LiDAR data. The cumulative result of the work presented is a proposed workflow for integrating LiDAR into tunneling operations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis captures the nature of musical theatre in secondary schools in order to understand more completely the intrinsic benefits of the activity.  The research surrounds the essence of students’ experience as part of a secondary school musical theatre course, and how students come to understand the meaning of their experience over time.  The research design uses a hermeneutic phenomenological lens to capture the lived experience of six former musical theatre students using in-depth, semi-structured interviews.  The data is organized in a narrative-like style and analyzed according to the emergent themes, the literature, and this researcher’s personal experience.  &#xD;
The data suggest musical theatre is a journey of self-discovery where process is paramount.  The alumni describe the impact of teacher quality on the musical theatre process, the family inherent in the musical theatre cast, the allure of performance and notoriety, and the frustrations toward other students’ apathy.  Recent graduates note increased confidence and improved public speaking abilities, but older graduates see musical theatre as something life changing.  The intensity of experience, therefore, seems to depend on the number of years students have to reflect on the impact of their experience.  Holding these experiences in such esteem, in this study however, decreases the probability of participation in future musical theatre opportunities for fear of their inadequacy.  These former students fear they will be unable to repeat the musical theatre experience to the same quality they experienced back when they were in secondary school.  This regrettable cycle is unfortunate, but seems to be the reality of how students come to understand this experience over time.  The analysis is intended to inform curriculum delivery, advocacy, and alumni relations for future courses in musical theatre.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Until recently, secondary organoboronic esters were not viable substrates in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction; however under recently reported conditions from the Crudden group1, which includes the addition of silver oxide to a palladium/phosphine catalyst system, this coupling can now be achieved.&#xD;
This thesis centres on optimizing the reaction conditions and expanding the substrate scope of this difficult but important secondary coupling. Optimal coupling conditions, for the example reaction of 4-iodoacetophenone and (R)-pinacol(1-phenylethyl)boronate, were found to be 8 mol% Pd(PPh3)4, 32 mol%  PPh3, 1.5 eq. Ag2O and 1.5 eq. K2CO3 in DME at 85 °C for 24 h. This gave the desired coupling product in 64 % yield with 99.5 % retention of stereochemistry. Using this set of conditions, an array of aryl iodides were screened. The reaction conditions could not be extended to triflate or diazonium electrophiles. &#xD;
Amide functionality is important in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. The extension of reaction conditions to amides possessing boronic ester functionality at the β-position was attempted; however, no conditions could be determined to generate the cross-coupling product. An α-substitution pattern would better exemplify the benzylic positioning found to work for the original substrates. Attempts to synthesize the α-substituted amide were made without success.&#xD;
The optimal reaction conditions gave hope for differentiation between an aryl and a secondary aliphatic boronic ester. Using an aryl triflate to couple the aryl position and an aryl iodide to couple the aliphatic position, conditions for selective coupling were determined and applied to a one-pot procedure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>ABSTRACT&#xD;
The United Nations Security Council's efforts to suppress and to halt the acts of international terrorism resulted in the adoption of resolution 1267 in 1999 pursuant to chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. This resolution was originally worded against the Taliban administration in Afghanistan for its alleged support and involvement in the bombing of the embassies of the United States of America in Kenya and Tanzania by Osama Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda Network. The resolution places a ‘no assets’ and a ‘no-fly’ ban on the Taliban government or any of its representatives. The third category of the sanction places arm embargo on the Taliban and the designated individuals and entities. &#xD;
&#xD;
As a result of the rising incidence of transnational terrorism, the resolution was made applicable to private individuals who are suspected to be affiliated with Osama Bin Laden or his Al-Qaeda organization. Worthy of note also is the establishment of the Resolution 1267 Committee which was saddled with the duty, inter alia, of putting the names of the suspected individuals on a list known as ‘the Consolidated List’ and requiring states to freeze these individuals’ assets and refraining them from flying in and out of their territories. &#xD;
&#xD;
Using the experience of Mr. Abousfian Abdelrazik as documented in the recent Canadian case of Abousfian Abdelrazik v. Minister of Foreign Affairs &amp; Attorney General of Canada as a case study and with the aid of a discussion of some established principles of international criminal law, this thesis will place the activities of the Resolution 1267 Committee on the scale of compatibility with the well established principles of natural justice and due process under international criminal law. The thesis will determine whether the working guidelines of the resolution 1267 committee conform with the centuries of jurisprudence on natural justice, equity and good conscience. It will examine whether the United Nations or any of its organs is bound to comply with due process or natural justice principles even in the face of threat to international peace and security.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are linked by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex which regulates each system through activation of protein C and TAFI, respectively. We have used novel assays and techniques to study the enzymology and biochemistry of TAFI and TAFIa, to measure TAFI activation in hemophilia A and protein C deficiency and to determine if enhancing TAFI activation can improve hemostasis in hemophilic plasma and whole blood.&#xD;
We show that TAFIa not TAFI attenuates fibrinolysis in vitro and this is supported by a relatively high catalytic efficiency (16.41μM-1s-1) of plasminogen binding site removal from fibrin degradation products (FDPs) by TAFIa. Since the catalytic efficiency of TAFIa in removing these sites is ~60-fold higher than that for inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin it is likely that FDPs are a physiological substrate of TAFIa. The high catalytic efficiency is primarily a result of a low Km which can be explained by a novel mechanism where TAFIa forms a binary complex with plasminogen and is recruited to the surface of FDPs. The low Km also suggests that TAFIa would effectively cleave lysines from FDPs during the early stages of fibrinolysis (i.e. at low concentrations of FDPs).&#xD;
Since individuals with hemophilia suffer from premature fibrinolysis as a result of insufficient TAFI activation we quantified TAFI activation in whole blood from hemophilic subjects. Both the rate of activation and the area under the TAFI activation time course (termed TAFIa potential) was determined to be reduced in hemophilia A and the TAFIa potential was significantly and inversely correlated with the clinical bleeding&#xD;
iii&#xD;
phenotype. Using a novel therapeutic strategy, we used soluble thrombomodulin to increase TAFI activation which improved the clot lysis time in factor VIII deficient human plasma and hemophilic dog plasma as well as hemophilic dog blood.&#xD;
Finally, we briefly show in a biochemical case study that TAFI activation is enhanced in protein C deficiency and when afflicted individuals are placed on Warfarin anticoagulant therapy, TAFI activation is reduced. Since TAFIa stabilizes blood clots, this suggests that reducing TAFI activation or inhibiting TAFIa may help restore blood flow in vessels with pathological thrombosis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two catchments amended with snow fences were paired with unaltered controls to investigate the influences of increased snow accumulation on the hydrology, soil thermal regime, and nutrient fluxes from High Arctic headwater catchments, representative of polar desert and mid-moisture vegetative classes at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO). The impact of augmented snow accumulation on the winter soil thermal regime was highly variable during the period studied. Soil temperatures were 8-9°C warmer beneath a drift 54 cm deep compared to ambient snow (10 cm) in the winter of 2006-2007, whereas soil temperatures were not significantly warmer beneath drifts (88 and 50 cm) compared to ambient snow (18 and 35 cm) in the winter of 2007-2008. Departures between air and ground surface temperatures suggest that snow accumulation was insufficient to insulate soils before February 2007-2008 due to late snow accumulation, compared to earlier snow accumulation in September in the winter of 2006-2007. The augmented snow accumulation did not significantly impact the timing of soil thaw in spring or active layer thickness at this site. &#xD;
&#xD;
Greater snow accumulation in the amended catchments altered runoff characteristics, including an extended  duration of runoff by 30-80%, a delay in peak flow of ~5 days, and increased runoff ratios. Augmented snow accumulation, resulted in greater fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+) and total inorganic solutes (TIS) in amended catchments relative to control sites. The seasonality of solute fluxes were also affected, with a greater proportion of inorganic solute fluxes occurring in the later portion of the runoff season compared to the controls. &#xD;
&#xD;
Snow accumulation was strong factor in determining total specific solute fluxes, with the magnitude of DOC and DON fluxes also strongly dependent on vegetative class. An active layer detachment that occurred in one of the amended catchments may have contributed to changes in nutrient fluxes, but the precise influence of the active layer detachment could not be differentiated from the combined impact of the disturbance and increased snow accumulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The development of inhibitory antibodies to the factor VIII (FVIII) protein is the greatest complication in the management of hemophilia A patients. These antibodies, which form in approximately 25% of patients, neutralize the procoagulant activity of FVIII. There are limited treatment options to manage FVIII “inhibitors”, and this significantly increases morbidity within the hemophilia population. Therefore, understanding the immunobiology of FVIII, and developing safe, efficacious therapies to induce immunological tolerance to FVIII is a clinical priority. &#xD;
In 2010, there is no therapy available to prevent the formation of FVIII inhibitors in boys with hemophilia. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of anti-CD3 to induce tolerance to FVIII in a prophylactic setting. Low-dose anti-CD3 significantly increased the level CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells, and prevented formation of inhibitors in &gt;80% in hemophilia A mice. Depleting CD4+CD25+ cells in vivo completely abrogated tolerance. Furthermore, cytokine production by splenocytes from tolerant mice were shifted toward a Th1 response. Anti-CD3 therefore represents one of the most efficacious pre-clinical therapies for FVIII tolerance induction.&#xD;
Surgery is widely regarded in the hemophilia community as a trigger for inducing de novo inhibitor formation. There is, however, only conflicting clinical evidence, and no basic science data to lend support to this clinical hypothesis. Therefore, we developed a novel surgical procedure in hemophilia A mice to study the influence of surgery on FVIII immunogenicity. We found that surgery induced a systemic proinflammatory response (upregulated plasma IL-1 and IL-6), but surprisingly the immunogenicity of FVIII was not enhanced when infused at the perioperative time. These results are significant, however, because they suggest that surgery is not as important for de novo inhibitor formation as previously thought.&#xD;
Finally, it is unknown whether central tolerance to FVIII shapes the peripheral T cell repertoire. Therefore, we studied the murine thymus for evidence of FVIII expression. Whole thymus expressed FVIII mRNA but not protein. FVIII mRNA expression in the thymus was due, at least in part, by the thymic epithelium (CD45-/loEpCAM+). In FVIII-/-AIRE+/-, the immunogenicity of FVIII appeared to be unaltered. This study is the first to investigate a possible role for central tolerance to FVIII.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis revisits the effects of moving image regulation, exploring its histories in Canada with an interest in the intersections between arts practitioners and legal processes in the administration of culture.  During the 1980s and 1990s, intensified film and video regulatory activities necessitated a coalition space for cultural activism populated by media artists and exhibitors, legal and academic scholars, and public intellectuals engaged with representational and identity politics, producing discourses about sexuality, pornography, race, AIDS, censorship, fundamental freedoms, and art.  Considering the current state of the law, largely ignored by arts exhibitors in between moments of crisis, I ask how is the reception of this history reflected in practice with regard to regulation and self-regulation?  Drawing on work that develops out of Michel Foucault’s theories of governmentality, I argue that actors across Canada were confronted with the task of negotiating not just how contemporary art survives regulatory scrutiny in public policy arenas and the courts, but also the acceptable boundaries of sexual identities and citizenship.  This approach prompts a rethinking of contradictory liberal and libertarian notions of censorship to foreground the way ideas are constrained in all aspects of policy, and the way protocols of dissuasion often fail.  As such, censoring acts reveal themselves to be less about restricting access than they are about the administration or legitimation of particular cultural values.  This thesis historicizes the mandate of the Ontario Film Review Board, explores aspects of movement strategies as they work to crystallize identities, documents specific speech constraints and their justifications in the law, and suggests functions of counter-speech in video productions of the period.  This thesis is guided by a concern with the relationship between cultural citizens and the state and asks what role does the state imagine itself playing in regulating the circulation of images?  What are the (mis)understandings of censorship within more recent anti-censorship movement efforts, and what are the opportunities for cultural citizens to negotiate change, both in public policy and in popular consciousness?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Flameless combustion technology has been developed over the past twenty years achieving low-NOx emissions and high energy efficiency for industrial applications.  In the present work, three aspects of flameless combustion were examined based on a burner employing the Strong-Jet/Weak-Jet (SJ/WJ) configuration.&#xD;
In the first part of the work, a 3-D SJ/WJ physical model was developed in the Lagrangian perspective for an isothermal pair of free jets.  The model was used to predict the WJ trajectory, identify important design/operation factors, and estimate the extent of mixing in the main combustion region (confluence region).  The model was also validated with experimental data and showed excellent agreement over a wide range of flow conditions.  &#xD;
In the second part of the work, a simplified chemical kinetic model was developed for the flameless combustion of natural gas.  A detailed chemical reaction mechanism (GRI Mech 3.0) was successfully reduced to a skeletal chemical reaction mechanism under flameless combustion conditions by Principal Component Analysis, sensitivity analysis and reaction flow analysis. The skeletal mechanism was further simplified to a set of 2-D manifolds by Trajectory-Generated Low-Dimensional Manifolds (TGLDM) method.  The set of 2-D manifolds was tested by the Batch Reactor (BR) and Perfect Stirred Reactor (PSR) models.  From the BR model test, it was found that the chemical reaction rates were well represented by the 2-D manifolds. The effect of the physical perturbation, tested by PSR model, could be handled by the perpendicular projection instead of the orthogonal projection because both showed similar discrepancies with the skeletal mechanism.  &#xD;
In the final part of the work, the steady-state Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation was conducted for the turbulent flameless combustion in the SJ/WJ furnace, based on the Probability Density Function (PDF)/Mixing approach. The set of 2-D manifolds and Conditional Source-term Estimate (CSE) method were used for the combustion reaction and the estimation of the mean production/destruction rate, respectively.  This CSE-TGLDM model provided good predictions of major species concentrations. However, the gas temperatures and CO concentrations were highly over-predicted.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In metal powder compaction, density non-uniformity due to friction can be a source of flaws. Currently in industry, uniform density distribution is achieved by the optimization of punch motions through trial and error. This method is both costly and time consuming. Over the last decade, the finite element (FE) method has received significant attention as an alternative to the trial and error method; however, there is still lack of an accurate and robust material model for the simulation of metal powder compaction. In this study, Cam-clay and Drucker-Prager cap (DPC) material models were implemented into the commercial FE software ABAQUS/Explicit using the user-subroutine VUMAT. The Cam-clay model was shown to be appropriate for simple geometries. The DPC model is a pressure-dependent, non-smooth, multi-yield surface material model with a high curvature in the cap yield surface. This high curvature tends to result in instability issues; a sub-increment technique was implemented to address this instability problem.  The DPC model also shows instability problems at the intersection of the yield surfaces; this problem was solved using the corner region in DPC material models for soils. The computational efficiency of the DPC material model was improved using a novel technique to solve the constitutive equations. In a case study it was shown that the numerical technique leads to a 30% decrease in computational cost, while degrading the accuracy of the analysis by only 0.4%. The forward Euler method was shown to be accurate in the integration of the constitutive equations using an error control scheme. Experimental tests were conducted where cylindrical-shaped parts were compacted from Distaloy AE iron based powder to a final density of 7.0 g/cm3. To measure local density, metallography and image processing was used. The FE results were compared to experimental results and it was shown that the FE analysis predicted local relative density within 2% of the actual experimental density.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The failure of brittle rocks around deep underground excavations due to the high induced stress is controlled by the crack accumulation in the rock. The study shows that the damage initiation strength, CI, corresponds to the long-term strength, and the short-term strength of the brittle rocks in-situ is the crack interaction strength, CD. Therefore the damage thresholds that are being used for the calibration and validation of numerical models are important parameters in the design of underground structures.&#xD;
The accurate detection of the damage thresholds is important as they define the in-situ behaviour of the brittle rocks. The two most common methods of detecting damage thresholds are the Acoustic Emission method and the strain measurement method. Apparent discrepancy that exists between the accuracy of these methods was the author’s motivation for comparing these two methods on Stanstead and Smaland granites. The author introduced two new parameters based on the measured strains for improving the strain measurement method. Based on the comparisons, the author is of the opinion that the Acoustic Emission method is a more accurate method of detecting damage thresholds.&#xD;
Numerical models are an important tool in the design of underground structures. The numerical methods that are able to simulate fractures explicitly have the ability to predict the brittle failure, the density and the extension of the microcracks around the opening. Itasca’s Particle Flow Code (PFC) was used in this study due to its potential  to simulate fractures explicitly. Calibration of PFC models to Unconfined Compressive Strength properties of the rock does not mean that the model will behave correctly under other confining stresses or in tension. The author has tried to solve this problem by different methods and developing new procedures. Improvements in the model behaviour have been achieved but  more work is required. &#xD;
The definition, and detection and calibrated simulation of rock damage thresholds for calibration of numerical models is helpful for a successful design of underground excavations and long term, lower bound strength, a critical design parameter for deep geological repositories for the storage of nuclear wastes, for example.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>When seeking information, children expect informants to provide information that is congruent with their knowledge and to use conventional labels. Violations of these linguistic expectations influence their behaviour and perceptions, as they are less likely to seek information from informants with a history of inaccuracy or of violation of conversational form (Eskritt et al., 2008; Koenig &amp; Harris, 2005) and perceive unreliable informants as “silly” (Brosseau-Liard &amp; Birch, 2010). I explored whether violations of linguistic expectations influence children’s perceptions of knowledgeability and helpfulness and whether these characteristics predict children’s information seeking. Forty 5-year-olds observed a farmer and a car mechanic label objects for a foreign child. The objects were associated with one of the two informants, rendering one as the expert, and the other as the non-expert. The informants labelled the familiarization objects by stating either the object’s color or its super ordinate category.  During test trials, children selected one of the two informants to label novel objects that were either related or unrelated to either one’s domain of expertise (i.e. novel animals, tools or odd objects). Finally, children rated informant’s knowledge of the familiarization objects and their willingness to help the foreign child. Results show that children perceive an informant who provided the super ordinate category as more helpful and somewhat more knowledgeable than one who provides the colour. When labelling objects related to the informants’ domain of expertise, children rely on expertise to seek information. For unrelated novel objects, a trend suggests that perceptions of the expert’s knowledge influence decision making. These results provide new factors underlying children’s information seeking.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examines the interface of poverty and development of state welfare&#xD;
initiatives colonial Nigeria. It attempts to unravel the transformation and the nature and&#xD;
character of poverty afflicting majority of Nigerians since the period immediately&#xD;
preceding colonialism and under colonial rule. It looks at the causes and manifestations&#xD;
of poverty as well as the nature of social welfare in pre-colonial Nigerian societies in&#xD;
relation to the new forms of poverty that British Colonial policies visited on the society.&#xD;
Poverty in the colonial period is shown to have been caused by changes in power&#xD;
relations and accompanying administrative and economic reorganization of the society&#xD;
which facilitated the diversion of labour, resources and surplus produce from family and&#xD;
household use to the colonial state, firms and their agents. This new form of poverty was&#xD;
manifested in the loss of family and household self-sufficiency and the inability to meet&#xD;
personal survival needs and obligations, making the majority unable to participate fully in&#xD;
the affairs of their communities. This dissertation looks at how the British Colonial State&#xD;
tried to achieve its objective of exploitation and deal with the problem of poverty in its&#xD;
various manifestations using indigenous institutions and practices and other nonindigenous&#xD;
strategies in the face of growing African resistance and declining&#xD;
productivity. It argues that over-aching strategy of development represented by the&#xD;
Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1940 and subsequent amendments and&#xD;
community development were designed to co-opt the emergent civil society into&#xD;
acquiescence with the social system and contain further resistance, and as such could not&#xD;
provide welfare nor alleviate the problem of poverty.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores poor retail food access in low-income, class-segregated communities through a social justice lens. Disadvantaged communities with poor food access—often called ‘food deserts’—have received ample scholarly attention, however the problem has yet to be analyzed from a normative, critical perspective. For this research, I use the case study of two communities in Kingston, Ontario’s North End, whose retail food geography changed significantly between 2006 and 2009. Critical political economy is my primary theoretical framework. I conducted forty-two qualitative interviews with key informants, four focus groups (three with low-income North Kingston residents and one with elderly Kingston residents), two door-to-door surveys in Rideau Heights, archival research, and I attended public meetings around a grocery store closure in the North End.&#xD;
&#xD;
I advance several research findings based on my results. Most broadly, I argue that the food desert problem represents capital’s ability to shape the ‘everyday geographies’ of simple, mundane activities like food shopping through the manipulation of the urban built environment. As such, capital is able to distribute the costs and burdens of food procurement in ways that reproduce class relations and class contempt to suite the dynamics of capitalist accumulation. I propose three interpretations of poor retail food access as a social injustice: (1) poor access represents the unequal and disproportionate allocation of burdens and costs of food acquisition on those with the fewest resources to mitigate these costs; (2) class disparity is inherently supported by urban governance systems that protect the interests of capital, therefore scaled-up retail capital is not accountable to residents of communities or their non-economic needs or wishes; and (3) the consolidated retail food geography of North American cities deprives low-income people of freedom, choice and dignity that is often embodied in the act of enjoying a ‘normal’ middle-class shopping experience. In the transition to a post-capitalist retail food geography, therefore, activists should abandon a romantic notion that low-income people should drive the change by somehow adopting a more agrarian lifestyle or lead the food system re-localization agenda – change driven by desperation rather than personal values.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Given that childhood obesity has become a public health concern, the development and implementation of effective interventions addressing this issue are needed. Research suggests that the use of a parent-only approach is an effective way to improve the home and family environment to promote healthy weight in children. Moreover, by improving parents’ physical activity and eating behaviours children’s behaviours may also be improved. Primary care interventions have been shown to be effective for enhancing physical activity in adults, especially when using physical activity prescriptions and referrals to community programs. No studies have combined these two interventions to explore the possibility of an added-value effect relative to the promotion of a healthy family environment conducive to healthy weight in children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a combined primary care-parent-only intervention with a primary care intervention alone for improving the home and family environment and mothers’ physical activity behaviours relevant to the promotion of healthy weight in children. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Female patients (N = 35) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Prescription Plus (PP), Prescription Only (PO) and Usual Care (UC). The PP group received a physical activity prescription plus a referral to a parent-only intervention, the PO group received just the prescription, and the UC group, regular health care. Outcome variables were physical activity, the obesogenic home environment, mother’s confidence for making obesity related changes, exercise/physical activity self-efficacy and outcome expectations, and self-regulation and perceived competence for exercise. All the measures were self-reported and were assessed before and eight weeks after the intervention. &#xD;
A 2 x 3 mixed analysis of variance showed no significant group differences at post-intervention. Only a significant time * intervention interaction was observed (p = .03), where the PP group achieved the largest effect (partial ŋ² = .200) in the obesogenic home environment score after receiving the intervention. These findings suggest that the combined primary care-parent-only intervention was effective for improving the home environment and provide preliminary insight into the effectiveness of such an intervention for influencing healthy weight in children.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zr-2.5Nb is used as the pressure tube material for 2nd and 3rd generation CANDU reactors. The physical properties of pressure tubes in service, including strength, dimensional stability, and delayed hydride cracking resistance, are largely dependent upon the crystallographic texture of the hcp α-phase, whose texture is predominantly developed during the extrusion stage of manufacturing. During extrusion and subsequent cooling, the formation of α may occur by transformation of the bcc β-phase to α according to the Burgers relationship and influenced by variant selection – that is, a preference for one or more of the twelve possible orientations of the hcp lattice relative to the bcc lattice. Variant selection has been observed in other Zr alloys, including the heat-treated zone in pressure tube welds and the bulk texture of heat-treated pressure tubes. Further, it has been proposed as a possible explanation for texture characteristics in pressure tubes that are not explained by the deformation mechanics of extrusion. However, the criteria for variant selection are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this work, an understanding of the criteria for variant selection is developed through observations of the differing mechanisms at play during both directions of transformation, from α-β and β-α. Transformation via the Burgers relationship was confirmed; the existence of variant selection is also established. In thermal cycles to the β-regime, this selection manifests as the selection of a new (0002) variant, as driven by anisotropic thermal stresses generated during heating. Upon cooling, the high-temperature β texture is inherited by the α grains via the Burgers relationship; the magnitude of the texture maxima is driven by elastic transformation strains. Further thermal cycles to the β regime demonstrate texture memory, with some development of cubic symmetry due to grain growth during the hold in the β-phase. No texture changes are observed if samples are not heated fully into the beta regime. Finally, a study of the biasing effects of both residual and external stresses is discussed. While the external stress did not appear to be capable of biasing variant selection during either heating or cooling, some texture changes were observed, likely due to deformation at high temperature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The O-antigenic glycan chains (O-antigen) of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria are synthesized by glycosyltransferases (GTs), most of which are yet to be characterized. The LPS are important for cell surface functions in bacteria and for the host immune system, through influencing the ability of bacteria to invade tissues and to evade the immune system of the host. Shigella is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes diarrhea or dysentery in humans. The O-antigenic chain of Shigella boydii (S. boydii) serotype B14 consists of repeating units with the structure [-6-D-Galp-alpha1,4-D-GlcpA-beta1,6-D-Galp-beta1,4-D-Galp-beta1,4-D-GlcpNAc-beta1-]n. None of the genes in the S. boydii serotype B14 O-antigen gene cluster, which includes putative GT genes, have been functionally characterized. We have developed the technology to biochemically identify these novel GTs. The wfeD gene in the B14 O-antigen gene cluster was proposed to encode a galactosyltransferase (GalT) involved in O-antigen synthesis. We confirmed here that the wfeD gene product is a beta4GalT that synthesizes the Gal1-4GlcNAcalpha-R linkage. WfeD was expressed in E.coli and the activity characterized using UDP-[3H]Gal as the donor substrate and the synthetic acceptor substrate GlcNAcalpha-pyrophosphate-phenyl-undecyl (GlcNAc-PP-PhU). A His-tagged version of the enzyme was purified via Ni2+-affinity chromatography, and its disaccharide product was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and galactosidase digestion. The enzyme was shown to be specific for the UDP-Gal donor substrate and required pyrophosphate in the acceptor substrate. Divalent metal ions such as Mn2+, Ni2+, and surprisingly also Pb2+, were able to enhance enzyme activity. Mutational analysis showed that the Glu101 residue within a DxD motif is essential for activity, possibly by forming the catalytic nucleophile. The Lys211 residue within a cluster of positively charged amino acids was also found to be required for activity. This latter residue may be involved in binding the negatively charged acceptor substrate. Our study revealed that the beta4GalT WfeD is a previously unknown enzyme that has extremely low sequence similarities to any other GalT and has an unusual preference for metal ion cofactors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background &#xD;
Considering  ~9 million Canadians have one or more chronic health conditions, and &gt;3.3 million report some level of disability, the burden of care is substantive for individuals and health system.  With such conditions, self-care is essential but may pose challenges to both individuals and providers of care.  As a concept, self-care is poorly understood. Further, evidence for effective self-care support is diffuse and typically studied relative to specific conditions.  &#xD;
Objectives&#xD;
To investigate the concept of self-care three objectives were undertaken:  1) explore and describe the construct of self-care as understood by individuals/families, health care professionals, researchers, policy-makers; and industry; 2) produce new knowledge for health care professionals about interventions for self-care across a range of population groups; 3) develop a provisional framework to inform practice and research.&#xD;
Method	&#xD;
A multi-phase enquiry was undertaken. Phase 1 Concept clarification including: 1) synthesis of qualitative evidence on the experience of self-care reported by individuals/families; 2)  content analysis and definitional study of the meaning  of self-care;  3) concept analysis of self-care; 4) creation of a conceptual schema encompassing these perspectives.  Phase 2 Self-care Interventions: Integrative study of systematic reviews, synthesizing evidence for self-care interventions from multiple disease/impairment groupings.&#xD;
Results 	&#xD;
Three modes of self-care were revealed : ‘Care of self’ self-care performed on one’s own behalf; ‘care by other’ acknowledging individuals with disabilities who guide and direct care provided by another person; and ‘care of other’- care of families and others at a community level.  Analysis of 30 self-care interventions across 16 conditions demonstrated that educational sessions and self-care management plans are emerging as effective strategies to support and guide self-care.&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
Self-care is a complex care concept that is becoming an expected element in today’s health care environment. A full understanding of how it is viewed, including the individual’s perspective, is vital for enactment and beneficial support.  This comprehensive understanding of the concept along with evidence for effective interventions drawn from multiple groups will assist health care professionals to improve their assessments and provide them with strategies to support self-care needs –ultimately,  contributing to enabling individuals to maintain their highest level of functioning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a medical imaging method that measures tissue structure. This is valuable when applied to the central nervous system (CNS) because it can provide structural information about white matter tracts. DTI of the spinal cord has been suggested as the next great leap in clinical diagnostics for spinal cord injury and disease because it may provide a measurable correlate of the physical structure of the cord with the associated functional deficit. Collecting precise structural information from the site of injury could be used to improve diagnostics and guide treatments. While these are the long term goals of DTI research, there are currently fundamental questions with regards to image resolution and motion-related artifacts in spinal cord which have not been thoroughly addressed. DTI is a sensitive imaging method which requires multiple mathematical calculations and approximations to complete. The limitations of the method compound with the limitations of imaging the spinal cord leading to the query: How reliable is DTI in the spinal cord? It is the goal of this study to begin to address these concerns. &#xD;
&#xD;
First, the effect of spinal cord motion on tissue discrimination was examined by comparing DTI results obtained in the presence and absence of a correctional measure for cardiac-induced motion called 'cardiac gating'. Tissue discriminability was found to be greatest in the cervical cord. Second, DTI results were subjected to two classification algorithms and compared with known anatomy to assess tissue discrimination accuracy as well as the types of associated errors. The proportion of errors in tissue classification was very high, presenting itself in all subjects. This result indicated that the DTI values associated with particular tissues were not unique to only those tissues. Finally, a theoretical model was implemented to assess the degree to which image resolution specifically affected the tissue classification accuracy obtained in the above experiments, as opposed to other errors such as MRI ghosting, blurring or distortions. It was found that DTI provides a systematically biased representation of spinal cord tissues. To overcome this limitation, future studies should concentrate efforts on increasing image resolution.</dcterms:abstract>

Methods: Kingston Gets Active distributes the Grade 5 Community PA Pass to approximately 2,500 grade 5 students in Kingston and surrounding areas yearly. The pass grants students free access to local pools (n=4), YMCA (n=1), and arenas (n=8) for recreational PA for 10 months. In fall 2006, 292 grade 5 students (54% girls; mean age=9.99, SD=0.35) from 24 elementary schools completed a baseline (BL) questionnaire that assessed demographics, children’s PA levels, PA facility use, and family support for PA. In spring 2007, 272 students completed a follow-up (FU) questionnaire with additional items assessing pass use. In spring 2007, 189 parents (83% mothers) participated in a telephone interview assessing family PA variables and community resources influencing pass and PA facility use.&#xD;
Results: The majority of students (69%) reported using their pass at least once; and although children’s PA did increase (t(230) = -4.91, p &lt; .05), free-play PA facility use did not increase from BL to FU. Multiple hierarchical regression analysis indicated that individual-level variables were better predictors of children’s PA (ΔR2 = .28, F(2, 136) = 26.99, p &lt; .001) and their free-play PA facility use (ΔR2 = .36, F(4, 151) = 21.55, p &lt; .001) as compared to family-level PA variables (children’s PA: ΔR2 = .001, F(3, 133) = 0.089, p =.97; free-play PA facility use: ΔR2 = .007, F(3, 148) = 0.54, p =.65). Parents indicated that other social, organizational, and community factors influenced children’s free-play PA facility use. &#xD;
Conclusions: Children’s PA and free-play PA facility use are influenced by a multitude of interrelated factors within the socio-ecological model. More research should explore associations between family factors and children’s free-play PA facility use.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents the design and analysis of two high speed analog laser driver stages (LDS) for use in a passive optical network (PON) upstream burst-mode transmitter (BM-Tx) using low cost complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) technology.  The maturation of CMOS technology has lead to aggressive scaling of device sizes which has made it an increasingly attractive technology for high speed analog design.  CMOS provides high levels of integration as it is the industry standard for digital circuits, analog and digital systems can share one substrate reducing costs.  Additionally CMOS is a more cost effective solution than traditional expensive high speed analog substrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
A 2.5 Gbps LDS fabricated in 0.18 um CMOS technology is presented.  The LDS uses a two stage per-amplifier.  Stage one consists of a cascode differential pair with a source follower voltage buffer, while stage two consists of a shunt inductively peaked differential pair using active inductors.  A differential pair composed of large transistors is used in an open drain configuration for the output stage.  Measurements of S-parameters are presented which accurately agree with simulations. Electrical eye diagram measurements are presented which demonstrate the LDS is able to provide a modulation current of 14.6-58 mA.  10%-90% approximate rise/fall times of 230/260 ps was obtained for a modulation current of 58 mA.  Power consumption of the core was determined to be 68.5 mW, while the chip consumed an area of 0.8 mm x 0.7 mm including pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
A 10 Gbps LDS fabricated in 0.18 um CMOS technology is also presented.  The LDS uses a cascode differential pair for the output stage.  The per-amplifier for this design consists of a differential pair and utilizes spiral inductors for series inductive peaking between the per-amplifier and output stage.  Measurements of S-parameters are presented which accurately agree with simulations.  Electrical eye diagram measurements are presented which demonstrate the LDS is able to provide a modulation current of 22.6-62 mA.  10%-90% rise/fall time of 87 ps and 75 ps are respectively obtained while operating at maximum modulation current.  The core of the LDS consumes a power of 287 mW, while the chip consumed an area of 0.79 mm x 0.7mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
The measured electrical eye diagrams for the 2.5 Gbps and the 10 Gbps meet the timing requirements for the GPON standard.  Further work is needed to investigate whether or not the timing requirements would still be met once the CMOS chips are integrated with commercial laser diodes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many recent discoveries in animal cognition have shown that species once thought to be relatively simple are in fact capable of complex problem-solving in accordance with their ecological needs. These findings have resulted from experiments designed with the evolutionary history of the focal species in mind. Transitive inference (TI), the abiliy to infer the ordering of non-adjacent objects within a series, is a cognitive skill once thought to be exclusive to humans. Now considered a litmus-test for logical-relational reasoning, TI is thought to have evolved in social species in order to help track dominance relationships. Although recent work has shown that animals can display TI, it has yet to be demonstrated in the natural context in which it evolved. Songbirds may use TI to gain relative dominance information about others during countersinging interactions, through their use of network communication. Here I demonstrate that black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) use TI to judge the relative rank of unknown territorial intruders during the breeding season using dominance information provided through song contests. Using a multispeaker playback, I provided focal males with the relative ranks of three simulated “males” through two countersinging interactions (A &gt; B, B &gt; C). I predicted that when presented with the non-adjacent pair (A and C) with no relative rank information provided, focal males would choose to defend against the intruder they perceived as the greater threat. Consistent with my predictions, the majority of focal males approached “male” A. Additionally, male responses were influenced by age, with older males (in their second or later breeding season) approaching the dominant intruder more consistently than younger males (in their first breeding season). This is the first instance of TI being demonstrated in a natural population of untrained animals, and has important implications for the understanding of songbird communication networks. Transitive inference may be used in several natural situations by chickadees throughout the breeding season and a number of possible avenues for future TI research are discussed. Additionally, methods are suggested for the examination of TI during the non-breeding season.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>INTRODUCTION: Use of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine through Ontario’s $117 million program has been low, reaching only half of the eligible population. Safety concerns have been identified as a major barrier to vaccine uptake. In order to maximize the benefits of this program, it is necessary to understand factors associated with vaccine use and address parental safety concerns. DESIGN: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of girls eligible for Ontario’s Grade 8 HPV vaccination program in 2007 and 2008 residing in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (KFL&amp;A) health region. METHODS: Using data from the province’s administrative databases, we described the patterns of use of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, identified factors associated with this use, and assessed the vaccine’s safety with respect to the risk of autoimmune diseases. To assess vaccine use, cross-tabulations were used to determine the vaccination and adherence status of girls according to socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Logistic regression was used to estimate the strength of these associations. To assess the risk of autoimmune diseases, we identified all new cases of selected autoimmune diseases diagnosed during study follow-up. Juvenile arthritis was the only condition for which there were sufficient cases to permit further analysis. Rate ratios for juvenile arthritis were estimated using a self-matched analysis. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 2519 girls eligible for publicly funded HPV vaccination in KFL&amp;A, 56.6% of whom received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine and 48.2% of whom received all three doses. Vaccinated and unvaccinated girls differed only on the basis of vaccination history, whereas adherers and non-adherers differed on the basis of socio-demographics. The risk of juvenile arthritis was more than four times higher in the 60 days following HPV vaccination than in other time periods (RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.36-13.73). This risk appeared to vary across time. CONCLUSION: The results of this thesis provide new evidence of an increased risk of juvenile arthritis following quadrivalent HPV vaccination in girls aged approximately 13-15 years. Moreover, it demonstrates differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls, as well as adherers and non-adherers that have potential policy implications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is well established that people experience a decline in cognitive functions, such as selective attention (SA), as they get older. SA is the ability to focus on task-relevant information and suppress task-irrelevant information. The Stroop task has been used to assess SA. In the current study, the neural correlates of SA were investigated using functional MRI-Stroop task with cognitively normal older adults (NC), patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD). &#xD;
   The current study reanalyzed previous master student’s data, due to the disagreement in analyzing the data. In the fMRI data analysis, the contrast of correct responses in the naming incongruent color (SC) condition minus correct responses in the reading incongruent word (RW) condition (SC-RW) in series 2a and 2b was reanalyzed using an event-related analysis. &#xD;
   The current Stroop experiment was in a block design with four series: series 0, series 1, series 2a and 2b. In behavioral analysis, the performance of the word-reading task was expected to be significantly better than the color-naming task in series 1, series 2a and 2b because the belief that reading incongruent color word was always an easier task than the color-naming task. The results from behavioral analysis showed that significant more errors were made in reading incongruent color words in series 2a and 2b than in series 1. In the functional MRI data analysis, although brain activation associated with inhibition was expected in the contrast of SC-RW of series 2a &amp; 2b, the results did not show any brain activation. The unexpected results could be due to the RSE that was elicited by the task switching paradigm of series 2a and 2b. The results suggest that the current Stroop task adapted from the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test may not yield a Stroop interference effect of sufficient magnitude to be detected with fMRI in the contrast of SC-RW of series 2a and 2b.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Action video games have been shown to improve the visual cognitive abilities of those who played them for as little as ten hours when compared to those who played a control non-action video game for the same period (Green &amp; Bavelier, 2003).  The purpose of the current study was to examine which specific traits of action video games are responsible for which specific changes in visual cognition occurring while playing action video games.  To test this, the visual cognitive abilities of participants were measured using a battery of five tasks before and after ten hours of practice with one of four versions of a simplified action video game.  The battery was chosen to measure different aspects of the visual cognitive system.  The Useful Field of View task measures the amount of visual angle the participant can actively attend to at any given time, the spatial limit of visual attention.  The Attentional Blink task measures the ability to monitor one location over time, the temporal flexibility of visual attention.  The Flanker task measures  interference of a task-irrelevant object on a primary task, and is thought to provide an indirect measure of attentional capacity.  The Visual Reaction Time task was intended to be a measure of visual apprehension speed and response generation.  The Visual Search task was intended to measure the ability to find and identify a target amongst distractors.  Participants were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions in a 2X2 factorial design manipulating the rate at which targets appeared and the maximum eccentricity at which the targets appeared during training. The paradigm provided evidence that faster target training rates caused a marginal improvement over the slow rates in the Useful Field of View task from pre-training to post-training. Training with the fast target rate caused greater improvement than the slow rate on the Attentional Blink at only lag 2 and and a reversed effect at lag 6. All groups improved from pre-training to post-training on the Useful Field of View, Attentional Blink and Visual Search tasks. However, there was no differential effect for the narrow and wide training eccentricities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“Renewing Homeland and Place” explores the complex intertwining of evangelical Christianity and notions of place and homeland in Algonquian communities in southern New England during the eighteenth century.  In particular, this dissertation examines the participation of Algonquian men and women in the Protestant evangelical revivals known generally as the “First Great Awakening,” the adoption of New Light beliefs and practices within Algonquian communities, and the ways in which the Christian faith shaped and informed Algonquian understandings of place and community, and the protection of their lands.  Mohegan, Pequot, Niantic, Narragansett, and Montaukett people living in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and on Long Island (New York) struggled continually throughout the eighteenth century to protect their land, resources, and livelihoods from colonial encroachment and dispossession.  Christianity provided many Algonquians with beliefs, practices, and rituals that renewed, rather than erased, the spiritual and sustaining values they attached to their lands and that strengthened, rather than diminished, the kinship ties and sense of community that linked their settlements together.  Equally as significant, the adoption of Christian beliefs and practices brought to the surface the dynamic and contested nature of community and place, and the varying ways in which Algonquians responded to colonization.  As a number of Algonquians attended formal schools, assumed roles as ministers and teachers within their own settlements and among the Haudenosaunee in New York, and formed their own churches, they disagreed within their communities over issues of land use and political authority, and between their communities over the best response to the infringements they continued to suffer.  By the 1770s a number of Christian leaders began to consider relocation to Oneida lands in New York as a solution to the land loss and impoverishment they faced in New England.  While many Algonquians left their coastal homelands for central New York in the 1780s to form the Christian community of Brotherton, a number of Christians remained behind, highlighting the varying paths of adaptation and survival that Natives tread by the end of the century.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stress contributes to both the initiation and maintenance of drug use. Drug intake, specifically alcohol, may be reinforced under stressful conditions by reducing anxiety or tension. The pharmacological effects of alcohol, however, cannot account entirely for the tension-reducing experience of intoxication. This suggests that cognitive factors contribute to the stress-dampening effects of alcohol. This study examined this hypothesis by testing how tension-reduction alcohol expectancies moderate the relationship between stress and alcohol intoxication. Stress response was operationalized as an increase in subjective anxiety and impaired sustained attention. Verbal learning, which was hypothesized to not be impaired by the stressor, was used as a cognitive control. One hundred and nine undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of five groups (low, medium or high dose alcohol; sober; or placebo). Following beverage consumption, participants completed cognitive tasks before and after the Trier Social Stress Test. Participants completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – State upon arrival in the lab, as well as pre- and post-stressor. They also completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – Trait and the College Drinking Influences Survey, which includes a Stress Reduction scale. Social stress did not hinder cognitive performance, whereas alcohol impaired sustained attention and verbal learning abilities. The stressor evoked a subjective stress response that was reduced by alcohol and the expectancy of alcohol (i.e., placebo). There was no evidence to suggest that tension reduction alcohol expectancies moderated this effect. These findings replicate alcohol’s ability to dampen a stress response and, furthermore, demonstrate that the expectancy of alcohol is as effective as the drug itself in reducing subjective response to stress. This study highlights the need for further research to elucidate which factors modulate the stress-dampening effect of alcohol in undergraduate students. This knowledge, in turn, could present an opportunity for screening and early interventions to circumvent problem drinking as alcohol consumption is used by this population to cope with stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spinal needle injections for back pain management are frequently carried out in hospitals and radiological clinics. Currently, these procedures are performed under fluoroscopy or CT guidance in specialized interventional radiology facilities. As an alternative, the use of inexpensive ultrasound image guidance promises to improve the efficacy and safety of these procedures. We propose to eliminate or reduce the need for ionizing radiation, by creating and registering a statistical shape model of the lumbar vertebrae to 3D ultrasound volumes of patient, using a groupwise registration algorithm. From a total of 35 patient CT volumes, a statistical shape model of the L2, L3 and L4 vertebrae is built, including the mean shape, and principal modes of variation. The statistical shape model is registered to the 3D ultrasound by interchangeably optimizing the model parameters and their relative poses. We also use a biomechanical model to constrain the relative motion of the models throughout the registration process. Validation is performed on three tissue mimicking-phantoms designed to preserve realistic curvature of the spine. We compare pairwise and groupwise registration of the statistical shape model of the spine and demonstrate that clinically acceptable mean target error registration of 2.4 mm can be achieved with the proposed method. Registration results also show that the groupwise registration outperforms the pairwise in terms of success rate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Complex deformation processes observed in massive slow-moving, active, landslides are contributed to by topography, non-uniform shear surfaces, heterogeneous rockmass and shear zone strength characteristics, composite failure mechanisms and hydrogeology.  This thesis provides a systematic means to account for geology, geomorphology and geomechanics when interpreting slope deformation processes.  Significant contributions to the field of landslide geomechanics have been made by analyzing how spatially discriminated slope deformations are influenced by spatial variation of geological and geotechnical factors and temporal changes in piezometric levels.&#xD;
The Downie and Beauregard landslides are massive instabilities that have extensive histories of slope monitoring and observational assessment, and where detailed site investigations have been completed.  A methodology has been developed for the interpretation of 3-dimensional shear zone geometries using spatial prediction algorithms complemented by sound engineering judgment.  The applicability of this process to other spatial data, such as displacement or piezometric records and measurements of material properties is demonstrated.  Composite landslide deformations have been analyzed for both Downie and Beauregard to characterize global slope behaviour and identify localized events.  Furthermore, a new interpretation of landslide morphological regions at Downie is provided.  &#xD;
The research presented in this thesis demonstrates the importance and value of 3-dimensional numerical modelling. A rigorous procedure to numerically simulate large landslides has been developed.  This sophisticated method accounts for complex geometries, heterogeneous shear zone strength parameters, internal shears, interaction between discrete landslide zones and piezometric fluctuations.  This advance in state-of-the-art landslide modelling provides an important tool for investigating dynamic landslide systems. &#xD;
Based on Downie and Beauregard field data numerical models have been calibrated to reproduce observed slope behaviour.  The calibration process has provided insight on key factors controlling massive slope mechanics.  Calibrated models are used to investigate how trigger scenarios may accelerate deformations at Downie and the effectiveness of a proposed slope drainage system at Beauregard.  The ability to reproduce observed behaviour and forward test hypothesized changes to boundary conditions has valuable application in landslide hazard management. The capacity of decision makers to interpret large amounts of data, respond to rapid changes in a system and understand complex slope dynamics has been enhanced.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this research was to describe the experience of moral distress among regulated and unregulated nursing personnel employed in Long Term Care (LTC) facilities. The specific research questions were: 1) Do regulated and unregulated nursing personnel experience moral distress? 2) What is the nature of moral distress in LTC facilities? 3) How do nursing personnel describe and perceive the experience of moral distress? 4) What are the organizational factors that participants perceive as contributing to or reducing moral distress in their workplace?&#xD;
A qualitative, descriptive, study design was used.  Semi-structured interviews were the method of data collection and analysis was conducted using thematic content analysis as proposed by Miles and Huberman’s (1994).  A purposive sample of 16 participants was recruited from two LTC facilities.&#xD;
Participants described work experiences in which they felt they were unable to do the “right thing”.  There were four kinds of situations that gave rise to moral distress:  end of life care, resident behaviours, other direct care provider behaviours and the work environment.  The experience of moral distress was described in terms of an initial emotional reaction, followed by a response, with resolved or unresolved outcomes.  Half of the examples described by participants as giving rise to moral distress, remained unresolved.  Participants also identified organizational factors that prevented moral distress and assisted with its resolution such as, educational courses, administrative leadership and pastoral support.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The present thesis investigates the friction properties of total knee replacement components using lubricating fluids of different composition and rheology. The first stage of the thesis involves characterization of the rheological properties of hyaluronic acid (HA)/bovine calf serum (BCS) solutions. With increased concentration and molecular weight of HA, higher viscosities and more pronounced shear thinning in steady shear flow was observed. In dynamic oscillatory flow, the elastic character of the solutions became more pronounced and the cross-over frequency decreased upon increasing concentration and molecular weight of HA. &#xD;
&#xD;
The second part of the thesis involves the determination of a method by which the coefficient of friction is estimated using a linear reciprocating wear testing machine with spherical metal indenters articulating on flat UHMWPE samples and deionised (D.I.) water lubrication. A characteristic periodic pattern in the friction behaviour was observed and the coefficient of friction was computed by calculating the average of 30 points about the midpoint between reversals and using the average of three cycles. &#xD;
&#xD;
The third part of the thesis involves the investigation of the effect of fluid composition on the coefficient of friction in knee replacement components. With increased concentration of HA in solution (0-1mg/mL), the coefficient of friction of HA/BCS solutions decreased.  However, with HA/BCS solutions of higher HA concentrations (above 1mg/mL), no significant difference in the coefficient of friction was observed. Similar behavior was observed with HA/Albumin solutions. With HA/ D.I. water solutions, the coefficient of friction was almost identical irrespective of the concentration of HA in solution. Significant difference in the rheological properties of HA/D.I. water solutions did not affect the coefficient of friction. The Stribeck analysis revealed that the coefficient of friction with HA/BCS and HA/D.I. water lubrication was not governed by hydrodynamic conditions. &#xD;
&#xD;
The fourth part of this thesis involved characterization of lubricating fluids before and after friction testing. Absorbance and dynamic light scattering measurements of HA/BCS solutions and of HA/Albumin solutions indicate a rise in turbidity and the presence of larger size particles in these solutions after friction testing.  The ninhydrin test confirmed the presence of protein in the precipitates obtained following testing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stair negotiation has been identified by older adults as one of the most challenging locomotor tasks, one that is associated with a high risk for falls and serious injury.  Currently lacking is a comprehensive understanding of the lower limb during stair negotiation in an older adult population.  It has been identified that more research is needed to determine key determinants of difficulty and safety on stairs.  The objective of this thesis was to investigate lower limb kinematics and kinetics during stair negotiation and evaluate the impact of handrail use on stair ambulation in young adults, older adults, and older adults with a fear of falling (FOF).&#xD;
The four studies that make up this dissertation provide a detailed picture of the lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics during stair ambulation, as well as provide insight into the role of handrail use and FOF in performance of stair negotiation.&#xD;
Specifically, in the first study principal component analysis (PCA) was used, of the scores generated from the PCA models four principal component (PC) scores were identified that could be used to correctly classify 95% of young and older adults.  The second study provided a comprehensive data set of lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics during stair negotiation. The third study identified comparable centre of pressure velocities (VCOP) between young adults and older adults during stair negotiation with and without a handrail. Whereas older adults with FOF demonstrated reduced VCOP during stair negotiation without a handrail and further reduced VCOP when using the handrail. Furthermore, no significant difference in lower limb moments during stair negotiation with and without a handrail were found in older adults, as was similar for older adults with FOF. However, a gait assessment revealed that older adults with FOF demonstrated differences from ‘normal’ gait patterns during stair negotiation with and without a handrail.&#xD;
These studies provide a comprehensive normative dataset of the lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics during stair negotiation, as well as provide insight into the role of handrail use and fear of falling in performance of stair ambulation. It is important to appreciate the nature and extent of normal age-related adaption and compensatory strategies to identify unique patterns of movement due to the superimposition of pathology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Being one of the most active research topics in the computer vision field, automatic human gesture recognition is receiving increasing attention driven by its promising applications, ranging from surveillance and human monitoring, human-computer interface (HCI), and motion analysis, etc. Segmentation and recognition of human&#xD;
dynamic gestures from continuous video streams is considered to be a highly challenging task due to the spatio-temporal variation and endpoint localization issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we propose a Motion Signature, which is a 3D spatio-temporal surface based upon the evolution of a contour over time, to reliably represent dynamic motion.  A Gesture Model, is&#xD;
then constructed by a set of mean and variance images of Motion Signatures in a multi-scale manner, which not only is able to&#xD;
accommodate a wide range of spatio-temporal variation, but also has the advantage of requiring only a small amount of training data.&#xD;
&#xD;
Three approaches have been proposed to simultaneously segment and recognize gestures from continuous streams, which mainly differ in the way that the endpoints of gestures are located.  While the first&#xD;
approach adopts an explicit multi-scale search strategy to find the endpoints of the gestures, the other two employ Dynamic Programming (DP) to handle this issue.  All the three methods are rooted in the&#xD;
idea that segmentation and recognition are actually the two aspects of the same problem, and that the solution to either one of them will lead to the solution of the other.  This is novel to most methods in the literature, which separate segmentation and&#xD;
recognition into two phases, and perform segmentation before recognition by looking into abrupt motion feature changes.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The performance of the methods has been evaluated and compared on two types of gestures: two arms movement and a single hand movement.&#xD;
Experimental results have shown that all three methods achieved high recognition rates, ranging from 88% to 96% for upper body&#xD;
gestures, with the last one outperforming the other two.  The single hand experiment also suggested that the proposed method has the potential to be applied to the application of continuous sign language recognition.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The prevalence of child sexual abuse remains high with girls 1.5 to 3 times more likely to be victims compared to boys. In addition to psychological and emotional challenges, this abuse can lead to spiritual difficulties that impact survivors’ ability to find meaning in their life, find a sense of purpose, experience hope or believe in a world that is just. Spirituality can facilitate healing and this study contributes to that knowledge base by exploring women’s own perspectives. &#xD;
The purpose of this qualitative narrative study is to understand, from women’s perspectives, the role of spiritual experiences in their healing from the impacts of child sexual abuse. Spiritual experiences were defined as any experiences that have a different reality or feeling compared to our usual everyday reality that may seem extraordinary or unexplainable, or very ordinary yet meaningful. Twenty in-depth individual interviews were conducted with ten women survivors of child sexual abuse. Narrative analysis methods were used to derive key themes that represent participants’ perspectives of how spiritual experiences enhance healing. &#xD;
Results of this study show that spiritual experiences opened doorways to self, shifted energy, expanded perspective, revealed truths, connected to the present moment, created possibilities of the positive and were an enduring source of support and strength. Spiritual experiences create inter-connections between aspects of the self that can simultaneously transcend the self and connect to the larger world thereby unifying each into a greater whole. These impacts prevail even when there is dissonance in the interpretation. Occupations facilitated spiritual experiences by acting as a portal to a spiritual dimension, transcending language and mind, facilitating internal communication, connecting to the body through doing and through innate healing qualities. &#xD;
Engaging in respectful dialogue on spiritual experiences requires reflection and awareness in the use of bias-free language. Health professionals are well situated to address spiritual experiences, using evidence-based practice and an understanding of embodied experience. Occupational therapists have a key role in validating spiritual experiences, facilitating the engagement in spiritual occupations, and providing resources to understand and interpret the experiences.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Given the high prevalence of physical inactivity, effective strategies are urgently needed to increase physical activity levels among youth, especially those most at risk for inactivity including adolescent girls, older adolescents, and youth from low socioeconomic status households. A clear understanding of the factors associated with physical activity among youth is needed to design effective interventions. Physical activity is a complex behaviour that is influenced by intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental factors. Most recently, emphasis has been placed on the environmental correlates of youth physical activity. One consistent finding is that access to recreation facilities and opportunities to be active are positively associated with youths’ physical activity participation.  &#xD;
Environmental interventions, which are often community-based, hold particular promise of instilling population-wide change. Yet, to date, little information is available about the effectiveness of environmental interventions to enhance youth physical activity in community settings. &#xD;
The manuscript presented in Chapter 3 of this thesis addresses these gaps in knowledge by providing evidence about a community-based initiative designed to increase access to recreation facilities by eliminating facility user-fees for youth. More specifically, recreation facility use among adolescents (n=1261; Mage = 14.97 ± 0.39; 46.3% girls) was objectively measured and the factors associated with the use of recreation facilities were examined. A total of 200 students accessed at least one facility. Results revealed that the likelihood of the best multilevel model examining pass use was 13 times larger than a model that included only individual-level predictors (p&lt; 0.01). Pass users were more likely to: attend schools that were only a short distance away from facilities (OR=0.90 p&lt; 0.01), be active (OR=1.69, p&lt; 0.05), rate their health as fair (OR=2.32, p&lt; 0.05), report homework as a barrier (OR=1.84, p&lt; 0.01) and to have used facilities previously (OR=2.01, p&lt; 0.05). Overall, results suggest that providing free access may be insufficient to enable adolescents to use recreation facilities. Furthermore, an ecological model should be used when designing interventions that aim to increase adolescents’ use of facilities. The implications of this study for research and practice will be outlined.&#xD;
Although further research is greatly needed to enhance our understanding of youths’ behaviours in order to develop effective interventions, the challenges associated with conducting research involving youth can deter researchers from investigating this population.  In particular, several researchers have highlighted the methodological and ethical concerns of school-based research. These issues and their implications will be discussed in Chapter 4 of this thesis.  Lastly, recommendations to help reduce the challenges of school-based research will be presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study establishes how rail transportation systems and their filmic and literary representations form and inform culture and identity, particularly in the new German capital and by extension its new Berlin Republic. Where, how, and by whom mobility is practiced influences the city and vice versa. Historically, Berlin’s U-Bahn and S-Bahn system, have mirrored physical and emotional changes in the urban landscape. They have also been an important platform for the exchange of cultural information through networks of shared knowledge among Berlin’s diverse groups of citizens. This situation continues into today. Both studies about urban rail transport and more traditional cultural texts suggest the communicative possibilities of such public mobility infrastructure. Interactions that occur on the Bahn system can engender possibilities for a new nation based on a multicultural society and constitutional patriotism, rather than one based on blood-and-soil type ideologies. Theoretical and fictional work also suggests that public rail transport is a litmus test, registering, for instance, the significant tensions of unification including increasing economic disparity and a resurgence of racialized violence. Cultural texts in particular sketch a mass exodus of citizens from the Bahn system and depict an increase of privately owned vehicles and bicycles being used to access the city. How does the figurative and perhaps real world removal of these travelers from the culture-building dialogues that occur on Berlin’s rail transportation signify for the future? Cultural representations of the Bahns provide unique perspectives into the past, the present, and the prospective future of Berlin.  As ciphers, they participate in the rich cultural code of Berlin, a city between worlds and central to German national identity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigated the monitoring and analysis of signals related to the vibration of large rotary blasthole drills. The research focused on a machine with electric drilling actuators: such machines are used as primary production equipment in the drill‐and‐blast cycle of the surface (open‐pit) mining process. The performance of such machines is limited by the onset of severe vibrations, which can arise due to the interaction of geology, bit, drill string, machine structure, and control settings. Experimental data for the thesis were obtained during field periods at an iron ore mine in Minnesota’s Mesabi Iron Range. The data acquisition and signal analysis techniques which were utilized are presented, including smoothing of signals and calculated variables such as specific energy. Ambient vibration sources and vibration aliasing issues are investigated. Results from analyzing structural response tests indicate that, as expected, the natural frequency of the drill mast decreases with increasing bit depth – although the mounting position of accelerometers distorts this trend. The pull down force (weight on bit) is shown to have no appreciable impact on the mast’s natural frequency, nor on the mast’s damping ratio. A strong relationship between rotary speed and the dominant vibration frequency peaks at 3x and 6x rotary speed is demonstrated, and a physical explanation of the 6x vibration peak is postulated. The rotary motor current is shown to consistently exhibit frequency peaks at 3x and 6x rotation speed, indicating that this variable is a good candidate for use either as a substitute for accelerometer feedback, or as an auxiliary signal to detect down‐the‐hole vibration when it is not manifested by the mast mounted accelerometers. System identification is used to demonstrate that the dynamic relationship between vibration and rotary current, while it can be modeled locally, varies with depth and geology and hence is essentially a time‐varying process. This results in the amplitude of rotary current not being usable as a proxy for vibration amplitude. Nonetheless, it is demonstrated that the root‐mean‐square (RMS) of the low frequency current oscillations, in a nonlinear combination with the RMS of the current signal as a whole, may be able to serve as a proxy for the RMS of the vibration signal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The deinstitutionalization movement formalized the role of the family caregiver in mental health, yet the needs of these family caregivers have received little attention.  Additionally, while a wide body of literature has focused on the effects of socio-demographic factors and level of social support on caregiver well-being, less attention has been paid to the nature of the caregiving relationship.  This study aimed to address this gap by developing and assessing scales to measure two indicators of the nature of the caregiver-care recipient relationship: intensity of care and life interference, and to use these scales to assess the relationship between these constructs and caregiver physical health.&#xD;
Methods: Using data from a national survey of members of the Schizophrenia Society of Canada, we employed reliability and factor analyses to evaluate whether the multiple items describing the caregiving role from the Caregiver Survey could be combined to form reliable and novel intensity of care and life interference scales.  We then employed least squares regression to examine these constructs as predictors of physical health.&#xD;
Results: Factor analysis of the ten items describing intensity of care revealed one strong factor accounting for 44.0% of variance.  The Intensity of Care Scale revealed high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha=0.85).  Two underlying factors emerged for the life interference items, one accounting for 60.0% of variance and the other for 8.8%.  Cronbach’s alpha for the 10-item Daily Life Interference Scale was 0.95.  For the 5-item Peace of Mind Interference Scale, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.88.  Based on a least squares regression, these scale scores were not significant predictors of physical health. A decline/fluctuation in physical health status as a result of caregiving, lower reported emotional health, and older age predicted lower current physical health ratings and this model accounted for 37.5% of variance.&#xD;
Conclusions: This study contributed three novel and internally consistent scales to the literature to be used and further refined.  It also added to the limited body of literature aimed at identifying characteristics of high-risk caregivers and shed light on potential future research directions to ultimately ensure that interventions can be directed towards those at greatest risk of caregiver burnout.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Phenotypic traits that vary geographically within species are commonly assumed to represent local adaptations to different environments. In order for local adaptation to evolve by natural selection, three conditions must be met: (1) traits must vary geographically, (2) local variants of traits must provide a fitness advantage (increased survival or reproductive success) within the local environment, and (3) local variants of traits must be heritable. In chapter two, we review evidence for local adaptation in birds. Geographic variation among populations is nearly ubiquitous, yet experimental tests of the fitness advantages of local trait variants are rare among populations of birds, presumably because of the difficulties in transporting individuals between populations. Thirty-seven studies have tested the heritability of among population variation in traits. Thirty-three of the 37 studies found some degree of heritability of variation among populations, consistent with traits diverging in response to natural selection. In chapter three, we experimentally test the fitness consequences of divergent nest morphologies of Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) using reciprocal nest transplant experiments between a temperate and subarctic site in Canada. Yellow Warblers breeding at our subarctic site build larger nests constructed with more insulative materials than Yellow Warblers breeding at our temperate site, and these differences are the result of different nest building behaviours. Temperate nests transplanted to subarctic sites experienced significantly colder temperatures, and tended to suffer higher egg and nestling mortality due to climatic conditions (cold temperatures), than locally transplanted subarctic nests. Adult females breeding in subarctic sites that received temperate nests changed their incubation behaviours by taking shorter recesses than females who received locally transplanted subarctic nests. In contrast, subarctic nests transplanted to our temperate site showed no changes in nest temperature, fledgling success, or parental behaviour during incubation. We suggest that divergent selective pressures acting on Yellow Warblers in subarctic and temperate environments results in different nest building behaviours. Cold temperatures in our subarctic site likely favour increased investment in larger, insulative nests, whereas warmer temperatures at our temperate sites likely favour reduced investment in nest building, and consequently smaller nests.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Species interactions can provide organisms with access to novel traits without having to evolve these traits themselves. Viewing such interactions as an alternative to trait evolution offers a new perspective to understanding species interactions—organisms can bypass evolutionary constraints and gain access to adaptive traits by co-opting them from other species. I explore the costs and benefits of trait co-option and generate 10 hypotheses for when and where selection might favor the co-option of traits as an alternative to typical trait evolution (Chapter 2). Next, I examine a possible case of trait co-option in nature, involving numerous species of birds that use aromatic seed-material from plants in the genus Eriocephalus to construct their nests (Chapter 3). I describe the bird-Eriocephalus interaction and focus on a single species of bird, the Karoo prinia (Prinia maculosa), which uses large amounts of Eriocephalus in their nests. Although previous work has suggested that both birds and plants benefit from their interaction, prinias gathered large quantities of E. racemosus seed fluff but avoided seeds, providing limited dispersal benefits to the plant. The time and effort invested into gathering fluff suggests that this material benefits prinias. I test two hypotheses for the fitness benefits of Eriocephalus material in bird nests—that chemical compounds reduced levels of nest ectoparasites (Chapter 4) and rates of nest predation by a specialist predator, the rhombic egg-eating snake (Dasypeltis scabra) (Chapter 5). Chemical compounds reduced levels of nest ectoparasites by functioning as either a deterrent to gravid female parasites, or as an ovicide. I found no evidence that chemical compounds reduced rates of nest predation from egg-eating snakes. Overall, these observations and experiments suggest that Karoo prinias benefit from co-opting Eriocephalus compounds for use in nest construction, likely at the expense of the plant. Overall, interactions similar to those involving prinias and Eriocephalus are widespread in nature, yet rarely are they viewed as an alternative to trait evolution. Viewing species interactions from the perspective of trait co-option and evolution has the potential to elucidate general patterns for when and which species should interact, broadening our understanding of nature and biodiversity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis describes an investigation of how carbon dioxide triggered switchable additives affect colloidal interactions found in oil sands, in an effort to identify potential candidates for industrial use.&#xD;
	Chemical force spectrometry was used to evaluate adhesion forces present in model oil sand systems.  Organic/mineral and mineral/mineral interactions were investigated in the presence of cationic and anionic switchable surfactants, as well as switchable ionic strength additives.  Of the additives studied, cationic switchable surfactants caused the greatest change in adhesion force between solutions free of CO2 and solutions saturated with CO2.  These trends were consistent across all of the systems examined.&#xD;
	The effect of switchable additives on clay suspension behavior was studied by zeta potential measurements.  The stability of clay suspensions are a problem in tailings disposal because fine mineral matter in recycled process water are detrimental to bitumen extraction.  Cationic and anionic switchable surfactants were investigated, as were switchable ionic strength additives.  Switchable ionic strength additives demonstrated the ability to suppress clay zeta potential to nearly zero upon exposure to CO2.  It was demonstrated that destabilization of clay suspensions can be achieved upon exposure of aqueous solutions containing the additives to CO2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of litigiousness on the information role of accounting conservatism. Prior literature documents the information role of accounting conservatism, measured by the positive association between earnings conservatism and information asymmetry between inside managers and outside investors. Prior literature also demonstrates that shareholder litigation concerns motivate managers and auditors to be conservative in preparing financial statements because conservatism shields managers and auditors from allegations that they overstated earnings and net assets. In a more litigious environment, both managers and auditors have incentives to be more sensitive to expected litigation costs, which increase with the level of information asymmetry. I hypothesize that higher levels of litigiousness enhance the information role of accounting conservatism. Overall empirical results are generally consistent with the hypothesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Photography has been exposed as an infinitely complex series of intersecting technologies, industries, discourses and socio-cultural desires. Figured as an image-making medium that bears the direct trace (light) of reality, it has become a fundamental method through which we construct identity, capture memories, communicate knowledge and reflect and shape reality. Its resulting conceptualization as a discourse-laden visual language, that enables the (co)articulation of subject (self), object (device) and truth, has located it as a central locus of ethical consequence. While there has been a significant amount of research into an ethics of photographic representation, there has been very little consideration of the importance of reconsidering the intersection of photography  (in and of itself) and ethics in light of digitization. While this thesis will function to map out a number of theoretical and practical trajectories, its central purpose will be to draw upon a rich understanding of analogue and digital photography in order to critically re-imagine ethics in light of digitization.&#xD;
	This thesis begins by mapping out a series of continuities and discontinuities in the technological, sociological and practical engagements of photography as a result of digitization. Following in this vein, it will engage in a comparative review of past and present (analogue and digital) photographic practices and theories in an effort to expand the conceptual frames of these trajectories further through an inter-disciplinary and sociological lens.  Following this review, and in response to a number of proposed digital novelties, this thesis will revisit past conceptualization of photographic ethics, demonstrate and legitimize their short-comings in the digital age, and begin to imagine alternative means of tackling the ‘impossible possibility’ of digital ethics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Comment faire l’amour avec un Nègre sans se fatiguer (1985) by Dany Laferriere and L’art du maquillage (1997) by Sergio Kokis, are two novels that are part of what is known as migrant literature in Quebec. Both explore the question of identity and alterity, one from a racial perspective and the other, from an individual and artistic one. If, on the one hand, the presence of otherness within identity refers to the importance of the other for the subject within the diegesis of the novels, on the other hand, it also represents the trace of a discursive other in the writing of the two novels. Hence, this thesis explores the importance of the other through a study of intermedial references to four paintings that prove to be significant for a better understanding of both novels. In Laferrière’s novel, the subject objectifies the other through his perception and his literary creation, and through this process, he objectifies himself. In Kokis’s novel, not only does the subject’s quest to reach the real Other end in failure, but by representing the other in art, he will eventually change the other’s identity. Acting as a theoretical framework for this analysis are Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic studies on the relationship between the subject and the other, and Irina O. Rajesky’s and Peter Wagner’s respective theoretical texts on intermediality, with the help of which the links between the paintings and the themes at play in the novels are explored.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Different types of web resources, such as Web Services, HTTP-based APIs and websites, can be located on the web to provide various services, such as information access and online banking. Such services are the basic building blocks to compose more complex functionality that cannot be achieved by a single service. Many service-oriented applications can be composed to fulfill similar functional requirements. Among various applications, a set of services can be frequently used together to deliver a unique functionality. Such set of services are called a service composition pattern. More specifically, a service composition pattern consists of a set of services and the control flow among the services. The reuse of the service composition patterns can facilitate the composition of new applications, improve existing applications and optimize maintenance process of services. To facilitate the identification and reuse of service composition patterns, we propose an approach that mines the service composition patterns from execution logs produced by service-oriented applications during runtime. Since the execution logs can be produced by heterogeneous web resources, we propose a unified description schema to describe various web resources in order to identify functionally similar services of different types. This helps reveal complete service composition patterns. Then we identify frequently associated services using Apriori algorithm and heuristics. Finally, we recover the control flow among the services using the event graph and process mining techniques. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through two case studies. The result shows that the unified description schema facilitates the identification of similar services of different types and our approach can effectively identify service composition patterns.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Silence around ideas of racial diversity in public settings has become normative. Colourmuteness allows for the culture of Whiteness to remain unchallenged, and reinforces attitudes of assimilation and tolerance. This culture manifests itself in institutions of higher learning, and positions these places as sites of cultural domination, such as Queen’s University, site of the current study. The purpose of this thesis was to offer insight into the educational experiences of four female self-identified racialized students at Queen’s University. Together these participants contributed their stories about their thoughts, motivations, and experiences at Queen’s University, and their experiences as members of the student body. The inductive process was used as an analytical framework to allow the experiences of the participants to be the main focus of the work, and the voices of the participants were used as a guide for analysis. &#xD;
Results of this study indicated that the exploration of identity is a complex and layered phenomenon, and that interrelations between different aspects of identity make categorization of individual experience problematic. Each participant presented her personal story of her experiences as a racialized student within the Queen’s context, and together these stories revealed a need for open dialogue around constructions of difference, rather than a silencing of diversity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>RdoA is a eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinase found in Salmonella typhimurium. It is a downstream effector of the Cpx stress response pathway and has been phenotypically characterized to have a functional role in flagellin phase variation and long-term bacterial survivability. Structurally, RdoA is homologous to, choline kinase and aminoglycoside (3’) phosphotransferase IIIa (APH[3’]IIIa). These kinases all belong to a protein kinase superfamily and share highly conserved residues/motifs in their catalytic domain. In RdoA seven of these conserved amino acids were proposed to have functional roles in the phosphotransfer mechanism. Mutation of these proposed catalytic domain residues resulted in a loss of in vitro kinase activity and in vivo RdoA function for a majority of the mutants. Four of the mutants also exhibited decreased levels of stable RdoA compared to wildtype.     &#xD;
Many protein kinases regulate activity through phosphorylation of an activation loop. Although RdoA does not contain a canonical activation loop, its carboxyl terminus is proposed to play a similar regulatory function. Mutations of a putative autophosphorylation target in the carboxyl terminus resulted in loss of in vitro kinase activity. Truncations of this region also resulted in loss of kinase activity, as well as decreasing RdoA stability. The length of the carboxyl terminus in the kinase was shown to be an important determinant in the overall structural stability of RdoA. Mutational analyses of conserved amino acid residues surrounding the putative substrate-binding cleft of RdoA revealed site specific mutants with diminished in vitro phosphorylation activity and/or RdoA levels. A subset of these mutants for which no in vitro kinase activity was detected were still able to complement RdoA function in vivo.  Taken together these results indicate that this region of the protein is important for RdoA function.&#xD;
In summary, this work has generated a panel of RdoA mutants with several unique phenotypes that will facilitate characterization of RdoA function and of regions of the protein</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Facile procedures based on hyphenated ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were developed to determine conditional stability constants, speciate chromium species and investigate the reduction of Cr(VI). &#xD;
1. Improvements were made to a method previously developed to determine the conditional stability constant, Kf’, and chelation number, n, using IEC-ICP-MS. This method allowed the accurate determination of the conditional stability constant of a simple system.  However, the corresponding chelation number was significantly different to the expected value because the principal assumption, i.e. that the ligand was in excess, was not realized in the experimentation. Furthermore, it neglected complexes other than that formed with EDTA4-.  By taking into account these factors, accurate Kf’ and n were obtained for Co-EDTA and Zn-EDTA systems.&#xD;
2. A simple method was developed for chromium speciation analysis at sub-µg L-1 level in potable water by IEC-ICP-MS. Cr(VI) and Cr(III) were separated on IonPac® AG-7 guard column within 7.5 minutes using gradient elution with 0.1 M ammonium nitrate and 0.8 M nitric acid. H2 collision/reaction interface gas eliminated chlorine-based and carbon-based polyatomic interferences on Cr detection. Water samples were analyzed directly, without any pretreatment. The accuracy of the method was verified through accurate analysis of riverine water certified reference material. Limits of detection of 0.02 and 0.04 µg L-1 for Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively, were obtained.&#xD;
3. This speciation analysis method was then used for kinetics studies of Cr(VI) reduction in  acidified riverine water. Water was spiked with Cr(VI), with or without Cr(III), and evolution of each Cr species with time was monitored by speciation analysis, showing that the reduction of Cr(VI) was a pseudo first order reaction. By plotting the logarithm of the peak area ratio of the instant Cr(VI) concentration over that of the original spiking versus time, the reaction rate constant was obtained as the slope. The reduction rate increased with decreasing pH and increasing temperature. The activation energy of the reaction at pH 1.3 was calculated using an Arrhenius plot. This method offers the advantages of small sample consumption, minimal sample manipulation, and easy data interpretation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation illustrates the complex nature of Christian and Saracen relations by analysing fixed and fluid representations of cultural boundaries in three medieval tales. The first chapter discusses the Sultaness in Chaucer’s “Man of Law’s Tale”; responding to feminist critics, I portray the extreme actions she takes as necessary to the protection of her Saracen subjects from Christian conversion. Rather than regard the Sultaness from her familial position, as so many critics do, and define her as monstrous for murdering her son, I view her in terms of her political standing and use John of Salisbury’s Policraticus along with René Girard’s theory of sacrificial violence to interpret her actions as essential for the continuation of the Saracen culture.  The second chapter contrasts opposing attitudes towards the possibility of integrating the other into Christian society in The King of Tars and Aliscans. The texts have yet to be read alongside each other by other scholars. This chapter is supplemented with scholarship by Siobhain Bly Calkin which discusses the ability to move between cultural and political groups, criticism by Susanne Conklin Akbari on crossing spiritual boundaries, and incorporates Jeffrey Jerome Cohen’s understanding of the portrayal in late Medieval culture of biological otherness. The chapter concludes with a speculative account of the reasons why these two texts have such different views on assimilation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The search for more sustainable construction methods has created a renewed interest in straw bales technology. Straw bales are a composite material that is energy efficient and durable. Rectangular straw bales stacked in a running bond and plastered on the interior and exterior faces have adequate strength to resist typical loads found in two-storey structures.&#xD;
	The structural behaviour of a load-bearing plastered straw bale wall subject to uniform loading is well researched. However, door and window voids in the wall redistribute vertical load paths and produce areas of concentrated stress. This thesis describes experiments on small-scale plastered straw bale panels subjected to loading conditions that simulate the loading conditions experienced in areas around door and window voids.&#xD;
	Twenty-one specimens were tested under two main types of loading conditions. The specimens were rendered with lime-cement plaster, were one to three bales (0.33 m to 0.99 m) in height, and were either unreinforced, or contained metal diamond lath or chicken wire embedded within the plaster. The specimens were pin-supported at various centre-to-centre distances ranging from 200 mm to 500 mm and were loaded either uniformly or by a point load.&#xD;
	Two distinct types of failure were observed. Strut-and-tie models were developed to describe the structural behaviour of panels undergoing vertical cracking of the plaster skin at failure. Bearing models were developed to describe the structural behaviour of panels undergoing crushing of the plaster skin beneath the point of applied load. The models predicted the correct failure mode of 92% of the specimens and had an average ratio of experimental strength to theoretical strength of 0.95 with a standard deviation of 0.17.&#xD;
	The results show that the behaviour of plastered straw bale walls can be predicted using common methods of structural analysis. A parametric analysis of door and window voids within plastered straw bale walls is presented.</dcterms:abstract>

Capacitive touch, pressure, and bend sensors are compared on rigid and flexible devices using a prototype electronic book reader.

Capacitive touch sensors may have decreased performance on flexible devices. We conclude by presenting recommendations for the design of future flexible e-book readers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis undertakes a review of the Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) for the St. Lawrence River Area of Concern (AOC).  As directed by Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, RAPs are to take a systematic and comprehensive ecosystem approach to restoration, and ensure that the public is consulted about restoration activities.   Through triangulation of three different research methods: twelve semi-structured interviews, observational research, and document analysis, this research explores how these two principles were incorporated into the St. Lawrence River AOC.&#xD;
This research draws from environmental management and governance literature in order to describe the implementation and decision-making frameworks of the RAP program.  In theory an ecosystem approach is to be holistic and comprehensive in scope and application.  In terms of the St. Lawrence River AOC, the holistic nature of the restoration process was hindered by the jurisdictional complexity of the region; Not only was there two federal governments, Canada and the United States, but the province of Ontario, state of New York, and the Mohawks of Akwesasne Nation.  These jurisdictional divisions led to the eventual decision to separate the AOC into two RAPs at Massena, NY and Cornwall, ON.  This division led to a divergence in impairment indicator identification and resultant restoration practices, timelines for RAP progress reports, availability of financial resources, and collective organization of restoration duties.  &#xD;
The goal of each RAP is to eventually delist as an AOC.  Through a review of the collective organization of the Cornwall RAP, it is best described as participatory and inclusive in terms of governance.  There was representation and membership from government, industry, First Nations, and the public making the Cornwall RAP an example of solidarity in action.  Because there has been a unification of visions through the RAP process, which is to have a clean and health St. Lawrence River, momentum has been generated to expand the ideals of the RAP to a broader St. Lawrence River collective.  Lessons learned from this restoration process are constructive for cross-jurisdictional, multi-media restoration projects and serve to inform approaches to ecosystem restoration, planning, and management, especially that of the St. Lawrence River.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We live in an era of fragmented memory. Though the wars and catastrophes of the twentieth century may have preceded our birth, we remain haunted by their lingering presence. Many studies have been conducted on the delayed nature of trauma, the power of the past to govern the present: it is precisely for this reason that trauma is a contemporary theme in both the social sciences and humanities. Psychology has demonstrated that a symbolization of the traumatic past is of the utmost importance to the process of liberating oneself from its encumbering grasp. However, in the wake of events that surpass human understanding, notably the Holocaust and the bombing of Hiroshima, the question arose of how such brutal realities could possibly be represented.&#xD;
It is here that literature comes into play. The present study considers the theme of trauma and its various representations in five literary works: L’Immaculée Conception by Gaétan Soucy, Savannah Bay by Marguerite Duras, the film Hiroshima mon amour by Duras and Alain Resnais, Le ciel de Bay City by Catherine Mavrikakis and Georges Perec’s W ou le souvenir d’enfance. It will demonstrate that these authors, rather than yield to that which resists representation, embrace the dilemma. This study’s progression will be twofold, looking first at an individual trauma based on fictional events in order to examine the literary means of symbolizing reality. The works in the succeeding chapters move toward historical and collective phenomena, departing from fiction with respect to the events, but not, however, in regard to the symbolization of these realities. The authors continue to resort to the imaginary to represent the horrors of the past. This recourse raises certain questions: what is the role of literature in representing trauma? What is the&#xD;
iii&#xD;
relationship between fiction and reality, and finally, can writing aid in the process of healing from a traumatic past?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Due to rising energy costs and increasing environmental awareness, various methods of energy conservation are being investigated.  In the residential sector, both solar and heat pump systems have been extensively tested.  Recently, combinations of solar and heat pump systems have been developed for both space heating and water heating.  These systems have the capability to provide better performances than either of the systems operating on their own.  The solar collector benefits from a lower fluid (glycol) inlet temperature which increases efficiencies, and the heat pump benefits from higher evaporator temperatures due to the additional solar energy collected.  &#xD;
For this study, a prototype of an Indirect-Solar Assisted Heat Pump for use in the Canadian environment was constructed, instrumented and tested.  Controlled, constant temperature tests, as well as solar profile tests were conducted and the heat transfer rates, natural convection flow rate, and heat pump coefficient of performance (COP) were calculated.  These values were then compared to simulation results based on a model developed in a previous feasibility study.  The experimental COPs calculated ranged from 2.3 to 3.3 throughout the full range of tests which were conducted with supply temperatures ranging from 0°C – 40°C.  The simulated results consistently overestimated the experimental results by between 12% - 15%.  New empirical heat exchanger relationships were developed for the model bringing the simulated results within 5% of the experimental results for tests run at glycol flow rates of 77 and 154 kg/hr.  These relationships were used to refine the model, and produce updated annual performance values in the TRNSYS simulation software.  Updated results showed a 5% drop in the annual free energy ratio in Toronto from 57% to 52%, but further optimization of the system using the TRNSYS software package improved annual results up to 56%.&#xD;
For the purposes of the study, a solar assisted heat pump prototype was constructed and tested successfully within the laboratory environment.  Results showed that the system has a strong market potential, especially in regions without a strong solar resource.  Based on these results further research is recommended, continuing with a full year outdoor test using unglazed solar collectors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During operation of a CANDU reactor, corrosion occurs which results in free hydrogen that can diffuse into the tubes. Once the solid solubility of hydrogen in the zirconium matrix is exceeded, the hydrogen will precipitate as a flake-like brittle hydride phase. The natural orientation of the hydride flakes is in the circumferential direction but under a tensile hoop stress the hydrides are able to reorientate themselves to the radial direction. This makes the pressure tubes susceptible to delayed hydride cracking (DHC) which can cause failure of the tubes. A memory effect has been observed to cause hydrides that would otherwise form in the circumferential direction to form in the radial direction. Studies have been previously performed to examine the memory effect however they have not quantified the hydride orientation distribution. &#xD;
This study examined the memory effect in Zr-2.5Nb micro pressure tubes with three different microstructures and textures. A stepped micro pressure tube sample design was hydrided to 100 ppm(wt%) and pressurized to obtain a nominal hoop stress ranging from 65 MPa to 350 MPa. Each of the samples was heated to 350oC to dissolve all of the hydrogen followed by cooling under stress. Samples were then reheated to 350oC for 1 hour and 24 hours and cooled without stress. Almost complete reorientation was observed in typical pressure tube material which had a very fine microstructure and a large portion of basal plane normals in the transverse direction. After reheating, little memory effect was found in material similar to the commercially used pressure tube material. However a clear memory effect was observed in the other two samples. The memory effect was observed in the range of angles where hydrides are naturally present. &#xD;
A second flanged sample design was used to find the dilational strain associated with hydride reorientation from which the normal strain could be calculated. The strain normal to the hydride, εnormal, was calculated to be 0.11 ± 0.05. This study provides a valuable resource that can be used to improve DHC models which are used to determine the useful life of the pressure tubes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is assumed that plasticity involving up-and down regulation of synaptic strength (i.e., long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) mediates learning and memory processes. Typically, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of afferent fibers results in LTP, while low-frequency stimulation (LFS) elicits LTD. In stark contrast to this “HFS- LTP vs. LFS-LTD” dogma, the present thesis characterizes a novel form of LFS-induced LTP in the septohippocampal system. The first set of experiments show that alternating, single pulse stimulation (1 Hz) of the medial septum (MS) and CA3 hippocampal (H) commissural fibres results in a long-lasting potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in CA1 of urethane-anesthetised rats (MS-H-LTP). MS-H LTP is long lasting (&gt;5 h), requires a specific inter-stimulus interval of 1 s between MS and CA3 stimulation, saturates with repeated stimulation episodes and depends on NMDA receptor activation. In the third chapter (review) I suggest that LFS protocols may more accurately mimic some oscillatory activity patterns (~ 1Hz) present in hippocampal and neocortical circuits during sleep-related memory consolidation. Moreover, I compare the mechanisms underlying classical, HFS-LTP to those mediating MS-H LTP as well as several other types of LFS-LTP in the hippocampus and amygdala in vitro. Subsequently, I investigated cellular mechanisms of MS-H LTP and their similarity to classical HFS-LTP via drug application at the CA1 recording site and showed that MS-H LTP depends on protein kinase A and protein synthesis. This surprising similarity between mechanisms mediating HFS-LTP and MS-H LTP was further supported by occlusion experiments whereby LFS and HFS, delivered to the same animal, competed for the available synaptic potentiation of CA3-CA1 synapses. The final experiments showed that MS-H LTP is compromised in early aged rats, while similar levels of potentiation are expressed in the juvenile and adult hippocampus. Interestingly, MS-H LTP could not be induced (i.e., was occluded) 3 h after training on the hidden platform version of the Morris water maze, while it was unaltered at 8 and 24 h intervals. This thesis characterizes a novel form of hippocampal plasticity at the cellular, synaptic and behavioural level and suggests that LFS-LTP may mediate processes of sleep-related memory consolidation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Navigation algorithms integrating measurements from multi-sensor systems overcome the problems that arise from using GPS navigation systems in standalone mode. Algorithms which integrate the data from 2D low-cost reduced inertial sensor system, consisting of a gyroscope and an odometer, along with a GPS via a Kalman filter has proved to be worthy in providing a consistent and more reliable navigation solution compared to the standalone GPS. It has been also shown to be beneficial, especially in GPS-denied environments such as urban canyons and tunnels. The main objective of this research is to narrow the idea-to-implementation gap that follows the algorithm development by realizing a low-cost real-time embedded navigation system that is capable of computing the data-fused positioning solution instantly. The role of the developed system is to synchronize the measurements from the three sensors, GPS, gyroscope and odometer, relative to the pulse per second signal generated from the GPS, after which the navigation algorithm is applied to the synchronized measurements to compute the navigation solution in real-time.&#xD;
Xilinx’s MicroBlaze soft-core processor on a Virtex-4 FPGA is utilized and customized for developing the real-time navigation system. The soft-core processor offers the flexibility to choose or implement a set of features and peripherals that are tailored to the specific application to be developed. An embedded system design model is chosen to act as a framework for the work flow to be carried through the system life cycle starting from the system specification phase and ending with the system release. The developed navigation system is tested first on a mobile robot to reveal system bugs and integration problems, and then on a land vehicle testing platform for further testing. The real-time solution from the implemented system when compared to the solution of a high-end navigation system, proved to be successful in providing a comparable consistent real-time navigation solution. Employing a soft-core processor in the kernel of the navigation system, provided the flexibility for communicating with the various sensors and the computation capability required by the Kalman filter integration algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research examines how the contents and structure of a story may be enriched by computational means. A review of pertinent semantic theory and previous work on the structural analysis of folktales is presented. Merits and limitations of several content-generation systems are discussed. The research develops three mechanisms - elaboration, interpolation, and continuity fixes - to enhance story content, address issues of rigid structure, and fix problems with the logical progression of a story. &#xD;
&#xD;
Elaboration works by adding or modifying information contained within a story to provide detailed descriptions of an event. Interpolation works by adding detail between high-level story elements dictated by a story grammar. Both methods search for appropriate semantic functions contained in a lexicon. Rules are developed to ensure that the selection of functions is consistent with the context of the story. Control strategies for both mechanisms are proposed that restrict the quantity and content of candidate functions. Finally, a method of checking and correcting inconsistencies in story continuity is proposed. Continuity checks are performed using semantic threads that connect an object or character to a sequence of events. Unexplained changes in state or location are fixed with interpolation. &#xD;
&#xD;
The mechanisms are demonstrated with simple examples drawn from folktales, and the effectiveness of each is discussed. While the thesis focuses on folktales, it forms the basis for further work on the generation of more complex stories in the greater realm of fiction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is an investigation of possible applications for a low cost non-contact magnetic rotational position sensor.  A single stage gearbox operating spur gears was instrumented with these sensors along with typical optical encoders.  These rotational position devices were used independently to measure gearbox Transmission Error (TE) during operation.  Basic filtering techniques were used to condition the TE so that localized faults were observable.  Characteristic feature extraction on the TE using RMS, Kurtosis and Crest Factor was used to quantify gearbox dynamics.  These features were able to measure dynamic changes in gearbox health, such as wearing in the gears or the progression of a fault resulting in full tooth failure.  These sensor attributes are ideal for machine condition monitoring applications where catastrophic failure can be forewarned by incipient fault detection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High levels of impulsivity, positive gambling attitudes, and positive gambling beliefs are identified as risk factors for pathological gambling and related symptoms in numerous surveys and naturalistic studies.  However, there remains a need for experimental studies, as we know little about how the effects of these variables on gambling emerge or the contextual factors that may exacerbate or attenuate these effects.  The current project thus tests whether direct effects of impulsivity, attitudes, and beliefs on within-session gambling exist in a controlled environment and examines whether the relationships among these variables and bet perception and betting differ in a spontaneous vs. a deliberative context or according to the desirability of the bets.&#xD;
Three experiments were conducted using a computerized gambling task.  The first experiment (N=151) had two time conditions: spontaneous and deliberative; and two desirability conditions: high desirability and low desirability (both conditions included ambiguous bets).  Participants’ level of impulsivity, attitudes, and beliefs were assessed.  No significant main effects of impulsivity, attitudes, and beliefs on betting emerged; however, the time and desirability conditions did have an effect.  The second experiment (N=156) replicated the first experiment, but also explored the role of perceptions.  When participants were asked to reflect on their perceptions, impulsivity, attitudes, and beliefs significantly related to participants’ bet perceptions and to betting on ambiguous bets.  The third experiment (N=142) further explored responses to ambiguous bets by removing the impact of the desirability condition.  Consistent with experiment two, attitudes and impulsivity related to bet perceptions and betting.  The effects of impulsivity, attitudes, and beliefs on amount wagered were fully mediated by participants’ perceptions of bets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High Performance Computing (HPC) is the key to solving many scientific, financial, and engineering problems. Computer clusters are now the dominant architecture for HPC. The scale of clusters, both in terms of processor per node and the number of nodes, is increasing rapidly, reaching petascales these days and soon to exascales. Inter-process communication plays a significant role in the overall performance of HPC applications. With the continuous enhancements in interconnection technologies and node architectures, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) needs to be improved to effectively utilize the modern technologies for higher performance.&#xD;
After providing a background, I present a deep analysis of the user level and MPI libraries over modern cluster interconnects: InfiniBand, iWARP Ethernet, and Myrinet. Using novel techniques, I assess characteristics such as overlap and communication progress ability, buffer reuse effect on latency, and multiple-connection scalability. The outcome highlights some of the inefficiencies that exist in the communication libraries. &#xD;
To improve communication progress and overlap in large message transfers, a method is proposed which uses speculative communication to overlap communication with computation in the MPI Rendezvous protocol. The results show up to 100% communication progress and more than 80% overlap ability over iWARP Ethernet. An adaptation mechanism is employed to avoid overhead on applications that do not benefit from the method due to their timing specifications.&#xD;
To reduce MPI communication latency, I have proposed a technique that exploits the application buffer reuse characteristics for small messages and eliminates the sender-side copy in both two-sided and one-sided MPI small message transfer protocols. The implementation over InfiniBand improves small message latency up to 20%. The implementation adaptively falls back to the current method if the application does not benefit from the proposed technique.&#xD;
Finally, to improve scalability of MPI applications on ultra-scale clusters, I have proposed an extension to the current iWARP standard. The extension improves performance and memory usage for large-scale clusters. The extension equips Ethernet with an efficient zero-copy, connection-less datagram transport. The software-level evaluation shows more than 40% performance benefits and 30% memory usage reduction for MPI applications on a 64-core cluster.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lindenmayer (L) systems form a class of interesting computational formalisms due to their parallel nature, the various circumstances under which they operate, the restrictions imposed on language acceptance, and other attributes.  These systems have been extensively studied in the&#xD;
Formal Languages literature.  In the past decade a new type of Lindenmayer system had been proposed: Watson-Crick Lindenmayer Systems.  These systems are essentially a marriage between Developmental systems and DNA Computing.  At their heart they are Lindenmayer systems augmented with a complementary relation amongst elements in the system just as the base pairs of DNA strands can be complementary with respect to one another.  When conditions and a mechanism for 'switching' the state of a computation to it's complementary version are provided then these systems can become surprisingly more powerful than the L systems which form their backbone.  This dissertation explores the computational power of new variants of Watson-Crick L systems.  It is found that many of these systems are Computationally-Complete.  These investigations differ from prior ones in that the systems under consideration have extended alphabets and usually Regular Triggers for complementation are considered as opposed to Context-Free Triggers investigated in previous works.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Retinoblastoma is the second most common childhood intraocular malignancy and development of the tumour is initiated by bi-allelic loss of the RB1 gene. Bi-allelic RB1 loss may not always directly lead to malignant retinoblastoma.  Subsequent mutational events, specifically gain and loss of chromosomal regions harbouring key oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, appear to underlie the progression of precursor lesions such as retinoma to retinoblastoma. Research thus far has implicated several cytogenetic aberrations in this sequence of molecular events, the two most recurrent and notable being the augmented copy number status of KIF14 and MDM4 on 1q and of DEK and E2F3 on 6p. A small subset of retinoblastoma exhibits high-level amplification of the MYCN gene on chromosome 2p and is characterized by pRb expression and aggressive histology. 1p36 deletion is also associated with MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma. Our project is testing the hypothesis that 1q and 6p gain and 2p amplification – defined by extra copies of KIF14 and MDM4, DEK and E2F3 and MYCN respectively, and 1p36 deletion – are biomarkers of retinoblastoma progression. This study reports the results of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded fluorescence in situ hybridization (FFPE-FISH) analysis of the aforementioned genes in two pre-constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs) comprising 270 retinoblastoma patient tumours. Results show 1q gain (3-10 copies) in 136/262 (52%), 6p gain in 127/262 (48.7%), MYCN gain in 18/265 (6.8%) and MYCN amplification (&gt;10 copies) in 20/265 (7.5%) patient tumours. MYCN amplification was also observed in a sample which retained pRb protein expression. Additionally we have demonstrated statistically significant associations between 1q and 6p gain and MYCN amplification and 1p36 deletion. The large cohort and consequent statistical power of our results has enabled a better understanding of the M3 to Mn sequence of genomic aberrations in the progression from retinoma to retinoblastoma. Statistically significant associations between 1q and 6p, indicates synergy within these two regions of gain that would be particularly beneficial to tumours. Owing to the biological interactions among the proteins encoded by DEK, E2F3, KIF14 and MDM4, tumour cells manifesting both 1q and 6p aberrations would have a selective survival and proliferative advantage.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the advent of high throughput measurement technologies, large scale gene expression data are available for analysis. Various computational methods have been introduced to analyze and predict meaningful molecular interactions from gene expression data. Such patterns can provide an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in the cells. In the past, system identification algorithms have been extensively developed for engineering systems. These methods capture the dynamic input/output relationship of a system, provide a deterministic model of its function, and have reasonable computational requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this work, two system identification methods are applied for reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks.&#xD;
The first method is based on an orthogonal search; it selects terms from a predefined set of gene expression profiles to best fit the expression levels of a given output gene.&#xD;
The second method consists of a few cascades, each of which includes a dynamic component and a static component. Multiple cascades are added in a parallel to reduce the difference of the estimated expression profiles with the actual ones.&#xD;
Gene regulatory networks can be constructed by defining the selected inputs as the regulators of the output.&#xD;
To assess the performance of the approaches, a temporal synthetic dataset is developed. Methods are then applied to this dataset as well as the Brainsim dataset, a popular simulated temporal gene expression data. Furthermore, the methods are also applied to a biological dataset in yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. This dataset includes 14 cell-cycle regulated genes; their known cell cycle pathway is used as the target network structure, and the criteria sensitivity, precision, and specificity are calculated to evaluate the inferred networks through these two methods. Resulting networks are also compared with two previous studies in the literature on the same dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work presents three techniques for parameter identification for nonlinear systems. The methods presented are expanded from those presented in Adetola and Guay [3, 4, 5] and are intended to improve the performance of existing adaptive control systems. The first two methods exactly recover open-loop system parameters once a defined convergence condition is met. In either case, the true parameters are identified when the regressor matrix is of&#xD;
full rank and can be inverted. The third case uses a novel method developed in Adetola&#xD;
and Guay [5] to define a parameter uncertainty set. The uncertainty set is periodically updated to shrink around the true value of the parameters. Each method is shown to be applicable to a large class of linearly parameterized nonlinear discrete-time system. In each&#xD;
case, parameter convergence is guaranteed subject to an appropriate convergence condition, which has been related to a classical persistence of excitation condition. The effectiveness of&#xD;
the methods is demonstrated using a simulation example. The application of the uncertainty set technique to nonlinearly parameterized systems constitutes the main contribution of the thesis. The parameter uncertainty set method is generalized to the problem of adaptive estimation in nonlinearly parameterized systems, for both continuous-time and discrete-time cases. The method is demonstrated to perform well in simulation for a simplified model of a bioreactor operating under Monod kinetics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The allylic bromide functionality in brominated poly(isoprene-co-isobutylene) rubber (BIIR) reacted readily to nucleophilic substitution by imidazole-derivatives.  When reacted with the rubber, alkylimidazoles formed a stable non-thermoset ionomeric elastomer that has dynamic mechanical properties similar to those of vulcanizates; however, the strength is in its ion-pair aggregation.  Structural characterization of the polymeric products was accomplished by spectroscopy with comparisons to the model compound prepared from brominated 2,2,4,8,8-pentamethyl-4-nonene (BPMN).  Physical properties tests on the elastomers of varying ionic content (0-1 mol%) were done using solution viscosity and rheology, and demonstrated that small amounts of ionic functionality noticeably improved properties with a plateau of properties being attained as full conversion to ionic content was reached.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The reaction of imidazole with BIIR created a thermoset elastomer that formed an ionomer and thermoset after its second alkylation.  These materials provided excellent scorch protection and delayed curing at high temperatures, while still reaching good storage modulus.  Formation of an elastomer with a pendant imidazole group was also achieved; however, it did not perform as well as the free imidazole.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Total knee arthroplasty has been effective in reducing pain, but less so in restoring function, especially for activities requiring deep knee flexion.  The philosophy of this dissertation was that more functionally effective and optimally designed artificial knees could be created for high flexion activities, if the knee joint kinematics and joint contact forces applied during finite element testing, knee simulator testing, and fatigue testing were more physiologically accurate.  The objective of this work was to determine knee joint kinematics and contact forces that could be used in high flexion total knee replacement design and pre-clinical testing.  Knee kinematics were determined during high flexion activities for total knee replacement patients and asymptomatic subjects by tracking the motion of skin-mounted sensors.  In addition, a protocol was developed to determine the effect of soft tissue artefact on the accuracy of the skin-mounted sensor system in high flexion.  The ranges of motion determined for the studied activities can be used as a benchmark to measure the functional success of high flexion total knee replacements.  Tibiofemoral joint contact forces were estimated during high flexion activities of daily living using a simple, non-invasive, inverse dynamics based model.  The accuracy of the joint contact force estimates was investigated by comparing the estimated forces to in vivo forces measured directly using implanted instrumented tibial components.  The comparison showed that the model underestimates the measured axial joint contact force, most likely because the model neglects antagonistic muscle co-contraction.  The measured and modeled joint contact forces and the measured knee kinematics could be used to form industry standards for knee simulator and fatigue testing to ensure that the implants are being tested physiologically.  Healthy target populations can be studied using the methods outlined in this thesis to define testing standards for target populations:  Kinematics can be determined as they were in this work for a group of Middle Eastern subjects, and the non-invasive inverse dynamics based model (with some consideration for the underestimation of forces) could be used to determine the tibiofemoral joint contact forces that the implant might be subjected to during activities of daily living.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Growing development pressure in Ontario’s Far North has prompted northern First Nation communities, who have recognized these potential outcomes, to initiate community-based land-use planning.  In 2009 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) announced Bill 191, An Act with Respect to Land-Use Planning and Protection in the Far North, to guide the planning process and promote a balance between conservation and development. The way the legislation develops and advances will be a determining factor in the degree of benefit to local communities. &#xD;
This manuscript thesis explores the issues related to land-use planning in Ontario’s Far North, specifically the James Bay lowland region, through two articles.  Information collected through participant observation, an extensive multi-disciplinary literature review, interviews with key policy actors and review of transcripts from Standing Committee hearings was combined to inform the development of both articles.  &#xD;
The first article explores the landscape to highlight the abiotic, biotic and cultural features of the region.  This article provides a scoping exercise to begin to describe features that should contribute to the creation of the community-based land-use plans.&#xD;
The second article critically examines the development of Bill 191 to guide land-use planning through policy, organizational and operational institutional levels from a First Nations perspective. Themes of power, social justice and participation in the planning process are central to the consideration of the emerging planning process.  This review reveals a process that, instead of initiating a new relationship between the government of Ontario and First Nations, has contributed to increasingly acrimonious relations between the two.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Calpains are calcium-dependent, intracellular, multi-domain cysteine proteases involved in many physiological functions regulated by calcium signaling, including cell motility. How calpains are activated in the cell is still unknown because the resting intracellular concentration of Ca2+ is orders of magnitude lower than that needed for half-maximal activation of the enzyme in vitro. &#xD;
   Several stratagems by which calpains might overcome this Ca2+ concentration differential have been proposed. It is possible that post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, or accessory proteins that bind to calpain, might facilitate the enzyme’s activation at lower than optimal Ca2+ concentrations. Autoproteolysis (autolysis) and subunit dissociation are two other proposed activation mechanisms that could release constraints on the calpain core by breaking the link between the anchor helix and the small subunit to allow the active site to form. &#xD;
   By measuring the rate of autolysis at different sites in calpain, it was demonstrated that while the anchor helix is one of the first targets to be cut, several other potentially inactivating autolysis sites, particularly in Domain III, can also be cleaved within the first minute. Thus autolytic activation would go hand in hand with inactivation. By fractionating and identifying calpain 2 autolysis fragments, I show that the small subunit does not dissociate away from the large subunit, but is proteolyzed to a 40-45 k heterodimer of the penta-EF-hand Domains IV and VI. It is likely that this autolysis-generated heterodimer has previously been misidentified as the small subunit domain VI homodimer that would be produced by subunit dissociation. A calpastatin affinity column was constructed and used to capture recombinant calpain 2 from bacterial cell lysate. This affinity column provides a tool to screen for and capture calpain complexed to potential binding partners in the presence of Ca2+. Here I propose a model for calpain 2 activation in vitro that does not involve autolysis, subunit dissociation, or calpain activators.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Francesco di Marco Datini (c. 1335-1410) left his native city of Prato, near Florence, in about 1350 to become a successful merchant in Avignon, France.  He returned three decades later to decorate his newly built private residence in the historic center of Prato.  Under his patronage, frescoes of sacred and secular subject matter were executed in the residence from 1389-95.  &#xD;
The artists that have been concretely identified, or suggested, as working in the Palazzo Datini include: Arrigo di Niccolò, from Prato; minor painters Dino di Puccio, Jacopo d’Agnolo, and Agnolo; Florentine artists Tommaso del Mazza, Bartolomeo di Bertozzo, and Pagolino d’Ugolino; and the master artists Niccolò di Pietro Gerini and Agnolo Gaddi.&#xD;
Many of the original frescoes were uncovered during renovations of the 1950s.  Those in the entry hall and ground floor rooms survive in varied condition.  This recovery is significant because the survival of large scale private works of this kind in Italy is rare.  Datini’s legacy also comprises hundreds of ledgers, account books, and thousands of personal and business letters dating from 1363 to 1410.  These are now contained in the Archivio Storico di Prato.  &#xD;
	Using the surviving visual and written material as a reference point, this thesis examines the contexts behind Datini’s choices as patron.  In particular, the influence of predominant values in merchant culture will be considered.  The frescoes are explored in comparison with the interior decoration in the palaces of contemporaries.  Precedence is given to residences in Florence and other urban centers in Tuscany.  Related paintings from Avignon are also considered, as Datini lived there for many years.  Visual parallels can also be drawn between the Datini frescoes and manuscript illuminations, among other sources.  The murals were influenced by Datini’s own interests, larger cultural values, and the painters, who derived from the Florentine tradition.&#xD;
	This thesis seeks to examine the cultural and artistic environment in late Trecento Prato, Datini’s contact with the artists, the subject matter and style of the frescoes, and their reception.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The existence of small-scale gold mining in Nova Scotia between 1868 and 1942 has resulted in many high arsenic (As) tailings areas in the province, some of which are near rural/urban areas and are used for recreational activities such as dirt bike racing and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) riding.  Because of the natural association of As with gold ore in the Meguma Terrane, processing of ore has resulted in As-rich mine waste that contains up to 2500 times more As than the Canadian soil quality guideline of 12 mg/kg.  These high As concentrations in combination with the recreational use of these sites creates a risk of human exposure.  The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of different cover options that might be used to mitigate the risk of human exposure.&#xD;
Four tailings samples were selected to represent the geochemical variability from two tailings areas: Montague gold mines and Goldenville.  These samples were characterized and subjected to 29 weeks of column testing, in which each sample was leached with three different input solutions including synthetic rainwater (to simulate uncovered tailings exposed to natural acid rain), synthetic rainwater equilibrated with calcium carbonate (to simulate rainwater percolation through a crushed limestone cover), and a dilute organic acid solution (to simulate a vegetative cover).&#xD;
Results of acid base accounting (ABA) tests indicate that samples have the potential to generate acid in the future (ratio of neutralization potential to acid potential is less than 2), though surface water at the sites is currently circum-neutral.  Acidic paste pH values (2.9) from a sample of As-rich hardpan indicate that a small volume of tailings at Montague are currently generating acid.&#xD;
Results of column testing indicate that the cover types simulated by the input solutions had less of an effect on the out-flowing leachate chemistry than did the small volume of secondary As phases in each sample (scorodite, yukonite, hydrous ferric arsenate and hydrous ferric oxides).  For the majority of sample types, columns leached with an organic acid solution reported higher leachate As concentrations than were reported from columns leached with either the rainwater or carbonate-rainwater solutions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Both onsite septic disposal systems and private drinking water wells are commonly utilized in rural areas of Canada.  The coexistence of septic systems and drinking water wells has the potential to greatly impact the quality of water obtained in these settings.  Human enteric viruses have been recognized as a potential source of groundwater borne disease, although the level of risk they pose and the processes responsible for their transport are poorly understood.  As a result of thin overburden, low storage capacity, and high groundwater velocities, fractured rock aquifers are potentially at highest risk to viral contamination. However, only limited research has been conducted to explore this concern.  The current study was conducted to investigate both the rate of occurrence of human viruses in fractured rock aquifers and the transport mechanisms acting in these settings.&#xD;
A survey was conducted to identify the prevalence of human enteric viruses in three fractured rock aquifers located across Canada.  A total of 61 samples were collected from 28 wells drilled in aquifers in Ontario, Newfoundland, and British Columbia.  Molecular PCR techniques were utilized to determine virus presence.  Results showed that 37.7% of samples and 58.1% of wells were at some time positive for viruses.  Virus presence was found to increase with housing density and viruses were found to travel distances of at least 40 meters.  Poor correlation was found between the presence of viruses and traditional bacterial indicators.&#xD;
A field-scale viral infiltration experiment was conducted to investigate viral transport behavior.  The bacteriophage ф-X174 and the fluorescent dye Lissamine FF were utilized as viral and solute tracers, respectively.  Tracers were applied to an exposed rock outcrop exhibiting fractures with known connection to two nearby wells.  Breakthrough was extremely rapid and the colloidal processes of decreased dispersion and slow-release kinetic sorption were identified. &#xD;
This study has provided concrete evidence that viral contamination poses a significant threat to fractured groundwater aquifers in rural areas where onsite septic disposal practices are utilized.  The results observed in this study suggest that current set back distances and monitoring techniques may be inadequate to prevent exposure to human viruses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Laser machining is a commonly used method for materials processing.  Focusing laser energy onto a sample can lead to material modifications and achieve feature sizes on the order of micrometres.  However, designing a machining platform capable of producing high quality, repeatable, and accurate results is a key challenge because the final outcome can be variable, even when using fixed laser parameters.  Therefore, in order to understand and monitor the process, real-time in situ metrology is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this work, a coherent imaging technique analogous to spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was applied inline with a machining laser in order to monitor the cut development of various materials for industrial and biomedical applications.  Such inline coherent imaging (ICI) provides axial resolution on the order of ones to tens of micrometers as well as temporal resolution on the order of microseconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
In stainless steel, the machining front was observed to have very different responses to pulsed lasers operating in different ablation regimes.  Applying shorter pulse duration with higher peak intensity led to more deterministic material removal with little relaxation between pulses, while longer pulses revealed periodic melting and refilling behaviour.  In addition, improvement of depth sensitivity to nanometre scales was explored by accessing phase information for Doppler processing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
For poorly absorbing materials, ICI provides the ability to observe structures below the surface.  This is a very important characteristic for biomedical applications, such as guiding ablation in biological tissue.  By monitoring the ablation of bone tissue in real-time using ICI, the operator was able to terminate exposure from the machining laser 50 μm before perforation into a natural inclusion in the tissue.  ICI was able to anticipate the inclusion 176 ± 8 μm below the ablation front with signal intensity 9 ± 2 dB above the noise floor.  With added real-time depth control, many applications will benefit whether it is achieving higher precision cuts in industrial materials, or limiting the possibility of damaging organs at risk below the cutting surface in surgical intervention.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The simplicity principle posits that we interpret sense data as the simplest consistent distal cause, or that our high level perceptual representations of stimuli are optimized for simplicity. The traditional paradigm used to test this principle is coding theory, where alternate representations of stimuli are constructed, simplicity is measured as shortness of representation length, and behavioural experiments attempt to show that the shortest representations correspond best to perception. In this study we apply coding theory to marker-based human walking motion. We compare two representation schemes. The first is based on marker coordinates in a body-centred Cartesian coordinate system. The second is based on a model of 15 rigid body segments with Euler angles and a Cartesian translation for each. Both of our schemes are principal component (PC)-based implementations of a norm-based multidimensional object space – a type of model for high level perceptual schemes that has received attention in the literature over the past two decades. Representation length is quantified as number of retained PC’s, with error increasing with discarded PC’s. We generalize simplicity to efficiency measured as error across all possible lengths, where more efficient schemes admit less error across lengths. We find that the Cartesian coordinates-based scheme is more efficient than the Euler angles and translations-based scheme across a database of 100 walkers. In order to link this finding to perception we turn to the caricature effect that subjects can identify caricatures of familiar stimuli more accurately than veridicals. Our design was to compare walker caricatures generated in our two schemes in the hope of finding that one gives caricatures that benefit identification more than the other, from which we would conclude the former to be a better model of the true perceptual scheme. However, we find that analogous caricatures between the two schemes are only distinguishable at caricature levels so extreme that identification performance breaks down, so our design became infeasible and no conclusion for a simplicity principle in walker perception is reached. We also measure a curve of increasing then decreasing identification performance with caricature level and an optimal level at approximately double the distinctiveness of a typical walker.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During the Sino-Japanese war of 1937 to 1945, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Shandong Province in North China achieved an unnoticed but historically significant success in financial affairs. From that time onward, the CCP in Shandong not only controlled economic affairs within its territory, but also obtained access to territories under enemy occupation through manipulation of currency exchange rates and by controlling the trade in staple grains, cotton, salt and peanut oil. As a result, trade with occupied China and with the Japanese invaders became the principal source of revenue of the CCP in Shandong as early as the second half of 1943. By the time of Japan’s defeat in August 1945, about 80% of the CCP’s revenue in Shandong came from trade beyond the areas under its control. Moreover, the CCP in Shandong deliberately carried out a policy of controlled inflation to increase its financial power. The key to this achievement was the CCP’s success in establishing exclusive zones for its banknotes in August 1943. The exclusive use of CCP currency developed in the course of many years of armed conflict among Japanese, CCP and Nationalist (GMD) forces in the province. The CCP’s&#xD;
ii&#xD;
banknotes were backed by Communist military power and military success. From their first days, the banknotes were intertwined with the military power of the CCP in Shandong and the supporting administrative institutions that Party authorities established in the province. The establishment of exclusive currency zones reflected the maturity of the CCP’s party-state. Because external trade was their principal source of revenue, CCP leaders in Shandong lacked the incentive to carry out social reform in Shandong.
