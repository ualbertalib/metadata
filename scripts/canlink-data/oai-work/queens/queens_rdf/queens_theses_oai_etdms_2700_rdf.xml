      <dcterms:abstract>The evolution of cooperative behaviours has received a large amount of attention in the literature. A recurrent result is that a spatial population structure often aids the evolution of cooperation. One such possible structure is a graph. Members of the population reside on vertices and interact with those connected by edges. The population changes over time via births and deaths and these changes are manifest in changing gene frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
I am interested in the change in frequency of a cooperative allele and one way to calculate this is with the inclusive fitness effect. The inclusive fitness effect is the sum of the effects of a behaviour on the members of a population, each effect weighted by a measure of genetic relatedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, I derive inclusive fitness theory in the context of evolutionary graphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
I provide new ways of calculating components of the inclusive fitness effect and high-light remaining challenges posed by graph-structured population models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis I contribute to arguments showing how the human body is much more than a vessel that enables us to experience the world through our senses. Our sense of embodiment and our embodied performances give meaning to and shape the world in which we live. I argue that our bodies are crucial to socio-political change and subverting discriminatory cultural assumptions and ideologies. &#xD;
Deviant performances can cause us to be less than intelligible individuals. That is, according to Judith Butler, we become less than intelligible when we do not perform in such a way that meets certain cultural expectations. Dominant expectations are typically implicitly understood to be common-sense values. Unfortunately, many of our implicit values have embedded unjust prejudices that directly affect our thinking and behaviour. These discriminatory implicit values are couched in “the background.” Alexis Shotwell’s expansion of what John R. Searle terms “the background” is particularly useful to understand the political nature of implicitly held beliefs. These discriminatory assumptions couched in the background systematically oppress us. However, the prejudices of the background can be exposed through repeatedly performing our bodies in certain ways. Additionally, our performances can enable us to pool our intellectual resources together and live out the socio-political change we desire. In doing so, performances and identities that were once considered unintelligible can become intelligible and can alter cultural climates.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In response to the possibilities for selection created by reproductive technologies like IVF and Prenatal screening, Julian Savulescu has argued that parents have a moral obligation to employ selective technology in order to have the best child that they can possibly have.  This idea, which Savulescu has called the Principle of Procreative Beneficence, appears reminiscent of historical eugenics. However, Savulescu has argued that this principle is not eugenic. In this paper I argue that there are good reasons to think that the Principle of Procreative Beneficence is eugenic. Specifically, I argue that this principle shares five common features with historical eugenics which justify the conclusion that it is eugenic. However, while I argue that this principle is eugenic, I argue that it is not morally problematic for that reason because the shared features of historical eugenics and the Principle of Procreative Beneficence, which justify the claim that the principle is eugenic, are not morally problematic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Contaminated sites in the Arctic pose risks to the environment and human health, and provide a major challenge to scientists attempting to carry out remediation on these sites. This project examines background information on the Arctic, the unique challenges that the Arctic poses for remediation, the types of remediation technologies that can be applied to the Arctic, and how life cycle assessment can be used to determine the effectiveness of remediation in the Arctic. This information is then applied to a theoretical case study involving remediation of a diesel spill within the city limits of Iqaluit, Nunavut. A simplified life cycle assessment is used to examine the benefits and drawbacks of landfarming within Iqaluit city limits versus shipping contaminated soil south to a landfill. This assessment is accomplished through comparison of toxicity to those involved in the remediation, length of time required for remediation, CO2 output from the remediation itself, and economic benefits to the community. Landfarming was found to be the better technique overall, as it has lower CO2 production and has greater financial benefits to the community of Iqaluit. However, it is a more time consuming process, and may result in higher toxicity due to volatilization of diesel.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous research studies have demonstrated that international graduate students experience various challenges adapting to academic situations within a new university community. This thesis reports on an interview study with six international graduate students who use English as a second language studying Master’s degree at one Canadian university. This study addresses the academic assessment and evaluation experience of international graduate students in the following four aspects: (1) their enjoyable and challenging assessment practices; (2) understanding of assessment expectations; (3) reflections on previous educational experience; and (4) psychological and physical factors in relation to assessment and evaluation. The findings indicate that these students’ experiences of assessment and evaluation procedures are varied and the academic acculturation process towards assessment depends on different yet interrelated factors: English language competence, cultural and educational awareness, and assessment literacy. All six research participants adapted to the host academic assessment practices and procedures fairly well despite the fact that they were not familiar with the expectations and requirements regarding assessment and evaluation at the beginning of their studies. These students learned about the host academic culture regarding assessment and evaluation through their own examination failure, instructors’ feedback, and peers’ observation. The findings also indicate that international graduate students need more coordinated support from university supportive services and easier access to information about assessment and evaluation expectations and requirements. Implications of the findings for effective learning and positive academic experience for L2 international graduate students, faculty and supportive staff, and for future research are discussed. It is suggested to organize workshops and seminars devoted to assessment literacy for international and domestic graduate students, instructors and supporting staff in order to enhance learning experience and outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies the importance and implications of information asymmetry in decentralized markets with search frictions. The first chapter provides an introduction and literature review. In the next chapter, I propose a model of the housing market using a search framework in which sellers are unable to commit to asking prices announced ex ante. Relaxing the commitment assumption prevents sellers from using price posting as a signalling device to direct buyers' search. Adverse selection and inefficient entry on the demand side then contribute to housing market illiquidity. Real estate agents that can facilitate the search process can segment the market and alleviate information frictions. In Chapter 3, I further study the importance and implications of the commitment assumptions embedded in directed search models. I eliminate commitment to take-it-or-leave-it trading mechanisms in a model of the labour market with worker heterogeneity and a matching process that allows for multiple firms to match with a single worker. When workers and firms cannot commit to ex ante offers, to an allocation rule, or to an ex post bargaining strategy, the equilibrium is necessarily inefficient. This is true for a broad class of protocols for wage determination, of which bilateral bargaining and Bertrand competition are special cases. Finally, Chapter 4 presents a theory of land market activity for settings where there is uncertainty and private information about the security of land tenure. Land sellers match with buyers in a competitive search environment, and an illiquid land market emerges as a screening mechanism. The implications of the theory are tested using household level data from Indonesia. As predicted, formally titled land is more liquid than untitled land in the sense that ownership rights are more readily transferable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High capacitance devices were developed using rapid electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of barium titanate (BaTiO3) on ultrasonically etched nickel (Ni) substrates. The microstructural and &#xD;
electrical properties of films with varying thicknesses, sintering temperatures and substrate etching times were investigated to study their effect on the capacitance. Although increasing the capacitance was the primary goal, decreasing manufacturing costs and reducing environmental impact was also considered. After confirming the tetragonality and particle size of a 0.2 µm hydrothermal powder, it was dispersed in an aqueous-organic mixture of ethanol, acetone and water. A zeta potential of 50 mV was observed at the EPD pH level (6.8). Flocculation or coagulation was not likely in this situation. Therefore, mixing water with an organic solution was an effective method for reducing environmental impact while maintaining deposition quality. The presence of BaCO3 in the films was proven using X-ray diffraction. Other impurities &#xD;
such as TiO2 and NiO were not detected. A significant variation in the average grain size was not observed for films with different thicknesses whereas films sintered at different temperatures displayed greater variation. A bimodal pore size distribution in the samples suggested that the powder was agglomerated after deposition due to a high deposition voltage (20 V). Rapid deposition times of 2 to 8 seconds offered a potential for cost reduction compared to longer &#xD;
deposition times implemented in industry. Therefore the increased porosity was accepted. The dielectric constant of the films increased from 2900 to 6730 as the thickness increased from 17.75 µm to 47.5 µm. The dissipation factor decreased from 0.27 to 0.06 with increasing thickness. This behavior was attributed to a low dielectric constant interfacial layer and a higher dielectric leakage current at smaller thicknesses. The dielectric constant increased from 1700 to 6350 and the dissipation factor decreased from 0.23 to 0.04 as the sintering temperature increased from 1150°C to 1300°C. This was attributed to an increase in tetragonality with grain size and a decrease in porosity with sintering temperature. Finally, etching a substrate for 60 seconds increased its capacitance by 27.47% and using ultrasonic agitation further increased the capacitance by 8.75%.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A test system for the performance analysis of a novel thermally regenerative fuel cell (TRFC) using propiophenone and hydrogen as the oxidant and fuel respectively was designed and built.  The test system is capable of either hydrogen-air or hydrogen-propiophenone operation.  &#xD;
Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were made using commercial phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes and commercial electrodes.  Using Pt/carbon paper electrodes with a catalyst loading of 1mg/cm2 and a membrane with an acid doping level of 10.2 mol acid/mol of polymer repeat unit, a maximum performance of 212 mW/cm2 at a current density of 575 mA/cm2 was achieved for baseline hydrogen-air testing at 110°C.  Problems were encountered, however, in achieving consistent, reproducible performance for in-house fabricated MEAs. Furthermore, ex-situ electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) showed that the phosphoric acid-doped PBI was unstable in the propiophenone and that acid-leaching was occurring.  &#xD;
In order to have MEAs with consistent characteristics for verifying the test system performance, commercial phosphoric acid-doped PBI membrane electrode assemblies were used.  At a temperature of 160°C and atmospheric pressure with hydrogen and air flowrates of 150 mL/min and 900 mL/min respectively a maximum power density of 387 mW/cm2 at a current density of 1.1 A/cm2 was achieved.  This performance was consistent with the manufacturer’s specifications and these MEAs were subsequently used to verify the performance of TRFC test system despite the EIS results that indicated that acid-leaching would probably occur.&#xD;
The Pt catalyzed commercial MEAs achieved very limited performance for the hydrogenation of the ketone. However, the performance was less than but comparable to similar results previously reported in the literature by Chaurasia et al. [1].&#xD;
For pure Pt catalyst loading of 1 mg/cm2, using a commercial PBI MEA operating at 160°C and atmospheric pressure, the maximum power density was 40 µW/cm2 at a current density of 1.3 mA/cm2.  A 16 hour test was conducted for these conditions with a constant 1 ohm load, successfully demonstrating the operation of the test system. The test system will be used in the development of better catalysts for ketone hydrogenation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the discourses surrounding the subject of climate change, with particular emphasis on the discourse(s) of the emerging social movement for climate justice. Positioned within the social constructivist and critical research paradigms, the methodology involves a Foucauldian-inspired discourse analysis in which discourse is defined as a historically-situated, materially-embodied, and power-imbued set of statements and rules that comprise a unique and coherent representation of the world. A review of the climate change-related literature reveals four primary discourses on the phenomenon of rising greenhouse gas emissions: early scientific, climate modernization, climate change denial, and climate justice. The statements and rules of these four discourses, as well as the theoretical trends and sociopolitical, economic, and ecological factors affecting their historical development are described. A deeper analysis using 26 primary documents representing every major climate justice organization reveals that rather than a single coherent discourse, the climate justice movement encompasses four individual sub-discourses: global, peasant-oriented, Indigenous, and civil rights. Focussed on climate-related inequities in developing countries of the Southern Hemisphere, the global discourse constructs climate change as a problem of the structures and logic of the globalized capitalist economy. The peasant-oriented discourse emphasizes inequities to peasant farmers, and represents climate change as largely the result of industrialized agriculture and food systems. With specific concern for the wellbeing of Indigenous communities, the Indigenous discourse locates the cause of climate change in the “violation of the sacred” and the loss of harmony with Mother Earth. The United States-based civil rights discourse primarily emphasizes the rights and interests of African American communities and constructs climate change as a problem of externalized ecological costs and failure to incent a “green” economy. The relations of power between the four climate justice sub-discourses and the prevailing climate modernization discourse are tentatively explored on the basis of three indicators of strength (internal coherence, material foundations, and adaptive capacity), on which basis several questions related to discursive resistance are proposed as possible avenues of future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The idea of home, the ownership of property, and the impact of the home on the moral character and identity of its inhabitants were important concepts in the late nineteenth century.  These views were perpetuated by a wide range of supporters including writers, religious leaders, social reformers, politicians.  Architects and developers became aware of these ideas and capitalized on the hopes and dreams of middle-class North America by designing, marketing and building the right kind of houses, but perhaps more importantly, by building them in the right location which most often meant the suburban areas around major cities. Architect and writer Franklin Townsend Lent (1855-1919) is but one of many architects practicing in North America who appreciated the contemporary consumers’ sensibilities, and their attachment to their homes.  Not only did Lent understand the importance of the concept of home, he was able to develop a design vocabulary that drew on the contemporary fascination with the American colonial period.  In addition, he appreciated the consumer’s desire for a beautiful home in the suburbs, and took advantage of this in his work in New Jersey notably on the development of a suburban neighbourhood called Roosevelt Manor.  Lent contributed to the built environment by designing and building many suburban houses, island and seaside cottages, and other structures.  He also wrote three books and several pamphlets that provide an understanding of his personal contribution to architecture in suburban American, and to the early development of resort architecture in the Thousand Island region of Upstate New York and Ontario, an area that has received very little scholarly attention.  This paper will focus on the domestic architecture of Lent in an attempt to construct an understanding of this unique contribution in the context of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century society by examining his published architectural writings, his advertisements, and some representative houses that he designed and built in the United States and Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the past 40 years, severe population fluctuations in Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) living in the High Arctic of Nunavut has caused widespread concern. In order to better understand these fluctuations, patterns of population characteristics need to be examined. The best source for long-range information is from Inuit, who have interacted with these species on a regular basis over the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents the collection and documentation of observations by Inuit to describe the population distribution of caribou and muskoxen. Interviewees also shared their understanding of factors contributing to changes in abundance, and information concerning the ecology of these species.&#xD;
Interviewees from Resolute Bay have observed severe fluctuations in the abundance of caribou on Somerset, Prince of Wales, Russell, Cornwallis and Bathurst Islands and northern Boothia Peninsula. Interviewees from Grise Fiord indicated that changes in caribou populations on Devon and southern Ellesmere Islands have occurred but have not been substantial. Interviewees also indicated that the populations of muskoxen on Somerset, Prince of Wales, Devon and Southern Ellesmere Islands have increased, whereas muskoxen populations on Cornwallis and Bathurst Islands have been consistently low.&#xD;
Overall, interviewees expressed that changes in caribou and muskoxen populations are normal. However, interviewees continue to be concerned with the possibility of negative impacts caused by significant human disturbance (e.g., petroleum exploration). They also suggest that factors such as weather, presence of forage and the handling of animals influence the distribution, abundance and health of caribou and muskoxen.&#xD;
Interviewees also described the variability in the physical traits of Peary caribou throughout the High Arctic islands. Generally, from Boothia Peninsula to Bathurst Island the bones of caribou become smaller and their fur has a finer texture. On the islands north of Bathurst Island the features that are unique to Peary caribou become more pronounced. Interviewees also explained that overall, caribou are not negatively impacted by wolves and that a large abundance of muskoxen is often followed by the decline in the population of caribou in a specific area. The documentation of this information contributes to our understanding of two unique northern species, and has the potential to aid in shaping the management of human activities that may affect them.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The generation and isolation of two novel borenium cations has been described. The observation that the reaction of the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 and the Lewis base diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) with pinacol borane (HBpin) resulted in the activation of the B–H bond of  HBpin and formation of a stable borenium cation/borohydride salt. This stable salt was used as a catalyst in the hydroboration reaction. It was shown to catalytically reduce a wide array of substrates including imines, N-heterocycles, nitriles, and ketones using pinacol borane as the source of hydride. Another borenium ion, synthesized from trityl tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl borate, DABCO, and HBpin did not contain a nucleophilic borohydride counterion and it was isolated in the solid state. This salt was also found to reduce the same substrates with similar yields and reaction times.  &#xD;
The mechanisms of both of these catalysts were investigated and were found to be proceeding by a similar borenium catalyzed process. Quantitative analysis of the initial rates of each catalyst under identical conditions yielded rate constants on the same order of magnitude which strongly suggested that both catalysts operated via similar mechanisms. Stoichiometric experiments and isotope labelling using deuterated pinacol borane demonstrated that the nucleophilic counterion was not a kinetically relevant reducing agent under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, these reactions and the use of an isolable iminium ion as a hydride acceptor indicated that the hydride delivery agent was a DABCO•HBpin adduct. The DABCO•HBpin adduct was observed spectroscopically at ambient and subzero temperatures. Lastly, the rate of reduction using pinacol borane and [d1]-pinacol borane were significantly different and produced a high kinetic isotope effect (KIE = kH/kD = 6.6 ± 0.2). This high KIE strongly indicates that hydride delivery is the rate limiting step in the catalytic cycle. With this knowledge an asymmetric model is discussed and the beginnings of the development of an asymmetric borenium cation catalyzed process are described.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction has become extremely important in the area of industry and academia. The ability to cleanly cross-couple aryl, alkyl, or alkenyl boronic acids/esters with aryl, alkyl, or alkenyl halides to generate new C-C bonds has proven to be a versatile tool towards the synthesis of complex molecules. Over the past three decades, there has been an array of developments and accomplishments in this area of research including the joint awarding of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Suzuki, Heck, and Negishi. &#xD;
Our group published the first successful example of the cross-coupling of chiral secondary benzylic boronic esters. The key components in this reaction were the incorporation of silver oxide and excess triphenyl phosphine. Silver oxide was required for the transmetallation step to occur. Remarkably, the reaction was not only effective for the coupling of these challenging substrates; it was also selective for the branched benzylic species in the presence of a linear alkyl boronic ester. &#xD;
In order to further probe the selectivity of the aforementioned cross-coupling reaction, we have prepared a substrate that incorporates both an aryl and a secondary benzylic boronic ester. Since the secondary benzylic boronic ester requires specialized conditions for the cross-coupling to proceed, we have been able to employ this reaction to introduce two different substituents in place of the boron groups based solely on reaction conditions. Herein, we discuss the optimization and successful chemoselective/iterative Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of a substrate that incorporates both an aryl and a secondary benzylic boronic ester without the need of protecting groups on the boron atoms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bullying continues to be a significant problem for children and adolescents. Peers are often involved in bullying as bystanders. Through their actions or inactions, bystanders can support the bullying, or can stop it by defending the person who is victimized. The increasing use and availability of digital communications technology has provided an avenue for electronic bullying. Little is known about the role of peers in electronic bullying, nor about how peers behave across traditional and electronic bullying.  Using a developmental contextualism framework to examine how the peer group context and environmental contexts of bullying influence adolescent interactions, this group of studies aimed to identify and explore peer roles in electronic bullying, and to compare peer roles across traditional and electronic bullying contexts. The first study developed and validated an assessment of peer roles in electronic bullying, the Electronic Bullying Roles Questionnaire (EBRQ), based on the traditional bullying roles identified by Salmivalli and colleagues (Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Österman, &amp; Kaukiainen, 1996). The second study examined the correspondence between peer bystander roles across traditional and electronic bullying environments. The third study examined peers who intervene in traditional and electronic bullying, by examining whether perceptions of the harmfulness of bullying would influence subsequent defending behaviours. Overall, our findings confirmed that peers are involved in electronic bullying, and that these electronic roles parallel the behaviours and characteristics associated with traditional peer roles. However, our findings also suggest that the unique features of the electronic environment can lead to inconsistencies in adolescent bystander behaviours across bullying contexts. This research has implications for understanding how the peer group behaves when witnessing bullying in both bullying contexts. In addition, this research illuminates some of the similarities and differences between traditional and electronic bullying. It is our hope that this research leads to a greater understanding of the factors related to peer participant roles in both bullying contexts. Understanding traditional and electronic peer roles may help to provide insight into the peer processes involved in bullying, which may in turn inform intervention efforts to encourage adolescents to defend others when confronted with bullying, no matter the context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This case study described the experiences of secondary students and preservice mathematics teachers in the teaching and learning of social justice mathematics (SJM). Specifically, participants’ experiences in making connections among the mathematics curricula and the real world, perceptions about mathematics, and responses to an integrated curriculum approach were described. Students participated in SJM activities designed by preservice teacher participants: one component of a pre-existing extracurricular Social Issues Club at a high school in Southeastern Ontario. Mathematics activities, led by the researcher or one of the preservice teacher participants, were designed to complement the social justice issues that were being explored by the members of the Social Issues Club. Data were obtained through observations, questionnaires, focus group, individual interviews, written reflections, and artifacts. Results demonstrated that preservice teacher participants had unique professional and educational encounters prior to SJM that they connected to their SJM experience. Subsequent to this experience, preservice teachers suggested limited ideas about integrating curriculum into their future teaching practice beyond the content and contexts made familiar to them through SJM. With limited exposure to examples of curriculum integration identified by preservice teachers as a barrier, results suggest that preservice teachers need more opportunities to engage in mathematics curriculum integration. &#xD;
Students showed an expanded view of connections between mathematics and the real world through their descriptions of the various ways in which SJM had helped them to apply mathematics concepts and understand the issues they were exploring. They enjoyed SJM’s collaborative mathematics learning approach and valued the opportunity to discuss the social issues about which they were concerned. Although the preservice teachers were confident about what they thought to be topics of interest for secondary students, there was a disconnect between students’ choices of contexts for mathematics learning and the beginning teachers’ assumptions about students’ interest. This finding suggests that there is a need to support preservice teachers to understand students’ interests in mathematics learning and that students’ opinion needs to be solicited. In addition, participants’ visions about enhancing mathematics teaching and learning through collaboration and providing students with autonomy allowed suggestions for the practice of mathematics teaching.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The teratogenic effects of valproic acid (VPA) are well known, though its teratogenic mechanism remains unknown. VPA induces oxidative stress, which may lead to double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. Though the cell may repair this damage via homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), repair is not always error-free; genomic instability may arise from gene deletions, amplifications, rearrangements, and loss of heterozygosity. Such alterations may underpin VPAʼs teratogenicity. The present study evaluated VPAʼs ability to induce NHEJ and HR and characterized the changes in expression of two proteins key to HR (RAD51) and NHEJ (XRCC4).&#xD;
Using pKZ1 transgenic mice (C57BL/6 genetic background), we sought to measure NHEJ events via X-gal staining. Although consistent staining was observed in adult male brain (positive control), no staining was observed in embryos 12 or 24 hours after in utero exposure to a teratogenic dose of VPA (500 mg/kg, maternal subcutaneous dose) on gestational day 9 (GD9).&#xD;
To determine whether the lack of staining observed in embryos was due to low/absent expression of key DSB-repair proteins, we measured mRNA/protein expression of RAD51 and XRCC4 in C57BL/6, GD9-exposed embryos and maternal brain. One hour after treatment, XRCC4 was increased at the protein level in brain and embryo. RAD51 was not increased in embryos and not detected in adult brain. These data suggest that embryos do possess the protein mediators of NHEJ and HR and that VPA-induced changes in expression of XRCC4 may influence the type of repair pursued, potentially affecting DSB repair fidelity (accuracy).&#xD;
Determination of fidelity of VPA-induced HR was attempted with the Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO33) using DNA sequencing; low template concentration and purity precluded successful sequencing of DNA from recombinant colonies and the assessment of fidelity.&#xD;
Overall, these data demonstrate that the lack of X-gal staining observed in pKZ1 embryos is not due to an underexpression of at least one key protein in the NHEJ pathway. Furthermore, a VPA-induced change in the the type of repair pathway pursued by the embryo may have teratological implications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of my study was to explore what and how university students learned from their experiences working as peer educators. In my study, I was only interested in investigating peer educators working in formal peer education programs within the post-secondary setting. I defined learning as “a comprehensive, holistic, transformative activity that integrates academic learning and student development” (italics in original, ACPA &amp; NASPA, 2004, p. 2). I used a modified version of the CAS 2009 learning outcomes framework to understand what peer educators learned. Those six CAS learning outcomes are: knowledge acquisition, construction, integration, and application; cognitive complexity; intrapersonal development; interpersonal competence; humanitarianism and civic engagement; and practical competence.&#xD;
I adopted a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory approach to the study of the content and context of peer educators’ learning. I selected participants for my study from a pool of peer educators of a student affairs’ learning assistance peer education program at a mid-sized Ontario university. I conducted face-to-face, in-depth interviews with seven peer educators.&#xD;
My research revealed what peer educators in a single peer education program learned; it also provided insight into their experience of learning within the peer education program, i.e., how they learned. This study offers some insight into the potential for learning, as well as potential facilitators of learning, in the university peer educator role. The findings of my research indicate that the peer educators whom I studied learned in each of the six CAS learning outcomes. The facilitators of learning that these peer educators described in their interviews include learning from experience, interactions with others, reflection, and training. The findings of my study suggest that further research could be conducted, at various institutions as well as within and across peer education programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We classify the smooth complete intersections with positive-definite intersection form on their middle cohomology. There are two families. The first family are quadric hypersurfaces in P(4k+1) with k a positive integer. The middle cohomology is always of rank two and the intersection lattice corresponds to the identity matrix. The second family are complete intersections of two quadrics in P(4k+2) (k a positive integer). Here the intersection lattices are the Gamma(4(k+1)) lattices; in particular, the intersection lattice of a smooth complete intersection of two quadrics in P(6) is the famous E8 lattice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Leptin is an adipokine that acts centrally to regulate feeding behaviour, energy expenditure and autonomic function via activation of its receptor (ObRb) in nuclei in the central nervous system (CNS). This thesis investigates the involvement of two sensory circumventricular organs (CVOs), the subfornical organ (SFO) and area postrema (AP), in mediating the central effects of leptin using a variety of experimental approaches. &#xD;
We first show that acute electrical stimulation of the SFO elicits feeding in satiated rats, supporting a role for this specialized CNS structure in the control of food intake. We then demonstrate, using RT-PCR, the presence of ObRb mRNA in SFO and, using whole cell current clamp electrophysiology, reveal that leptin influences the excitability of individual SFO neurons, causing both excitatory and inhibitory responses.  Furthermore, we find that leptin activates the same SFO neurons activated by amylin.  &#xD;
Given the association between obesity and hypertension and the well-established role of the SFO in cardiovascular regulation, we show that leptin microinjection into the SFO decreases blood pressure in young rats, effects that are abolished in leptin-resistant, diet induced obese rats, suggesting that leptin-insensitivity in the SFO of obese, leptin-resistant, individuals may contribute to obesity-related hypertension.  &#xD;
Our studies also show that the medullary AP expresses ObRb and that leptin influences the excitability of AP neurons. Furthermore, we show that leptin and amylin act on the same subpopulation of neurons in the AP. &#xD;
Finally, our preliminary AP/SFO lesion studies reveal that animals with these lesions exhibit a profound decrease in body weight and food intake and no longer exhibit decreases in body weight in response to peripheral leptin administration. &#xD;
In summary, the data presented in this thesis suggest the SFO and AP to be important in body weight homeostasis and in mediating the central effects of leptin. In addition, these areas appear to be important in the integration of multiple signals derived from peripheral sources. Furthermore, the fact that the SFO appears to be involved in leptin effects on both energy balance and cardiovascular regulation attest to the integrative nature of the SFO in the control of diverse physiological functions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation offers a re-evaluation of the role of the imagination in Jean- Jacques Rousseau’s 'Emile: or On Education' (1762) and Christoph Martin Wieland’s 'Geschichte des Agathon' (1794). My central claim is that both novels develop a pedagogy of the imagination in order to overcome the dilemmas of Cartesian dualism, that is, to form a beautiful soul in whom sensuality and reason, the body and the spirit, coexist in harmony. I demonstrate that both texts highlight the important but potentially damaging role played by the imagination in the development of religious thought, moral sentiments, and sexuality. The texts suggest that while a malformed imagination results in materialism, egotism, libertinism, and despotism, a well-formed imagination provides the foundation for natural religion, cosmopolitan enthusiasm, sentimental love, and a just political constitution. Consequently, I argue that for Rousseau and Wieland, harnessing the power of the imagination becomes the key to reconciling human nature and civil society.&#xD;
     In addition to elucidating the role of the imagination in 'Emile' and 'Agathon', this dissertation also contributes to an understanding of the intellectual affinities between Rousseau and Wieland more generally. In preparation for the comparative reading of 'Emile' and 'Agathon', I survey Wieland’s private and public responses to Rousseau and contend that although the two authors differ significantly in their narrative and philosophical approach, they nevertheless share similar moral and political ideals. Both authors acknowledge the ability of the imagination to drive a wedge between the individual’s natural inclinations and moral duties, causing fragmentation of the self and society in turn. Yet the imagination, the motor of cultural progress, is not only the source of man’s alienation, it is also the remedy for his dividedness. If properly harnessed, the imagination can cease to be the cause of human depravity and become the basis of peaceful human relations, both at the level of the individual and that of society as a whole. In conclusion, I propose that the role of the imagination in forming the beautiful soul has consequences for the collective, and that we can read the moral constitutions of Emile and Agathon as negotiating the possibilities of various political constitutions, including that of a democratic state.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite the popularity of Vietnamese cuisine in Toronto, there is limited understanding of how this culinary cuisine is socially constructed through its consumption and production. This thesis research examines the production of Toronto’s Vietnamese culinary landscape with the aim of unpacking the discursive power relations between consumers’ and purveyors’ construction of authenticity through the processes of racialization. It also highlights the identities created through racialized consumption and production practices, and how such identity constructions are constitutive of Vietnamese culinary culture. To this aim, consumers were surveyed and in-depth interviews were conducted with owners and managers. Results from the fieldwork process demonstrated that both consumers and producers construct authenticity and images of Vietnamese culture for their own benefits but had different, and sometimes confounding, understandings of how such constructions are interpreted and practiced.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Food web biomanipulations provide the means to partly control water quality problems (i.e. algal blooms) in lakes by altering internal ecological mechanisms. However biomanipulation mechanisms are complex and the results are often confounded through the interactions of various stressors. This study used paleolimnological approaches using the fossil remains of diatoms, Cladocera and Chaoborus indicators to explore the effects of past fish manipulations of two oligotrophic lakes (Mouse and Ranger lakes) located in south-central Ontario. A major focus was the temporal period associated with the most recent Dorset Food Web Piscivore Manipulation Project (1991-1997). The diatom assemblages recorded only subtle changes over time, with the most pronounced variation in the past decade, likely responding to recent warming and bottom-up processes. Following the smallmouth (Micropterus dolomieu) and largemouth (Micropterus salmoides) bass addition to Mouse Lake, the zooplankton and Chaoborus fossil record revealed that a reduction in planktivorous fish led to expected shifts in community size structure, but with changes apparently delayed by ~5-10 years. Primary production, as inferred from VRS chlorophyll-a concentrations, had been relatively stable for over ~200 years but increased significantly following the piscivore addition. A shift to larger, more efficient herbivorous zooplankton (i.e. Daphnia) may have been expected to suppress phytoplankton as they are able to filter food particles at a much faster rate and graze a wider size-range of algae compared to the less effective grazer, Bosmina. Additionally, changes to the lake system from climate warming may have uncoupled the trophic interactions, producing a mismatch in the timing of favourable environmental conditions in an algal-herbivore interaction. In addition, these oligotrophic lakes support algal communities often classed as being ungrazable, which would also substantially reduce grazer-mediated responses in the phytoplankton. Ranger Lake did not respond to reductions to piscivores as expected in terms of zooplankton and Chaoborus size structure. Larger-bodied Cladocera (i.e. Daphnia, Holopedium gibberum and Polyphemus pediculus) increased in abundance while small Bosmina species decreased markedly in the uppermost sediments. While some results of this study corroborated the expected effects of biomanipulation theory (i.e. species-specific shifts in size), the inconsistencies encountered highlight that other drivers (i.e. climate) are likely to&#xD;
mediate the effects of biomanipulations, particularly in temperate lake systems experiencing multiple stressors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Advanced malicious software threats have become commonplace in cyberspace, with large scale cyber threats exploiting consumer, corporate and government systems on a constant basis. Regardless of the target, upon successful infiltration into a target system an attacker will commonly deploy a backdoor to maintain persistent access as well as a rootkit to evade detection on the infected machine.  If the attacked system has access to classified or sensitive material, virus eradication may not be the best response.  Instead, a counter-intelligence operation may be initiated to track the infiltration back to its source. It is important that the counter-intelligence operations are not detectable by the infiltrator.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rootkits can not only hide malware, they can also hide the detection and analysis operations of the defenders from malware. This thesis presents a rootkit based on Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC). This allows the counter-intelligence software to exist inside the kernel and avoid detection. Two techniques are presented to defeat current detection methods: Trident, using a kernel-mode driver to inject payloads into the user-mode address space of processes, and Sidewinder, moving rapidly between user-mode threads without intervention from any kernel-mode controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, an implementation of the explored techniques is discussed. The Dark Knight framework is outlined, explaining the loading process that employs Master Boot Record (MBR) modifications and the primary driver that enables table hooking, kernel object manipulation, virtual memory subversion, payload injection, and subterfuge. A brief overview of Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems is also presented to outline how the Dark Knight system can be used in conjunction with for immediate reactive investigations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This three-phase qualitative study examined the significance of personal learning in the lives of full-time elementary school teachers in Ontario, Canada. The research aimed to provide an awareness of the effects of engaged personal learning on teachers’ in-school practices and on student engagement in school. An online questionnaire was used as the initial exploratory tool. The questionnaire was completed by 87 Ontario elementary teachers, and results were stratified by age, gender, range of learning experiences, and career stage. The questionnaire was used to generate descriptive statistics, identify how elementary teachers pursue personal learning interests across different career stages, and gather open responses, in order to determine how teachers characterize their engagement in personal learning opportunities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven participants to characterize the teachers’ learning experiences, and to explore their views as to how their learning affected them personally and professionally. Classroom observations ensued with three of the interviewees. The data analysis indicated that the nature of personal learning varies across different career stages, and that such learning occurs most often in an informal setting. It also revealed the significance of learning opportunities that both challenge and extend knowledge in real-life contexts and/or that is social or collaborative in nature. Three themes—connections, self as learner, and vitality—emerged from the reported effects of teachers’ personal learning on their students and their classroom practice. The teachers’ passion for learning was evident in the many ways that they provide meaningful, collaborative, and challenging opportunities for their students in a very supportive and nurturing environment. Through the data collection and analysis, it became clear that some of the most profound learning experiences were not preplanned or intentional in nature, but arose as a result of life. In some cases, the participants did not consider these experiences to be learning—until they began to detail the effects that these experiences had on them, both as individuals and as educators. Suggestions for future research are offered to continue learning from teachers who take part in personal learning, and from the students that they teach.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Image-guided surgeries employ advanced imaging and computing technologies to assist the surgeon when direct visualization is inadequate or unavailable. As modern surgeries continue to move toward minimally invasive procedures, tracked ultrasound (US), an emerging technology that uniquely combines US imaging and position tracking, has been increasingly used for intraoperative guidance in surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The intrinsic accuracy of a tracked US system is primarily determined by a unique procedure called ``probe calibration", where a spatial registration between the coordinate systems of the transducer (provided by a tracking device affixed to the probe) and the US image plane must be established prior to imaging. Inaccurate system calibration causes misalignments between the US image and the surgical end-effectors, which may directly contribute to treatment failure. The probe calibration quality is further reduced by the "elevation beamwidth" or "slice thickness", a unique feature of the ultrasound beam pattern that gives rise to localization errors and imaging uncertainties.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we aim to provide an automated, pure-computation-based, intraoperative calibration solution that also incorporates the slice thickness to improve the calibration accuracy, precision and reliability. The following contributions have been made during the course of this research. First, we have designed and developed an automated, freehand US calibration system with instant feedback on its calibration accuracy. The system was able to consistently achieve submillimeter accuracy with real-time performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, we have developed a novel beamwidth-weighted calibration framework (USB-FW) that incorporates US slice thickness to improve the estimation of calibration parameters. The new framework provides an effective means of quality control for calibration results. Extensive phantom validation demonstrated that USB-FW introduces statistically significant reduction (p = 0.001) in the calibration errors and produces calibration outcomes that are less variable than a conventional, non-beamwidth-weighted calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we were the first to introduce an automated, intraoperative Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) calibration technology for needle guidance in prostate brachytherapy. Our tests with multiple commercial TRUS scanners and brachytherapy stepper systems demonstrated that the proposed method is practical in use and can achieve high calibration accuracy, precision and robustness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A steady-state mathematical model for the stripping section of an industrial EPDM rubber production process was developed for a three-tank process, and two four-tank processes. The experiments that were conducted to determine model parameters such as equivalent radius for EPDM particles, as well as solubility and diffusivity parameters for hexane and ENB in EPDM polymer are described. A single-particle multiple-tank model was developed first, and a process model that accounts for the residence-time distribution of crumb particles was developed second. Plant data as well as input data from an existing steady-state model was used to determine estimates for the tuning parameters used in the multiple-particle, multiple-tank model. Using plant data to assess the model’s predictive accuracy, the resulting three-tank and four-tank process B models provide accurate model predictions with a typical error of 0.35 parts per hundred resin (phr) and 0.12 phr. The four-tank process A model provides less-accurate model predictions for residual crumb concentrations in the second tank and has an overall typical error of 1.05 phr. Additional plant data from the three- and four-tank processes would increase the estimability of the parameter values for parameter ranking and estimations steps and thus, yield increased model predictive accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cell-based therapies involving adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have shown promise in stimulating cardiovascular regeneration, including in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic heart disease. However, previous studies involving the delivery of ASCs following MI have indicated that therapeutic efficacy has been limited by low survival and/or poor retention of the transplanted cells at the site of injury. To address these limitations, the goal of this thesis was to develop a more effective delivery strategy incorporating an injectable biomaterial combined with chemotactic growth factor delivery to enhance ASC retention within the gel. Working towards future in vivo analysis in a rat model, multilineage characterization studies confirmed that ASCs isolated from the epididymal fat pad of male Wistar rats could differentiate in vitro along the adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Subsequently, the chemotactic response of the rat ASCs (rASCs) to varying concentrations of stromal derived factor-1 α (SDF-1α) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was analyzed using a modified Boyden chamber assay. The results demonstrated that SDF-1α and HGF, at 20, 50, and 100 ng/mL elicited significant migratory responses under normoxic (21%) and hypoxic (5%) culture conditions. RT-PCR analysis was conducted to assess the expression of the two chemotactic growth factors and their associated receptors in the rASCs, and secreted SDF-1α protein expression was quantified by ELISA. Moving towards the development of the biomaterials-based delivery approach, the viability of rASCs encapsulated by photopolymerization in methacrylated glycol chitosan (MGC) hydrogels modified with various degrees of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-peptide modification was examined. More specifically, rASCs were encapsulated in MGC hydrogels with 0%, 4%, and 7% RGD modification and cultured for up to 14 days. Viability staining results indicated that rASC viability was enhanced in the 4% and 7% RGD-modified MGC hydrogels in comparison to the MGC hydrogels with no peptide modification. Pre-loading the gels with 50 ng/mL of SDF-1α had no significant effects on cell viability over 14 days. Overall, the results demonstrate that peptide modification to promote cell adhesion within the MGC hydrogels is key to improving cell viability and thereby improving the therapeutic potential of ASCs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is concerned, loosely, with time series analysis. It is also, loosely, concerned with smoothers and Generalized Additive Models. And, finally, it is also concerned with the estimation of health risk due to air pollution.&#xD;
In the field of time series analysis, we develop two data-driven interpolation algorithms for interpolation of mixed time series data; that is, data which has a stationary or “almost” stationary background with embedded deterministic trend and&#xD;
sinusoidal components. These interpolators are developed to deal with the problem of estimating power spectra under the condition that some observations of the series are unavailable.&#xD;
We examine the structure of time-based cubic regression spline smoothers in Generalized Additive Models and demonstrate several interpretation problems with the&#xD;
resultant models. We propose, implement, and test a replacement smoother and show dramatic improvement. We further demonstrate a new, spectrally motivated way of&#xD;
examining residuals in Generalized Additive Models which drives many of the findings of this thesis.&#xD;
Finally, we create and analyze a large-scale Canadian air pollution and mortality database. In the course of analyzing the data we rebuild the standard risk estimation model and demonstrate several improvements. We conclude with a comparison of the original model and the updated model and show that the new model gives consistently more positive risk estimates.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Air-conditioning systems driven by solar energy have can save primary energy and reduce peak power consumption, which is particularly important for utility providers in the summer months. Additionally solar cooling is a promising application of solar thermal technology since the cooling load is well correlated to the overall solar availability. Liquid desiccant air-conditioning, which uses a salt solution to dehumidify air, can be used in a thermally driven air-conditioning system and offers many benefits for solar applications including the ability to store solar energy in the form of concentrated liquid desiccant. &#xD;
The current work focuses on the Queen’s University Solar Liquid Desiccant Cooling Demonstration Project. In previous work, a pre-commercial Liquid Desiccant Air Conditioner (LDAC) was installed and experimentally characterized using a gas-fired boiler to provide heat. As part of the current study a 95m2 solar array was added as a heat source. The Solar LDAC was tested for 20 days in the summer of 2012 to evaluate performance. &#xD;
The solar LDAC was found to provide between 9.2kW and 17.2kW of cooling power with an overall thermal Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 0.40 and electrical COP of 2.43. The collector efficiency was 53%, and 40% of the required thermal energy was provided by the solar array. &#xD;
	A model was developed in TRNSYS to predict the performance of the solar LDAC and simulation results were compared to the experimental results with reasonable accuracy. The validated model was then used to simulate the annual performance of the solar LDAC in Toronto, Ontario; Vancouver, British Columbia; and Miami, Florida. The highest performance was achieved in Miami, where an overall thermal COP of 0.48 was predicted. &#xD;
	It is proposed that additional improvements be made to the system by replacing inefficient pumps and fans, adding desiccant storage, and improving the control scheme.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Axon guidance is the developmental process where developing neurons navigate their processes based on attractive and repulsive cues. C. elegans has been an instrumental model in the study of neurobiology with one of the key benefits being a relatively simple nervous system which comprises of only 302 neurons.  The Eph Receptors are a canonical class of axon guidance molecules and in C. elegans there is only Eph receptor VAB-1.  To understand axon guidance it is useful to study the mechanosensory neurons, and in particular a pair of neurons called the PLM (Posterior Lateral Microtubule).  In this thesis I undertook a series of projects involving new techniques, and identified gene products that may interact with VAB-1 in the PLMs.  I demonstrate that the use of the PLM Length and PLM/Body length ratio at the L1 stage offers an improved way of detecting axon guidance phenotypes.  I show proof of concept that use of a light induced cell ablation technique can help study the developing nervous system.  &#xD;
Further, I show that with the use of a tissue specific RNAi technique the role of lethal genes in axon guidance can be analyzed.  Finally I conducted a screen that identified new effectors of the VAB-1 signal transduction pathway.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Patterns of genetic diversity in natural systems are influenced by landscape heterogeneity over spatial and temporal scales. Certain natural or anthropogenic landscape features may facilitate or impede organism dispersal and subsequent gene flow. Characterizing the geographical distribution of genetic diversity and identifying the factors contributing to population genetic structure is imperative for maintaining functional connectivity between isolated populations across a fragmented landscape. &#xD;
In this study, I combined genetic data and high-resolution land cover information to investigate patterns of population genetic structure in the threatened eastern hog-nosed snake (Heterodon platirhinos) at its northern range limit in Ontario, Canada. First, using putatively neutral microsatellite markers, I found evidence of genetic differentiation between two geographically disjunct regional populations: in the Carolinian region of southwestern Ontario, and along the eastern shoreline of Georgian Bay. Spatial and non-spatial Bayesian clustering algorithms also detected population genetic structure within each regional population. I found evidence of weak structure within Georgian Bay, roughly corresponding to regions north and south of Parry Sound. A genetic cluster at Wasaga Beach, located at the southern terminus of Georgian Bay, was highly differentiated from other populations, despite its geographic proximity to Georgian Bay. Excess homozygosity and reduced allelic diversity in Wasaga Beach compared to other sampled populations imply a population bottleneck event. &#xD;
Secondly, I inferred the role of landscape features on eastern hog-nosed snake dispersal and subsequent gene flow in the Georgian Bay regional population. Using techniques derived from electrical circuit theory, I estimated pairwise resistance distances between individuals by assigning costs to landscape features that are predicted to impede hog-nosed snake movement: open water, wetland, settlement and agriculture, and roads. Landscape features did not influence genetic structure within Wasaga Beach. However, I found weak evidence for an effect of landscape features, particularly open water and roads, on gene flow in eastern Georgian Bay. This study is the first to examine potential factors driving population genetic structure of eastern hog-nosed snakes and provides an empirical foundation for future tests of demographic models and spatially explicit simulations of gene flow.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Security defects or vulnerabilities are inescapable in software development. Thus, it is always better to address security issues during the software development phases, rather than developing patches after the security threats are already in place. In line with this, a number of secure software development approaches have been proposed so far to address the security issues during the development processes. However, most of these approaches lack specific process improvement activities. The practice of taking adequate corrective measures at the earliest possible time by learning from the past mistakes is absent in case of such security-aware iterative software development processes. As one might imagine, software security defect data provide an invaluable source of information for a software development team. This thesis aims at investigating existing security defect classification schemes and providing a structured security-specific defect classification and analysis methodology.&#xD;
Our methodology which we build on top of the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) scheme, is customized to generate in-process feedback by analyzing security defect data. More specifically, we perform a detailed analysis on the classified security defect data and obtain in-process feedback using which the next version of software can be more secure and reliable.  We experiment our methodology on the Mozilla Firefox and Chrome security defect repositories using six consecutive versions and milestones, respectively. We find that the in-process feedback generated by applying this   methodology  can help take corrective actions as early as possible in iterative secure software development processes. Finally, we study the correlations between software security defect types and the phases of software development life-cycle to understand development improvement by complementing the previous ODC scheme.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Plasticity of synapses is not static across the lifespan. As the brain matures and ages, the ability of neurons to undergo structural and functional change becomes more limited. Further, there are a number of modulatory factors that influence the expression of synaptic plasticity. Here, three approaches were taken to examine and manipulate plasticity in the auditory thalamocortical system of rats. Using an in vivo preparation, long-term potentiation (LTP) and paired pulse (PP) responses were used as measures of long- and short-term plasticity, respectively. First, the effect of intracortical zinc application in the primary auditory cortex (A1) on LTP was examined. Following theta burst stimulation (TBS) of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN), juvenile and middle-age rats, but not young adults, showed greater levels of LTP with zinc application relative to age-matched control animals. Next, PP responses were examined between rats reared in unaltered acoustic conditions and those reared in continuous white noise (WN) from postnatal day (PD) 5 to PD 50-60 (i.e., subjected to patterned sound deprivation). Rats reared in WN demonstrated less PP depression relative to controls, indicating that WN rearing alters short-term thalamocortical synaptic responses. Furthermore, control males showed no change in PP response following LTP induction, indicating a postsynaptic locus of LTP, whereas increased PP depression following LTP induction was seen in WN animals, suggestive of a presynaptic involvement in LTP. Finally, differences in plasticity between male and female rats were investigated, and the result of early WN exposure on both sexes was examined. Males and females did not show consistent differences in LTP expression; however WN exposure appeared to affect LTP of females less than their male counterparts. PP responses were then compared between WN-reared males and females, and no difference was found. This indicates that short-term plastic properties of auditory thalamocortical synapses between the sexes do not differ, even though plasticity on a longer time scale following sensory deprivation does indicate some difference. Together, the experiments summarized here identify some of the important factors that contribute to the regulation of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity in the central auditory system of the mammalian brain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused serious concerns worldwide due to the novel biological feature of the virus strain, and the high morbidity rate for youth. The urban scale is crucial for analyzing the pandemic in metropolitan areas such as the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) of Canada because of its large population. The challenge of exploring the spatial dynamics of H1N1 is exaggerated by data scarcity and the absence of an immediately applicable methodology at such a scale. In this study, a stepwise methodology is developed, and a retrospective spatial statistical analysis is conducted using the methodology to estimate the spatial dynamics of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the GTA when the data scarcity exists. The global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses are carried out through the use of multiple spatial analysis tools to confirm the existence and significance of spatial clustering effects. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) implemented in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) is used to estimate the area-specific spatial dynamics. The GLMM is configured to a spatial model that incorporates an Intrinsic Gaussian Conditionally Autoregressive (ICAR) model, and a non-spatial model respectively. Comparing the results of spatial and non-spatial configurations of the GLMM suggests that the spatial GLMM, which incorporates the ICAR model, proves a better predictability. This indicates that the methodology developed in this study can be applied to epidemiology studies to analyze the spatial dynamics in similar scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Articular cartilage has a low propensity for self-repair, due to which 27 million people are affected by osteoarthritis every year in North America. The current repair techniques used for cartilage defects possess flaws that reduce long-term clinical success. Tissue engineering carries with it the promise of engineering hyaline-like cartilage with physical and biochemical properties, similar to that of native cartilage. &#xD;
This being said, the primary objective of my project was to engineer clinically relevant sized articular cartilage constructs. To achieve my objective, first, I investigated the effect of continuous culture on cartilaginous tissue growth. Constructs grown under continuous media flow significantly accumulated more collagen and glycosaminoglycan, and displayed a stratified morphology, similar to that found in native cartilage. The second goal was to further increase chondrocyte proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. To achieve this, constructs were grown in a bioreactor with media supplemented with 14 mM sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Constructs cultivated in the bioreactor with NaHCO3 supplementation exhibited a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in ECM accumulation (a 98-fold increase in glycosaminoglycans and a 25-fold increase in collagen content), cell proliferation (a 13-fold increase), and thickness (a 28-fold increase) compared to all other conditions (static and reactor without NaHCO3 supplementation).&#xD;
The third goal was to engineer cartilage constructs with as little cells as possible, reducing donor site morbidity. From the results obtained, it was evident that the monolayer constructs outperformed all the other constructs (pellet, biopsy, and minced). &#xD;
The final goal was to understand the underlying reason for the increased proliferation. First, I investigated if there were any differences present in intracellular pH (pHi) and intracellular buffering capacity. Second, I determined the role of extracellular pH (pHe) on cell proliferation. In an effort to accurately achieve this, I, for the first time, have reported on measuring pHi of chondrocytes while still in culture (2D and 3D cultures) using a confocal microscope. This study demonstrated the importance of extracellular environments, such as pHe, extracellular buffering capacity, and the presence of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ions for chondrocyte proliferation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Primary polydipsia, excessive drinking without known medical cause, continues to occur with a significant prevalence in psychiatric populations. While the etiology of polydipsia remains unknown, the fact that it is significantly associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia has led some to postulate that the two may share common neurological pathophysiologies. Animal models of schizophrenia-like symptoms have focused on modeling the core behavioral and neurochemical features of the illness, like cognitive deficits and enhanced dopamine transmission. Here, we used three well-established models, including repeated amphetamine treatment, subchronic MK-801 (an N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA]-receptor antagonist), and post-weaning social isolation. We also examined a “double-hit” model, combining NMDA-receptor antagonism and social isolation. We paired these models to test the hypothesis that drinking will be enhanced in a paradigm of excessive drinking in the rat. In rodents, non-physiologic drinking can be induced by intermittent presentation of food (e.g., one sugar-pellet a minute) in the presence of a drinking spout to a hungry animal, termed schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP). &#xD;
Animals pretreated with pharmacological or non-pharmacological models of schizophrenia-like symptoms showed significantly increased SIP, The “double hit” model did not further increase drinking above that of either social isolation or MK-801 treatment alone. A moderate amount of spontaneous polydipsia in the homecage of MK-801-treated rats was also observed and resulted in one death secondary to excessive drinking, a phenomenon also found in inpatients with schizophrenia. Following repeated treatment with AMPH, there was some evidence that over time, animals learned to drink increased amounts independently of the scheduled food presentation. This evidence suggests that the excessive drinking behavior observed in polydipsia associated with schizophrenia may have a learned component.&#xD;
In summary, animal models of schizophrenia-like symptoms augmented SIP behavior, showing that polydipsia associated with schizophrenia may be modeled in rodents. As each model has been shown to modify dopamine transmission to some degree, the evidence suggests augmented SIP may reflect changes in dopamine transmission and dopamine may be the common link between polydipsia and schizophrenia. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying SIP, polydipsia and schizophrenia.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Much of North America’s reinforced concrete infrastructure is reaching the end of its service life and careful inspection and assessment is required to ensure the appropriate capacity is maintained in these structures. The research conducted herein seeks to further the development of two new sensor technologies: fibre optic strain sensors and digital image correlation, which have the potential to provide comprehensive performance data for structures to a level of accuracy previously not possible. The research involves determining the accuracy of these sensor systems to monitor both strain and crack widths in reinforced concrete compared to conventional techniques, such as electrical resistance strain gauges. Preliminary work was also undertaken on correcting the sensor results for temperature. It was determined that temperature variations in the range of +21 °C  to  20 °C, result in significant strain errors for both sensor systems. Once the results obtained from the sensors systems are corrected for temperature, crack widths are monitored in four small-scale reinforced concrete tension specimens, and strain and crack width behaviour is monitored in four full-scale beams under four point bending. One of the major problems faced when using the digital image correlation technique is out of plane movement which results in significant error. Techniques to lower this error are addressed. In addition, obtaining a more robust understanding of the effects of temperature on crack widths, stiffness, strength and short term creep behaviour of reinforced concrete elements is explored to improve structural monitoring and numerical models used for analysis. Four full-scale beams, two at room temperature and two at  20 °C, were loaded to failure under four point bending. A comparison of the room temperature and low temperature test results show that the cracks tend to close up at lower temperatures in members that are free to expand and contract. This behaviour results in a potential increase in shear capacity for beams at lower temperatures. The low temperature beams also saw a minor increase in strength, but saw no noticeable increase in stiffness. Lastly, short term creep behaviour was reduced in the low temperature beams once the formation of ice occurred.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis traces the migration of Irish Presbyterian clerics to the Thirteen Colonies and the United States over the course of the years 1683 to 1901.  Further, it demonstrates that this clerical migration can be used in conjunction with what is already known about Irish Presbyterian migration to America in the eighteenth century to sketch the general shape and parameters of general Irish Presbyterian migration to the United States in the nineteenth century—something which seemed a near impossibility due to factors such as an absence of useable demographic data.  In so doing, it posits a solution to a problem that has bedeviled specialists in Irish-American immigration for thirty years: how to find and study Irish Protestant immigrants in the nineteenth century in a way which gives some idea of the overall shape and frequency of the phenomenon.  The following thesis is interdisciplinary and broad in the techniques employed, questions asked, and the literature it has consulted, incorporating much developed by historians of religion, ethnicity, culture, Colonial America, the United States, the Atlantic world, Ireland, and Britain in this study of emigration from Ireland and immigration to America.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The sandstone-hosted McArthur River Zone 4 U ore body and alteration system, located in the Athabasca Basin, are the focus of a detailed mineralogical and geochemical study aimed at reconstructing its evolution.  The oxidation state of Fe in clay alteration from Zone 4 is measured using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and compared with other mineralized and barren sandstone-hosted alteration systems in the Athabasca Basin.  The aim is to ascertain the role of Fe in forming U deposits and determine whether Fe oxidation state in alteration minerals can indicate proximity to mineralization.  At Zone 4, early diagenetic kaolin is overprinted by zones of dravite, illite, chlorite, and late kaolinite forming around the P2 fault.  Uranium mineralization occurred at ca. 1600 Ma and was triggered by mixing between oxidizing U-bearing basinal fluids and reducing basement-modified basinal fluids, the latter forming when basinal fluids interacted with basement lithologies.  Early pre-ore silicification in the lower 200 metres of the Manitou Falls Formation above the ore body created favourable conditions for mineralization by focusing basinal fluids into the reduction site and enhancing ore preservation.  However, it obstructed the post-ore migration of radiogenic Pb and U pathfinder elements from the deposit and limited the extent of hydrothermal sudoite alteration in the overlying strata.  Sandstone-hosted alteration systems in the Athabasca Basin are commonly surrounded by an outer illite and an inner chlorite zone.  Illites have high Fe3+/ƩFe ratios characteristic of formation from oxidizing basinal fluids, whereas, chlorites have lower and more varied Fe3+/ƩFe ratios, reflecting their origin from reducing, Fe2+-bearing basement-derived fluids having undergone variable mixing with oxidizing basinal fluids.  Chlorites in mineralized systems where fluid-mixing occurred, such as at McArthur River Zone 4 and Maurice Bay, record higher Fe3+/ƩFe ratios than barren systems where fluid-mixing did not, such as at Wheeler River Zone K and Spring Point.  The scarcity of U-bearing basinal fluids available for mixing with Fe2+-bearing basement fluids is a critical geochemical factor precluding mineralization in barren sandstone-hosted systems.  The Fe3+/ƩFe ratio of chlorites has potential applications for discriminating barren and mineralized systems and as spatial vectors to ore when coupled with Pb isotope ratios.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the most frequently reported deficits seen in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is impairments in learning and memory, which is likely attributed to the teratogenic effects of ethanol on the developing hippocampus. TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β), hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways have been identified as high probability candidate pathways associated with brain deficits seen in FASD. Increasing evidence indicates that ethanol may induce changes in DNA methylation that could alter transcription regulating factors within signaling pathways critical in brain development. The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that prenatal ethanol exposure during i) the first trimester-equivalent period, or ii) throughout the entire gestational period induces changes in DNA methylation and alters the transcription/translation of TGF-β1, SHH (sonic hedgehog) and Wnt3a within the developing hippocampus. Pregnant Dunkin-Hartley-strain guinea pigs were assigned to one of three groups: ethanol (4 g/kg maternal body weight), isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding, or no treatment. Embryonic telencephalon tissue (which gives rise to the hippocampus) and fetal hippocampus were collected at gestational day (GD) 23 or GD 65, respectively. GD 23 ethanol-exposed and nutritional control embryos exhibited decreased crown-rump and head lengths. GD 65 ethanol-exposed fetuses exhibited decreased body and brain weights compared with the control groups. Ethanol exposure during the first trimester-equivalent period, but not during the entire gestational period, resulted in an increase in global DNA methylation. First trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure did not alter TGF-β1, SHH and Wnt3a gene expression within the GD 23 telencephalon. However, ethanol exposure throughout the entire pregnancy led to an increase in the expression of all three genes within the GD 65 hippocampus. No change in TGF-β1 protein was seen in the hippocampus of ethanol-treated fetuses. Post-translationally modified (ptm) SHH, but not unmodified SHH protein, was decreased in the hippocampus of ethanol-exposed fetuses. A decrease in unmodified, but not ptm Wnt3a protein, was observed in both ethanol-exposed and nutritional control hippocampus. These results suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure may affect hippocampal development through alterations in i) DNA methylation as shown at early gestation and ii) the expression of transcription regulating factors, especially SHH, as shown at term.</dcterms:abstract>

Using Foucault’s tenets of power, discourse, and governmentality, this thesis will demonstrate the ways in which discourses employ techniques of governance and the responses of self-governing individuals. Each chapter will represent a perspective with its own taxonomy, measures, and constructions of ‘obesity’. To conclude, the thesis will look at the possibility for collaboration in interdisciplinary research on the subject of obesity; in a direct exchange between the perspectives, the thesis will attempt provide a comprehensive account of ‘obesity’ as being comprised of several perspectives simultaneously.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mosaic Arthroplasty is a well-accepted surgical approach to treating focal cartilage defects of the knee.  However, the task of creating the mosaic of osteochondral grafts that optimally restores the cartilage surface is technically demanding.  Conventional techniques require the surgeon to reconstruct a complex, three-dimensional surface by eye and experience only. There is evidence that this type of procedure is sensitive to technique: grafts that are transplanted proud of the native cartilage surface tend to show evidence of cartilage fissuring and fibrillation prematurely.  &#xD;
Two computer-assisted techniques (navigation by optical tracking and guidance by patient-specific templates) were investigated to determine whether they would have a beneficial effect on surgical execution, and whether any differences in execution had any correlation to surgical outcome.  The experimental work can be broken into two parts: an in vitro study that compared the accuracy of execution of an optically navigated group versus a template guided group, and an in vivo animal trial that compared both computer assisted techniques to the conventional, non-assisted approach.&#xD;
The results of the pilot study indicated that, while there were higher errors in the individual measures of position, orientation, and plug depth in the optically navigated group, there was no significant difference in the overall fidelity of the geometric surface produced between the two groups.  The results of the animal trial indicated that both computer assisted techniques produced morphological results that were superior to the conventional technique.  The two computer-assisted techniques also showed a significantly better treatment effect as seen by their higher histological scoring.  Furthermore, a significant linear correlation was found between morphological results and histological score.  Overall, the experiments demonstrated that surgeons and patients could potentially benefit from the use of computer-assisted techniques in the short term.  Further work is required to prove long-term beneficial effect.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pressing demands for less power consumption of processors while delivering higher performance&#xD;
levels have put an extra attention on efficiency of the systems. Efficient management&#xD;
of resources in the current computing systems, given their increasing number of entities and&#xD;
complexity, requires accurate predictive models that can easily adapt to system and application&#xD;
changes. Through performance monitoring counter (PMC) events, in modern processors, a vast&#xD;
amount of information can be obtained from the system. This thesis provides a methodology&#xD;
to efficiently choose such events for power modeling purposes. In addition, exploiting the&#xD;
time-dependence of the data measured through PMCs and multi-meters, we build predictive&#xD;
multivariate time-series models that estimate the run-time power consumption of a system. In&#xD;
particular, we find an autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) model&#xD;
that is combined with a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm as a good candidate for such&#xD;
purposes.&#xD;
Many of the available estimation or prediction models avoid using the metrics that are&#xD;
affected by the changes of the processor frequency. This thesis proposes a method to mitigate&#xD;
the impact of frequency scaling in a run-time model on power and PMC metrics. This method is&#xD;
based on a practical Gaussian approximation. Different segments of the trend of a metric that&#xD;
are associated with different frequencies are scaled and offset into a zero mean unit variance&#xD;
signal. This is an attempt to transform the variable frequency trend into a weakly stationary&#xD;
time-series. Using this approach, we have shown that power estimation of a system using PMCs&#xD;
can be done in a variable frequency environment.&#xD;
We extend the ARMAX-RLS model to predict the near future power consumption and&#xD;
PMCs of different applications in a variable frequency environment. The proposed method is&#xD;
adaptive, independent of the system and applications. We have shown that a run-time per core&#xD;
or aggregate system PMC event prediction, multiple-steps ahead of time, is feasible using an&#xD;
ARMAX-RLS model. This is crucial for progressing from the reactive power and performance&#xD;
management methods to more proactive algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Climate change has been predicted to have long-term consequences for North American ecosystems. Amphibians in particular are considered indicators of ecosystem health because of their sensitivity to environmental change – due in part to their semi-permeable skin and aquatic developmental requirements. Amphibians have been experiencing population declines on a global scale, suggested in part to be due to changes in reproductive behaviour and timing. My thesis examines the abiotic correlates of timing of calling in southeastern Ontario anurans, as well as the extent to which the timing of calling events vary within and among species. I focused on eight species of frogs using both a 40-year historical dataset and a 5-year field-collected dataset of environmental variation and anuran activity. From analysis of the historical dataset, Lithobates pipiens was the only species out of eight to emerge significantly earlier, by an estimated 22 days over four decades. Both L. pipiens and Anaraxyus americanus have advanced initiation of calling over a four-decade span significantly earlier by an estimated 37.2 and 19.2 days, respectively, correlating with significant regional increases in spring air temperatures (2.8°C over four decades). Global frog declines or range shifts relate ultimately to changes in reproductive behaviour and timing mediated by shifting climate. From my analysis of the field-collected dataset, I concluded that species varied in the environmental predictors that best predicted this variation may be a consequence of varying reproductive strategies between early spring “explosive” breeders versus late prolonged breeders. There was also significant among-location variation in calling activity for four prolonged breeding species, which may be an effect of significant microclimatic variation between locations surveyed. My study suggests that local temperature increases have affected the timing of emergence and the onset of calling activity in some frogs and that microclimatic differences among breeding habitats may be influencing the timing of breeding in some prolonged breeding species. My research aids future conservation and management strategies for North America’s dwindling amphibian populations by quantifying how abiotic factors influence breeding behaviour on both a fine and extended temporal scale as well as by developing and testing standardized methods for long-term species monitoring.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In laser materials processing, the direct measurement and characterization of material and process depth is traditionally a diffcult task. This is particularly difficult when such information needs to be obtained in real-time for feedback and dynamic analysis applications. This thesis outlines a novel method and apparatus for real-time depth measurement during laser processes such as welding, drilling, cutting and ablation called inline coherent imaging (ICI). The approach borrows the coherent imaging ideas from the primarily medical field of optical coherence tomography and adapts them to the new application. Without requirements for flawless image quality and limitations on sample exposure the design is free to emphasize speed in acquisition and processing. Furthermore, the imaging optics are specialized for compatibility with off-the-shelf beam delivery systems. Several generations of the imaging technique and relevant design equations are described and shown and realized. Also described is the design and construction of two laser processing stations used for testing ICI in macro- and micro-processing applications. A variety of applications for ICI in the understanding of percussion drilling and welding of metals and other industrial materials are discussed. The imaging technique is further extended to provide manual and fully automatic closed-loop control of drilling and ablation processes in industrial materials. Finally, some important applications of ICI in the processing of bone in both open and closed-loop configurations are demonstrated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Experiments exploring transport and bio-containment of contaminants in fractured rock were completed using fractured-limestone samples obtained in eastern Ontario, Canada. Three single-fracture samples, a fracture-intersection sample and a fracture-network sample were set into vertical flow systems. Three phases of experiments focused on the transport and hydraulic properties of each sample, the effects of biobarriers on diffusion processes in fracture rock, and methods of improving biobarrier stability and survivability.  &#xD;
Hydraulic apertures were determined from constant-flow measurements and transport properties were interpreted from Lissamine and KBr tracer experiments with velocities of up to 8500 m/d for all five samples. At Re &gt; 16, linear to non-linear transitions were observed in enlarged single fracture A and the fracture intersection samples. Reversible increases in aperture were observed at Reynolds numbers (Re) of 7, 4, and 3 for single fractures A and B, and the fracture-network, respectively. Non-linear effects were not observed in these samples over the range of velocities studied (up to Re = 20). Results from the 1-D analytical transport model overestimated values of matrix porosity, suggesting that diffusion from dead zones and slow-flowing regions are also contributing to observed breakthrough curves. &#xD;
Methods of improving biobarrier stability in fractured rock were studied in two single-fracture samples and the fracture-network sample by stimulating naturally-occurring groundwater bacteria. Survivability was improved with successive cycles of feeding and starving and stimulating growth at lower temperatures. Modeled values of matrix porosity decreased by up to 50%, indicating that diffusion processes are strongly influenced by biofilm development. &#xD;
Back diffusion of Lissamine was measured using one single-fracture sample and the fracture-intersection sample. Lissamine was allowed to diffuse into the matrix of each sample and, following a suitable loading period, the back-diffusion of residual Lissamine concentrations were measured from the outflow. This was done in the presence and absence of biofilm, and following the introduction of biofilm onto the fracture surfaces, diffusion was no longer a governing process affecting transport and only advective transport was observed. Experiments were interpreted using a 3-D finite difference model with a three-layer porosity approach, and indicated a decrease in aperture and porosity following biostimulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores the regulation of abortion in Canada following the landmark R v Morgentaler decision (1988), which struck down Canada’s existing abortion law, causing the procedure’s subsequent reclassification as a healthcare issue. The resulting fragility of abortion rights is still evident in the varying provincial regulations governing the nature of access to the procedure. While access has been accepted as the new terrain of abortion rights, research into this area to date has taken a largely national focus, surveying provincial barriers and compiling lists of potential motivations for differences in service. This dissertation builds on this work through the use of specific case studies of provinces representative of a spectrum of access in Canada – New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec. Through the use of original interview data, these cases are compared and contrasted on previously enumerated grounds believed to have an influence on the treatment of abortion. By isolating the impact of specific processes responsible for the regulation of abortion, through research into its treatment in politics, law, medicine, and public discourse, this study endeavours to offer a more nuanced explanation for varying levels of provincial access to abortion services. Ultimately it finds that a province’s social climate, characterized by attitudes towards the ongoing rights versus morality debate championed by pro- and anti-choice social movements, has had the greatest impact in shaping public perceptions of the procedure. These attitudes in turn have a profound effect on the nature of provincial access.&#xD;
Using a citizenship framework grounded in social reproduction, which understands anti-abortion politics as elements of backlash against progressive advances in women’s citizenship, this dissertation argues for the need to understand abortion as a right of women’s citizenship to address the precarious treatment of abortion services. Recognition of women’s unique reproductive abilities through a citizenship paradigm is necessary before women can hope to achieve equality. Only when abortion is entrenched as a right of citizenship and this understanding of the procedure is embedded in social perceptions, can women not only be treated as equal citizens, but also understand themselves to be equal citizens.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wireless sensor networks have been used in different applications due to the advancement of sensor technology. These uses also have raised different optimization issues. Most of the algorithms proposed as solutions to the various optimization problems are either centralized or distributed which are not ideal for these real life applications. Very few strictly local algorithms for wireless sensor networks exist in the literature. In this thesis, we consider some of these optimization problems of sensor networks, for example, sleep-wake scheduling, mobile dispersion, mobile object monitoring,  and gathering problems. We also consider the depth adjustment problem of underwater sensor networks.  We design cellular automaton based local algorithms for these problems. The cellular automaton is a bioinspired model used to model different physical systems including wireless sensor networks. One of the main advantages of using cellular automaton based algorithms is that they need very little local information to compute a solution. We perform different simulations and analysis and find that our algorithms are efficient in practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is complex IV of the electron transport system, and catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. It possesses ten nuclear-encoded subunits, the largest of which is COX4. Bayesian analysis suggests the isoform pair for this subunit arose early in vertebrate evolution, and tissue distribution of the COX4 paralogs is similar in mammals and teleosts: COX4-1 is ubiquitously transcribed while COX4-2 is present in large amounts only in brain and respiratory tissue. This subunit is of interest due to its apparent sensitivity to oxygen. During hypoxia, transcription switches from COX4-1 to COX4-2 in some mammalian tissues. However, questions remain about the regulation of this response as well as its pervasiveness across vertebrates. I investigated these uncertainties by measuring the transcriptional response of the COX4 paralogs to hypoxia in a variety of vertebrate models, and assessing the hypoxic induction of putative oxygen-responsive elements (HRE1, HRE2, and ORE) from candidate vertebrate species in a transfection experiment. I also examined the conservation of key elements of the COX4-2 gene and polypeptide in vertebrates. It was found that the hypoxia-responsiveness of COX4-2 may not be vital to the cellular response to hypoxia. COX4-1 transcripts remained in excess during hypoxia in all of the vertebrate models used with the exception of western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), where COX4-2 transcripts remained in excess during control and hypoxic treatments. Only the HRE2 element from human COX4-2 was activated with hypoxic exposure, yet this along with the other features of the gene and polypeptide were not well conserved across mammals, and nearly absent outside of this lineage. These results provide evidence that COX4-2 may respond to hypoxia in only select few mammalian tissues, or that the function of this gene is not related to the cellular hypoxic response.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The rhombus and parallelogram orbits are interesting families of periodic solutions, which come from celestial mechanics and the N-body problem.  Variational methods with finite order symmetry group are used to construct minimizing non-collision periodic orbits.&#xD;
We study the question of stability or instability of periodic and symmetric periodic solutions of the rhombus and the equal mass parallelogram four body problems.  We first study the stability of periodic solutions for the rhombus four body problem.  An analytical description of the variational principle is used to show that the homographic solutions are the minimizers of the action functional restricted to rhombus loop space [23].   We employ techniques from symplectic geometry and specifically a variant of the Maslov index  for curves of Lagrangian subspaces along the minimizing rhombus orbit to prove the main result, Theorem 4.2.2, which states that the reduced rhombus orbit is hyperbolic in the reduced energy manifold when it is not degenerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
We second study the stability for symmetric periodic solutions of the equal mass parallelogram four body problem.  The parallelogram family is a family of Z_2× Z_4 symmetric action minimizing solutions, investigated by [7].  In this example, the minimizing solution [7] can be extended to a 4T-periodic solution using symmetries through square and collinear configurations.  The Maslov index of the orbits is used to prove the main result, Theorem 5.3.1, which states that the minimizing equal mass parallelogram solution is unstable when it is non-degenerate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a critical examination of civic nationalism that focuses on the disconnect between nationalist ideology and the social bases of nationhood, and the implications that this disconnect has for the feasibility of civic nationalism as a policy prescription for issues such as intra-state nationalist conflict and immigrant integration. While problems with the principles of civic nationalist ideology are important, my focus here is the more significant problem that civic nationalism is based on a general theory of nations and nationalism that treats them as solely ideological phenomena. Against this I argue that the term ‘nationalism’ refers to several different phenomena, most importantly a ‘system of culture’ or way of organizing society as described by Ernest Gellner and Benedict Anderson, and that augmenting Gellner and Anderson’s theories with the kind of relational social theory used by authors such as Rogers Brubaker and Charles Tilly provides an alternative explanation that is a better match for the evidence. If this is the case, I contend, then civic nationalism is both a misrepresentation of the history of nations and nationalism and infeasible as a prescription for policy issues such as intra-state nationalist conflict and immigrant integration. These arguments are supported with empirical evidence that is principally drawn from four cases: France, the United States, Northern Ireland, and Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Theories of empire and imperialism have a long history in both the International Relations (IR) and International Political Economy (IPE) literature. Yet both literatures have significant theoretical and methodological problems. IR scholars assume the American empire has a progressive role in the global system, promoting peace, security and prosperity. They divorce the ideals of America from its history of violence and exploitation. Alternatively, the IPE literature recognizes that capitalism is a driving force behind imperialism, but tends to ignore other determinants of American foreign policy. This dissertation aims to use an interpretation of Karl Marx’s method of historical materialism to reconceptualize imperialism in the 20th and early 21st century. Building upon theories offered in the IPE literature, it argues there are three interrelated types of imperialisms at work: geopolitical, geocapital and capital imperialism. Geopolitical imperialism is when geopolitics is the main determinant behind foreign policy. This process is driven by international security concerns or domestic politics and often has few direct economic motivations. Geocapital imperialism is when the needs of capital accumulation coincide with the policies of the government.  The third type is “capital imperialism.”  This process conditions countries and institutions through transnational corporations and international finance, such as bond markets, the repo markets, currency speculation and investment flows. The recent financialization of the international system has made this process of imperialism a much more rapid and disruptive international process.  This thesis will place an emphasis on relations, context and history in order to provide a thorough understanding of the forces of imperialism with a particular focus on the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work presents the first evidence of a ligand-independent role for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a positive regulator of gene expression in mammary cells. We have demonstrated that unliganded GR interacts directly with the promoter of the tumour suppressor gene BRCA1, and upregulates its expression. The presence of the stress hormone hydrocortisone (HC) abolished this interaction and resulted in repression of BRCA1. Since low levels of BRCA1 have been implicated in the development of sporadic breast cancer, this may represent a novel mechanism through which prolonged stress signaling increases breast cancer risk. We determined that the interaction between unliganded GR and BRCA1 is mediated through the beta subunit of the Ets transcription factor GABP at the RIBS promoter element. GR and GABPβ were shown to interact in both co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays, and this interaction involved the N-terminal to central regions of both proteins. &#xD;
To further characterize the role of unliganded GR in breast cells, we used shRNA to generate mouse mammary cell lines with depleted endogenous GR expression. Loss of GR resulted in an impaired capacity of cells to differentiate into acini, but this effect was rescued by the addition of glucocorticoids, implicating both the liganded and unliganded forms of GR as key regulators of differentiation. We performed expression microarray to identify targets of unliganded GR using the GR-depleted cell lines. This analysis revealed 260 genes negatively regulated and 343 genes positively regulated by unliganded GR. Many of the positively regulated genes were involved in pro-apoptotic networks, and appeared to oppose the activity of liganded GR targets. Validation and further analysis of five candidates of positive regulation by unliganded GR indicated that two of these, Hsd11b1 and Ch25h, were regulated by unliganded GR in a manner similar to Brca1. The Hsd11b1 enzyme regulates intracellular glucocorticoid levels by interconverting cortisol and its inactive metabolite, cortisone. Further investigation of Hsd11b1 expression and regulation indicated that Hsd11b1 activity appears to be unidirectional in breast cells, specifically inactivating cortisol. Overall, this work suggests that gene regulation by unliganded GR represents a mechanism for protecting the breast from tumourigenesis during stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Environmental sustainability in regards to infrastructure and the built environment is a significant consideration for the Department of National Defence (DND).  As the 2nd largest landowner in Canada, the DND is making great efforts to operate in a sustainable manner through the creation and implementation of sustainable building policies.   Meeting the green/sustainable buildings requirements of the recent Federal Sustainable Development Strategy, and the 2006 DND Sustainable Development Strategy to achieve accreditation within generic green building systems, has proven to be extremely challenging given the mandate and the nature of Canadian Forces (CF) operations, both domestically and overseas.  This line of research was conducted in order to identify the unique requirements and the sustainability factors/criteria that are applicable to the CF / DND and to investigate how to best align these requirements within the context of sustainable development strategies. Input data was obtained through an analysis of literature and relevant documents, as well as a series of interviews with individuals at all levels within the Federal Government.  The result of this research undertaking was, in part, the creation of a Sustainable Development for DND based on a thorough, comprehensive and internationally-investigated factor selection process.  These results illustrate the importance for the DND to consider implementing a department-specific sustainable building strategy; one that is more representative of the unique type of infrastructure DND owns and operates.  The results of such an investigation can surely be used to assist with best practices and strategic policies within DND and to potentially influence policies at the Federal level of governance in this regard.  The ultimate goal of this thesis was to establish the policy framework with a view for DND to develop and implement its own unique Sustainability Standard.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the enabling technologies for Long Term Evolution (LTE) deployments is the&#xD;
femtocell technology. By having femtocells deployed indoors and closer to the user,&#xD;
high data rate services can be provided efficiently. These femtocells are expected&#xD;
to be depolyed in large numbers which raises many technical challenges including&#xD;
the handover management. In fact, managing handovers in femtocell environments,&#xD;
with the conventional manual adjustment techniques, is almost impossible to keep&#xD;
pace with in such a rapidly growing femtocell environment. Therefore, doing this&#xD;
automatically by implementing Self Organizing Network (SON) use cases becomes a&#xD;
necessity rather than an option. However, having multiple SON use cases operating&#xD;
simultaneously with a shared objective could cause them to interact either negatively&#xD;
or positively. In both cases, designing a suitable coordination policy is critical in&#xD;
solving negative conflicts and building upon positive benefits.&#xD;
In this work, we focus on studying the interactions between three self optimization&#xD;
use cases aiming at improving the overall handover procedure in LTE femtocell&#xD;
networks. These self optimization use cases are handover, Call Admission Control&#xD;
(CAC) and load balancing. We develop a comprehensive, unified LTE compliant&#xD;
evaluation environment. This environment is extendable to other radio access technologies&#xD;
including LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), and can also be used to study other SON&#xD;
use cases. Various recommendations made by main bodies in the area of femtocells&#xD;
are considered including the Small Cell Forum, the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) alliance and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).&#xD;
Additionally, traffic sources are simulated in compliance with these recommendations&#xD;
and evaluation methodologies. We study the interaction between three representative&#xD;
handover related self optimization schemes. We start by testing these schemes separately,&#xD;
in order to make sure that they meet their individual goals, and then their&#xD;
mutual interactions when operating simultaneously. Based on these experiments, we&#xD;
recommend several guidelines that can help mobile network operators and researchers&#xD;
in designing better coordination policies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Environmental conditions can lead to mercury accumulations in fish that are highly variability among spatially close lakes in Ontario, Canada.  Mercury methylation caused by sulfate reduction can influence total mercury concentrations in fish (THgfish).  Kahshe and Mountain lakes were chosen to assess temporal trends of THgfish and using paleolimnological tools described the lake environment in terms of total mercury (THgsed), total sulfur (TSsed), chromium-reducible sulfur (CRSsed), and chrysophyte-inferred lake-water pH (CI-pH).&#xD;
THgfish were standardized by length (LS-THgfish) to identify trends and make comparisons with archived fish from the Royal Ontario Museum.  In Kahshe Lake, LS-THgfish for 30-cm smallmouth bass and 40-cm walleye displayed peak concentrations in the early 1980s (0.74 +/- 0.17 µg/g d.w; n=41 and 1.40 +/- 0.42 µg/g d.w; n=16, respectively) with clear declines starting in 1999 (0.33 µg/g d.w +/- 0.13, n=12).  At Mountain Lake, LS-THgfish in smallmouth bass (0.31 – 0.45 µg/g) and walleye (0.30 – 0.49 µg/g) were low and stable through the period of observation. Peak concentrations at Kahshe Lake were over 300% higher than the 1926 archival sample (0.22 µg/g d.w, 22.1 cm total length), while the 1948 Mountain Lake sample (0.28 µg/g, 24.4 cm total length) is consistent with modern concentrations.&#xD;
As expected from LS-THgfish , THgsed was higher in Kahshe Lake, although enrichment was seen at both sites. Temporal trends for TSsed and CRSsed diverged with enrichment in Kahshe Lake and depletion in Mountain Lake.  CI-pH showed minimal temporal changes.  Although trends of CRSsed indicate sulfate is processed differently among the lakes, geochronology highlighted a consistent spatio-temporal relationship between THgfish and CRSsed.  This strongly supports a relationship between sulfate reduction rates and Hg methylation, independent of THgsed and pH. Therefore, if THgfish is used as an indicator of aquatic health CRSsed may be a useful tool for rapid assessment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The general objective of this thesis was to improve understandings of design, conduct and analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The specific objective was to evaluate the methodological and statistical principles associated with conducting analyses of futility, a component of interim analysis, as part of the conduct of RCTs. This objective was addressed by first performing a systematic review, which included a detailed literature search, as well as data from a cohort of previously extracted studies. The systematic review was designed to identify futility analysis principles and methodologies in order to inform the design and conduct of retrospective futility analyses of two completed NCIC CTG trials. The results of these trials have been previously published; one trial met its stated endpoint and the other did not. Neither trial underwent an interim analysis of futility during its conduct. The retrospective futility analyses assessed the accuracy of frequently used methods, by comparing the results of each method to each other and to the original final analysis results. These assessments were performed at selected time points using both aggressive and conservative stopping rules. In order to increase the robustness of the comparisons, bootstrapping methods were applied.  The results of this thesis demonstrate principles associated with the conduct of futility analyses and provide a basis for hypotheses-testing of optimum methodologies and their associated trade-offs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Signal reception and production form the basis of animal communication, and are largely constrained by environmental biophysical factors such as environmental light. However, the role of environmental light in producing variation in either signal reception or production has not been fully investigated. Using two distinct environmental light treatments, as well as a third treatment for a sampling of adults, I recorded corneal electroretinograms, lens transmission, and spectral reflectance of the body pattern of juvenile and adult Nile tilapia to chart the effect of environmental light on visual sensitivity and body colouration throughout ontogeny. Environmental light had an age-dependent effect on spectral sensitivity and an age-independent effect on spectral &#xD;
reflectance. Spectral sensitivity in juveniles reared under a broad-spectrum light treatment and a red-shifted light treatment differed mostly at short wavelengths, where the irradiance of the two environmental light treatments differed the most. In contrast, adults reared under the two environmental light treatments did not differ in spectral sensitivity. Lens transmission did not differ significantly between environmental light treatments, indicating that differences in spectral sensitivity of juveniles originated in the &#xD;
retina. Both juveniles and adults reared under the two environmental light treatments &#xD;
differed in spectral reflectance, and adults transferred to the third environmental light &#xD;
treatment differed in spectral reflectance from their counterparts reared under the two &#xD;
original treatments. These results demonstrate that environmental light plays a large role in shaping signal reception in juveniles and signal production throughout ontogeny, suggesting that environmental light has the capacity to drive ecological speciation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Whether classified as realist, modernist, or postmodernist, the fiction of Alice Munro combines a strong mimetic impulse with a  recognition of the limitations of mimesis. This dissertation examines the ethical dimensions of the balance between mimesis and the recognition of its limits. Chapter one provides an overview of Munro scholarship and brings particular attention to the manner in which this balance between mimesis and metafictional self-reflexivity has been analyzed since the earliest days of Munro criticism. Chapter two draws on the Munro scholarship of Naomi Morgenstern, Robert McGill, and Robert Thacker to argue that Munro’s fiction is connected, though not reducible to, her experience of reality. This connection, however imperfect, gives her aesthetics its ethical weight, particularly when the subject of her writing is the human Other. Munro’s combination of a sense of alterity with a powerful feeling of reality reflects a desire to understand and represent the Other without compromising the Other’s radical alterity. The tension that arises from this desire can find a resolution in an aesthetics of love akin to eros as described by Emmanuel Levinas and refigured by Luce Irigaray: a representation, inscribed in each story’s form, of the possibility of a subject-to-subject relationship that preserves difference and ends in mutual fecundation. Chapter three compares the ethical vision in “The Ottawa Valley,” which ends on a moment of continuing, uncompromised alterity, with the feeling of love and catharsis produced in “The Moons of Jupiter.” Chapter four reads “Material” as an oblique gesture at the possibility that literature can open a relationship to the Other that is a kind love. Chapter five examines “Deep-Holes” as an attempt to reconcile the ethical tensions inherent in writing by representing a collaborative mode of meaning-making linked to love and fecundity. This dissertation also, however, follows Derek Attridge and Munro herself in observing some distinction between the self-Other dynamic as a face-to-face relation and this dynamic as a problem of literary representation, even if the two cannot be neatly separated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 1930, A.Y. Jackson and Lawren S. Harris travelled to the Arctic Archipelago as members of Canada’s Eastern Arctic Patrol. The collaborative venture between the Department of the Interior and the noted Group of Seven artists, which followed Jackson’s 1927 voyage aboard the government patrol, was part of a mutual aim to generate popular interest in the Canadian North through art. This thesis examines the underlying political context of both the 1927 and 1930 collaborative efforts. It examines the government patrols in connection with the promotion of Jackson’s and Harris’s Arctic works as part of a larger process of advancing the Arctic as a Canadian possession during a period of increased foreign interest in the region. Drawing on primary source material as well as various print media reports and exhibition reviews, this study provides insight into how the contemporary framing of Jackson’s and Harris’s Arctic sketches and paintings from the government-supported expeditions—the ways in which the works were discussed and understood—contributed not only to the “imagining” of the Arctic as a Canadian possession, but also to the dissemination of Canadian sovereignty efforts in the North.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many students struggle with comprehending informational texts (Duke, 2004; Hall, Sabey, &amp; McClellan, 2005; Stafford et al., 2005; Marinak &amp; Gambrell, 2008; Read et al., 2008; Duke, 2010).  Informational texts are particularly difficult to comprehend because they contain complex ideas and information that not only is usually unfamiliar to the reader (Williams et al., 2009), but is organized into different text structures such as description, sequence, compare and contrast, problem and solution, and cause and effect.  Adding to the difficulty, the information in many informational books is often organized using a combination of these text structures (Stafford et al., 2005).&#xD;
This project addresses the difficulties associated with reading and writing informational texts.  Also, it includes a curriculum unit demonstrating how such texts can be integrated into a grade 3 science unit on soil.  It is written for elementary teachers who want to learn how to better prepare their students for the many nonfiction texts they will encounter throughout their educational career and entire life.  It is especially intended for teachers who tend to focus on teaching with narrative texts because that is what they are comfortable with.  The research and lessons that comprise this project are meant to support teachers so that they might have a better understanding of how to teach their students to read and write informational texts and the importance of doing so.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We investigate the stabilization of unstable multidimensional partially observed single-station, multi-sensor (single-controller) and multi-controller (single-sensor) linear systems controlled over discrete noiseless channels under fixed-rate information constraints. Stability is achieved under communication requirements that are asymptotically tight in the limit of large sampling periods. Through the use of similarity transforms, sampling and random-time drift conditions we obtain a coding and control policy leading to the existence of a unique invariant distribution and finite second moment for the sampled state. We use a vector stabilization scheme in which all modes of the linear system visit a compact set together infinitely often.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We focus on the design of optimal policies in the event of commitment problems. &#xD;
In the first essay, we characterize how income should be redistributed within &#xD;
and across generations. The time-inconsistency problem arises when the government &#xD;
cannot commit to the future retirees' nonlinear tax schedule. Because retired &#xD;
individuals have revealed their private information during the active period &#xD;
of their lives, the government has an incentive to misuse it and to implement &#xD;
more redistribution than a regular second-best policy would prescribe. We study &#xD;
the set of equilibria that can be sustained if the government is infinitely lived, &#xD;
and the households are short-lived.&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, we derive an optimal linear pension scheme when individuals &#xD;
need forced savings as a commitment device. We do so with &#xD;
time-inconsistent preferences, whereby forced savings are the outcome of a paternalistic &#xD;
social welfare maximization process. We then derive the optimal scheme when individuals&#xD;
have self-control preferences.In both cases, we study the conflict between the forced-savings &#xD;
and redistributive roles of public pensions. We show that the non-paternalistic pension &#xD;
system may exhibit more forced savings and be less redistributive than the paternalistic one.&#xD;
&#xD;
The third essay analyzes whether centralizing or decentralizing the provision of &#xD;
public goods may influence the threats of secessions in a federation. We use a simple model &#xD;
with two regions, in which one of them may decide to secede even if it would be socially &#xD;
optimal, from the standpoint of the whole federation, to keep it united. Centralization&#xD;
offers both benefits and costs for individual regions. We show how &#xD;
centralizing generates a cost to secede if centralizing the provision of public goods requires &#xD;
an investment in joint institutions that cannot be perfectly recovered if the federation is &#xD;
dissolved. However, because a centralized provision of public goods does not match local preferences &#xD;
as well as a decentralized one, it also generates a long-run cost to remain in the federation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis proposes a distributed observer design for a class of nonlinear systems that arise in the application of model reduction techniques. Distributed observer design techniques have been proposed in the literature to address estimation problems over sensor networks. In large complex sensor networks, an efficient technique that minimizes the extent of the required communication is highly desirable. This is especially true when sensors have problems caused by physical limitations that result in incorrect information at the local level affecting the estimation of states globally. To address this problem, scalable algorithms for a suitable distributed observer have been developed. Most algorithms are focussed on large linear dynamical systems and they are not directly generalizable to nonlinear systems. In this thesis, scalable algorithms for distributed observers are proposed for a class of large scale observable nonlinear system.&#xD;
Distributed systems models multi-agent systems in which each agents attempts to accomplish local tasks. In order to achieve global objectives, there should be agreement regarding some commonly known variables that depend on the state of all agents. These variables are called consensus states. Once identified, such consensus states can be exploited in the development of distributed consensus algorithms. Consensus algorithms are used to develop information exchange protocols between agents such that global objectives are met through local action. In this thesis, a higher order observer is applied in the distributed sensor network system to design a distributed observer for a class nonlinear systems. Fusion of measurement and covariance information is applied to the higher order filter as the first method. The consensus filter is embedded in the local nonlinear observer for fusion of data. The second method is based on the communication of state estimates between neighbouring sensors rather than fusion of data measurement and covariance. The second method is found to reduce disagreement of the states estimation between each sensor. The performance of these new algorithms is demonstrated by simulation, and the second method is effectively applied over the first method.</dcterms:abstract>

The main contribution of this thesis is the idea that the research and practice of using IR models  to mine unstructured software repositories can be improved by going beyond the current state of affairs. First, we propose new applications of IR models to existing software engineering tasks. Specifically, we present a technique to prioritize test cases based on their IR similarity, giving highest priority to those test cases that are most dissimilar. In another new application of IR models, we empirically recover how developers use their mailing list while developing software.Next, we show how the use of advanced IR techniques can improve results. Using a framework for combining disparate IR models, we find that bug localization performance can be improved by 14–56% on average, compared to the best individual IR model. In addition, by using topic evolution models on the history of source code, we can uncover the evolution of source code concepts with an accuracy of 87–89%. &#xD;
Finally, we show the risks of current research, which uses IR models as black boxes without fully understanding their assumptions and parameters. We show that data duplication in source code has undesirable effects for IR models, and that by eliminating the duplication, the accuracy of IR models improves. Additionally,  we find that in the bug localization task, an unwise choice of parameter values results in an accuracy of only 1%, where optimal parameters can achieve an accuracy of 55%.&#xD;
Through empirical case studies on real-world systems, we show that all of our proposed techniques and methodologies significantly improve the state-of-the-art.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines how popular experiences of nature and history in the British Columbia Interior were structured by automobility – the system of objects, spaces, images, and practices that surrounded private automobiles and public roads. The Fordist state poured massive resources into the provincial road network during the period 1920 to 1970, and in the process created new possibilities for leisure and for profit. Motoring was a new, very modern way of experiencing BC, and also an important economic engine. Making the province’s highways and the landscapes that were visible alongside them look appealing to the motoring public became a matter of concern for many different parties. Boosters, businesses, and tourism promoters who stood to benefit from increased automobile travel often cultivated roadside attractions and lobbied the state to do the same. Starting in the early 1940s, the provincial government established numerous parks along the Interior highway network: the two examined here are Manning and Hamber parks. Beginning in the late 1950s it did the same with historical sites: Barkerville, Fort Steele, and several others are examined here. These and other parks and historic sites were established, developed, and managed as roadside amenities, and were used to deliver lessons about nature and history to the motoring public ‘by the road.’ Drawing on a wide range of examples from across the BC Interior, including both successes and failures, this thesis examines how the motoring public’s common landscape experiences were shaped by state-built infrastructure and by various groups’ efforts to manage, manipulate, and modify the landscapes that were visible by the road.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bag-of-words deception detection systems outperform humans, but are still not always accurate enough to be useful. In interrogation settings, present models do not take into account potential influence of the words in a question on the words in the answer. According to the theory of verbal mimicry, this ought to exist. We show with our research that it does exist: certain words in a question can "prompt" other words in the answer. However, the effect is receiver-state-dependent. Deceptive and truthful subjects in archival data respond to prompting in different ways. We can improve the accuracy of a bag-of-words deception model by training a machine learning algorithm on both question words and answer words, allowing it to pick up on differences in the relationships between these words. This approach should generalize to other bag-of-words models of psychological states in dialogues.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The three-dimensional (3D) baroclinic response of Cayuga Lake to surface wind forcing was investigated using the fully nonhydrostatic MITgcm. The model was validated against observed temperature data using a hydrostatic 450 m (horizontal) grid and both qualitative and quantitative methods. The model correctly reproduces the basin-scale dynamics (e.g., seiche with horizontal mode-one period T1 = 80 h) with a basin-wide root-mean-square error of 1.9 C. Nonlinear internal surges were visualized to evolve due to (i) a wind-induced locally downwelled thermocline (wind duration Twind &lt; T1/4), (ii) a basin-scale wind-induced upwelled thermocline (Twind &gt; T1/4), (iii) internal hydraulic jumps (IHJs). &#xD;
Results from a 113 m grid and field observations were used to characterize the basin-scale internal wave field according to composite Froude number (G2), Wedderburn number (WN), and Lake number (LN). The typical Cayuga Lake response is a surge when ~ 1 &lt; WN (LN) &lt; ~ 2-12 and a surge with emergent nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) when WN or LN &lt; ~ 2, in agreement with published laboratory studies. An observed shock front was simulated to be an IHJ, occurring at mid-basin during strong winds when WN &lt; 0.8. This is the first simulation of a mid-basin seiche-induced IHJ due to super critical conditions (G2 &gt; 1) in a lake. The topographic-induced IHJs were also shown to form when the surges interact with a sill-contraction topographic feature. &#xD;
Both high-resolution hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models were used to investigate the evolution, propagation and shoaling of NLIWs at medium lake-scale. A nonhydrostatic 22 m grid with lepticity λ ~ 1 ensures minimal numerical relative to physical dispersion, qualitatively reproducing observed dispersive NLIWs using ~ 2.3E+8 grid cells. Solitary waves evolve with almost unchanged wavelengths upon grid refinement from 40 m (λ ~ 2) to 22 m; suggesting model convergence to the correct solution. Corresponding hydrostatic grids were shown to produce a packet of narrower spurious solitary-like motions with different wavelengths, representing a balance between nonlinear steepening and numerical dispersion. Local gyre-like patterns and secondary transverse NLIW packets were visualized to result from wave-topography interaction, suggesting that NLIW propagation in long narrow lakes, where the bottom topography has irregularities is fundamentally 3D.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Every theory of liberal multiculturalism is premised on some account of the nature of culture, cultural difference and social reality, or what I call “the conditions of multiculturality”.  In this dissertation, I offer a revised account of the conditions and challenge of multiculturality.  Beginning with the widely accepted idea that individuals depend on both culture and community as social preconditions for choice, freedom and autonomy, and informing this idea with collectivist and individualist lessons from Tyler Burge’s famous externalist thought-experiment, my analysis shows that social contexts are multicultural when they are characterized by a plurality of social communities offering distinct sets of cultural norms, and individuals are multicultural to the extent that they are capable of using cultural norms from various social communities.  The depth, pervasiveness, and complexity of multiculturality raises important normative questions about fair and just terms for protecting and promoting social communities under conditions of internal and external cultural contestation, and these questions are not only restricted to cases involving internal minorities.  As a theory of cultural justice, liberal multiculturalism must respond to the challenge of multiculturality generated by cultural difference per se, but it cannot do so adequately in all cases armed with only the traditional tools of toleration, freedom of association and exit, fundamental rights and freedoms, and internal political autonomy.  My analysis demonstrates that, upon the revised conception of multiculturality, liberal theories of tolerationism, egalitarianism and nationalism leave significant cultural remainders, or unaccounted for cultural interests.  What is needed is a different liberal multiculturalism, which respects the individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms, is committed to the equal and just treatment of individuals, tolerates voluntary cultural groups and practices in the social sphere, recognizes an individual right to culture, and provides some measure of state assistance to individuals seeking to protect and promote their cultural communities in the private sphere.  This is a recipe for liberal cultural justice, and for a defensible liberal multiculturalism without nationalism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This case study examines the emergence of an autonomy-oriented assessment culture in Pediatric residency education in the School of Medicine at Queen’s University. Through a case study approach this research explores how an assessment system to capture residents’ performance in the clinical environment was initiated, how that process supported a shift in assessment cultural, and how assessment innovation is eclipsing departmental boundaries.&#xD;
	The case has instrumental value in illuminating how an autonomy-oriented assessment system and culture can be cultivated in residency education. The analytic frame for the case was constructed based on research literature that identified weaknesses in assessment practices in residency education more generally. The approach was theoretical, with the intent to explain how a shift in assessment culture is emerging in Pediatrics. A longitudinal approach was adopted to expose shifts in the culture. The narrative structure distills the journey into a manageable story. Three watershed events that exemplified change were systematically selected from data collected over a three-year period and constitute the findings of this research.&#xD;
	The central contribution this research makes is that it is possible to shift the culture of assessment within a Pediatric residency program. That shift can be understood to unfold over a prolonged period through a process of mediating both social and regulatory requirements. Beginning to shift the assessment culture in Pediatrics was achieved by: recognizing the need for change in assessment practice, re-conceptualizing and realizing that change, and engaging and empowering the community to support a shift in assessment culture. Strong leadership, widening community engagement and the Rubric Descriptor Bank supported this process. &#xD;
	Five theoretically informed principles guided the emergence of the autonomy-oriented assessment culture in Pediatrics including: (a) conceptualizing learning as a social, active process: (b) focusing attention on residents’ multidimensional growth; (c) moving away from a high-stakes orientation to assessment based on the false dichotomy between formative and summative assessment and embracing it as a tool for supporting and monitoring growth over time and across contexts; (d) actively supporting residents’ learning strategy and assessment skill development; and (e) fostering a growth orientation to learning, embracing the concept of graduated autonomy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vegetation community patterns and processes are indicators and integrators of climate.  Recently, scientists have shown that climate change is most pronounced in circumpolar regions. Arctic ecosystems have traditionally been sequestering carbon and accumulating large carbon stores. However, given enhanced warming in the Arctic, the potential exists for intensified global climate change if these ecosystems transition from sinks to sources of atmospheric CO2. In the Mid and High Arctic, ecosystems exhibit extreme levels of spatial heterogeneity, particularly at landscape scales. High spatial-resolution (e.g., 4m) remote sensing data capture heterogeneous vegetation patterns of the Arctic landscape and have the potential to model ecosystem biophysical properties and CO2 fluxes.  The following conditions are required to model arctic ecosystem processes: (i) unique spectral signatures that correspond to variations in the landscape pattern; (ii) models that transform remote sensing data into derivative values pertaining to the landscape; and (iii) field measures of the variables to calibrate and validate the models. First, this research creates an ecosystem classification scheme through ordination, clustering, and spectral-separability of ground cover data to generate ecologically meaningful and spectrally distinct image classifications. Classifications had overall accuracies between 69% - 79% and Kappa values of 0.54 - 0.69. Secondly, biophysical variable models of percent vegetation cover, aboveground biomass, and soil moisture are calibrated and validated using a k-fold cross-validation linear bivariate regression methodology. Percent vegetation cover and percent soil moisture produce the strongest and most consistent results (r2 ≥ 0.84 and 0.73) across both study sites.  Finally, in situ CO2 exchange rate data, an NDVI model for each component flux, which explains between 42% and 95% of the variation at each site, is generated. Analysis of coincidence indicates that a single model for each component flux can be applied, independent of site. This research begins to fill a gap in the application of high spatial-resolution remote sensing data for modelling Arctic ecosystem biophysical variables and carbon dioxide exchange, particularly in the Canadian Arctic. The results of this research also indicate high levels of functional convergence in ecosystem-level structure and function within Arctic landscapes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High-resolution physical and biogeochemical field data in central Lake Erie during the summers of 2008-2009 along with a three-dimensional numerical model were used to investigate the dynamics of basin scale waves and sediment resuspension mechanisms. In Chapter 2, the modal response of the Poincaré waves in the lake is assessed. The vertical mode-one Poincaré wave was found to be mostly dominant during the seasonal stratified period. The horizontal modal structure was also investigated in a sensitivity analysis, using the numerical model forced with real and idealized wind events. In Chapter 3, dynamics of bottom mixed layer (BML), primarily forced in the outer layer by surface seiches and Poincaré waves is studied for two 10-days representative intervals of weak and strong stratification. Shear velocity was calculated by least square fitting the well-known law-of-the-wall equation to observed near-bed velocity in a region of constant shear stress. Height of the BML is computed using water density (from water temperature) and compared with heights of logarithmic layer approximated using the law-of-the-wall equation and its modified form with buoyancy length scale term. Published equations for estimating BML heights are evaluated and modified for the lake. In Chapter 4, we investigate physical processes leading to sediment resuspension in the lake including surface waves (periods of 4-8s), up/downwelling events (periods of 3-4 day), and high frequency internal waves (periods of 5-45min). Temporal changes in near-bottom sediment resuspension are illustrated using changes in acoustic backscatter signals from current profilers and time series of turbidity measurements to identify the mechanism responsible for sediment resuspension. Resuspension is parameterized as a function of the critical velocity ~0.25ms-1 and from surface waves using linear wave theory. Finally, based on the critical velocity and sediment grain size analysis (from in-site field data), critical shear stress and Shields parameter are calculated and compared with previous observations in Lake Erie and in other locations suggesting a modified Shields diagram for silty bed materials.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>By virtue of its proximity, the Virgo Cluster is an ideal laboratory for us to test our understanding of the formation of structure in our Universe. In this spirit, we present a dynamical study of 33 gas-poor and 34 gas-rich Virgo galaxies as part of the Spectroscopic and H-band Imaging of Virgo survey.  Our final spectroscopic data set was acquired at the 3.5-m telescope at the Apache Point Observatory. Hα rotation curves for the gas-rich galaxies were modelled with a multi-parameter fit function from which various velocity measurements were inferred. Analog values were measured off of the observed rotation curves, but yielded noisier scaling relations, such as the luminosity-velocity relation (also known as the Tully-Fisher relation). Our best i-band Tully-Fisher relation has slope α=-7.2 ± 0.5 and intercept M_i(2.3)=-21.5 ± 1.1 mag, matching similar previous studies. Our study takes advantage of our own, as well as literature, data; we plan to continue expanding our compilation in order to build the largest Tully-Fisher relation for a cluster to date. Following extensive testing of the IDL routine pPXF, extended velocity dispersion profiles were extracted for our gas-poor galaxies. Considering the lack of a common standard for the measurement of a fiducial galaxy velocity dispersion in the literature, we have endeavoured to rectify this situation by determining the radius at which the measured velocity dispersion, coupled with the galaxy luminosity, yields the tightest Faber-Jackson relation. We found that radius to be 1.5 R_e, which exceeds the extent of most dispersion profiles in other works. The slope of our Faber-Jackson relation is α=-4.3 ± 0.2, which closely matches the virial value of 4. This analysis will soon be applied to a study of the Virgo Cluster Fundamental Plane. Rotation correction of our dispersion profiles will also permit the study of galaxies' velocity dispersion profile shapes in an attempt to refine our understanding of the overall manifold of galaxy structural parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

path-lifting equations. To validate this procedure, three distinct obstructions&#xD;
must be overcome. The first obstruction is that the endpoint maps of the control system&#xD;
under study must be twice continuously differentiable. By extending a result&#xD;
of A. Margheri, we show that this differentiability property is satisfied by an&#xD;
inclusive class of time-varying fully nonlinear control systems. The second obstruction is the existence of singular controls, which are simply the singular points of a fixed endpoint map. Rather than attempting to completely characterize such controls, we demonstrate how to isolate control systems for which no controls are singular. To this end, we build on the&#xD;
work of S. A. Vakhrameev to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition. In particular, this result accommodates time-varying fully nonlinear control&#xD;
systems. The final obstruction is that the solutions of path-lifting equations may not&#xD;
exist globally. To study this problem, we work under the standing assumption&#xD;
that the control system under study is control-affine. By extending a result of Y. Chitour, we show that the question of global existence can be resolved by examining Lie bracket configurations and momentum functions. Finally, we show that if the control system under study is completely&#xD;
unobstructed with respect to a fixed motion planning problem, then its corresponding endpoint map is a fiber bundle. In this sense, we obtain a necessary condition for unobstructed motion planning by the continuation method.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation presents a thesis on the use of additive manufacturing in the development and evaluation of a computer-assisted system for wrist-fracture repair. The work developed tools for performing navigated wrist surgery, developed methods for evaluating surgical performance, and provided novel experience with model-based&#xD;
surgical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Patient-derived bone models, fabricated using additive manufacturing, were proposed as an alternative to cadaver specimens for testing and validating the new surgical system. The accuracy of fabricating these models from computed-tomography imaging was investigated using laser scanning and was found to be reproducible to within half a millimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
Three generations of a surgical system for navigated wrist-fracture repair were&#xD;
developed and evaluated using a wrist model that was produced by additive manufacturing. Compared to cadaver specimens, the model was less expensive and performed equally well under simulated surgical conditions. The model-based evaluation permitted larger study sizes that increased the statistical power of the experimental results.&#xD;
&#xD;
Criteria for surgical performance included surgical and technical measurement of&#xD;
screw placement. The navigation system was superior in optimizing screw placement compared to conventional surgical methods. Navigation also reduced the risk of&#xD;
radiation exposure and clinical complications of wrist-fracture repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
Surgical tools, including a drill guide and wrist-stabilization device were developed&#xD;
with the use of additive manufacturing. Prototype devices could be quickly and&#xD;
economically fabricated for testing under realistic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
A system for performing navigated wrist fracture repair was successfully developed&#xD;
through the use of additive-manufacturing prototyping and evaluation. Additive manufacturing was integral to the successful evaluation of the system's improvement in performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Compared to research on English as a First Language (EL1) reading comprehension, there is a dearth of studies investigating English as a Second Language (ESL) reading comprehension. This dissertation reports findings from two studies which examined the cognitive processes underlying English reading comprehension in Chinese ESL students. Two-hundred and forty six Grade 8 students in an English immersion program in a junior middle school in China were administered a battery of reading-related and reading comprehension tests. The first study investigated the cognitive predictors of English reading comprehension in these students. It tested whether the Simple View of Reading model (Gough &amp; Tunmer, 1986) applied to Chinese ESL students and whether the effects of breadth and depth of vocabulary contributed to different levels of reading comprehension. The results showed that the Simple View of Reading model did not predict Chinese English-immersion students’ reading comprehension well. Vocabulary as well as inference and strategy added further variance to the general understanding of text. Vocabulary breadth and depth explained unique variance in reading comprehension, with vocabulary breadth contributing more to general understanding of text and vocabulary depth to deep processing of text. &#xD;
The second study explored characteristics of reading comprehension difficulties among Chinese English-immersion students. Three groups of comprehenders matched on age, nonverbal intelligence, and word reading speed were identified from the 246 Grade 8 Chinese English-immersion students: 33 unexpected poor comprehenders, 28 expected average comprehenders, and 30 unexpected good comprehenders. The three groups differed in vocabulary and higher-level processes. Vocabulary breadth and depth distinguished between the unexpected poor comprehenders and the expected average comprehenders. Inference, strategy, listening comprehension, summary writing, and morphological awareness distinguished between the expected average comprehenders and the unexpected good comprehenders. The findings suggest that vocabulary is the main source of reading comprehension difficulties in these unexpected poor comprehenders. The advantage of the unexpected good comprehenders group was primarily due to discourse comprehension and strategic processes, and is only possible with high language proficiency. Taken together, both vocabulary and higher-level skills are essential to successful reading comprehension in Chinese English-immersion students. The higher-level skills can be used more efficiently to help these students’ reading comprehension when they have acquired adequate vocabulary knowledge.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Smith (2003) suggested in an influential review paper that behavioural observation and sociometry were two potentially useful but under-utilized methods for the study of peers in youth sport.  Despite this call, the methods used to study peers in sport remain largely focused on athletes’ perceptions through questionnaires and interviews (Murphy-Mills, Bruner, Erickson, &amp; Côté, 2011).  Thus, the  purpose of this project was to examine sociometric status, competence, and athlete behaviour in a youth sport context using an observational coding system.  Female volleyball players (N = 28; Mage = 15.94) from three competitive teams completed the sport competence and peer connection inventories (Vierimaa, Erickson, Côté, &amp; Gilbert, 2012), and each team was videotaped during three practices. An observational coding system was developed and used to code athlete behaviours in a continuous, time-based manner and this data was compared across sociometric status groups.  The results reinforce past research that suggests that sport competence is an important factor in gaining peer acceptance among youth (e.g., Weiss &amp; Duncan, 1992). Behavioural profiles were constructed for each sociometric status group, which revealed differences between groups in relation to interactions with peers, coaches, and overall sociability.  Rejected and neglected athletes appeared to be less sociable than average, interacting less with peers and coaches.  Coaches also appeared to spend more time interacting with popular athletes who they viewed as more competent, and less with rejected and neglected athletes who they viewed as less competent.  Thus, sociometry appears to be a useful approach with which to study young athletes’ behaviour in sport.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by slow progression, functional limitations and poor quality of life. As a chronic disabling disease RA influence not only individuals but also their families. The impact of RA on family members includes providing the required care to the ill relative, postponing family plans, or altering family priorities and decisions due to the illness process. &#xD;
Purpose of the Study: The psychosocial changes that family members experience may possible compromise their health, family function and relationships with each other. The purpose of the current study was to describe the experience of family members who provide social support to their relative with RA. This study was set to explore the forms of support that are needed by family members to provide adequate support to their relative with RA.&#xD;
Method: The exploratory purpose of the study leads the researcher to conduct a descriptive qualitative study within the naturalistic inquiry. Naturalistic inquiry is consistent with the aims of this study in which the social support needs of family members of individuals with RA were explored and described. &#xD;
Findings: Five themes emerged from the data analysis, including: 1) effect of the disease; 2) reshaping the relationship; 3) providing support; 4) social support needs; and, 5) finding balance and coping. &#xD;
Conclusion: The impacts of RA on the lives of family members resulted from the chronicity of RA. Participants in this study described the effects of RA on themselves, the changes in the relationship with their relative with RA and their effort to maintain the relationship by providing support to their relative with RA.  Additionally, they described the social support that they received from family members, friends and healthcare providers. They continuously identified the support they lacked. Nearly all participants were able to achieve balance between providing support and care to their relative with RA and engaging in their own life activities. They also utilized several coping strategies to achieve balance while providing support to their relative, carrying on their duty toward the family, work and their own personal needs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The increasing environmental impact of society has created the need for the modification of current and the implementation of new industrial processes which are less environmentally harmful. However, these new or modified processes must be less material-, time-, and cost-intensive such that they are more economically beneficial than the processes they are to supplant. The described research was inspired by these two ideas and is comprised of two projects, both focused on the creation of recyclable, CO2-switchable methods of separating organic compounds.&#xD;
The development and optimization of switchable water, a CO2-switchable ionic strength aqueous solvent is described. The solvent system, an amine/aqueous mixture, had the ability to switch from low to high ionic strength via the application and removal of CO2. This solvent system was able to achieve salting-out of water-miscible organics in comparable amounts to several inorganic salts typically used for salting-out.&#xD;
The switchable water system was explored for use in several industrial applications. A homogeneous catalysis recycling system was developed for the hydroformylation of styrene. A catalyst was able to be recovered and recycled five times with minimal loss of activity. The use of switchable water to expedite the settling of clay suspensions was also explored. Switchable water, when used as process water did not settle bulk clay solids as quickly as a CO2-only treatment, but did however increase the settling rate of small clay fines resulting in lower turbidities of the supernatant. The solvent could be recovered from settled clay suspensions and recycled up to three times. &#xD;
Finally, efforts towards the realization of CO2-switchable chiral resolving agents are presented. It is hypothesized that chiral nitrogenous bases could be used as switchable resolving agents by forming diastereomeric salt pairs with racemic alcohols via the application of CO2. After separation of the diastereomers, removal of CO2 would afford the resolved alcohol enantiomers and the chiral base. Efforts towards the synthesis of a library of chiral nitrogenous bases and the screening of their reactivity with CO2-treated alcohols are described. Several bases were generated, but the necessary reactivity between the bases and the racemic alcohols in the presence of CO2 was not observed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Robert Lepage’s play The Dragons’ Trilogy stretches across space and time, travelling through three generations and three major Canadian cities, each section named for a dragon in the Chinese game Mahjong. The Blue Dragon continues the story of Pierre Lamontagne twenty years later, and in doing so, rounds out and completes the cycle of the three Dragons of The Dragons’ Trilogy. This thesis studies the evolution of Lepage’s treatment of the Other and the Self in The Dragons’ Trilogy and The Blue Dragon. Grouping these two plays together should be a foregone conclusion, because of the titles of each section and the character of Pierre Lamontagne, who appears in both plays, but it has in fact been discussed very little. This thesis thus examines the transformation of characters such as Pierre, who, from one play to the other, and through language and space, find the Other in the Self. &#xD;
To address this issue, the second chapter explores the question of plurilingualism, in order to show how the plurality of languages in the plays and among the characters promotes the ideal of communication and communion with the Other. In the third chapter, the thesis examines the theatrical space of the two plays; from the closed-off city of Québec during the 1930s in The Green Dragon to Pierre Lamontagne’s intimate and modern loft in The Blue Dragon, the imagined worlds perfectly mirror the interior journeys of the characters. Finally, the last chapter, which studies the characters, focuses on the question of stereotypes, the quests for identity, and the role artistic creation plays within these quests. Ultimately, this thesis demonstrates that in The Dragons’ Trilogy and The Blue Dragon, although Otherness may at first appear to be the opposite of Self, it is in fact found within identity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Skin is a dynamic and complex organ that relies on the interaction of different cell types,biomacromolecules and signaling molecules. Upon injury, a cascade of events occurs to quickly restore the skin’s integrity. Depending on the size and severity of the wound, a dressing is used&#xD;
to provide a temporary barrier to protect from dehydration, microorganisms and debris. Current wound dressings however, cannot accelerate wound healing beyond the natural rate, require frequent dressing changes, and cannot be easily removed without triggering additional pain ortissue destruction. Insulin, a peptide used to treat Type 1 diabetes, has been reported to improve&#xD;
the recovery of severe burn wounds. Yet, no one has successfully demonstrated a convenient and effective insulin delivery vehicle that can be used to accelerate burn wound healing.&#xD;
Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles, were shown to release bioactive insulin for a&#xD;
period of 25 days, stimulating human keratinocyte migration in vitro. A wound dressing made from poly(ethylene glycol) and alginate was formulated incorporating the insulin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles. Bioactive insulin release was achieved for nearly 3 weeks, along with favourable water handling and physical properties conducive for wound&#xD;
healing. Finally, in vivo testing confirmed that a constant dose of insulin from alginate-PEG sponge dressings loaded with 0.125mg, or 0.04mg/cm2 insulin, with dressing changes every 3 days, was sufficient to significantly improve wound healing by 25%, as compared to an alginate-&#xD;
PEG sponge dressing without insulin. Insulin releasing alginate-PEG sponge dressings are&#xD;
therefore, an effective method of improving burn wound healing and may serve as a delivery vehicle platform to incorporate other therapeutic molecules in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the major complications in patients with long standing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is colitis-associated colon cancer. The signaling pathways that promote the transformation of colitis to colorectal cancer (CRC) are unknown but one candidate is the prolonged interaction between tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and its receptor, TNFR1. This interaction may stimulate a defective Wnt signaling pathway to evoke epithelial cells to hyperproliferate. This crypt hyperproliferation can lead to the development CRC. Activation of Extracellular Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) a G-protein coupled receptor, on sub-epithelial myfibroblasts has been found to stimulate the expression of Wnt5a, a member of Wnt family, while CaSR activation on the epithelial cells stimulates Wnt5a receptor, Ror2, a member of receptor tyrosine kinase family. Wnt5a/Ror2 (non canonical signaling) interaction has been suggested to decrease TNFR1 expression and inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling to regulate cellular growth. The aims of this thesis were to determine whether increased dietary calcium will increase colonic CaSR expression, characterize the colons of “rescued” CaSR/PTH double homozygous knockout and their response to an acute model of colitis, and assess whether CaSR activation influenced the status of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (pLRP6), co-receptor for Wnt, in cell culture models. Our results demonstrated that CaSR expression is higher in the colon of the NIH-Swiss Webster mice after feeding them 2% calcium alone or in conjunction with vitamin D for four weeks compared to two weeks, suggesting that dietary calcium alone or together with vitamin D can regulate colonic CaSR expression. We found the CaSR-/PTH- colons had a significant reduction in the non canonical signaling and enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the amount of inflammation was increased, suggesting that CaSR can inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the colonic crypt and acts as an anti-inflammatory signal.  Our results demonstrated that CaSR activation alone in CaSR-HEK and RKO cells reduced Wnt-stimulated LRP6 phosphorylation suggesting a crucial role of CaSR in the inhibition of LRP6 phosphorylation. The observations seen in this study strongly suggest a role for CaSR in inhibiting the defective Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, induced colitis, and LRP6 phosphorylation to regulate cellular growth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, revisionism in Canadian museums has created a space for the development of different ways of classifying and representing non-Western visual and material culture. Despite these changes, many mainstream or authoritative museums and other cultural institutions still operate largely as separate from the constituent communities to which the non-Western collections in their possession are directly related. This thesis investigates the complex relationship between three different types of collections of African visual and material culture in Canada, the institutions in which they reside, and the relationship to the constituent communities that have a stake in the reception of these collections. These collections include the ethnographic collection of African artifacts at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the Lang Collection of African Art at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre at Queen’s University in Kingston, and the African cultural collection at the North American Black Historical Museum and Cultural Centre in Amherstburg. As this thesis makes clear, the very nature of incorporating, classifying and displaying African visual and material culture in Western museums, which are a direct product of the colonial era, is fraught with contentions. In light of this, the growth in cultural centres in Canada in recent years has the potential to inform mainstream museums, offering new ways of approaching and engaging with not only non-Western objects, but also their diverse constituent communities. By focusing on the discourse of museum representation in relation to African collections in Canada, this thesis posits that these collections can be understood as crucial sites for the promotion of cross-cultural negotiations between African and non-African Canadian communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years the role of morphology has gained a great deal of attention regarding research on vocabulary and literacy learning. An attendant literature investigating morphology as a potentially rich context for instructional innovation has grown as well. Chapter 1 of this dissertation presents a critical review of that research. Its focus is on ways that this growing interest in morphology builds on lessons from previous decades of research on the relative effectiveness of instruction which targeted phonological features of words (sub-lexical features) compared to those which targeted learning to read words from context. A detailed description of the linguistic account of how English orthography operates to represent morphology and phonology is also presented. &#xD;
Two studies investigating the role of morphology and morphology instruction in relation to literacy learning and theories of reading are reported. The first study is an intervention using experimental and control classes (Grade 4 and 5) to investigate the effect of instruction about morphology on vocabulary learning. Hierarchical regression analyses controlling for initial vocabulary showed that the experimental group gained in measures of vocabulary compared to a control group and that the morphological treatment group made better use of existing vocabulary knowledge in learning new vocabulary. &#xD;
The second study is a quantitative synthesis of instructional studies assessing the effects of morphological instruction on sub-lexical, lexical and supra-lexical outcomes. Positive effects were found for morphological treatments compared to the 10 studies that used typical classroom instruction controls and effects equal to alternative treatments that mostly used well-established research-based instruction.  Less able students and younger students generally exhibited greater gains than undifferentiated and older students. &#xD;
The results of these studies are discussed within the context of previous instructional research and established theories of reading and literacy instruction. It is suggested that the findings from these studies support the view that instruction should encourage learners to explicitly attend to the ordered lexical/sub-lexical morphological and phonological features of how oral and written words work as a means to foster generative word learning and greater literacy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation presents a new measure of U.S. inflation persistence from the point of view of a professional forecaster. In chapter 2 I explore two different measures that give insight into the views of professional forecasters and link their views with U.S. inflation data. One of these measures, given by the persistence implied by forecast revisions, appears to have similarities with actual inflation persistence over the 1981–2008 sample period.&#xD;
	Chapter 3 explores forecast revisions in a more general setting allowing forecasters to have their own views on inflation persistence as well as a unique information set. This chapter builds a measure of perceived inflation persistence via the implied autocorrelation function that follows from the estimates obtained using a forecaster-specific state-space model. When compared to the autocorrelation function for actual inflation, forecasters tend to react less to shocks that hit inflation than the actual inflation data would suggest. This could be due to increased credibility of the Federal Reserve, but it could also be a result of a bias in the underlying inflation forecasts.&#xD;
	Chapter 4 focuses on this issue and finds that the reluctance of forecasters to make revisions to their previously announced forecasts causes their estimates of perceived inflation persistence to be understated as their announced inflation forecasts differ from their true inflation expectations. This chapter also presents a method to undo this bias by retrieving their true inflation expectations series.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although there have been many studies examining the factors involved in children’s risk of injury, there has been a dearth of research that examines specific individual parental factors in children’s risk of injury.  This thesis examined how the attitudes, values, and beliefs of 119 Canadian minor hockey parents of children (aged 9 to 12 years) with respect to their decision-making regarding their children’s safe participation in hockey.  Two studies are reported.  The first study describes: (a) the development of a questionnaire that quantifies the constructs of perceived control, probabilities, values, risk propensity, competitiveness, and assertiveness expectancies; and (b) a sample of hockey parents in terms of their demographic characteristics and their attitudes, values, and beliefs regarding their children’s participation in minor hockey.   The second study examined the relationships between these attitudes, values, and beliefs and a measure of their risk decision-making.  Overall, results showed that (a) this sample of hockey parents tended to be well educated, and did not see themselves as being generally over-competitive or aggressive; (b) hockey parents’ attitudes, values, and beliefs regarding their children’s risk of concussion had very little predictive value or reliable connection with respect to their risk decision-making on behalf of their children; and (c) the most significant factors in parents’ risk decision-making were the opinions of their children, and the opinions of the doctors.  The implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accrediting bodies for medical schools require that medical students be provided with formative assessment in all clerkship courses. The literature describes many strategies for formative assessment in clerkship settings, but qualitative studies of clerk and supervisor experiences with formative assessment are lacking. In this thesis, I describe a study that explores clerk and supervisor experiences with formative assessment in one internal medicine clerkship course. &#xD;
	First, the literature was reviewed to determine current conceptions of formative assessment and learning in medical education. Then, novice and experienced clerks were recruited to participate. Prior to starting their Core Internal Medicine course, each clerk participated in an interview to understand his or her concepts of learning and assessment. During the six-week course, they replied to an electronic weekly questionnaire to describe and reflect on learning experiences. Finally, they participated in a focus group at the end of the course, to explore their experiences with formative assessment. Supervisors, (residents and attending physicians), who supervised clerks were recruited to participate in one interview to explore their approach to supervision and assessment of clerks, and to understand factors that influenced their ability to do this. All relevant artifacts (forms, policies, procedures) were collected for subsequent analyses. &#xD;
	Four experienced clerks and eleven novice clerks participated, along with eight attending physicians and five residents. Participants identified four key themes as playing a significant role in assessment and learning: (a) the developing role of doctor, (b) the role of the team, (c) working and learning environments, and (d) educational strategies. Data analysis revealed the participants had unclear formal concepts of formative assessment, even though they could all describe the key concepts about how assessment affects learning, and were quite clear about what factors supported learning, and which ones were barriers to learning. &#xD;
	The study contributes to our understanding of clerks’ and supervisors’ experiences with assessment and learning in a workplace-based learning setting. Finally, the study led to recommendations about how to better support formative assessment in the Core Internal Medicine course, and for further research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ plays a role in tumorigenesis. Previous studies with PPARγ(+/-) mice suggest PPARγ normally suppresses dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast, and other, tumor progression. Since many cell types associated with the mammary gland express PPARγ, each with unique signaling pathways, the present study aimed to define which tissues are required for PPARγ-dependent anti-tumor effects. Conditional adipocyte and endothelial cell-specific PPARγ knockout mice (PPARγ-A KO and PPARγ-E KO respectively) were used to evaluate whether PPARγ signaling normally acts to prevent DMBA-mediated breast tumour progression in a stromal cell-specific manner. Twelve week old PPARγ KO mice and their congenic wildtype (WT) controls were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. All mice were treated by gavage once/week for 6 weeks with 1 mg DMBA and maintained on a normal chow diet. At week 7, mice in each group were divided into those continuing normal chow, and those receiving a PPARγ ligand (ROSI, 4 mg/kg/day) supplemented diet for the duration of the 25 week study, and monitored weekly. Tumour and tissue samples were collected at necropsy, and portions of each were fixed and frozen for future analysis. In both PPARγ-A KOs and PPARγ-E KOs versus PPARγ-WT mice, malignant mammary tumor incidence was significantly higher and mammary tumor latency was decreased. DMBA+ROSI treatment reduced average mammary tumor volumes by 50%. Gene expression analyses of mammary glands by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence indicated that untreated PPARγ-A KOs had significantly decreased BRCA1 expression in mammary stromal adipocytes. Compared to PPARγ-WT mice, serum leptin levels in PPARγ-A KOs were also significantly higher throughout the study. In the PPARγ-E KO mice, both treatment groups saw a significant increase in thymic tumour incidence, a finding not established before with the study of other stromal cell knockout mice. These studies provide the first direct in vivo evidence that PPARγ signalling in stromal adipocytes and endothelial cells attenuates DMBA-mediated breast tumourigenesis. This study supports a protective effect of activating PPAR gamma as a novel chemopreventive therapy for breast cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Software is an integral part of our everyday lives, and hence the quality of software is very important. However, improving and maintaining high software quality is a difficult task, and a significant amount of resources is spent on fixing software defects. Previous studies have studied software quality using various measurable aspects of software, such as code size and code change history. Nevertheless, these metrics do not consider all possible factors that are related to defects. For instance, while lines of code may be a good general measure for defects, a large file responsible for simple I/O tasks is likely to have fewer defects than a small file responsible for complicated compiler implementation details. In this thesis, we address this issue by considering the conceptual concerns (or features). We use a statistical topic modelling approach to approximate the conceptual concerns as topics. We then use topics to study software quality along two dimensions: code quality and code testedness. We perform our studies using three versions of four large real-world software systems: Mylyn, Eclipse, Firefox, and NetBeans.&#xD;
Our proposed topic metrics help improve the defect explanatory power (i.e., fitness of the regression model) of traditional static and historical metrics by 4–314%. We compare one of our metrics, which measures the cohesion of files, with other topic-based cohesion and coupling metrics in the literature and find that our metric gives the greatest improvement in explaining defects over traditional software quality metrics (i.e., lines of code) by 8–55%.&#xD;
We then study how we can use topics to help improve the testing processes. By training on previous releases of the subject systems, we can predict not well-tested topics that are defect prone in future releases with a precision and recall of 0.77 and 0.75, respectively. We can map these topics back to files and help allocate code inspection and testing resources. We show that our approach outperforms traditional prediction-based resource allocation approaches in terms of saving testing and code inspection efforts.&#xD;
The results of our studies show that topics can be used to study software quality and support traditional quality assurance approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability to receive regular peer feedback on learning should, in theory, be valuable to learners. A formative view will be presented in this study in which information is collected and used as feedback for student learning. This differs from summative practices where the purpose is to make judgments about the extent to which learning has taken place. This case study takes place in a first year master’s Occupational Therapy (OT) course where the focus is on the development of communication skills. These skills are developed through interviewing and assessment strategies. This case focuses on the feedback received by students from their peers based on the clinical interviews that were conducted. &#xD;
	 Peers in this study are members of the same learning team who have been divided into these groups for the purpose of learning together. Students in this course receive both written and oral peer feedback during peer assessment exercises. This feedback is formally reflected on by students as self-assessment. Although, both peer and self-assessments are used for formative purposes in this course, the primary focus of this study is on peer assessment. &#xD;
	Six participants were recruited for this study. The data for this inquiry consisted of transcripts from six semi-structured interviews and a focus group as well as written artifacts from the course. The data analysis revealed three core themes related to both the peer assessment process and peer feedback. Motivation for Learning and Awareness of Growth or Development were identified as two key themes relating to student learning. The third theme identified was Factors that Impacted the Learning Experience which had to do with how students felt about having engaged in the peer assessment process. A unique finding regarding the latter theme centered around the time factor required to take on the roles, inherent in peer assessment activities.  Students offered insights into the relationship between stress and motivation for learning when taking on peer assessment responsibilities. &#xD;
	This study contributes to our understanding of the meaning and consequences of implementing peer assessment into the communication module of the OT course. Insights on the implications of this study to higher education in relation to peer assessment are also explored.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The performance of joints in buried gravity flow pipelines are important since failure of these elements can affect the structural capacity of soil-pipe systems and reduce their longevity. Currently, there are no clear guidelines to design joints for gravity flow pipelines and therefore their design is based on semi-empirical methods.  It is necessary to identify and quantify the demands that act across joints when subjected to service loading conditions to establish adequate design guidelines. Such demands will vary depending on the type of joint, type of pipe, burial and loading conditions. Therefore work is needed to investigate the influence of these conditions on the performance of joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
Full-scale laboratory tests have been performed on rigid (reinforced concrete) and flexible (corrugated steel and thermoplastic) pipelines to investigate the response of their joints when buried and subjected to surface loading. The joints investigated are either ‘moment-release’ joints (those that accommodate rotation and reduce the longitudinal bending moments close to zero), or ‘moment-transfer’ joints (those that limit rotation and transfer longitudinal bending moments from one pipe to the next). These experiments evaluate the influence of different cover depths, loading locations, and installation conditions on the response of the joints. Additionally, the performance of each joint when the pipeline was buried with shallow cover and subjected to surface loads up to and beyond fully factored loads were also investigated. Furthermore, three-dimensional finite element analyses of a gasketed bell and spigot joint in a buried reinforced concrete pipeline subjected to surface loading have been developed employing material properties and joint rotational characteristics experimentally obtained. &#xD;
&#xD;
The data obtained from the experimental and computational studies are used to evaluate joint performance and to identify key demands (shear force and rotation or moment) acting across them. In addition, the different patterns of vertical displacement along rigid and flexible pipes were established. It was found that the stiffness of the pipeline, the geometry of the joint, the loading and burial conditions influence the response (and therefore the demands) of the joints examined. Finally, recommendations are provided regarding development of structural design methods for these pipeline and joint systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding how floral traits covary with one another and with mating patterns is an important step in understanding how and why mating systems evolve. I examined the evolution of floral and mating system variation in Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia (Onagraceae), a species that exhibits divergence in key floral traits expected to be associated with variation in the relative importance of outcrossing vs. self-fertilization. &#xD;
I combined geographic surveys of floral variation with genetic estimates of the proportion of seeds outcrossed (t) and confirmed that t covaried with corolla width and herkogamy in a predictable way both within and among populations. I then performed geographic surveys, manipulative experiments and genetic analyses to evaluate the potential role that; inbreeding depression (ID), interactions between flowers, pollinators and florivores, and reproductive assurance (RA) may have played in shaping and/or maintaining the geographic pattern of mating system variation in this species.&#xD;
The main selective factor maintaining outcrossing in large flowered (LF) populations appears to be ID, which was much stronger in LF compared to small flowered (SF) populations. These results are also consistent with purging of ID in SF populations. Increased selfing appeared to alleviate pollen limitation (PL) because it was associated with higher and less variable fruit set and reduced florivory by a microlepidopteran. However, evidence that florivores preferentially attacked larger flowers was equivocal. LF experienced stronger PL than SF populations suggesting that one condition for the evolution of selfing via RA is met in outcrossing populations. Floral emasculation experiments revealed that the timing of selfing also covaried with flower size among and within populations. SF self-pollinate before flowers open but LF do not, suggesting that selfing evolved in response to chronic outcross PL. Negative side effects of emasculation were detected which prevented a clear interpretation of the RA value of selfing. Given that much of what is known about RA comes from emasculation experiments, my results suggest that the assumptions of this approach, which are rarely verified, require more serious consideration. Taken together my results suggest that C. cheiranthifolia has evolved multiple stable mixed mating systems perhaps in response to selection for RA.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Shallow lakes in Muskoka-Haliburton have been largely ignored in previous limnological and paleolimnological studies, as many are considered to be less desirable for cottage development and other cultural activities.  Nonetheless, shallow lakes offer important habitat for many animals. 30 oligo- and mesotrophic, shallow lakes were chosen for a paleolimnological study to assess the impacts of multiple stressors on cladoceran invertebrates. Fossil cladoceran remains preserved in the sediment samples of the study lakes were used to evaluate the nature and magnitude of any changes in assemblages from both modern and pre-industrial times. Relationships between present-day assemblages and key environmental variables were investigated using redundancy analysis, which identified that lake area (p&lt;0.01) and Secchi depth (p&lt;0.05) were significant predictors of assemblage composition in the shallow lakes. Secchi depth was not correlated to water clarity measures, as it usually is, but rather to macrophyte abundance. The modern-day assemblages were compared to the pre-industrial assemblages using the snapshot “top-bottom” paleolimnological approach. The top and bottom assemblages were compared using an ANOSIM which was not significant (p=0.2), confirming that modern assemblages were similar to pre-industrial assemblages in shallow lakes. Full core analysis from three shallow lakes also showed only subtle changes in littoral assemblage composition through time, further supporting results from the top/bottom study. The changes recorded were mainly in the pelagic taxa, with the littoral taxa relatively very stable through time. These small, shallow lakes were then compared and combined with a deep lake set from the same region. The results show some striking differences between shallow and deep lakes. For example, pelagic taxa appear to be driving changes within assemblages across a depth gradient, with most of the changes in the deeper lakes. Water chemistry has an increasingly important role in structuring cladoceran assemblage as lakes become deeper, although lake morphometry does play an important role in defining cladoceran assemblages in all the study lakes. Cladoceran assemblages in shallow lakes appear to be more stable than deeper lakes, despite being exposed to the same regional stressors, such as acidification, calcium decline, and climate change.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is an empirical modeling investigation of the impact of forest harvesting, climate change and topography on stream nitrate fluxes in the Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW), Ontario, Canada. Data used for this study include topography (DEM), climate (mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation), wet nitrogen deposition (total monthly nitrate-N and ammonium-N), nitrate water samples and streamflow in 13 headwater catchments within the TLW. First, a paired-watershed approach was used to examine the impact of forest harvesting intensity on stream water nitrate fluxes by developing transfer function noise (TFN) models that related monthly stream water nitrate fluxes of three treatment catchments to those of one control catchment. Second, TFN models were also developed to relate monthly stream nitrate fluxes in 13 catchments to the temperature, precipitation and wet nitrogen deposition to examine the spatially varying responses of stream nitrate fluxes to changes in climate and bulk deposition. Third, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was introduced to model the spatial and temporal relationships between topography and stream nitrate fluxes in 13 headwater catchments. The results showed that there existed a new phenomenon of clustered wave-up and wave-down of the stream nitrate increases caused by clearcut and selectioncut at the monthly scale, respectively. This phenomenon was never reported by previous studies because it was not possible to be identified with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression at an annual scale. There also existed significant responses of stream nitrate fluxes to wet nitrogen deposition in all catchments at the monthly scale over a long-term record between 1982 and 2003. These responses were previously thought to be lower and masked by the impact of climate variations. There further existed significant spatial and seasonal variability of the relationships between topography and stream nitrate fluxes across space and over time. This variability was largely ignored in previous studies with possibly misleading interpretation on the empirical relations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis discusses the kinematic calibration of the constraining linkage of a four degrees of freedom parallel manipulator. The manipulator has hybrid actuation of joints and wires, however the wires are not considered in this calibration. Two of the passive joints of the manipulator contain sensing so the calibration of the constraining linkage can be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Four kinematic models are developed for the manipulator. For each of these models, an independent set of model parameters are identified through an analysis of the augmented identification Jacobian matrix.  Three different methods for formulating the augmented identification Jacobian matrix are explored.  &#xD;
&#xD;
For the calibration, an optical tracking system is used to track the end-effector of the manipulator. The procedure to collect the calibration data is explained and the sources of error are considered.  To further analyze the sources of error, simulated input data is created and the calibration using the experimental data and the simulated data are compared. &#xD;
&#xD;
In an attempt to improve the calibration, the selection of measured poses to be used for calibration is explored. Several different pose selection criteria have been proposed in the literature and five are evaluated in this work. The pose selection criteria were applied to the experimental manipulator and also a simulated two degrees of freedom manipulator.  It is found that the pose selection criteria have a large impact when few poses are used; however the best results occur when a large number of poses are used for the calibration. &#xD;
&#xD;
An experimental calibration is carried out for the manipulator. Using the joint encoders and the kinematic model, the expected pose of the end-effector is calculated.  The actual pose is measured using a vision tracking system and the difference between the actual and expected pose is minimized by adjusting the model parameters using a nonlinear optimization method.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>PV/Thermal technology is the combination of solar thermal and photovoltaics - two mature and widely understood technologies. Combining the two technologies complicates existing standardized rating procedures and performance modeling methods. Currently a standardized performance test method does not exist for PV/Thermal (PV/T) panels. Existing and developing PV/T panels are commonly tested using separate standardized solar thermal and photovoltaic test procedures. Solar thermal performance is rated in terms of temperature difference whereas photovoltaic performance is dependent on absolute temperature level. The thermal and electrical performance of a PV/T panel is, however, coupled so performance equations derived using traditional test methods may not accurately reflect the performance of a combined PV/T panel over a wide range of conditions. &#xD;
The purpose of this work was to develop an efficiency equation for a PV/T panel which can be derived from a minimal amount of empirical test data and still accurately predict its thermal and electrical performance over a wide range of conditions.  To accomplish this, a quasi- 3-dimensional steady-state model of a sheet-and-tube PV/T collector was developed and used to generate a broad data set from which a simplified PV/T performance equation was developed. Using this numerically generated data set, and introducing additional coefficients into the traditional solar thermal performance characteristic, a modified PV/T efficiency equation was derived which expressed the electrical and thermal efficiency in terms of ambient temperature, incident solar irradiation and the temperature difference between the inlet fluid and the ambient. It was also shown, for the case studied, that the efficiency equation can be produced from as few as 6 data points and still accurately predicts the performance at a wide range of operating conditions. A  TRNSYS [1] model was developed to demonstrate how the performance equation can be used to simulate the annual performance of a PV/T collector in a domestic hot water system. It was shown that a performance equation, derived from 6 data points, performed as well as a performance map which used over 1000 data points. The annual thermal and electrical production predicted by both models was within 1.5% of each other.  The PV/T efficiency equations were also shown to perform well for a range of electrical parameters, thermal properties and substrate thermal conductivity values. &#xD;
Future work is recommended to validate the PV/T performance equation using real empirically derived data for a range of collector designs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A thermal conductive heating (TCH) pilot test was conducted at the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) in West Trenton, New Jersey in 2009 in collaboration with TerraTherm, Inc., the Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center and the United States Geological Survey. The NAWC site was historically used as a jet engine testing facility from the mid-1950s to the late 1990s. During this time, the subsurface was contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) which was a common solvent used at the facility. The pilot test consisted of 15 heater/extraction wells installed to a depth of 16.8 m in weathered mudstone and operated for 102 days. Rock core samples were taken pre- and post-remediation to measure the initial TCE concentrations and evaluate the effect the TCH pilot test had. The data collected during the pilot test was used to create a two-dimensional (2D) finite difference model using TMVOC. TMVOC is part of the TOUGH 2 family of codes and is a numerical model that is capable of simulating multiphase flow, heat transfer and transport of volatile organic compounds in three-dimensional heterogenous porous media or fractured rock. &#xD;
&#xD;
The 2D model was used as a screening model to investigate TCE removal from the rock matrix when heating for 100 days with a similar heating pattern to what was employed at the NAWC site. The numerical domain incorporated three primary fractures with competent bedrock in between. As the test pilot was conducted in the weathered bedrock zone, a sensitivity analysis was first completed on the matrix permeability to help to match the TCE removal from the pilot test. The pilot test had a 63.5% removal of TCE from the study area compared to 67% from the baseline model. A limited sensitivity analysis was completed which investigated how the matrix porosity and rate of energy application would have on the success of TCE removal from the rock matrix. It revealed that the TCE removal increases with increased matrix porosity and increased rate of energy application.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines technological and social mechanisms of British imperial water control as created and managed by British irrigation engineers in Egypt between 1882 and 1914. In the aftermath of the British military conquest of the Ottoman colony, irrigation engineering was lauded as a way to make Egypt prosperous and financially solvent through the growth and sale of cash-crop cotton on the global market. The irrigation engineers who transferred into Egypt in the wake of the British occupation to enact this revivification of irrigation were Indian-experienced military engineers; these Royal Engineers officers and their British superiors in Egypt and the Foreign Office enacted the principles of late nineteenth century liberal economy, including the construction of large-scale public works. &#xD;
 	The British engineers imported their Indian experiences when they transferred to the Egyptian Irrigation Department. Their engineering epistemologies included economic frugality, an emphasis and reliance on hydraulic science, and skepticism of the viability of local irrigation practices. Permanent dams were built or reconstructed across the Nile at Cairo (Delta Barrage, 1887-1890) and at Aswan (Aswan Dam, 1898-1902). With these structures, among other major projects, the engineers created a system of water control that extended their abilities to manage the Nile and local irrigation practices. Always chaotic, contingent, and geographically and temporally specific, the engineers forced Egyptian peasants, cash crop cotton, and the Nile into the interconnected web of politics, economics, and science that was transnational British imperialism.</dcterms:abstract>
