      <dcterms:abstract>Habits are defined as a form of automatic, spontaneous behaviours that are initiated following exposure to contextual cues. Although habits have been a focus of research for health, social, and consumer psychologists for many years, the literature has overwhelmingly relied on explicit, self-reports to measure habits. This is despite the fact that such measures require deliberative processing, and that individuals are frequently unable to consciously reflect on their spontaneous behaviours in order to accurately respond to self-report measures. To address concerns with self-report measures of habit, I have developed an implicit measure of habit strength: The Habit IAT. The purpose of this study was to validate an implicit measure of habit strength by investigating hand washing, a common habitual behaviour. One-hundred-and-sixty-six undergraduate students completed implicit measures of hand hygiene habit strength (Habit IAT) and attitudes toward hand hygiene (attitude IAT), as well as explicit measures of hand hygiene frequency, hand hygiene habits and attitudes, general self-efficacy, regulatory focus, and the big-five personality dimensions. The Habit IAT and attitude IAT had moderate and good internal consistency, α = .66 and α = .78, respectively. Correlational analyses indicated the Habit IAT was unrelated to an implicit measure of attitudes toward hand hygiene, providing some evidence of discriminant validity for the Habit IAT. In addition, Habit IAT and attitude IAT scores were unrelated to self-report measures of hand hygiene frequency, habit strength, and attitudes. Exploratory analyses were conducted to investigate moderation effects on the relationship between self-reported frequency of hand hygiene, habit strength, and attitudes on Habit IAT and attitude IAT scores. Although this study provides evidence of discriminant validity for the Habit IAT, it is limited by not investigating the ability of Habit IAT scores to predict observed hand hygiene behaviour. Design considerations for the development of future implicit measures of habit are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease that leads to the paralysis of voluntary muscles used for walking, talking, eating and breathing. There is no cure for ALS and current treatments, including exercise therapies, are extremely limited (Kiernan et al., 2011). The first of two studies presented herein aimed to examine the tolerance and training effects of modified sprint interval training (SIT) for people with ALS. Despite an available population and persistent efforts, one participant completed the training study over eighteen months. For this individual, SIT was well tolerated acutely and chronically, and functional capacity and aerobic fitness were unchanged following six weeks of home-based SIT training. The inability to recruit sufficient participants for this intervention trial called into question how individuals living with ALS negotiate exercise and barriers to participation. A second study guided by interpretive phenomenology used in-depth interviews to better understand how everyday experiences of living with ALS impact the ways individuals with ALS engaged with physical activity and exercise. From the subjective accounts of seven men and women living with ALS in Southeastern Ontario, three major themes were identified: 1) living in a changing body, 2) environmental access and 3) the (f)utility of exercise, which speak to the complex process of negotiating the value of exercise for a body that is progressively and incurably deteriorating. Findings suggest there is immense variability and individuality amongst people with ALS and their experiences and attitudes towards physical activity and exercise. Numerous physical, psychological and environmental barriers were also found to be common to people with ALS and may serve as targets to be addressed by future customized exercise interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The Ontario Internationally Educated Physical Therapy Bridging (OIEPB) program was designed to help internationally educated physiotherapists (IEPTs) increase their success at entering practice in Canada.  The learners (IEPTs) in the OIEPB program undertake two clinical internships, at which they are assessed by preceptors using the Canadian Physiotherapy Assessment of Clinical Performance (ACP).  Our overall goal was to understand the professional competencies and deficiencies in IEPTs as they attempt to integrate into the Canadian physiotherapist workforce. &#xD;
Methods: Phase 1 was a review of literature to explore the experiences of internationally educated healthcare professionals in their new country; data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis, mapped to the professional competency roles. Phases 2 and 3 were secondary analyses of the data in learners' ACP forms. Phase 2: we descriptively analyzed the scores in the ACP forms. Phase 3: we employed deductive direct content analysis to describe the content of the comment sections of the ACP forms. &#xD;
Results: For phase 1, 13 studies were included. Communicator role was the most frequently discussed role. Cultural-language and confidence deficits contributed to deficiencies in roles and competencies among IEHPs. For phase 2, most of the 61 learners' scores indicated entry-level performance for 18 of 21 ACP items at the end of both internships. Most IEPTs (84%) either had high scores throughout or had improvements from lower scores to at least 'advanced intermediate' performance level at the end of the second internship. For phase 3, 100 learners’ comment sections were analyzed. Professional conduct and professional practice were the two central themes, with 11 categories for areas of strength (4) and areas of weakness (7). &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: Most IEPTs showed a progressive improvement in their clinical education performance across internships as judged by ACP scores. Areas of strength included subjective assessment, treatment delivery, patient confidentiality, and inter-professional respect. Areas of weakness included objective assessment, setting SMART goals, logical clinical reasoning, communication, confidence, time management and patient safety. The findings about IEPTs in the OIEPB program are partially congruent with the literature in showing the importance of cultural-language competency and confidence in fulfilling professional roles.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study explored the subject area literacy knowledge and beliefs of five pre-service secondary school teachers in a Bachelor of Education program at a university in Eastern Ontario. It explored the factors that informed the development of participants’ thinking about subject area literacy, including their conceptualizations of how to integrate literacy into their subject area classrooms, and their reactions to a text-based activity that used both a researcher-selected and a participant-selected text selection. Participants represented three teachable subject areas, including history, mathematics, and English.&#xD;
Subject area literacy is an important concept in adolescent literacy, as secondary school classes require advanced skills for successful completion. Each subject area has its own inherent structures and knowledge bases that one must understand to be successful in that area. These contribute to how successfully one interacts with subject area texts, but do not necessarily transfer between subject areas. Research posits that subject area teachers must explicitly instruct students in “reading to learn,” which was how this study conceptualized literacy.&#xD;
Participants completed semi-structured interviews that included a text-based activity. Participants were asked to engage with two subject area texts to explore how they believed students would interact with the text, and the support they anticipated students might need to “read to learn” from the text. These interviews resulted in data about pre-service secondary school teachers’ understandings about subject area literacy; how they would integrate literacy into their teaching; the factors that contributed to their thinking about subject-specific literacy; and their understandings about the use of text within their classrooms. These findings could have implications for teacher-education program instructors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives: To examine the association between lifetime caffeine intake and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) overall, according to tumour behaviour (invasive vs. borderline), and by invasive tumour type (Type I vs. Type II) and to assess menopausal status as an effect modifier. Methods: The PRevention of OVArian Cancer in Quebec (PROVAQ) study is a population-based case-control study that was conducted in Montreal (2011-2016). A total of 497 cases and 904 controls reported lifetime consumption of caffeinated beverages and other variables through in-person interviews. Lifetime average daily caffeine intake values were calculated for each participant and unconditional multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) to describe the association between quartiles of caffeine intake and risk of EOC. A hybrid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and change-in-estimate (CIE) procedure determined variables for statistical adjustment. Polytomous logistic regression was used for associations by tumour behaviour and invasive cancer type. Results: Results did not provide strong evidence of an association between lifetime caffeine consumption and overall EOC risk. The adjusted odds ratios (with 95% CIs) for the highest versus lowest quartile of caffeine intake were 1.21 (0.85-1.70) for overall EOC; 1.32 (0.90-1.94) for invasive EOC; and 0.99 (0.54-1.80) for borderline EOC. Further review indicated a suggestive trend of increasing risk with increasing quartile of caffeine consumption for invasive cases, although no such trend was seen for borderline cases. There was no appreciable difference in risk between Type I and Type II tumours. Stratification according to menopausal status yielded ORs that differed in direction and magnitude, however results were statistically non-significant (interaction p-value = 0.09). Further analyses by specific caffeinated drink types generally indicated non-significant results; yet, cola consumption elevated risk for overall, invasive, and invasive Type II EOC at certain consumption categories. Conclusions: Results did not demonstrate a pattern of association between lifetime caffeine intake and EOC risk and there was no strong evidence of menopausal status acting as an effect modifier. Additional drink type analyses indicate that cola intake may increase EOC risk. Further research with increased sample size may be warranted.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic pelvic pain condition with an unknown etiology and biomedical treatment outcomes for IC/BPS are poor. Catastrophizing and depression have been implicated in negative outcomes in patients with chronic pelvic pain (e.g., diminished mental and/or physical quality of life, greater pain and disability). The literature has suggested that pain, catastrophizing, depression, and disability are associated variables, but investigations on how they are associated remain to be conducted. Linton and Bergbom (2011) have created a theoretical pathway model that can be used to connect pain, catastrophizing, depression, and disability through an emotion regulation framework. Using the biopsychosocial model, and the Örebro Model of Emotion Regulation for Pain as theoretical frameworks, the primary aim of this study is to examine whether both catastrophizing and difficulties in emotion regulation mediate the relationship between pain and depression/pain-related disability in an IC/BPS sample with serial mediation models. A total of 225 women diagnosed with IC/BPS recruited from tertiary care clinics in Canada and the U.S. completed questionnaires regarding demographics, pain, catastrophizing, emotion regulation, depression, and pain related disability across twelve months. Catastrophizing and difficulties in emotion regulation were found to mediate the relationship between pain and depression/pain-related disability. The longitudinal models were not significant, which might suggest that these psychological actions are stable over time. The relationships between pain, catastrophizing, difficulties in emotion regulation, depression, and disability are discussed in the framework of chronic pain literature, as well as clinical implications, limitations, and areas for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This participatory and community-based research project aims to foster hope and healing for Aboriginal people whose lives have been affected directly by the Criminal Justice System (CJS).  In this project, I recorded the experiences, views, and stories shared by Aboriginal participants to shed new light on the conditions of power that inform their experiences and to create opportunities restory their histories in ways that might foster growth and healing. This restorying circle project is committed to three connected objectives: first, to enable Aboriginal people involved with the CJS to improve their lives; second, to create greater awareness of colonial impediments to justice for Aboriginal people by fostering counter-narratives to the prevailing political rhetoric that we need ‘more jails’ in Canada to lock up the ‘bad guys’; and third, to create new culturally safe models for politically engaged healing. &#xD;
	The restorying circles designed for this project placed Aboriginal men impacted by the CJS in dialogue with other Aboriginal men who had endured similar experiences. The restorying circles adopted an approach similar to that of the sharing circles utilized in many cultural and spiritual ceremonies within Aboriginal communities. These restorying circles were adapted to serve the needs of Aboriginal former inmates who have varying levels of traditional knowledge, spiritual connection, and cultural experience. &#xD;
  This project demonstrates the continued need for culturally supportive practices for Aboriginal people involved with the CJS, a need that is particularly acute in urban centers. The project also suggests that Aboriginal people involved with the CJS benefit from the spiritual connections and cultural support enabled within the restorying environment. Furthermore, the project shows how socio-economic factors played a significant role in the paths of these Aboriginal men towards the CJS. In this dissertation, I contend that restorying circles foreground the agency of participants, foster a sense of community that is often lacking for these individuals, and offer opportunities to imagine alternatives to the stories these men have often heard about themselves. The stories created and shared by the participants offer alternatives to disempowerment and criminalization, and they propose a healthier pathway for other Aboriginal people.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Contemporary culture is in the process of revitalizing the memory of Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald, an early twentieth-century American author, painter, and dancer, conventionally known as the Queen of the Jazz Age and dubbed the “First American Flapper” by her husband, novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald (Cline 1), and frequently remembered more for her struggles with mental illness than her artistic output. At its core, this dissertation is interested in the way that psychomedical discourses shape the construction of a public artistic self, and Part One turns to a burgeoning literary celebrity—one of the most prominent innovations in public life of the early-twentieth century—in order to argue that modernist authorship and celebrity alike depend on masculinist constructions of a virtual, agential, authorial subject. Part Two looks to a flurry of novelistic renarrativizations of Zelda Fitzgerald’s life in early twenty-first century middlebrow literature, identifying in this publishing event a historiographic impulse to renegotiate the cultural memory of a figure who has become paradigmatic both as celebrity and as patient. This reconsideration, Part Two argues, constructs itself as a compassionate exercise, and in so doing demands that middlebrow authors in some way achieve justice through the sympathetic and repeated retelling of these stories. As constructions of authorship also require the construction of a readership, this project suggests that the core function of compassion asks readers and authors alike to in some way turn compassionate feeling into an ethical orientation towards their own societies. As the movement to destigmatize mental illness has seen increasing cultural prevalence in the first decade and a half of the twenty-first century, the question of what compassionate writing about Zelda Fitzgerald prompts readers to do is more important than ever.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The concept of fountain codes has gained considerable attention in the past few years due to its simplicity, reliability, and feasibility. Nowadays, fountain codes are used in many applications including, but not limited to, data storage, data broadcasting, and point-to-point communications. While traditional fountain codes achieve the channel capacity over the binary erasure channel universally and asymptotically, they offer much room for improvement over other channels, architectures, and regimes. With the development of new technologies for smart cities and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data transmission methodologies with arguably the highest level of flexibility and adaptability are required. With these technologies, the end users have a very diverse set of capabilities in terms of memory, power, and processing. Besides,&#xD;
the end users are connected via a wide range of links with various qualities and capacities. As a result, the required methodologies must provide a comprehensive solution whereby voice, data, and streamed multimedia can be provided to users on an anytime-anywhere basis. Also, they must enable a dense network of nodes with very different capabilities to communicate with each other reliably and efficiently.&#xD;
This thesis focuses on the design of state-of-the-art data transmission methodology with one of the highest levels of flexibility and adaptability. We present a novel fountain-based encoding technique using overlapped generations of Luby-transform (LT) codes. The proposed overlapped LT (OLT) codes provide more degrees of freedom and better trade-offs for the rateless-coded system parameters. They are highly energy-efficient, scalable, and robust. First, we design new LT codes that are robust to the communication system's parameters such as erasure probability as well as the source length. Density&#xD;
evolution (DE), extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart, and code stability are used to design the parameters of fountain codes with different objectives. The main objectives are: maximizing the code rate, minimizing the bit erasure probability (BEP), and maximizing erasure threshold. Secondly, we propose OLT codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC) as well as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel to improve the performance in terms of error probability and code rate. Our analysis shows that by using OLT codes, significant gains in error probability and code rate are obtained. In addition, we show that OLT codes require a smaller number of operations to recover the source data compared with conventional LT codes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background/Rationale: Working in non-standard shifts (i.e. nights, evenings) can disrupt circadian function, and this disruption can influence hormone levels that may affect ovarian cancer risk. Few studies have examined the relationship between shift work and ovarian cancer risk, thus, more research is required in this area. The association between shift work exposure and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk, as well as risk according to tumour behaviour (borderline, invasive) and invasive cancer type (Type I, Type II) was investigated. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: In a population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal, Canada (2011-2016), lifetime occupational histories for 496 incident EOC cases and 906 controls were collected in a face-to-face interview. Controls were identified from the Quebec Electoral List and frequency-matched to cases on five-year age groups and electoral district. Shift work exposure for each participant was assessed using three metrics: cumulative exposure, night shift frequency, and night shift intensity. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between shift work exposure metric categories and overall EOC risk. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate associations by EOC subgroup. Associations were also examined for potential effect modification by chronotype and menopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Over half of cases (53.4%) and controls (51.7%) ever worked shifts that included evenings and/or nights during their lifetime. There was no strong evidence of an association between shift work exposure metrics and overall EOC risk, or by EOC subgroups, where the OR for the highest cumulative exposure tertile vs. never working shifts was 1.20 (95% CI: 0.89-1.63) for overall EOC risk. Tests for multiplicative interaction were not significant for chronotype or menopausal status, however, associations were suggested to vary among chronotypes. Additional analyses regarding cumulative exposure to specific shift timings or schedules indicated no strong association with EOC risk. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Study findings do not provide support for the relationship between shift work exposure and EOC risk. As only three epidemiological studies have been published looking at this association, further investigation is warranted.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Thapsigargin is a complex, densely oxygenated guaianolide, which functions as a selective and irreversible subnanomolar inhibitor of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases.  Importantly, a prodrug of this natural product, mipsagargin, is currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of multiple cancers.  Nevertheless, the limited availability of the material from natural sources, coupled with an estimated demand of one metric ton per annum, provides a compelling mandate to develop a practical total synthesis of this agent.  This thesis describes the development of a concise, efficient and scalable total synthesis of thapsigargin and related natural products, and it is divided into four chapters.  &#xD;
Chapter 1 provides an account of thapsigargin including its isolation, biosynthetic pathway, biological activity, and focuses on the previously reported strategies towards the synthesis of thapsigargin natural products.  &#xD;
Chapter 2 describes our synthetic efforts towards the total synthesis of thapsigargin by using a rhodium-catalyzed [(3+2)+2] carbocyclization reaction as the key step.  This strategy enabled the rapid construction of the highly functionalized guaianolide skeleton present in thapsigargin.  &#xD;
Chapter 3 describes the successful route towards the total synthesis of thapsigargin by using an enantioselective ketone alkylation and a diastereoselective pinacol/lactonization cascade as the key steps.  Our synthetic strategy is inspired by nature’s carbon−carbon bond formation sequence, which facilitates the construction of a highly functionalized guaianolide skeleton in five steps.  Overall, the total synthesis of thapsigargin was accomplished in 12 steps and with 5.8% overall yield from the commercially available (R)-(−)-carvone.&#xD;
Chapter 4 discusses our ongoing work on the synthesis of other members of thapsigargin natural products, which is exemplified by the completion of the total synthesis of nortrilobolide in 10 steps and with 13.3% overall yield from the commercially available (R)-(−)-carvone.  The divergent nature of our strategy should permit the rapid preparation of all the members of thapsigargins and a library of simplified thapsigargin analogs for detailed structure−activity relationship studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Following in the footsteps of Karl Schmidt’s 1967 article, Keltisches Wortgut im Lateinischen, and J.P. Wild’s 1970, Borrowed Names for Borrowed Things?, this thesis examines a total of twenty-one Gallic lexical items that were borrowed by the Latin language during the period of Roman hegemony over the whole of Gaul and, from that point, discusses whether the borrowing of these terms is proof of corresponding instances of cultural diffusion.  In an effort to examine lexical and cultural integration in tandem, this study has selected terms from three semantic categories of material culture, specifically ‘food and drink’, ‘clothing’, and ‘wheeled vehicles’, and uses contextual evidence from the literary record to gauge the integration levels of the terms within both the Latin language and Roman culture.  As a result, this thesis not only reveals much valuable information pertaining to both lexical and cultural integration, but also the effect which factors like perceived social status and the search of prestige had on the entire process.  Furthermore, as a form of linguistic archaeology, this study succeeds in reconstructing certain aspects of Celtic culture which may have otherwise been lost to the passage of time.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
Purpose&#xD;
	Physical activity, sedentary behaviour (SB) and sleep have traditionally been studied as independent behaviours and not as co-dependent behaviours that are compositional in nature. This study used compositional data analyses to investigate the co-dependent relationships between time spent in movement behaviours (sleep, SB, light intensity physical activity (LIPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity MVPA)) and obesity among children. &#xD;
Methods&#xD;
	434 children aged 10-13 years were studied. Participants wore an Actical accelerometer for 7 days to determine time spent in SB, LIPA, and MVPA. Time spent sleeping was determined from the accelerometer and a log. The outcomes of interest were the body mass index, waist circumference, and fat mass index. Compositional data analysis was used to examine associations. This involved transforming the movement behaviours using an isometric log ratio transformation, using regression to model the associations, and back-transforming the regression coefficients to estimate how displacing time from one movement behaviour with another influenced the obesity measures.&#xD;
Results&#xD;
	The composition of movement behaviours was associated with all three obesity measures (p&lt;0.001). Relative to the other movement behaviours, time spent in MVPA was negatively associated with the obesity measures (p&lt;0.01), time spent in LIPA was positively associated with the obesity measures (p&lt;0.05), while time spent in SB and sleep were not associated with the obesity measures. The most meaningful time displacements were for MVPA, and these displacements were larger at lower MVPA levels. For example, reallocating 10 minutes of MVPA to 10 minutes of LIPA was associated with a 2.7% (95% CI: 2.4, 2.8), 2.0% (95% CI: 1.8, 2.1), and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.4,1.6) increase in BMI z-score at the 25th, mean, and 75th MVPA percentiles, respectively. &#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
	The composition of movement behaviours across the day was associated with the obesity measures. The displacement of time from MVPA to LIPA were associated with the most significant changes in the obesity measures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Growth and development is controlled by specific sets of gene products (proteins and RNAs),  forming  metabolic and developmental pathways. Mutations in these genes can result in abnormal growth of cells, leading to diseases such as cancer. "Phosphatase and tensin homolog" (PTEN) is one of the main proteins that control developmental and growth processes in humans. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, DAF-18 is the homolog of PTEN. At the L1 larval stage, worms use an insulin-like signalling pathway to detect the availability of nutrients. DAF-18 is an antagonist of the insulin signalling pathway and is essential in maintaining quiescence during L1 arrest. Insulin-like peptides bind to the insulin receptor triggering a signal transduction pathway, which inhibits a transcription factor (DAF-16/FOXO) from entering the nucleus and activating the transcription of stress resistance genes. In L1 arrest, wild-type worms can survive up to 22 days without food. We and others have shown that daf-16 mutants show a decreased survival of 13 days in L1 arrest while daf-18 mutants can only survive up to 3-4 days. This discrepancy in time suggests that although DAF-18 is upstream of DAF-16, DAF-18 has additional functions essential in maintaining L1 arrest and L1 is, in part, independent of DAF-16 signalling. The aim of this study is to identify a potential alternate DAF-18 pathway, which works independently of DAF-16 and plays a crucial role in L1 survival. I predict that over- or under-expressing genes downstream of daf-18 in the alternate pathway will allow the daf-18 mutant worms to live longer than 4 days. I was able to isolate two suppressors through EMS screening, that can enhance the survival up to almost wild type even when DAF-18 is mutated and are possible members of alternate pathway. I also studied the effect of DAF-2 on L1 arrest with somatic daf-18 rescue. From Yeast Two-Hybrid screens, I isolated multiple possible interactors of DAF-18. The discovery of a new pathway will provide a better understanding of larval growth and development in C. elegans. Moreover, these findings could identify genes that  play major roles in control of cellular growth and the development of cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>singly high, especially in important areas or pedestrian-heavy environments. As&#xD;
a result, planning of public spaces has started to shift towards more preventative&#xD;
measures of urban design to protect the public realm in some of the most vulnerable&#xD;
areas to these attacks. On the other hand, important buildings have also started to&#xD;
implement similar hardening and security features through environmental design. In&#xD;
response to these implementations, buildings of importance have been using a physicalstructure&#xD;
based approach at planning urban spaces through Crime Prevention through&#xD;
Environmental Design (CPTED) and Anti-Terrorism (AT) planning.&#xD;
This research project examined the links between Crime Prevention through&#xD;
Environmental Design (CPTED), Antiterrorism planning (AT) and its integration into the&#xD;
urban environment of two embassies on the ceremonial Confederation Boulevard in the&#xD;
downtown core of Ottawa, ON. The two embassies include the British High Commission&#xD;
and the US Embassy, both located near Parliament Hill. The objective of the study was&#xD;
to examine each embassy’s use of security and CPTED, identify the embassy that better&#xD;
integrates security and CPTED with the surrounding urban environment and create a set&#xD;
of recommendations based on these findings. The research used evaluation criteria&#xD;
established through CPTED principles and Anti-Terrorism literature and government&#xD;
reports.&#xD;
A site audit of the integrated security features of both sites was conducted in the Fall of&#xD;
2016 and the Spring of 2017. The findings from the audit revealed some of the security&#xD;
features and integration issues on both sites. This research project promotes the use of security features in a way that better&#xD;
integrates with the current community design and security practices in Canada’s Capital&#xD;
Region. Furthermore, it outlines strengths and weaknesses of the current systems used.&#xD;
It highlighted the role of security planners to take into account the effect the security&#xD;
features have on the surrounding environment to make decisions that would reduce the&#xD;
fear of crime, but also reduce crime opportunity. Through good planning and urban&#xD;
design, these spaces could be managed effectively and more seamlessly integrate&#xD;
themselves into the surrounding land uses to have a low-profile building with an&#xD;
abundance of physical security.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common orthopedic injuries (Sanders et al., 2016). Following reconstruction of the ACL a patient must be medically cleared before returning to full participation in sport or activities. The single-leg hop for distance test is one that is used to help determine a patient’s readiness to return to sport. A patient will pass this test if they achieve ≥90% symmetry in distance jumped with each leg, although this does not always mean that the limbs are working in the same way to achieve this symmetrical distance. Therefore, this study hoped to find other measures that could be added to strengthen the single-leg hop for distance test.&#xD;
Kinematic and kinetic data were collected on 24 control participants and 6 ACL reconstructed (ACLR) participants as they performed the single-leg hop for distance test. Participants were asked to jump as far as they could, taking-off from one foot and landing on two. Hop distances were measured to calculate the hop distance limb symmetry index (LSI). Joint angular velocity and joint power were calculated at the hip, knee and ankle, but only the take-off portion of the hop was used for statistical analyses. A logistic regression was performed to predict participant group membership using knee joint power. &#xD;
All controls and ACLR participants achieved a 90% hop distance LSI. Although all participants achieved ≥90% LSI, not all participants were symmetrical across all joints. Two participants, 1 ACLR and 1 control had knee power correlations less than 0.4, and even though their power correlation scores were low, their joint angular velocity correlations were higher. The logistic regression classified 1 control and 1 ACLR as ACLRs, while everyone else was classified as a control, although it was not significant.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Anhedonia is one of the defining features of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and may be characteristic of an especially severe depression. Because MDD is highly heterogeneous, anhedonia may represent an easier target for research on how childhood maltreatment is associated with MDD and anhedonia and on the underlying mechanisms of dysfunction within this disorder. The goal of the current study is to test the hypothesis that the association between childhood maltreatment and anhedonia is mediated by two endophenotypes: (a) blunted neuroendocrine response to stress, and (b) blunted responsivity to reward. Further, consistent with the related neurobiological underpinnings of threat and reward systems, we hypothesize that in our full sample, individual differences in stress reactivity will be correlated with individual differences in reward responsivity. The current study includes 89 adults (39 with MDD, 47 non-depressed) who were well-characterized in terms of their diagnostic and symptom profiles, and who participated in a laboratory stress challenge (the Trier Social Stress Task; TSST) and a computerized Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT). Our hypothesized mediation model was not supported by the results. However, I did find that blunted reward learning was correlated with blunted stress reactivity. Further, different forms of childhood maltreatment were preferentially associated with different symptoms of anhedonia. Contrary to hypotheses, I also found that within the depressed group, childhood maltreatment, depression severity, and anhedonia were positively correlated with response bias on the PRT. Also contrary to hypotheses, within the depressed group stress reactivity was positively associated with anhedonic symptoms, although these results were not statistically significant. Although our overall model was not supported by the results, my findings suggest that reward responsivity, stress reactivity, and anhedonia remain important research targets in understanding the etiology of MDD. These findings also help to shed light on the negative outcomes associated with childhood maltreatment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neuropathic pain is defined as “pain caused by a lesion or disease of the nervous system”. Neuropathic pain conditions are estimated to affect up to 8% of the population worldwide and presently, the most common treatment strategies are often ineffective. Opioids, for example, are a “last effort” treatment which, when used properly, are only effective at reducing pain, on average, by 20-30%. Treatment with opioids however, is problematic not only because of the large number of side effects but also because of the high risk of developing tolerance and/or addiction. Thus, new therapeutic options are required to treat neuropathic and other chronic pain conditions. Clinical studies have recently demonstrated that patients with chronic neuropathic pain often exhibit circadian fluctuations in pain intensity, with patients reporting significantly higher levels of pain in the evening than during the day. We therefore sought to understand whether a link exists between circadian rhythms and somatosensory activity using a mouse model. To this end, we used standard behavioural assays to measure mechanical and thermal sensitivity in both male and female, naïve and nerve-injured C57BL/6J mice at different times of the day. We found a circadian pattern only in the heat sensitivity of naïve animals, with mice displaying a higher sensitivity at 9am than at 9pm. Pharmacological characterization of this pattern by intraplantar injection of capsaicin suggests that the observed rhythm may be modulated by the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel, as mice displayed a higher level of sensitivity when injected at 9am than at 9pm. Nerve-injured males were found to display a circadian rhythm in mechanical sensitivity (they were more sensitive at 9am than at 9pm), while the female data remains inconclusive. These results provide evidence that mice display a modality-specific circadian rhythm of pain. Future studies will be required to expand on these findings and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the circadian control of pain, both naïve and after injury. The robust rhythm observed, however, does provide a foundation upon which future studies can build, with the hope of translating this research from bench to bedside.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Since the point of first contact, Indigenous women on Turtle Island have been actively resisting colonial gendered violence. Their organizing reached a watershed moment in the 1970s when many women came together to cohesively resist the enshrined racism and sexism within Indian Affairs policy and legislation. This early organizing was seen as Indigenous women “waking up to their [traditional] responsibilities” (Maracle, 2003, p. 75), which ultimately spurred the creation of organizations that specifically support Indigenous women and their issues. Today, Indigenous women’s organizational and organizing work continues to grow at rapid rates, which underscores the important role that they play in advancing the rights of Indigenous women and promoting the well-being of their communities. Yet, despite the significant amount of work Indigenous women carry out, they continue to experience intricate challenges organizing due to the settler colonial state they are operating within, where they have been persistently excluded, silenced and surveilled. This thesis will interrogate these challenges that Indigenous women face when they organize. This will be done through exploring Indigenous women’s experiences through a settler colonial governmentality lens that centres Indigenous women’s perspectives. The utilization of this framework will reveal that the settler colonial state is threatened by the existence of Indigenous women and therefore uses governmentality tactics to maintain power and control over them and their work. At the same time, it will also be demonstrated that Indigenous women’s organizations and organizers courageously confront these challenges so that they can continue to support Indigenous women, girls and their communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Illuminating the adaptive nature of animal behaviours is a major goal of evolutionary biology, and the fitness consequences for many behaviours have been well-documented. Animal personality research seeks to achieve this goal by first integrating multiple behaviours into a single ‘personality’ trait, but it has been argued that this approach offers no additional value to the traditional methods of assessing multiple, isolated behaviours as potential predictors of fitness. In this study, I measure seven behavioural traits in male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to determine the consistency of those behaviours within individuals and contexts, and to investigate how well these traits predict social dominance, measured as aggressive interactions between males, in a feeding context. This study was designed to compare directly with previous results from a study of female zebra finches that investigated the relationship between behaviour and social dominance from a personality perspective. I found that while the analysis of personality suggests that there is no association between behaviour and social dominance, the analysis of individual behaviours reveals that several behaviours significantly predict social dominance in males. Females similarly show no association between personality and social dominance when the latter is measured as aggressive interactions between females, but it is possible that evaluation of multiple, isolated behaviours would reveal a different pattern in females, as well. I conclude that the study of individual behavioural traits, rather than integrated personality traits, is probably more useful for evaluating the adaptive significance of behaviours, and provides results that are much easier to interpret and compare among different studies and species.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Safe, efficient, and comfortable travel has always been a fundamental human necessity. From reducing commute time to saving lives, autonomous vehicles promise to be an indispensable tool in the age of modern urban transportation. However, implementing such a disruptive technology comes with significant challenges, a major one being accurate vehicle positioning and localization.&#xD;
In situations such as urban cores, parking lots, and under dense foliage, positioning information provided by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) deteriorates significantly. GNSS is increasingly integrated with other systems such as the inertial navigation system (INS) and Visual Odometry (VO) to bridge these outages. The major drawback of current integration systems is that they are unable to provide a stable navigation estimate during extended and frequent GNSS outages, situations common to autonomous vehicles.&#xD;
To improve the overall system accuracy, this thesis presents a multi-sensor navigation solution that integrates GNSS with a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and VO. Firstly, a switching architecture is detailed, which implements a loosely coupled extended Kalman filter (EKF) that fuses VO updates only when GPS is unavailable, reducing computational resources while limiting the errors inherent in an INS. Secondly, termed R-AVO (Reduced - Aided Visual Odometry), the orientation and translation of a vehicle, as determined by a low drift INS algorithm, is used to evaluate which feature matches from the processed image frames are to be considered in VO. This method is shown to be both more accurate and less computationally expensive than classic feature outlier rejection schemes, which are iterative in nature. Reducing the computation complexity of VO paves the way for even more sensors to be utilized by a vehicle.&#xD;
The developed algorithms are evaluated on several real road trajectories, including simulated outages that are as long as 10 minutes. To ensure generic implementations, two different land vehicles are used in the trajectories and two different IMUs are tested.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Prison for Women (P4W) in Kingston, Ontario was the sole federal prison for Canadian women throughout the majority of the twentieth century. As such, studying P4W represents a comprehensive study of Canadian women’s incarceration, which is unique in Canadian prison history in comparison to men’s institutions. This thesis explores the educational history of P4W from 1934-1965 to examine what opportunities were afforded to incarcerated women and to reveal the intentions of the Penitentiary Service in their provision of education. &#xD;
	This thesis argues that education at P4W intended to reform incarcerated women into models of respectable womanhood. This project relies on archival documents from the Correctional Service of Canada fonds at Library and Archives Canada, files from the Public Safety Library Archives, the Isabel J. Macneill fonds from the Nova Scotia Archives, and prisoner press publications. To frame this research, this thesis takes a blended functionalist and narrative approach to legal history to underscore that the development of education in P4W followed the development of education in Ontario, and that narratives are required to appreciate P4W’s gendered educational history. P4W’s education is contextualized by Chapter One, which provides an overview of imprisonment in English Canadian history.&#xD;
	To further deepen analysis, education has been separated and organized into three categories: academic, vocational, and recreational. Chapter Two analyzes academic education and reveals that incarcerated women’s education relied heavily on correspondence courses. This reliance resulted in the neglect of illiterate women’s education until 1949 when the first teacher was hired. Chapter Three analyzes vocational education and presents the narrow options that incarcerated women had for employment. Chapter Four analyzes recreational education which explores what types of activities incarcerated women were allowed to participate in outside of their daily prison employment. Each of these chapters conclude that incarcerated women in P4W were offered educational programs that reinforced ideas and behaviours associated with respectable womanhood.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ethnic identity of the ancient Macedonians continues to be the most debated subject within Macedonian historiography. The debate has fixated on a simple question: were the Macedonians Greeks, or a separate ethnic group? Rather than attempting to trace the exact origins of the Macedonians – an exceedingly difficult task in dealing with any ancient people – this thesis will focus on the ethnic presentation of the Macedonians: how do the ancient literary sources identify the Macedonians? How did the Macedonians identify themselves? What factors shaped the Greeks’ perspectives towards the Macedonian kings and their people? How much can we reasonably infer about the Macedonians’ ethnic self-perception and identification in the absence of their own literary testimony? This thesis will seek to answer these essential questions by providing a comprehensive analysis of the relevant ancient literary sources dating from the mid-late 5th c. B.C. to the early 2nd c. A.D., devoting careful attention to all of those passages which particularly relate to the subject of Macedonian ethnic identity. It will be demonstrated that the first established ruling dynasty of Macedon, the Argeads, may be considered Greek according to both modern and ancient Greek criteria for ethnicity; they held a conscious identity as Greeks and were accepted as such at a fairly early point by the intellectual and literary elite of southern Greece. Regarding the wider Macedonian populace, however, more direct evidence is required for us to readily ascertain their sense of ethnic identity. While an ethnocultural merging of Greeks and Macedonians does appear in literature by a later point in antiquity, the Greeks of the Classical period were consistent in designating the Macedonian people as ‘barbarians.’ Although further literary evidence (especially in the form of an average Macedonian communicating their sense of ethnic self-perception) is needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn, we may perhaps best understand the Greeks and Macedonians as ethnically related yet distinct groups, gradually placed in close ethnocultural alignment by Greek writers only in the centuries following Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Near East.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inflammation causes proliferation of intestinal smooth muscle cells (ISMC), contributing to the thickened intestinal wall and the dysmotility symptoms observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A unique consequence of Crohn’s disease (CD), a subset of IBD characterized by chronic, transmural intestinal inflammation, is the formation of obstructive strictures attributable to ISMC hyperplasia. In vitro, prolonged proliferation of ISMC results in loss of their normal contractile phenotype, including decreased expression of contractile markers and the neurotrophin glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). In other diseases of smooth muscle hyperplasia, epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, affect smooth muscle phenotype and contribute to impaired tissue function. Any epigenetic role in regulating gene expression and the contractile phenotype of ISMC is unknown. &#xD;
Repeated passage ISMC were treated with trichostatin A (TSA) and 5-azacytidine (AZA), which inhibit enzymes that deacetylate histones and methylate DNA, respectively, and the outcomes on phenotype were assessed. TSA and AZA treatment decreased the enhanced growth response of repeated passage ISMC, and increased the expression of contractile markers, SMA and SM22. Repeated passage cells treated with TSA and AZA increased expression of muscarinic receptor 3, myosin light chain kinase 2, and showed an increased response to carbachol stimulation. TSA and AZA treatment also increased GDNF expression, and improved the neurotrophic function of repeated passage ISMC. Compared to low passage ISMC, repeated passage cells had increased DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) expression. ISMC from human strictures showed a decreased contractile phenotype, with increased levels of DNMT1 and HDAC5. Repeated passage human ISMC also had decreased expression of contractile markers SMA and SM22, mimicking the rat model. These findings suggest that the altered contractile phenotype of ISMC is associated with epigenetic changes, including increased DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. Furthermore, this evidence supports a potential therapeutic role for improving the contractility of ISMC, and restoring proper motility in CD patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Military families live a unique lifestyle. Mobility, separation, and risk are three important factors that distinguish military families from their civilian counterparts. Since the start of the Global War on Terror, there has become an increased interest within the United States to understand, prevent, and reduce the effects associated with living in a military family. However, since the military is a microcosm of Canadian society, there has been a lack of research that addresses military-connected children in the Canadian context. Thus, the needs of Canadian military-connected children are not fully understood. The purpose of this qualitative research is to explore how military-connected children and their unique needs are perceived by school professionals in Canadian secondary schools.                                                                                                                          &#xD;
This research followed a phenomenological research methodology to explore the perceptions of Canadian secondary school professionals of military-connected students and their unique needs. Six participants, selected via snowball sampling, participated in a single in depth, one-on-one interview. The audio data was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a general inductive approach. 							The findings suggest that Canadian secondary school professionals are generally aware of the military lifestyle. However, school professionals lack an overall awareness of how secondary schools are currently addressing and supporting the needs of military-connected children. Based on these findings, implications of the study are discussed and recommendations for future work in this field are made. This research contributes to the wider body of research regarding the educational experiences of military-connected children by offering the voices of Canadian secondary school teachers and describing how these school professionals perceive military-connected children and their needs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Kinesin-5 family members are classically known for generating outward forces that push spindle poles apart to drive bipolar spindle assembly and elongation. Kinesin-14 members contribute inward forces that pull spindle poles together and control its elongation prior to anaphase. In many eukaryotes, loss of kinesin-5 activity leads to failure of bipolar spindle formation and cell death. However, simultaneous loss of the counteracting kinesin-14 rectifies this problem and cells survive. This phenomenon led to the widely accepted “force-balance” model explaining the actions of these mitotic motor proteins in orchestrating spindle assembly. In this thesis, the cell biological studies of kinesin-5 (Kip1) and kinesin-14 (Kar3Cik1) in Candida albicans reveal distinct mechanisms of spindle assembly and stabilization. Although defective in normal progression through mitosis, kip1Δ/Δ cells are viable and can form bipolar spindles. Also unique is that simultaneous loss of Kip1 and Kar3Cik1 is lethal. Therefore, spindle force-balance is either not restored upon dual depletion of these motors, or their combined loss cannot be compensated for by other spindle-associated factors. Using time-lapse microscopy of kip1Δ/Δ cells, it was observed that many budding cells contained two bipolar spindles that often segregated independently to the mother and bud. In kip1Δ/Δ cells that had experienced cell-cycle arrest, essentially all exhibited this duplicated spindle morphology. These phenotypes imply that C. albicans predominantly employs kinesin-5 as a spindle microtubule crosslinking protein, rather than as a microtubule sliding motor needed for outward pushing force. Examination of Kip1 localization by fluorescence microscopy indicated that these putative crosslinking activities are focused at the spindle poles and at the spindle midzone. By following spindle dynamics, the spindle duplication event was established to occur at the onset of anaphase by bipolar spindle breakage at the midzone. Additionally, it appeared kip1Δ/Δ cells contained multiple clusters of chromatin. These findings imply a role of Kip1 in maintaining spindle integrity, presumably by interpolar microtubule cross-bridging. Finally, similar to kar3cik1Δ/Δ cells, kip1Δ/Δ cells are defective at mature hyphal growth. Combined with the compromised spindle function of kip1Δ/Δ cells, the lack of identifiable septa in immature hyphal compartments suggests that improper distribution of nuclear material underlies this defect.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  Mammary Prevention.3 (MAP.3) was a randomized placebo controlled trial of exemestane for breast cancer prevention. Participants commonly experienced vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes. Exemestane is ultimately eliminated through glucuronidation activity by UGT2B17; approximately 10% of Caucasians are homozygous null for the UGT2B17 gene. The UGT2B17 deletion is hypothesized to be associated with worsened vasomotor health-related quality of life (HRQL) in women randomized to exemestane.&#xD;
Objective: The thesis objectives examine the relationship between UGT2B17 genotype and 1) worsened vasomotor HRQL and 2) incident adverse vasomotor HRQL. This thesis also explores whether UGT2B17 genotype modifies the relationship between incident adverse vasomotor symptoms and early treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
Methods: MAP.3 participants completed the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) at study entry, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Multivariable modified Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to assess the association between UGT2B17 genotype and worsened vasomotor HRQL and incident adverse vasomotor HRQL, respectively. The relationship between UGT2B17 genotype, incident adverse vasomotor HRQL and early discontinuation was investigated with modified Poisson regression.&#xD;
Results: Of the 3576 MAP.3 participants, 46% experienced worsened vasomotor HRQL within 12 months. 11% of participants had the UGT2B17 homozygous deletion. The UGT2B17 deletion polymorphism was not significantly associated with worsened vasomotor HRQL (RR=1.03; 95% CI: 0.96-1.11). Additionally, there was no statistically significant association between UGT2B17 status and incident adverse vasomotor HRQL (OR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.32-1.19) or interaction with treatment (p-valueinteraction = 0.17), although the association trended towards a protective effect, particularly in the placebo group (OR=0.17; 95% CI: 0.02-1.29). Incident adverse vasomotor HRQL was significantly associated with early treatment discontinuation (RR=3.05; 95% CI: 2.28-4.07) but the UGT2B17 deletion did not modify this relationship (p-valueinteraction = 0.30).&#xD;
Conclusions: In contrast to the study hypothesis, it appears the UGT2B17 deletion polymorphism is not associated with worsened vasomotor HRQL in women randomized to exemestane. The lack of UGT2B17 activity may attenuate the effects of exemestane-induced estrogen depletion on vasomotor symptoms, via a sex steroid metabolic pathway. Further research on the UGT2B17 deletion could help clarify its role with respect to endogenous estrogen availability in women with menopause-related symptoms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone which performs over 300 biological functions, including&#xD;
those that require binding to prolactin receptor (PRL-R) in neurons within the central nervous system&#xD;
(CNS) (Bole-Feysot, Goffin, Edery, Binart, &amp; Kelly, 1998). In order to enter the CNS, circulating PRL&#xD;
must overcome the blood-brain barrier. As such, areas of the brain that do not possess a blood-brain&#xD;
barrier, such as the subfornical organ (SFO), are optimally positioned to interact with systemic PRL. The&#xD;
SFO has been classically implicated in energy and fluid homeostasis but has the potential to influence&#xD;
estrous cyclicity and gonadotropin release, which are also functions of PRL. We sought to confirm and&#xD;
characterize the expression of PRL-R in the SFO as well as identify the effects of PRL application on&#xD;
membrane excitability of dissociated SFO neurons. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we identified PRLR&#xD;
mRNA in the SFO in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. PRL-R expression did not significantly&#xD;
differ between males (n=10) and females (n=24), between juveniles (n=10) and sexually mature (n=24)&#xD;
rats, or across the estrous cycle (n=19). Patch-clamp recordings were then obtained using juvenile male&#xD;
rats to further investigate the actions of PRL at the SFO. Dissociated SFO neurons perfused with 10 pM&#xD;
to 1 μM PRL resulted in three subpopulations of neurons which either depolarized, hyperpolarized, or did&#xD;
not respond to PRL application (n=111). The proportion and magnitude of responses were independent of&#xD;
PRL concentration. Furthermore, a majority of SFO neurons showed a reduction in the transient K+&#xD;
current following PRL exposure. The stability in response to PRL and expression of PRL-R in the SFO&#xD;
suggests PRL function is conserved across physiological states and circulating PRL concentrations,&#xD;
although further studies are required to elucidate the nature of PRL function in the SFO.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Motor proteins convert chemical energy to perform mechanical work which cells require for essential activities, such as transporting cargo away from the nucleus. Kinesins are one class of molecular motors which cells use to transport various molecules or entire organelles from one location to another. They play a central role during the building of the cilium which is responsible for various activities including cell signaling. In our model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the klp-20 gene encodes a kinesin-like protein belonging to the kinesin-2 family of plus-end directed microtubule-based motor proteins. In the worm we refer to the protein encoded by the klp-20 gene as KLP-20 and the human ortholog is KIF3A, encoded by the Kif3a gene. Throughout this thesis, this kinesin motor will be represented by the C. elegans name followed by the human ortholog (KLP-20/KIF3A). There are two members of the kinesin-2 family. The first is Kinesin-II which is a heterotrimeric motor complex which consists of the KLP-20/KIF3A subunit, along with KLP-11/KIF3B and KAP-1/KAP-3. The second member is OSM-3/KIF17. Both Kinesin-II and OSM-3/KIF17 participate in a bidirectional motility transport intraflagellar transport (IFT) needed for ciliogenesis, the building of the cilium. Originally, klp-20 mutants were identified as vab-6 mutants due to their most striking bumpy body variable abnormal (Vab) phenotype. This phenotype can be rescued by expressing klp-20 pan neuronally. Null alleles of klp-11(tm324) and kap-1(ok676) do not show this Vab phenotype, suggesting that KLP-20 may have roles independent of its classical heterotrimeric complex. Expression patterns of the KLP-20 suggests the protein having a strong role in the nervous system. The aim of this study is to characterize the role of KLP-20 and understand how mutations in klp-20 causes defective epidermal morphogenesis. I predict that Kinesin-II functions along microtubules to participate in neuron development and axonal growth and I hope to understand how this could generate the abnormal epidermal phenotype. KLP-20 has a role in the development of amphid sensory neurons and mechanosensory neurons. We hope these findings will allow us to better understand the cell nonautonomous behavior of KLP-20 and ultimately the molecular processes involved in morphogenesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss and deterioration of functional abilities, but anecdotal and clinical observations suggest that many individuals with AD continue to respond in meaningful ways to music, sometimes well into the course of the disease. Previous research in the psychology and neuroscience of music has established that some music cognitive and perceptual abilities are less affected by AD than others, but it is unclear what implications these preserved abilities have for how individuals with AD engage with music in their daily lives. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the relationship between music cognition and engagement. Study 1 examined episodic, implicit, and semantic memory for melodies in participants with AD relative to older adult and younger adult control groups. AD participants showed impaired ability to form new memories for melodies, but their semantic memory for melodies was on par with that of the older and younger control participants. Study 2 addressed the need for an informant-report measure of music engagement. 35 items were created in parallel self-report and informant-report formats. Exploratory factor analysis of data from a large development sample guided the construction of six subscales, each of which showed high internal reliability. A further study showed a high correlation between self-report and informant-report versions in a sample of older adult respondents. Study 3 explored patterns of association between semantic memory for melodies, melody perception, and music engagement in a series of 15 AD cases. No single cognitive or perceptual ability was sufficient to explain cases of high music engagement. Heterogeneity between cases supports the hypothesis that there are multiple pathways by which music engagement may be sustained in those with AD. Individual cases are examined to draw out implications for basic and clinical research on music and AD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Between 1986 and 1991, missionaries “pioneered” the Hope Land base of the&#xD;
international missions organization: Youth With A Mission (YWAM). Situated just&#xD;
outside of Jinja, Uganda, the Hope Land base’s vision is “to be a training center, running&#xD;
schools accredited by YWAM’s University of the Nations,” and to be “committed to&#xD;
discipling men and women, while equipping them with the professional skills necessary&#xD;
to serve and reach the world for Christ”. Run by a small group of&#xD;
leaders, the British directors of the Hope Land base oversee a community of international&#xD;
and national students and staff, who live “To Know God and Make God Known”.&#xD;
Using data collected in qualitative interactive interviews with Ugandan women, I&#xD;
discuss the lives of a diverse group of ‘born-again’ Christian women whose lives have&#xD;
been influenced, in some way, by the work of YWAM in Uganda. Using a discussion of&#xD;
global coloniality, with particular attention given to the coloniality of power and the&#xD;
coloniality of knowledge, I consider the ways that&#xD;
hegemonic epistemic violence has worked to produce the ‘born-again’ conversion&#xD;
experiences among the women.  Inspired by Mahmood (2005) use of Foucault’s Modes of Subjectivation and Techniques of the Self, I examine the ways that ‘born-again’ women continually work&#xD;
towards their own Christian discipleship, through actively transforming their own moral&#xD;
and ethical selves. Finally, using Bhaba’s concept of Colonial Mimicry (1994), I&#xD;
present evidence that argues that the YWAM missionaries use strategic ambivalence to&#xD;
perpetuate their work in Uganda.  I argue Ugandan women resist the &#xD;
missionaries metonymizing gaze, and engage in subversive behaviors with these&#xD;
missionaries, as a means of perpetuating their access to the material benefits provided by&#xD;
YWAM.&#xD;
This project relies on women’s stories as articulations of unique knowledges. It&#xD;
acknowledges that in a neocolonized postcolonial world, asymmetries of power result in&#xD;
violent epistemic interventions that produce subjects and subjectivities marked by&#xD;
hegemonic ways of knowing. Despite this, this thesis finds that those subjectivities&#xD;
actively experience their own visceral responses to the Christian God, and as such,&#xD;
produce their own conceptions of God and their own ways of knowing about the world.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study used self-luminous high-speed photography to visualize quasi-detonation propagation and deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in a transparent round tube equipped with repeating orifice plates. Experiments were conducted in a combustion channel consisting of a 3.16 m square channel with a 7.6 cm by 7.6 cm cross-section connected to a 1.55 m cylindrical channel filled with orifice plates. Rectangular ‘fence-type’ obstacles were installed on the top and bottom of the square channel with a 3.8 cm opening between them. Two sets of orifice plates with different diameters, d, representing different blockage ratios (BR) were tested (d=5.33 cm for 50% BR and 3.81 cm for 75% BR orifice plates). &#xD;
&#xD;
Stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixtures at initial pressures of 4–60 kPa were ignited at one end of the combustion channel. Average propagation velocities were derived from shock-time-of-arrival measurements using pressure transducers in the square channel and high-speed video filmed through the round tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
As established in literature, a substantially higher orifice-diameter-to-detonation-cell-size ratio (d/λ) was observed for the 75% BR tests (d/λ=14) than the 50% BR tests (d/λ=1.4) and Peraldi’s d/λ≥1 criterion for the DDT limit. Video footage revealed that this difference may be attributed to a difference in near-limit detonation initiation modes: at 75% BR, detonation initiation occurred on the orifice face after shock reflection, whereas at 50% BR, detonation initiation occurred on the tube wall between orifice plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
Synchronized high-speed video and soot foils allowed for the classification of quasi-detonation propagation modes. At 50% BR, as initial pressure increased, fast-flame propagation transitioned to single-hot-spot wall ignition detonation to multi-hot-spot wall ignition detonation, and finally to continuous detonation propagation. A similar progression was observed at 75% BR, except that obstacle face ignition detonations occurred between the fast-flame and single-hot-spot regimes, and continuous detonations were not observed as tube strength concerns limited the maximum initial test pressure. &#xD;
&#xD;
For a continuous detonation, a higher average velocity was observed in the round tube than the square channel, which can be attributed to the effect of wave curvature during detonation diffraction past an obstacle (2D diffraction in the square channel compared to 3D diffraction in the round tube).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with severe functional disability; however, the mechanisms of impaired functioning are understudied. Cognitive deficits is one known mechanism of functional impairment in MDD. However, treatments that remediate cognitive functioning do not seem to produce commensurate gains in day-to-day functioning. Current models of functioning in MDD do not take into account motivation deficits that characterize the mood disorder. MDD individuals have demonstrated avoidance behavior and impaired performance in physically- and cognitively- effortful tasks, despite the promise of large rewards. Motivation to expend effort has yet to be evaluated as a predictor of functioning in depression.&#xD;
Objectives: This study aimed to compare physical and cognitive effort expenditure for rewards and the factors that influence motivation to expend high levels of these types of effort in MDD relative to healthy comparison individuals. Secondary objectives were to examine whether motivation to expend physical and cognitive effort predicted functioning, after controlling for symptoms and cognition. Finally, the study aimed to examine whether cognitive functioning was associated with functional impairment through its relationship with motivation to expend physical and cognitive effort.&#xD;
Method: Two cost-benefit decision-making tasks were developed to assess motivation to expend physical and cognitive effort in 44 MDD and 36 healthy comparison participants. Participants were assessed on a brief cognitive battery, anhedonia, depression severity, and functional impairment.&#xD;
Results: MDD participants made marginally fewer choices to expend high effort for large relative to small incentives than healthy comparison participants across both effort tasks. Lower motivation to expend physical effort in the MDD sample was moderated by increases in anhedonia severity, whereas lower cognitive effort motivation was associated with greater functional impairment, even after accounting for symptoms and cognitive ability. Cognitive effort motivation mediated the relationship between cognition and functioning in MDD.&#xD;
Conclusion: Motivation deficits to expend physical effort may reveal proximal mechanisms of anhedonia, while motivation for cognitive effort may explain distal functional outcomes. Findings offer novel evidence for attenuated motivation to expend physical and cognitive effort as a contributor to diagnostic clarity of anhedonia and a treatment target for functional recovery, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives have become widespread in the extractive industry, including in Africa. CSR opponents and proponents hold conflicting positions on the conceptualisation, importance and ability of CSR to effectively address the negative ramification of the extractive industry and promote development in resource rich communities. Proponents of CSR hold that corporations can create shared wealth and promote long-term sustainable development. On the other hand, CSR opponents state that CSR is a greenwashing mechanism intended to guarantee corporations the social license to operate (SLO), and to allow continuation of usual business practices. This study sought to empirically investigate whether a global dominance of CSR has distorted or silenced ongoing knowledge of and protest against the negative externalities of the mining industry in Ghana. The study further assessed stakeholders’ perception of CSR as contributing to long term development. The study employed an ethnographic approach using key informant interviews and community surveys to examine the social interaction between relevant state institutions, AngloGold Ashanti (AGA) and Adieyie and Teberebie communities. By using the environmental justice (EJ) framework to critically analyse the impacts of the mining industry, it was revealed that Adieyie and Teberebie bear disproportionately high levels of the cost of the operation of the activities of AGA while benefiting minimally despite ongoing CSR initiatives. Key informants who viewed CSR as a greenwashing mechanism held that current CSR initiatives cannot contribute to long-term community development but more important is corporation’s compliance to the rules and regulations that govern the industry. Other key informants were of the view that for sustainable development to occur, current CSR initiatives must be aligned to national and community development agendas and create shared value. The study proposes a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of resource extraction on resource rich communities using the EJ framework so as to identify and find solutions to the true drivers of the marginalisation and exploitation of these communities. Furthermore, the government of Ghana should effectively perform its development responsibility to resource rich communities. In line with the arguments of Hermann (2004), the study proposes that CSR should be standardised and legislated with effective enforcement of standards and laws and also be aligned to the development agendas of the country and communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: &#xD;
Skin tears (STs) are among the most prevalent wounds found in long-term care (LTC) settings. Given our aging population, the burden related to STs will further increase. Skin tears are often misunderstood as expected outcomes of normal skin changes associated with aging and as a result are frequently under-recognized and under-treated. While many factors have been purported to be associated with ST development, there is little evidence to corroborate their roles in ST risks. The primary purpose of the present study was to establish the prevalence and incidence of STs and examine the risk factors associated with ST development in the Ontario LTC population.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: &#xD;
A prospective study design was used to explore the risk factors associated with ST development. Prior to the study, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify previously reported risk factors to inform the study. A total of 380 individuals 65 years of age and over from 4 LTC facilities in Ontario were followed over 4 weeks.  The participants were examined for STs at the beginning of the study and at week 4 to determine if STs had occurred and to record the ST type, location, and associated patient-related factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: &#xD;
The study found a ST prevalence of 20.8% and an incidence of 18.9% within a month. History of a ST at baseline (RR 1.84, 95% CI (1.25-2.70), p=.002), the presence of skin changes associated with aging (RR 1.60, 95% CI (1.43-1.79), p&lt;.001), chronic disease (RR 1.17, 95% CI (1.03-1.32), p=0.018), requiring assistance with activities of daily living (RR 1.13, 95% CI (1.08-1.18), p&lt;.001) and displaying aggressive behaviour (RR 1.06, 95% CI (1.02-1.10), p =.001) were identified as key risk factors associated with ST development at 4 weeks post baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: &#xD;
These results provide much needed Ontario data on the burden of STs in the LTC population. By identifying risk factors, healthcare professionals can establish prevention programs targeted at reduction of modifiable risks for ST development. The present study is an important first step towards developing a prevention program targeting individuals at risk for STs in LTC.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A one-dimensional multi-scale coupled, transient, and mechanistic performance model for a PEMFC membrane electrode assembly has been developed. The model explicitly includes each of the 5 layers within a membrane electrode assembly and solves for the transport of charge, heat, mass, species, dissolved water, and liquid water. Key features of the model include the use of a multi-step implementation of the HOR reaction on the anode, agglomerate catalyst sub-models for both the anode and cathode catalyst layers, a unique approach that links the composition of the catalyst layer to key properties within the agglomerate model and the implementation of a stochastic input-based approach for component material properties. The model employs a new methodology for validation using statistically varying input parameters and statistically-based experimental performance data; this model represents the first stochastic input driven unit cell performance model. The stochastic input driven performance model was used to identify optimal ionomer content within the cathode catalyst layer, demonstrate the role of material variation in potential low performing MEA materials, provide explanation for the performance of low-Pt loaded MEAs, and investigate the validity of transient-sweep experimental diagnostic methods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this essay, I explore the difference between Representational Theories of Content (RTC) and Embodied Enactivism, and argue that enactivist approaches of perception can account for hallucinatory experiences, a sensory phenomenon readily explained by the RTC approaches. RTC bases perceptual activity on the presence of representational features interpreted by the brain, and are defined by their relation to independently existing objects. The enactivist model uses success and failure to determine whether or not a perception is hallucinatory by appealing to the use of all of the body’s sensory modalities to navigate a perceptual error.&#xD;
In Chapter two I present my arguments for an enactivist theory of hallucination, first by demonstrating that illusion and hallucination, broadly thought of as being two radically different phenomena, are actually one and the same. I also demonstrate how it is that bodily experiences affect the type of hallucination a patient will have, appealing to mood, repetitive tasks, and current environmental presences. My last strategy cleaves a wedge between visual imagery and hallucination, an assumption often made by representationalist accounts of cognition. RTC arguments made to support visual imagery are used to demonstrate how hallucinations are representational, but if the two experiences are actually different, then arguments for visual imagery become less convincing. &#xD;
Chapter three focuses on some lingering concerns and interesting implications of the enactivist theory. Veridicality differs from successful/failed perceptions by appealing to the degree with which the agent can make sense of their perceptions. I also argue how smaller misperceptions are hallucinatory, as well as how auditory hallucinations and multi-modal halluciations are also explainable to the enactivist. Dreams pose the last challenge I address, for they exhibit some embodied characteristics all the while being impervious to the success/failure metric of perceptual activity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Widespread vegetation productivity increases in tundra ecosystems and stagnation, or even productivity decreases, in boreal forest ecosystems have been detected from coarse-scale remote sensing observations over the last few decades. However, finer-scale Landsat studies have shown that these changes are heterogeneous and may be related to landscape and regional variability in climate, land cover, topography and moisture. In this study, a Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series (1984-2016) was examined for a study area spanning the entirety of the sub-Arctic boreal forest to Low Arctic tundra transition of central Canada (i.e., Yellowknife to the Arctic Ocean). NDVI trend analysis indicated that 27 % of un-masked pixels in the study area exhibited a significant (p &lt; 0.05) trend and virtually all (99.3 %) of those pixels were greening. Greening pixels were most common in the northern tundra zone and the southern forest-tundra ecotone zone. NDVI trends were positive throughout the study area, but were smallest in the forest zone and largest in the northern tundra zone. These results were supported by ground validation, which found a strong relationship (R2 = 0.81) between bulk vegetation volume (BVV) and NDVI for non-tree functional groups in the North Slave region of Northwest Territories. Field observations indicate that alder (Alnus spp.) shrublands and open woodland sites with shrubby understories were most likely to exhibit greening in that area. Random Forest (RF) modelling of the relationship between NDVI trends and environmental variables found that the magnitude and direction of trends differed across the forest to tundra transition. Increased summer temperatures, shrubland and forest land cover, closer proximity to major drainage systems, longer distances from major lakes and lower elevations were generally more important and associated with larger positive NDVI trends. These findings indicate that the largest positive NDVI trends were primarily associated with the increased productivity of shrubby environments, especially at, and north of the forest-tundra ecotone in areas with more favorable growing conditions. Smaller and less significant NDVI trends in boreal forest environments south of the forest-tundra ecotone were likely associated with long-term recovery from fire disturbance rather than the variables analyzed here.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goal of surgery for patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and subsequent rehabilitation is the restoration of normal knee function (van Grinsven et al., 2010). Having procedures that accurately assess and quantify recovery are crucial to ensure that physicians if patients are regaining knee function. However, there is no standardized, objective assessment of a patient’s improvement as they progress through the stages of rehabilitation. Currently, maximal effort testing is used to evaluate knee function to determine a patient’s readiness to return to unrestricted physical activity but, these tests place a high demand on the knee joint, which is contraindicated in early rehabilitation (Cascio et al., 2004) and may confound the patient’s results due to fear of re-injury. The step-up-and-over (SUAO) test is an objective, submaximal effort test that quantifies performance (van Grinsven et al., 2010) and, therefore, can be used to evaluate knee function throughout rehabilitation to gauge the patient’s progression.&#xD;
Two studies were completed for this thesis. In the first study, 12 ACL-reconstructed individuals completed the SUAO test at each physiotherapy clinic visit until they were cleared to return to unrestricted physical activity by their physician or physiotherapist. They also completed the ACL-QoL, a questionnaire measuring the patient’s subjective knee function. In the second study, these 12 ACL-reconstructed patients completed a fear of re-injury questionnaire once a month and their pain was measured on each testing day to evaluate whether these two variables affected the results obtained from the SUAO test.&#xD;
Results showed that the ACL-QoL was not related to the variables measured using the SUAO test and that the SUAO test was able to track an individual’s progression through rehabilitation. Results also showed that fear of re-injury did not affect the performance on each testing day but pain did. Together, these results indicate that the SUAO test is a clinically viable option to track an individual’s progression through rehabilitation without having fear of re-injury affect the results and that pain may affect performance of the SUAO test.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rationale: The physiologic variables distinguishing classic asthma (CA), cough variant asthma (CVA), and methacholine (MCh)-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity (COUGH) are incompletely understood. Defining the range of normal responses associated with deep inspirations (DIs) during high-dose MCh is key to understand the clinical relevance of COUGH.&#xD;
Purpose: To characterize responses to DI in healthy normal individuals (without asthma, chronic cough or asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness) during high-dose MCh and compare with responses in CA, CVA and COUGH.&#xD;
Methods: Individuals aged 18-65 years with no history of asthma and/or chronic cough attended 2 visits. On visit 1, after baseline spirometry and body plethysmography, participants were randomized to perform either: (i) modified high-dose MCh challenge using partial and maximal expiratory flow-volume curves (PEFV/MEFV) and impulse oscillometry (IOS) or (ii) traditional high-dose MCh challenge using MEFV, at each dose to a maximum change (∆) in FEV1 of 50% from baseline (MAX). Previously published data (Wasilewski et al., 2016) was used to compare the responses of healthy individuals to individuals with CA (n=11), CVA (n=10) and COUGH (n=7).&#xD;
Results: 15 participants (31.4±7.3years) (Mean±SD) completed the protocol. At MAX, participants developed minor but significant cough (3.2±4.7; p=0.022), dyspnea (Borg: 0.4±0.7; p=0.016), bronchoconstriction (%∆FEV1 -14.7±7.9%; p&lt;0.001) and gas trapping (∆IC -0.20±0.36; p=0.001), compared to baseline. At MAX, the bronchodilation effect of DIs was preserved (DI index: 0.67±0.44 and -0.14 ± 0.15 at MAX and baseline, respectively; p&lt;0.001). Compared to healthy individuals, the COUGH group developed more cough (p=0.006), dyspnea (p=0.029) but comparable bronchoconstriction and gas trapping in response to high-dose MCh. At MAX, the bronchodilating effect was preserved in CA, CVA and healthy participants but impaired in COUGH (DI Index: 0.67±0.97 (CA); 0.51±0.73 (CVA); 0.01±0.36 (COUGH); 0.68±0.45 (healthy participants); p=0.009).&#xD;
Conclusion: The responses to high-dose MCh in healthy participants and participants with COUGH, CVA and CA lie on a continuum, which may reflect fundamental pathophysiological differences in terms of impairment versus preservation of the bronchodilating effect of DIs. COUGH appears to be a clinically relevant phenotype, distinct from healthy normal and CVA.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The HIV prevalence rate inside Canadian Federal Penitentiaries is estimated to be 7 times higher than the rate in the general Canadian population. Additionally, a survey of Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) HIV-positive inmates showed that over half were worried about HIV-related stigma while incarcerated. This study of HIV-positive current and former inmates, the first Canadian study of its kind, investigated participants’ lived experiences in and out of prison. Topics investigated include experiences of stigma and disclosure of HIV status during incarceration. This study consisted of semi-structured, in-person interviews. A total of 20 interviews were conducted with 10 currently incarcerated, 5 recently released HIV-positive males, 4 Peer Education Course (PEC) workers and 1 recently released HIV-negative male. Currently incarcerated participants were recruited through the health care departments of penitentiaries in the Ontario Region of CSC. Formerly incarcerated participants were recruited from social service organizations in Kingston, Ontario, that focus on working with PLWH and formerly incarcerated individuals. Participants reported experiencing or witnessing enacted, perceived and internalized stigma in and out of the prison environment. Experiences of enacted stigma ranged from verbal insults to being ostracized, threats of violence, and actual violent attacks. Variations in experiences of enacted stigma were explained by non- or limited disclosure based on fears of discrimination, as well as perceived standing in the prison hierarchy. Additionally, the majority of participants reported having experienced a variety of childhood traumas and feelings of poor self-worth and suicidal ideation. HIV-related stigma is a common experience of HIV-positive current and former inmates. Although there are HIV prevention programs including testing, bleach kits, condom distribution, and HIV treatment within CSC prisons, there are no reported programs that specifically target the reduction of HIV-related stigma. As a result, future research is needed to develop and evaluate possible avenues for intervention to prevent experiences of stigma for people living with HIV, both within and outside of the prison environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the brain develops and ages, cognitive abilities (e.g., attention and memory) undergo significant functional fluctuations. In order to differentiate neuropathology from natural changes that occur due to development and aging, the goal of our study is to develop an understanding of changes in cognitive control that occur across the lifespan. The oculomotor system is an ideal model to probe cognitive function through the analysis of saccadic eye movements. We used a video-based eye tracker capable of measuring various saccade metrics on an interleaved pro- and anti-saccade task in healthy participants 5-85 years of age. The interleaved pro- and anti-saccade task requires the generation of pro-saccades (automatic eye movements toward a salient stimulus) and/or anti-saccades (voluntary eye movements away from a salient stimulus) depending upon a visual colour instruction. Participant head position was stabilized using a fixed head mount and participants sat in front of a computer screen to conduct the task. Our results show that individuals between 17 and 29 years of age outperformed younger and older participants by generating the fastest correct pro- (Mean = 146ms to 160ms) and anti-saccades (Mean = 225ms to 232ms). Participants between 21 and 29 years of age generated the fewest anti-saccade direction errors (Mean = 13.3%), which occur when an automated pro-saccade is initiated towards the target. Younger children (5-13 years-old) and older adults (50-85 years-old) had the slowest anti-saccade reaction times (Mean = 285ms to 339ms and 265ms to 290ms, respectively). Among younger participants (5-16 years-old), direction error rates decreased with age (Mean = 60.3% to 29.8%). Taken together, these results demonstrate strong developmental- and age-related effects in participant performance, reflecting maturation and deterioration of the nervous system. This study provides valuable insight into the natural oculomotor changes that take place across the lifespan, providing a foundation for future comparisons between clinical, preclinical and healthy populations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>INTRODUCTION: In medical imaging software, structures are often represented using image volumes known as labelmaps. Conversion of structures to labelmap representations results in a loss of information which impacts medical imaging algorithms, including those in radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning. RT treatment planning systems are used to optimize radiation delivery to structures, which are represented as planar contours. Errors from conversion affect metrics such as dose volume histograms (DVHs) that are the primary metric for RT plan optimization. The goal of this thesis is to develop fractional labelmaps as a structure representation that preserves more structural information and reduces conversion errors. METHODS: The effect of voxelization on treatment planning metrics was tested by comparing DVHs calculated using varying voxel sizes. An algorithm was implemented that triangulates planar contours to closed surface mesh and handles features such as branching, keyhole contours, and end-capping. Closed surfaces were converted into fractional labelmap representations, where each voxel represents occupancy between 0% and 100%. Existing segmentation methods were modified to allow fractional labelmaps to be edited directly. RESULTS: Algorithms were implemented in the open-source medical imaging platform 3D Slicer, and the SlicerRT toolkit. Voxel size was found to affect DVH accuracy for structures with small features or in regions with a high dose gradient. The planar contour to closed surface triangulation algorithm produced qualitatively good surfaces. Fractional labelmaps from closed surfaces were found to be up to 19.1% better at representing structure volume than binary labelmaps, with an average improvement of 6.8%. DVHs calculated from fractional labelmaps were found to be more accurate than DVHs calculated using binary labelmaps. Fractional segmentation methods were found to create good quality segmentations. CONCLUSION: Labelmap voxel size was found to be a contributing factor for DVH accuracy. Accurate conversion algorithms were implemented for planar contour to closed surface and closed surface to fractional labelmap conversions. When used for structure representation and DVH calculation, fractional labelmaps were more accurate than binary labelmaps at the same resolution. Fractional labelmaps were found to be an effective tool for structure representation in radiotherapy that could be expanded to other use cases.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>What does it mean to question and think? Questioning and thinking are two activities which we consider imperative to doing philosophy and the two activities that we involve ourselves in most of the time, albeit without much thought given to that involvement. Are questioning and thinking those activities normally thought of as those belonging to reason alone and among the ranks of various mental activities? I would like to argue that, according to Heidegger, questioning and thinking carry a different essence than just mental activities, all the while still being imperative to philosophy. The following study seeks to investigate Heidegger’s reconceptualization of the themes of questioning and thinking and the meaning that lies therein. My aim is in the vein of a reconstructive exposure: to lay out and follow along Heidegger’s thought behind his conceptions of questioning and thinking and, through building them back up, to expose their deeper meaning, new understanding, and potential for interpreting the situation of one’s “historical time.” In order to argue this deeper meaning, new understanding, and interpretation, I put forth the following statement: where we find questioning, there too do we find thinking, meaning that if we take questioning to be that activity which opens up one’s situation, it is then thinking that confronts the opened-up situation as a struggle against it. This struggle against, however, is not to be conceptualised as a struggle against something so as to end it. On the contrary, the struggle against is that which runs up against the confrontation opened-up through questioning; a running up against that, while a struggle, nevertheless is intimately related to the confrontation that it struggles against. Ultimately, what is revealed through questioning and thinking is the “place” which most concerns the being who questions and thinks: the always-already there.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It has been demonstrated both clinically and experimentally that the higher brain is highly vulnerable to ischemia, while the lower brain is comparatively resilient. Discovering how lower brain neurons naturally resist ischemic stress may help to design new strategies for improving higher brain survival following ischemia. Our laboratory has proposed that differential expression of Na+/K+-ATPase isoforms, the ion pumps responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of neurons, may underlie this phenomenon. Specifically, the α3 isoform, but not the α1 isoform, possesses kinetic properties that allow it to function efficiently under low energy conditions, rendering it ischemia-resistant. The goal of this thesis was to characterize regional expression of Na+/K+-ATPase α1 and α3 isoforms in the brains of Aldh2+/+ and Aldh2-/- mice across the lifespan, under both baseline (naïve) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) conditions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze mRNA expression levels of α1 and α3 isoforms within higher and lower brain regions of 5 – 7 month old and 15 – 19 month old naïve Aldh2+/+ and Aldh2-/- mice, as well as in 3 month old mice that underwent a 28-day CUS protocol, along with age-matched controls. In both young and aged naïve cohorts, the α3 isoform was proportionally more highly expressed in the brainstem compared to the neocortex, while α1 was proportionally more highly expressed in the neocortex and less so, in the hippocampus, compared to the brainstem. Exposure to the CUS protocol did not significantly alter α1 or α3 mRNA expression in any brain region compared to controls. Stress mice exhibited regional differences in α1 and α3 expression that were consistent with the results in naïve animals. There were no significant effects of genotype or sex on the expression of either isoform. Parallel studies from our laboratory have shown that protein expression correlates with mRNA expression. Future work in our laboratory will investigate how α1 or α3 expression may change and protect neurons in response to acute ischemia.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper will contribute to the academic discussion surrounding education and its effects on the empowerment of Keralite women. Kerala’s education system has been highly praised as a model for development due to its high performance in standard developmental indicators. This model, however, is increasingly becoming contested in academic scholarship, specifically due to its perpetuation of inequality amongst marginalized groups, such as women and members of lower castes. This work will explore the culture-specific relationship between women and their social surroundings and the critiques made by the women in the Women’s Studies Department at the University of Kerala will take an active role in participating in the discussion of education and its effects on the positionality of women in Kerala, illuminating new required avenues of scholarship and attention.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Current understanding of dynamic patellofemoral joint (PFJ) mechanics in literature is limited to static or very slow in vivo measurements.  Two studies were performed across a wide range of functional movements to improve upon our understanding on how the PFJ moves dynamically.  The first study aimed to provide foundational data of the PFJ and associated mechanisms such as medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) length, joint congruence, and engagement.  The second study looked at the effects of a gait rehabilitation program had on the PFJ.  The program altered hip mechanics to mitigate pain associated with patellofemoral pain.  Both studies used biplanar videoradiography (BVR) motion capture techniques in conjunction with a computed tomography scan of the knee to quantify and evaluate PFJ motion.&#xD;
  &#xD;
Four functional movements - walking, lunging, sidestepping, and running - were investigated.  We observed several linear correlations between MPFL length, lateral patellofemoral tilt, lateral patellofemoral displacement, orientation of the patella ridge within the trochlear groove, and patellofemoral volumetric congruence.   In the pilot gait rehabilitation study, we found that targeting the hip had significant effects on PFJ kinematics, mechanics, and congruence.  Whether these changes can be maintained or are beneficial is yet to be determined; however, they currently provide insights into mitigating PFP using non-surgical methods. These datasets can be used to provide the basis of our understanding of the PFJ and guide future studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>From January to April 2015, I curated Talkin’ Back to Johnny Mac, a five-part performance series that took place in Katarokwi (Kingston, Ontario). The series, which took place during the bicentennial birthday year of Kingstonian Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, interrupted the celebratory, nationalist, and settler colonial narratives that drove the celebration and critiqued the ways in which historical and colonial/settler icons like Macdonald are remembered. Each individual performance by artists David Garneau, Peter Morin, Adrian Stimson, Leah Decter, and Tanya Lukin Linkater embodied unacknowledged contradictions in the celebratory tone of Macdonald’s birthday year. Together, the performances built a critical dialogue that intervened in the colonial narrative that turned Macdonald into an icon. Taken together, this series of performative acts forced a consideration of his ongoing influence as the first Prime Minister of Canada on the undercurrent of discrimination and assimilation still so fundamental to state approaches to Indigenous issues in Canada.&#xD;
Talkin’ Back to Johnny Mac is the first component of this project-based dissertation. Documentation of the performances that constituted the project is included in Chapter Three. The second component is this written section, which explores Indigenous curatorial methodologies by placing my experience of curating Talkin’ Back in conversation with the practices of six Indigenous curators. In so doing, I create a map of Indigenous curatorial history in Canada. The written component builds on the curatorial project, locating it within a discussion of Indigenous curating as a practice based in Indigenous epistemologies and ontologies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis describes: 1) the use of protein engineering to increase ice-binding protein (IBP) activity and thermal stability, and 2) the binding interaction and microcolony formation between an Antarctic bacterium and diatom. IBPs, including the antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that prevent the freezing of organisms, are found in nearly all biological kingdoms. IBPs have potential applications in a variety of domains including the food industry, cryo-medicine, and biotechnology. Despite the variety of IBPs, most are difficult to produce in amounts needed for industrial applications. Consequently, there is a need to find or engineer IBPs with enhanced activity and stability. Previously, AFP activity was increased by fusing an AFP to another protein, or by increasing the size of the IBP’s ice-binding face. Here, I used a highly-branched polymer, known as a dendrimer, to fuse a range (6 to 12) of moderately-active type III AFPs from Macrozoarces americanus together. These AFP multimers had improved antifreeze and ice-recrystallization inhibition activity. Unexpectedly, AFPs multimers had enhanced recovery from heat treatment. I also achieved enhanced thermal stability in type III AFP through an alternative strategy. Using split-intein mediated end-terminal ligation, I fused the N- and C- termini of the type III AFP together. Peptide backbone circularization had no effect on antifreeze activity but significantly increased thermal stability compared to the non-cyclized form. &#xD;
The IBP found on the cell surface of a Gram-negative Antarctic bacterium, Marinomonas primoryensis, is one region of an exceptionally large multi-domain 1.5 MDa protein, MpIBP. Using temperature-controlled microfluidics, I have shown that M. primoryensis forms bacterial clusters on ice. Binding is aided by the motility of the bacterium and is dependent on the functionality of its ice-binding domain. The strictly aerobic M. primoryensis is drawn and binds to, the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros neogracile to form mixed cell clusters and adheres them to ice. We hypothesize that the ice-binding function of MpIBP keeps its host immediately under the surface ice in the phototrophic zone of the water column where oxygen and carbon compounds are more abundant. By recruiting diatoms to the ice, M. primoryensis helps these photosynthesizers form a symbiotic community where light is most abundant.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Endometriosis is a major reproductive pathology that affects more than 8.5 million women in North America alone, and 176 million worldwide. It is characterized by the growth of endometrial lining outside of the uterus and remains one of the most important global health challenges due to staggering health care costs, lack of non-invasive diagnostic tests, lack of a cure and significant side effects with current treatments.  Recurrent pregnancy loss is another major reproductive pathology, which affects 1-5% of pregnant women worldwide. It is now well established that aberrant inflammation is one of the most important contributing factors in the pathogenesis of these gynecological diseases. RNA binding proteins including Tristetraprolin (TTP) and Human antigen-R (HuR) families are regulators of inflammation, and modulate many hallmark inflammatory cytokines implicated in both endometriosis and RPL, including: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). To understand the unique contributions of RNA binding protein axis, we screened for TTP/HuR axis in endometriosis patients and investigated functional effects in vitro as well as in a syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis. We also sought out to determine endometrial-endothelial modes of intercellular communication and whether RNA binding proteins are shuttled via extracellular vesicles including exosomes.  We report aberrations in the TTP/HuR axis in endometriosis patients and demonstrate that knockdown of TTP in endometriotic epithelial cells yields differential inflammatory cytokine profiles compared to endometrial epithelial cells. We also report for the first time functional effects of endometrial-derived exosomes that participate in a form of intercellular communication with endothelial cells. Further, using a mouse model of RPL, we report downregulation of TTP protein while targets TNF-α and IL-6 are upregulated in placentas treated with Lipopolysaccharide compared to controls. Our results suggest that RNA-binding proteins such as TTP are expressed and involved in the modulation of inflammation-induced pregnancy pathologies.  Together, our data demonstrate unique contributions of the HuR/TTP RNA binding protein axis in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and pregnancy loss and opens up a new avenue of research to understand contributions of these RNA binding proteins in modulating inflammatory responses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: Depression negatively impacts olfactory functioning and as such, olfactory dysfunction has been found in individuals with depression. Expansions of this research have demonstrated an improvement in olfactory functioning after successful pharmaceutical and psychotherapy treatments for depression. However, it is unknown if intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has a similar effect. &#xD;
Objectives: The current study examined the olfactory functioning and depression severity in depressed individuals before and after iTBS, comparing them to non-depressed controls. We hypothesized that depressed individuals would have significantly poorer olfactory functioning compared to controls before treatment, but little to no difference between after successful treatment. We also predicted that depression severity and olfactory dysfunction were negatively correlated. &#xD;
Methods: We recruited 20 depressed individuals receiving iTBS and 9 non-depressed controls. The olfactory function of depressed patients was tested before and after treatment using Sniffin’ Sticks Extended Test (examining olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification). Depression severity was also evaluated. Controls were tested in the same manner with a 5-6 week waiting period in lieu of iTBS. &#xD;
Results: Both the comparison of olfaction before and after treatment in depressed patients and with controls found no significant differences. An effect of age (p&lt;0.05) and baseline depression severity (p&lt;0.05) were found in the depressed group, with younger and less severely depressed individuals having significantly better olfactory functioning than their counterparts both before and after treatment. There were a number of significant correlations between depression severity and olfactory discrimination, identification, and total olfaction score at both time points. &#xD;
Discussion: While no significant difference was found between the depressed and control groups or within the depressed group, the impact of depression severity provided support for the assumption of a reciprocal relationship. The significant difference between younger and older depressed participants highlights the limitation of age present in the study that may have contributed to the lack of significant differences. Overall, the relationship between depression and olfaction has the potential to be an important part of early diagnosis, examination of treatment progression, and on quality of life of depressed individuals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, the joint source-channel coding method, channel optimized scalar quantization, is applied to real-valued, correlated data. The data is sent over the orthogonal multiple access channel, with non-binary noisy discrete channels with memory as the two sub-channels. Three different schemes are compared for this system: in the first scheme encoding and decoding are performed independently, in the second scheme encoding is done independently and joint decoding is carried out, and the third scheme is with jointly optimized encoders and joint decoding. The goal is to derive optimality conditions that will result in a lower end-to-end distortion. To this end, necessary optimality conditions for the two latter schemes are fully derived and implemented for the bivariate Gaussian and bivariate Laplacian distributions of varying correlation.\\&#xD;
The first and second methods are then further compared, by implementing them for an image transmission system. Here the images are first processed with the 2 dimensional discrete cosine transform, and then encoded using channel optimized scalar quantization. At the decoder, two different methods are used, the independent and joint decoder.\\&#xD;
In addition to comparing the different coding methods, various channels characteristics are exploited. For example, the non-binary noisy discrete channel can be used to model memory and the $2^q$-ary output allows for performance improvement via soft-decision decoding. It is observed that by taking the source correlation into consideration, significant signal-to-distortion ratio gains can be achieved. For example, the highest gain incurred from the third scheme is when the bivariate Gaussian is compressed at rate 2, where the gain in signal-to-distortion ratio due to source correlation is 10.90 dB.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Several studies have observed variability in the individual mRNA expression responses to acute exercise. However, because observed responses contain a degree of measurement error and within-subject variability, it is unknown whether variability in the mRNA expression responses to acute exercise exists. The purpose of this thesis was to determine whether variability in the individual mRNA expression responses to acute exercise exists. Utilizing freely available microarray data, variability in observed responses to acute resistance exercise (RE) and CON were compared to determine the variability in mRNA expression responses to RE. The previously published microarray study (1) collected skeletal muscle biopsies before (PRE) and 24 hours after (POST) RE/CON and genome-wide mRNA expression responses were measured using Affymetrix microarray chips. Standard deviation (SD) in the observed responses to CON were subtracted from RE to determine an effect size of variability in the responses (ESIR) to RE. Although 15849 transcripts had an incalculable ESIR (i.e. SD in observed responses to CON &gt; RE), 29933 transcripts had an ESIR &gt; 0 and 1486 mRNA had a large ESIR (i.e. ESIR &gt; 0.6). WebGestalt’s gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the 1486 mRNA with a large ESIR were involved in several pathways proposed to play roles in regulating the adaptive responses to resistance training (RT). The 1486 mRNA with a large ESIR were also compared to a group of 2756 mRNA (2) previously found to have acute expression responses that correlate with skeletal muscle strength and size adaptations following RT. 109 mRNA with large ESIR were also among the mRNA previously found to correlate with both skeletal muscle strength and size adaptations to RT. Together, these results suggest that individual variability in the mRNA expression responses to RE exist, and highlight 109 mRNA that potentially play key roles in predicting skeletal muscle adaptations to RT.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many Chinese students take test preparation courses with an aim to achieve success on English language tests because of the high-stakes consequences associated with test scores. However, contrary to the massive test preparation industry in China and the huge claim of achieving high scores, there is very limited empirical evidence to help us understand how students are prepared and if the claim can be substantiated. Therefore, the purpose of my doctoral dissertation was to understand Chinese students’ test preparation for high-stakes English language tests, through examining the nature, the perceived effects, and the perceived value of test preparation practices for the Test of English as a Foreign Language Internet-based Test (TOEFL iBT) and the College English Test Band 4 (CET4). &#xD;
This study employed a multiple-stage, multiple-method design to collect data from three participant groups, including students, teachers, and administrators. Three research sites reflecting the stages of test preparation experience were included: ‘currently’ taking test preparation courses, recently completing test preparation courses, and achieving success on tests. Data were collected from classroom observations and interviews with 18 students, eight teachers and three administrators, questionnaires with 534 students, and documents related to test preparation courses and test preparation centre’s administration.&#xD;
Test familiarization, English skill improvement, and stress management were three major practices that helped Chinese students achieve success; however, the factors related to participants’ characteristics, perceptions, and their situated context interacted with each other to shape these practices. Although no immediate substantial test score gains were found, the practices that targeted at English skills were perceived to gradually improve test scores. The trustworthiness, the efficacy and the reorientation of the test preparation practices were valued to help with achieving success, although the extent of these aspects varied to individual students. Drawing on Green’s (2007) washback model, the findings contributed to the understanding of test preparation phenomenon that the variability in the nature of the test preparation practices influence the direction that test preparation practices work on test scores and English learning, and the perceived value are related to what students experienced (nature) and what they achieved (perceived effects).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis contains three papers in which a player's price may signal his private information. Each paper contains a novel game theoretic model, analysis of the model, and a discussion of how the solution contributes to our understanding of real problems. In the first, a defendant's settlement offer may convey the strength of his case to a plaintiff. That papers addresses the questions of why discovery may be only partially utilized and why parties to a case may fail to settle despite the availability of discovery and disclosure. I show that the plaintiff may underutilize discovery in order to openly maintain his belief that the defendant may not have a strong case to affect the defendant disclosure and ultimately his settlement offer. I also consider a similar buyer-seller model with buyer inspection and embed it into two more complex models. The second paper extends the buyer-seller model with two types of sellers to one with three types, which introduces very different kinds of equilibria (ie. partial separation). The application there is to the labour market and, in particular, to the 1973-2006 period in which the US saw a simultaneous substantial fall in the 10th percentile male and female wages and substantial rise in residual wage inequality followed by reversals, which are patterns that other theories have been unable to generate. Under a kind of technological progress in line with the routinization hypothesis, the benefit that the middle type gets from mimicking the high type decreases, which causes him to prefer to separate. That generates the initial comovements and the continued technological progress generates the reversals. In the final paper, each firm may convey through its price its current marginal cost of production, which affects whether or not its customers will return in the next period. Price stickiness arises in the sense that a firm only uses two sale prices and one regular price despite the generality of its cost process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent Gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen responsible for many hospital-acquired infections. It is a significant source of infection in burn victims and is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa is of considerable medical importance due to its high antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Like most organisms, P. aeruginosa requires iron for survival and proliferation. As free iron is scarce within humans, with the majority of iron complexed with heme, this human pathogen expresses proteins responsible for heme uptake and breakdown. P. aeruginosa possesses two iron-regulated cytoplasmic heme proteins, PhuS and HemO. PhuS has been previously classified as merely a heme-trafficking protein, while HemO is the canonical heme oxygenase (HO) responsible for heme degradation to produce biliverdin, CO, and free iron. Determination of the crystal structures of PhuS in the apo- and heme-bound forms show unique structural differences compared to its homologue ChuS, the Escherichia coli O157:H7 HO. However, we have discovered that PhuS also has heme-degrading activity and is five times more potent than ChuS. We show that PhuS degrades heme to verdoheme and has a much lower energy barrier for this step than HemO. Thus, HemO is mainly responsible for the ring-opening reaction of verdoheme to biliverdin. We have also confirmed through kinetics analysis that the presence of PhuS and HemO together enhances heme degradation compared to HemO alone. These results combined have identified function coupling of this unique two-enzyme system that affords P. aeruginosa with more efficient heme breakdown and iron utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
As iron is used as a cofactor for many enzymatic processes, we focused on another family of iron-containing oxygenase called the 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases (2OG oxygenases). P. aeruginosa encode four putative 2OG oxygenases, of which two of them are characterized here: MicL (PA4191) and PiuC (PA4515). We show that MicL has the ability to bind 2OG and Fe(II), while PiuC has potential protein substrates in EF-Tu and keto-acid isomerase. Through in vivo P. aeruginosa growth assays, we show that MicL and PiuC are important regulators of cell growth, allowing the pathogen to survive longer under greater levels of nutrient stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The growing trend of devices participation in Internet of Things (IoTs) platforms has created billions of IoT devices for users. The rapid trend has made users to install IoT devices at homes to achieve their goals, such as to reduce electricity cost. Moreover, the increasing popularity of service-oriented computing makes more and more services available on the Web. Users make use of these services to achieve their personal goals, such as to book right tickets. Existing research with personalized software assistants has been conducted to assist users majorly in e-commerce sites for customized search recommendations. However, the potential of personalized software assistant systems usage in a user-centric model is highly unrealized in assisting users to achieve their personal goals through personalized context-aware interactions with users based on behavioural habits, such as to smartly recommend IoT devices usage in smart-homes to reduce electricity expenses, and engage users more during the process of service selection to achieve their goals. In this thesis, First, we propose an engine that identi es the behavioural patterns of IoT device users to make smart recommendations to reduce users cognitive overload. Then we propose an intellectually cognitive personalized assistant framework which helps users to achieve their personal goals through personalized context-aware interactions for selection of services. We have designed and developed a prototype as a proof of concept. We perform a case study to evaluate the e ectiveness of our framework. Our framework, utilizing the learning-to-rank algorithm, namely AdaRank, improves the nine baseline approaches by 12.02% - 31.52% in helping users  nd the desired services to achieve their goals. Further, we conduct a user study to obtain users' perception of using our framework to achieve their personal goals. Our user study results show that our framework is helpful in achieving user's goals and saves users time in  nding their personalized services faster.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The long-term durability of infrastructure is a growing concern as assets built in the middle of the last century reach the end of their service lives. One solution to manage these assets is to use distributed monitoring technologies to assess their performance and the effects of deterioration. Distributed fibre optic sensors (FOS) based on measuring Rayleigh backscatter provide strain measurements along the full length of the fibre up to 70 m. Digital image correlation (DIC) can show crack formation over the surface of a structure and assist with the understanding of the strain data from the FOS. An experimental study using these two technologies was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams.  &#xD;
In the first test series, seven reinforced concrete specimens with different stirrup spacing and longitudinal reinforcement ratios were instrumented with nylon coated FOS and tested in three point bending to investigate whether FOS could detect differences in behaviour. It was found that distributed strain measurements could detect the peak strain in the stirrups indicating the location of the crack crossing the stirrups as well as providing the strain distribution along the stirrup. The specimens all failed in flexure except the ones that violated the CSA A23.3-14 (2015) stirrup spacing limit. &#xD;
In the second test series, five RC beams with artificial deterioration were instrumented and tested. Artificial deterioration mechanisms included having no bottom or top anchorage as well as pitting corrosion at the mid-height of the stirrup legs. Stirrups without bottom anchorage were found to have the largest impact on the specimen’s performance (the load carrying capacity was reduced by 20% and the failure mode changed from flexural to shear). The other two types of deterioration did not influence the load carrying capacity. Distributed sensing aided in understanding the failure mode.&#xD;
Finite-element models were created using a two dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) package to evaluate the accuracy of this software for use in structural assessments with distributed sensing. It was found that the results from the FE models were less conservative than the experimental results for most cases. Inaccuracies (i.e. load capacity, failure mode, strain distribution, crack pattern) were due to the use of incorrect modeling methods for the deteriorated stirrups and the use of smeared cracking.</dcterms:abstract>

The study was informed by research literature on teacher learning, responses to professional changes, intercultural competence and international mindedness.&#xD;
	Participants were nominated by the school’s director, based on the criteria synthesized from literature. This study collected three types of data: 1) director interview, 2) teacher interviews, and 3) teachers’ written reflections. Influenced by a phenomenological approach, all interviews were modeled after Seidman’s (2006) in-depth interview structure, with one important adaptation: prior to each interview, participants were asked to engage in reflective writing exercises. Data were analyzed inductively and spirally by creation of emergent codes and themes. Four themes emerged from the data:  1) Learning to live in the host country, 2) Learning to teach diverse students, 3) Learning to navigate curricular differences, and 4) Learning to contribute to the school community. &#xD;
	In summary, the key findings of this study are that teacher learning is complex, multifaceted, and embedded in everyday experiences inside and outside of the school context. Personal factors permeate all aspects of teacher learning and incur conscious choice. The schools’ ethos and support structures set the conditions for learning and frame how and what teachers learn. This study is crucial because it contributes a layered, in-depth teacher perspective on the source and nature of teacher learning in international schools to better understand and support it.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Due to its many benefits over conventional H2SO4 leaching, the use of HCl for leaching has been increasing in many flowsheets, particularly for laterites and rare earth elements ores. However, HCl is more expensive than H2SO4 and an inexpensive method of regenerating it must be developed to ensure its economic viability in these flowsheets. This thesis presents a robust process which operates at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure thereby reducing operating costs. The addition of H2SO4 to MgCl2 solutions in the presence of air sparging is shown here to produce external HCl recoveries up to 64.6%. The effects of temperatures between 75 °C and 100 °C, airflow between 200 and 600 mL/min, stoichiometric H2SO4 addition between 100% and 300%, and initial chloride concentration between 4 and 10 M were investigated. Increasing chloride concentration and H2SO4 addition were found to be beneficial to HCl recovery, consistent with Le Chatelier’s Principle. The positive impact of increasing temperature and airflow were determined to be due to higher temperatures and increased airflows favouring the volatilization of HCl. Additionally, the impact of the incorporation of iron, calcium, sodium, and a combination of these ions were studied. The presence of calcium and sodium were found to be detrimental and iron beneficial to total HCl recoveries. After initial batch experiments were conducted, the process was scaled-up to a two-stage continuous mode operation which yielded a maximum HCl recovery of 56.4%. While overall recoveries were found to decrease in continuous operation, the temperature, airflow, H2SO4 addition, and initial chloride concentration trends were found to be consistent with the batch experiments. The inclusion of iron had a greater positive impact in the continuous experiments and sodium was less detrimental to the system. The resulting liquid and solid samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma, atomic absorption spectroscopy, x-ray powder diffraction, carbon-sulphur analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis as appropriate to examine the mass balance and precipitate formed. The precipitate was found to be MgSO4.2H2O, CaSO4.2H2O, and FeSO4.7H2O which will impact further treatment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Diabetes is a global epidemic health adversity that is often associated with female subfertility, repeated miscarriages and congenital malformations. Despite plethora of information suggesting an association between aberrant maternal immune responses during pregnancy and gestational complications in type 1 diabetes, mechanisms underlying pre-clinical gestational loss in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects are yet to be defined. Further, no comprehensive evaluation of the impact of diabetes on implantation has been completed. This study aimed at examining effects of diabetes on the natural events associated with mammalian implantation in-vivo. Using various functional, histological and postmortem analyses, impact of diabetes and that of the macrolide immunosuppressant tacrolimus on murine implantation and post- implantation pregnancy events and outcomes were compared across mouse models of type 1 and obesity-associated type 2 diabetes, the None-Obese Diabetic and the New- Zealand Obese mice, respectively. Results obtained in this study showed, for the first time, that naturally occurring diabetes significantly impeded endometrial progesterone receptor (PGR)-mediated influences, creating a hostile uterine milieu that is not receptive to the implanting embryo. Specifically, we have identified aberrancies in the endometrial expression and regulation of certain receptivity biomarkers including those of the anti-implantation mucin MUC1 and its upstream regulators of cytokines and transcriptional factors suggestive of heightened endometrial resistivity to the hormonal actions of progesterone at implantation in diabetes. Further immunological and molecular analyses of endometria obtained from diabetic mice revealed an augmented pro-inflammatory milieu and an aberrant expression of the PGR and two of its co-regulators, namely the protein inhibitor of activated STATy (PIASy) and the co-chaperone protein FKBP52 which are incompatible with successful implantation. Therapeutic interventions with tacrolimus abrogated these perturbations in endometrial PGR-mediated actions, restored glycemic control, promoted implantation and significantly inhibited fetal demise and malformations. Comparative studies with metformin suggested that factors beyond glycemic control are critically involved in the pathogenesis of failed implantation and diabetes- associated fetal malformations in the obese and diabetic subjects. These findings provide insights into molecular mechanisms linked to implantation failure in diabetes, and evidently demonstrate reproductive benefits for the pre-conceptional use of macrolide immunosuppression in subjects at risk thereof.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Socioemotional flexibility involves shifting in and out of emotion states, and the range of emotional states expressed during interpersonal interactions (Hollenstein et al., 2013). Previous research has shown that socioemotional flexibility is associated with greater psychosocial functioning, and its counterpart, rigidity, is associated with poor psychosocial functioning (van der Geissen, et al., 2014; Lougheed &amp; Hollenstein, 2016; van der Geissen, &amp; Bogels, 2017). In a longitudinal follow-up (Time 1, Lougheed &amp; Hollenstein, 2016), we examined socioemotional flexibility of in 54 mothers and their adolescent daughters (M age = 16 years old) at three different timescales: (1) within positive and negative contexts (dynamic flexibility), (2) across contexts (reactive flexibility), and (3) across 2 years (developmental flexibility), and associations with psychosocial functioning. Mothers-daughter dyads completed the Emotional Rollercoaster task—a series of five 3-minute discussions on times they felt the following strong emotions towards each other: (1) Happy/Excited, (2) Worried/Sad, (3) Proud, (4) Frustrated/Annoyed, and (5) Grateful. Findings support the Entrenchment hypothesis, as mother-daughter flexibility remained consistent over two years. In general, greater daughter psychosocial functioning was associated with greater dynamic and reactive flexibility in mother-daughter dyads. Contrary to findings at Time 1, mother psychosocial functioning was not associated with flexibility at Time 2. The changes that characterizes mother-daughter relationships in late adolescence (i.e., decreased mother authority, increased daughter autonomy, and increased internalizing symptoms) are explored as possible explanations for the shift in the associated factors of socioemotional flexibility from Time 1 to Time 2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The neuromodulator serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays an important role in controlling the induction threshold and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the visual cortex and hippocampus of rodents. Serotonergic fibers also innervate the rodent primary auditory cortex (A1), but the regulation of A1 plasticity by 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) is largely uncharted. Thus, we examined the role of several, predominant 5-HT receptor classes (5-HT1ARs, 5-HT2Rs, and 5-HT3Rs) in gating in vivo LTP induction at A1 synapses of adult, urethane-anesthetized rats. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) applied to the medial geniculate nucleus resulted in successful LTP induction of field postsynaptic potential generated by excitation of thalamocortical and intracortical A1 synapses. Local application (by reverse microdialysis in A1) of the broad-acting 5-HTR antagonist methiothepin suppressed LTP at both thalamocortical and intracortical synapses, an effect that was mimicked by the selective 5-HT2R antagonist ketanserin, but not the 5-HT1AR blocker WAY 100635. Interestingly, antagonism of 5-HT3Rs by granisetron selectively blocked LTP at thalamocortical, but not intracortical A1 synapses. Further, in the absence of TBS delivery, granisetron application resulted in a pronounced increase in fPSP amplitude, suggesting that 5-HT3Rs play an important role in regulating baseline (non-potentiated) transmission at A1 synapses. Together, these results indicate that activation of 5-HT2Rs and 5-HT3Rs, but not 5-HT1ARs, exerts a clear effect on LTP induction at A1 synapses, allowing 5-HT to act as a powerful regulator of long-term plasticity induction in the fully matured A1 of mammalian species.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The water quality issues facing aquatic systems have made managers and stakeholders seek help from computational and empirical models. A 3-D hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model was applied to storm-water ponds in the City of Edmonton to examine the reasons behind excessive algae growth and eutrophication. In the hydrodynamic simulation (ELCOM), the atmospheric instability corrections led to more heat loss (up to ~33%) and resulted in more accurate simulation of the temperature profiles (root mean square error (RMSE) &lt;3.03 ℃). The calibration involved tuning albedo and light attenuation coefficients, which was optimized by applying a sensitivity analysis tool that showed the model was more sensitive to albedo. Thereafter, the biogeochemical model (CAEDYM) was coupled with ELCOM and the water quality processes in the ponds were also investigated. The results demonstrated that the model predicted nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) components and dissolved oxygen (DO) variability with acceptable accuracy (0.016 mg/L &lt; RMSE &lt;2.85 mg/L), but underestimated the chlorophyll-a (RMSE &lt;64.3 μg/L). However, the model predicted phytoplankton community contribution to the total chlorophyll-a with marginal error (&lt;40% for different groups). &#xD;
An empirical DO model, based on the measurements of hypolimnetic DO (to estimate DO depletion; dDO/dt) and the temperature profiles (to estimate hypolimnion thickness; H) in three lakes (Lake Erie, Lake Simcoe and Eagle Lake) was proposed. The model was developed by neglecting the vertical and horizontal fluxes in the DO budget during summer and considering only sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and hypolimnion oxygen demand (HOD) as the main parameters driving dDO/dt. HOD and SOD were empirically estimated by fitting to the observed dDO/dt and H. Thereafter, using computed H, estimated SOD and HOD and an initial DO, the hypolimnetic DO were simulated in the selected lakes (RMSE &lt;2.67 mg/L). One of the main assumptions of the empirical prediction of DO, negligible vertical DO flux, was then examined by computing the flux of DO through the thermocline in Eagle Lake from microstructure casts. It is shown that the amount of vertical flux toward hypolimnion is 2 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than the other terms of the DO budget (HOD and SOD).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A wrist motion simulator or wrist motion actuator is a system that actuates a cadaver wrist to control the joint and move it through a variety of motions. Active wrist motion actuators apply forces directly to the tendons of interest to manipulate wrist position in a manner similar to in-vivo active motion. &#xD;
&#xD;
Active wrist motion actuators have been approached in many diﬀerent ways, how ever no clear design standard has been developed. Existing systems often require hardware and software proprietary to the investigators, preventing other researchers from easily replicating the work. This thesis presents the development and testing of an economical, accessible and open-source wrist motion actuation system. The full design, software code and ﬁles needed to replicate the device are all available from an online repository. &#xD;
&#xD;
An open-source system of four linear actuators driven by a micro-controller was developed to apply tension to cadaver wrist tendons under program control. The control algorithm compared current wrist angular position with a target position as a function of time and generated actuator motions to move the wrist towards the target position. &#xD;
&#xD;
The actuation system was tested with a soft embalmed cadaver wrist that was suture connected to the system using four tendon attachment points. The system of four linear actuators driven by the micro-controller applied tension to the sutures under program control. Wrist angular position data was collected in real time using an electromagnetic tracking system and delivered to the Actuation System via serial communication link. The system was tested by taking the wrist through 25 cycles of ﬁve diﬀerent motions: ﬂexion-extension, radioulnar deviation, dart throw, clockwise and counter-clockwise circumduction and angular position data was recorded as a function of time. &#xD;
&#xD;
This work shows that a functional wrist motion actuator can be constructed based on an economical micro-controller system to provide adequate control of four tendons through a simple C program.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the hydrodynamic performance of a tail-fin abstraction of Anomalocaris canadensis, a large arthropod from the Cambrian period believed to have been an apex predator. Through direct force measurements and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, it was found that a flat plate with a multi-vane geometry inspired by preservations of Anomalocaris exhibited a region of enhanced steady-state lift and drag at angles of attack greater than 25° when compared to an equivalent delta-wing plate. These shapes showed little difference during acceleration from rest; however, at an angle of attack of 30°, the lift and drag measured on the multi-vane model were 15.3% and 17.0% higher than the delta-wing model, respectively. It was found that the secondary and tertiary vanes of the tail-fin abstraction encourage the formation of additional leading-edge vortices, similar to those frequently seen on natural propulsors. The formation of these additional leading-edge vortices is confirmed by the increase in streamwise circulation measured using particle image velocimetry near the additional leading edges along the length of the chord. The results of the current study suggest that the enhanced resultant normal force on the tail fin of Anomalocaris made it well-suited for manoeuvres, giving it the ability to turn quickly and through small radii of curvature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Taking the It Gets Better Project as its case study, this thesis argues that the ways in which the project represents trauma is through an events-based model that centers the experiences of young, cis, white, gay boys. This is accomplished through a narrative of trauma that puts forward the idea that all queer youth experience trauma as an effect of being queer and that through this normalization they are positioned as all experiencing trauma in the same way. Furthermore, this framing is based upon the centering of sexuality as the primary way trauma manifests, which erases experiences of trauma that are marked by other axes of identity. The first chapter introduces my political commitments and a theoretical framework for interpreting the It Gets Better Project’s representations of trauma. The second chapter addresses the ways in which the project’s mantra, “it gets better,” constructs a linear teleology of queer suffering through an affective attachment to happiness and a melancholic attachment to the figure of the innocent child. The third chapter situates the It Gets Better Project within a broader discourse of queer liberalism to suggest that the project itself works to strengthen the borders of the Canadian and American nation-states. The conclusion suggests that a different practice of reading or remembering death, one attentive to questions of history, can gesture towards a future where ‘it’ can ‘get better.’</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Animation retargeting is a method of producing human-like animations for use in research, video games, and movies. The procedure consists of capturing the motion of a performer and applying it to a computerized avatar. In practice, the body shape of the avatar can be very different from the body shape of the original performer. Such animations are called inconsistent because they are generated from mismatching shape and motion components. However, actions seen in day-to-day life are typically composed of correlated and consistent information. As a result of this exposure it is believed that the visual system builds up expectations regarding the way a person should look and move. Here I asked whether the human visual system has a special sensitivity to shape-motion inconsistency that would modify the perception of realistic animations. I recorded 10 male performers with either light or heavy body weight carrying out three actions: pushing, lifting, and throwing objects. I extracted shape and motion estimates from each performer, creating consistent and inconsistent animations whose shape and motion components were either from the same performer or combined from performers in different body weight groups. I conducted three experiments in an immersive virtual reality environment. First, when tasked with detecting shape-motion inconsistency, participants had a small ability to select the inconsistent stimuli instead of the consistent stimuli over chance levels. Next, using judgements of animation characteristics as an alternative measure of sensitivity, I assessed the effect of inconsistency on perceived eeriness, humanness, and attractiveness of consistent and inconsistent stimuli. None of these measures were affected by inconsistency. However, in a final experiment where I asked performers to rate the perceived weight and thrown distance of objects, I found an influence of shape-motion inconsistency on the perception of action outcomes. This indicates that the visual system relies on its knowledge of shape and motion to perceive realistic human animations. I propose that animated avatars that involve object manipulations may present an opportunity for the visual system to reinterpret inconsistency as a change in the dynamics of an object, rather than as an unexpected combination of body shape and body motion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Adropin is a peptide hormone with cardiovascular and metabolic roles in the periphery, including effects on glucose and lipid homeostasis. Central administration of adropin has been shown to inhibit water intake in rats; however, the site at which central adropin acts has yet to be elucidated. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a critical autonomic control center, plays essential roles in the control of fluid balance, energy homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation, and is therefore a potential target for centrally-acting adropin. In the present study, we used whole- cell patch-clamp techniques to examine the effects of adropin on the excitability of neurons within the PVN. All three neuronal subpopulations (magnocellular, preautonomic, and neuroendocrine) in the PVN were found to be responsive to bath-application of 10 nM adropin, which elicited responses in 68% of cells tested (n = 57/84). The majority of cells (58%) depolarized (5.2 ± 0.3 mV; n = 49) in response to adropin, while the remaining responsive cells (10%) hyperpolarized (−3.4 ± 0.5 mV; n = 8), effects which were shown to be concentration-dependent. Additionally, responses were maintained in the presence of 1 μM tetrodotoxin in 75% of cells tested (n = 9/12), and voltage-clamp analysis revealed that adropin had no effect on the amplitude or frequency of excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) in PVN neurons, suggesting the peptide exerts direct, postsynaptic actions on these neurons. The electrophysiological effects of adropin on PVN neurons appear to be mediated partly by modulation of the transient potassium current. Collectively, these findings suggest central adropin may exert its physiological effects through direct actions on neurons in the PVN.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A novel Lagrangian force estimation technique for unsteady fluid flows has been developed, using the concept of a Darwinian drift volume to measure the unsteady force on an accelerating body. A methodology using multiple drift volumes is described and evaluated on an experimental test case containing highly-separated, vortical flow. The inherent advantage of the force estimation technique presented is that, unlike many modern Eulerian techniques, gradient operations and near-body measurements are not required to be calculated. These noise amplifying processes are avoided since the drift volume is calculated only from particle displacements in the flow field, reducing the importance of having high quality acceleration and spatial gradient data near walls and in regions of high shear. The resultant unsteady force estimates from the proposed technique are shown to align with the measured drag force during high accelerations, a region in which comparable methods suffer. The critical aspects of understanding unsteady flows, relating to peak and time-resolved forces, often lie within the acceleration phase of the motions, which are well-captured by the drift-volume approach. Therefore, this Lagrangian force estimation technique opens the door to fluid-dynamic analyses in areas that, until now, were inaccessible by conventional means.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the last decade, the conversation surrounding racial profiling and carding in the city of Toronto garnered much public and scholarly attention. Many journalists, academics and activists have examined the Community Contacts Policy, also known as carding, as well as mass incarceration and the police shootings and killings of unarmed, young Black men. The Yonge Street Uprising and the carding controversy in Toronto serve as two case studies to explore the ways that Black men have been disproportionately profiled, policed and surveilled in this country, particularly in the province of Ontario. Despite the fact that the Yonge Street Uprising and the carding controversy occurred decades apart, a common thread throughout both cases was the narrative of Black male criminality. In addition, it became apparent that many of the practices employed in contemporary society, such as racial profiling, carding and mass incarceration were derived from slavery, with the goal of limiting the freedom and mobility of Black people. Therefore, an examination of Canada’s historical treatment of Black people is necessary in order to demonstrate how practices rooted in slavery, such as, fugitive slave advertisements and historical representations of Black criminality helped inform current police practices. Through an analysis of historical, legal, criminological, and critical race scholarship, this work seeks to examine how and why Black people, specifically Black men, were and continue to be disproportionately more likely to be policed, surveilled and incarcerated. In addition, neighborhood contexts were examined to determine whether there was a relationship between police stop and search practices among different neighborhoods. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data gathered from various bodies of criminological and legal research, and reports commissioned by the Ontario government, provide support for the theory that the Canadian state criminalize and incarcerates certain populations it deems undesirable. Additionally, a consistent theme throughout this analysis was a heightened sense of anxiety and threat that whites have historically exemplified in relation to Black immigration, mobilization and resistance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The focus of this thesis is probabilistic analysis of unreinforced and reinforced soil slopes using the random finite element method (RFEM). RFEM combines the finite element method (FEM) with soil properties that are described by either random (homogeneous) or spatial variability.  &#xD;
The RFEM approach is used for the first time to investigate the influence of spatially variable cohesive soil strength on probabilistic margins of safety for bearing capacity failure of a footing located close to the crest of a slope. Analyses showed that the coefficient of variation and the spatial correlation length of soil cohesion can have a large influence on footing bearing capacity, particularly for slopes with large height to footing width ratios. &#xD;
Probabilistic slope stability analyses of simple geosynthetic reinforced soil slopes were carried out for the first time using the shear strength reduction method in combination with the RFEM approach. The FEM code was modified to include bar elements to model horizontal layers of geosynthetic reinforcement. Analysis results demonstrate that large reductions in probability of failure can be realized by adding geosynthetic reinforcement layers to constructed slopes.&#xD;
The same modified RFEM code was used to carry out probabilistic stability analyses of constructed wrapped-face reinforced slopes (or embankments) using frictional soils. The influence of fill placed at different layer thickness and compacted to different levels was simulated by adjusting the soil strength and unit weight, and the vertical spatial correlation length in the anisotropic spatially variable strength field used in each slope realization. Numerical results showed that vertical spatial correlation lengths approaching the magnitude of fill lift heights can control the probability of failure for reinforced slopes constructed with weak fills placed in lift heights close to but less than the wrapped reinforcement spacing used in the study.&#xD;
The RFEM codes developed in this study are used next to carry out numerical simulations of physical full-scale unreinforced and reinforced embankments loaded to failure using a strip footing. The results of analyses showed that the assumption of vertical spatial variability in soil properties due to compaction was able to capture the observed failure mechanisms in these structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>CO2-switchable materials use CO2 as the trigger. Their mechanism is the reversible protonation of tertiary amines or amidines in aqueous solution, in the absence or presence of CO2. The application of CO2-switchable materials is also useful in other areas of polymer chemistry, such as ATRP (Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization) and the preparation of polymer latexes. Firstly, CO2-switchable ligands, solvents and photo-catalyst were used individually or jointly to recycle ligands and purify polymer made by ATRP. Secondly, artificial polymer latexes, such as poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA), were separately prepared from bulk polymers using the CO2-switchable solvents. The joint use of the two approaches mentioned above can produce polymer latexes with controlled molecular weight, but without impurities such as ligand or metal catalyst. Also, a new benign means was developed for reversibly breaking emulsions and latexes using CO2-switchable water, an aqueous solution of switchable ionic strength. Furthermore, living CO2-switchable PMMA latexes were prepared using reverse ATRP emulsion polymerization and AGET ATRP miniemulsion polymerization; the prepared latexes can be switched between the aggregated and dispersed states using only CO2 as the trigger.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Workplace mental health has increasingly become a public health concern in Canada as employees are missing work every week because of a mental health issue, costing the Canadian economy billions annually. This is the first study to examine occupational prestige and its relationship to perceived public stigma, mental health experiences of stigma, and professional help-seeking. &#xD;
Methods: Cross-sectional survey data on a nationally representative sample of working Canadians between the ages of 15 and 75 from Statistics Canada’s 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and rapid response stigma modules were used to explore both objectives (N=10,389). SAS 9.4 was used to conduct complex survey data analyses, all of which incorporated Statistics Canada’s recommended sampling weights and bootstrap variance estimation procedures. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to examine the associations between occupational prestige, perceived public stigma toward depression, mental health experiences of stigma during the past 12 months because of a past or current emotional or mental health problem, and professional help-seeking. Considered covariates included: gender, age, ethnic or cultural background, education, household income, marital status, number of dependent children, chronic physical condition, self-rated general mental health, and contact with a work colleague who has received treatment for a mental illness.   &#xD;
Results: Controlling for perceived public stigma in the direct effect between occupational prestige and professional help-seeking (ORdirect=0.994, 95% CI: 0.970-1.020) did not attenuate the total effect between occupational prestige and professional help-seeking, without controlling for perceived public stigma (ORtotal=0.995, 95% CI: 0.972-1.020). The confidence interval for the indirect effect of perceived public stigma toward depression as a mediator in the relationship between occupational prestige and professional help-seeking crossed the null value of one (ORindirect=0.999, 95% CI: 0.949-1.053), indicating that perceived public stigma toward depression is not an important mediator. Higher occupational prestige scores significantly reduced the odds of experienced stigma during the past 12 months because of a past or current emotional or mental health problem (OR=0.954, 95% CI: 0.913-0.998). Occupational prestige was not significantly associated with negative opinions or unfair treatment affecting work life (OR=0.945, 95% CI: 0.762-1.173).     &#xD;
Conclusion: Perceived public stigma toward depression is not an important mediator in the explored relationship between occupational prestige and professional help-seeking. Higher occupational prestige scores might facilitate resistance against mental health experiences of stigma.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project focuses on voluntary organizing by the patriots and their use of the press between 1834 and 1842 in the Canadas and the United States, particularly in relation to the Canadian Rebellion of 1837–1838. The dissertation argues that historians should conceive of the Rebellion as an attempt by the patriots to establish a new order through the press and voluntary associations, both before and after the outbreak of insurrection. First constitutionalists and then patriots turned to militarized organizing as a natural outgrowth of their voluntarist values. The press was an important factor in this organizing and beginning in 1836 saw the rise of a “patriot press” in Upper and Lower Canada. These newspapers existed as a republican borderland: they were committed to republicanism and independence for the Canadas and therefore sought to transcend the border by erasing the boundary between monarchy and republic in North America. Past scholarship on the Rebellion has been segmented by “pre” and “post” 1837 and selective focus amongst Lower Canada, Upper Canada, or the United States. Studies have also concentrated heavily on the secret society, the Hunter’s Lodges, and their incursions into the Canadas. The dissertation instead explores the evolving interplay between military organizing and civil society both in the U.S. and the Canadas, demonstrating the surprising extent to which this military organizing has been rooted in and shaped by traditions of liberal voluntary associations and the press. Going beyond the narrow time-frame of the Rebellion, the dissertation provides a comprehensive and longer-term picture of how the patriot press continued and changed with its exile in the United States. The dissertation outlines the catalytic and animating role played by patriot editors in fostering a sense of community and common cause amongst patriots and their sympathizers as well as in engaging combatively with their constitutionalist counterparts in the Canadas. Also documented are the activities undertaken by patriot editors to police vigilantly the boundaries and membership of patriot organizations, particularly in respect to minorities, and to seek to delineate acceptable roles for women in patriot organizing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Within this thesis, I seek to dismantle the dominant narrative pertaining to transnational labour exploitation of garment workers by using the relationship between Canada and Bangladesh as sites of analysis. Overall, the goals of this project are to challenge dominant Canadian understandings of the exploitation of Bangladeshi women workers, and to disrupt the saviour narrative that has launched various ineffective global solidarity projects. I achieve these goals by highlighting the ways in which capitalism, white feminism, and global development programs impact garment workers in Canada and Bangladesh. My project is unique because within it, I bring together the insights of scholars who theorize separately about the Global North and Global South, while also conceptualizing the issue of labour exploitation as a transnational issue, caused by the collective global forces of capitalism, international development, and white feminism. I compare similarities in the struggles faced by garment workers in both Bangladesh and Canada, while also noting how they exhibit agency and challenge exploitation. The research methods that I employ in this project include institutional ethnography, archival research, and personal interviews. I conclude this project by offering more effective approaches to attaining solidarity with garment workers transnationally.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Breast density and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) have both been linked to breast cancer risk. Prior research has shown an overwhelmingly positive association between these two factors, but almost exclusively in pre-menopausal women. In fact, few studies have focused on this relationship in post-menopausal women. Evidence suggests that reproductive hormones, like estrogen, might play a role in the overarching pathways connecting IGF-I, breast density, and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objective: The objectives of this thesis were to examine the relationship between IGF-I and breast density in post-menopausal women, and then determine if there was any effect modification of this association by estrogen level.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: This thesis focused on a cohort of 568 post-menopausal women from a clinical trial that analyzed the efficacy of exemestane in reducing breast cancer risk. Cumulus software was used to calculate percent breast density values from provided mammograms. These values were then dichotomized as being either low (&lt; 25%) or moderately high (≥ 25%). IGF-I concentrations were determined by ELISA from collected serum samples, and then standardized prior to data analysis. The association between IGF-I level (standardized) and percent breast density (dichotomized) was analyzed using multivariable modified Poisson regression. In addition, log-transformed percent breast density values were used to measure the association through multiple linear regression. Effect modification by treatment arm (i.e. exemestane or placebo) was examined to determine if estrogen level plays any part in this relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Percent breast density values were lower than anticipated (μ = 5.54%) with few women (13.9%) being classified as having moderately high breast density. Serum IGF-I levels were higher than expected (μ = 178.52 ng/mL), due in large part to exemestane administration. After identifying and controlling for potential covariates, there was no significant association detected between IGF-I and percent breast density in either its dichotomized (p = 0.30) or log-transformed (p = 0.60) form. The inclusion of an interaction term also returned a non-significant result for effect modification of these relationships by estrogen level.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: There was no observed association between IGF-I and breast density in postmenopausal women. This was seen regardless of estrogen level, as determined by treatment arm.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Calcium (Ca2+) is one of the most ubiquitous and versatile second messengers in eukaryotes. In the Ca2+ signaling paradigm, cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, evoked by environmental stimuli, are detected by Ca2+-binding proteins, termed Ca2+ sensors, that help coordinate physiological responses by binding to and regulating the activities of various other proteins. Calmodulin (CaM) is an evolutionarily-conserved eukaryotic Ca2+ sensor involved in many signal transduction pathways. Intriguingly, plants also possess large families of unique Ca2+sensors related to CaM and known as calmodulin-like (CML) proteins. Several CMLs have been implicated in developmental and stress-response signaling but the roles of most CMLs remain unknown.  Among these CMLs, CML39 is of particular interest due to its roles in early seedling establishment. The focus of my thesis was to determine whether CML39 played additional roles in plant development and to also characterize the mechanism(s) underlying CML39-mediated physiological phenomena. Thus, I employed a multi-disciplinary approach to address this question.  Detailed analysis of cml39 T-DNA insertional knockout plants under various developmental stages identified several abnormalities in these mutants. Relative to wild-type (WT), cml39 displayed aberrant germination behaviour, reduced hormone sensitivity in seeds, altered seed coat characteristics, reduced fertility and de-repression of seed maturation genes in seedlings. The pleiotropic phenotype of cml39 mutants confirms that CML39 regulates diverse aspects of plant development. RNAseq analysis of cml39 seedlings revealed broad perturbations in global gene expression and provided some insight into CML39-regulated pathways.  In addition, two trihelix transcription factors, Arabidopsis 6b-interacting 1-like (ASIL) -1 and -2, were found to interact with CML39 in yeast 2-hybrid and in planta split-luciferase protein-protein interaction analysis, suggesting that CML39 may regulate gene transcription in some tissues.  Genetic analysis of cml39 and asil mutants indicated that CML39-ASIL interaction may be responsible for dormancy maintenance in developing seeds and repression of seed maturation program in vegetative tissue. Collectively, the findings presented in this thesis suggest that CML39 plays an integral role in regulation of seed- and fruit development, dormancy induction and maintenance, hormone sensitivity of seeds, and transition from seed to seedling phase, thus emphasizing the significance of this Ca2+ sensor in plant development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose:  The purposes of this study of 10-13 year old children were to: (1) determine if time spent in different domains of physical activity was independently associated with selected cardio-metabolic risk factors, and (2) estimate whether replacing time in one domain of physical activity with time in another domain of physical activity was associated with changes in cardio-metabolic risk factors. &#xD;
Methods: 385 children aged 10-13 years were studied. Participants wore a Garmin Forerunner 220 GPS watch, an Actical accelerometer, and completed an activity log for 7 consecutive days during the school year.  Data from these measures was used to estimate average minutes/day spent in active transportation, outdoor active play, organized sport, and curriculum-based physical activity at school. Percent body fat, resting heart rate, and systolic blood pressure were measured using automated equipment.  Isotemporal substitution regression models were used to estimate changes in cardio-metabolic risk factors that occurred when time spent in each domain of physical activity was replaced with an equivalent amount of time in another domain. &#xD;
Results: After adjusting for covariates, outdoor active play was associated with body fat % (β = -.058, 95% CI = -.095, -.021) and organized sport was associated with resting heart rate (β = -.040, 95% CI = -.071, -.009).  In the isotemporal substitution models, replacing 10 minutes/day of organized sport with outdoor active play was favourably associated with body fat % (β = -.048, 95% CI = -.094 to -.002) and replacing 10 minutes/day of active transportation with organized sport was favourably associated with resting heart rate (β = -.109, 95% CI = -.197, -.020). &#xD;
Conclusion: These findings suggest that replacing time spent in organized sport with an equal amount of time in active play may have beneficial effects on body fat and that replacing time spent in active transportation with an equal time in organized sport may improve resting heart rate. No significant effects were observed when curriculum-based physical activity was replaced by another domain of activity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research into the history of education provides powerful insights for answering a philosophical question of central importance: namely, what is the purpose of education. While recent research has emphasized looking to the past few centuries, investigating the educational practices of ancient societies is also valuable. The education available in the Byzantine Empire is particularly useful to examine. This society existed for a millennium and contributed substantially to the development of many aspects of the world as we know it today. In contradiction to its importance, however, its study has been neglected by historians of education.&#xD;
The education of the early Byzantine Empire (4th-6th centuries) is particularly interesting to explore, as society shifted in religious belief from pagan pluralism to Christianity. This religious transition led to questions on the nature and purpose of education as compromise was sought between the two religions. Such a struggle for educational compromise parallels contemporary Canadian society, where, as well-attested in the literature, a formerly Christian society is adjusting to one of pluralism and religious tolerance.&#xD;
Education in the early Byzantine Empire is presented in the literature as the bailiwick of the elite. Even as society Christianized, historians of education emphasize that educational practices remained those inherited from a pagan past. This assertion is complicated, however, by scholars of early Christianity who identify the rise of Christian monasticism and its “educational” capacity. While the pagan educational practices are well described as literary in nature, the means of monastic education is ambiguous.&#xD;
This study reconciles these two scholarly traditions, drawing on monastic primary sources to describe the literate education available within Christian monasteries of Late Antique Palestine. It then goes further, exploring the impact literate monks had on the Christianization of Byzantine society, and recursively, the impact this newly Christian society had on monasticism.&#xD;
This thesis contributes significantly to an understanding of the intersection between education and religion. Value is also to be found in the form of education that is revealed – an education not concerned with advancement and worldly gain, but one of self-improvement and spiritual growth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As development cycles and prototyping iterations begin to decrease in the aerospace industry, it is important to develop and improve practical methodologies to meet all design metrics. This research presents an efficient methodology that applies high-fidelity multi-disciplinary design optimization techniques to commercial landing gear assemblies, for weight reduction, cost savings, and structural performance dynamic loading. Specifically, a slave link subassembly was selected as the candidate to explore the feasibility of this methodology. The design optimization process utilized in this research was sectioned into three main stages: setup, optimization, and redesign.&#xD;
The first stage involved the creation and characterization of the models used throughout this research. The slave link assembly was modelled with a simplified landing gear test, replicating the behavior of the physical system. Through extensive review of the literature and collaboration with Safran Landing Systems, dynamic and structural behavior for the system were characterized and defined mathematically. Once defined, the characterized behaviors for the slave link assembly were then used to conduct a Multi-Body Dynamic (MBD) analysis to determine the dynamic and structural response of the system. These responses were then utilized in a topology optimization through the use of the Equivalent Static Load Method (ESLM). The results of the optimization were interpreted and later used to generate improved designs in terms of weight, cost, and structural performance under dynamic loading in stage three. The optimized designs were then validated using the model created for the MBD analysis of the baseline design.&#xD;
The design generation process employed two different approaches for post-processing the topology results produced.  The first approach implemented a close replication of the topology results, resulting in a design with an overall peak stress increase of 74%, weight savings of 67%, and no apparent cost savings due to complex features present in the design. The second design approach focused on realizing reciprocating benefits for cost and weight savings. As a result, this design was able to achieve an overall peak stress increase of 6%, weight and cost savings of 36%, and 60%, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the many possible negative outcomes of pathogen evolution is the emergence of a virulent drug resistant strain. A pathogen may exploit plasmid-mediated gene transfer to gain drug resistance and virulence genes in an attempt to become the exclusive infection. To answer questions on the possible emergence of a virulent drug resistant strain we constructed a nine dimensional SIS model with treatment. We used plasmid-mediated gene transfer by way of superinfection to distribute virulence and drug resistance genes. By examining the resulting system of differential equations at the two extremes of treatment level (%0 and %100), we determined the stability of the single strain endemic infection equilibrium points of interest. In the absence of treatment we determined a set of ancestral conditions which provided constraints on the model parameters. In the presence of treatment we focused on the ability of the&#xD;
virulent drug resistant (AB) strain to invade the avirulent drug resistant (B) strain. We were able to express these invasion conditions in terms of novel reproductive ratios that incorporated both non-superinfection effects and superinfection effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our model reveals that plasmid-mediated gene transfer by way of superinfection increases the parameter space allowing for virulence to evolve in a drug resistant population. However, virulence in a drug resistant population is not always more&#xD;
likely to evolve in comparison to virulence in a drug sensitive population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Our visual world is observed as a complete and continuous percept. However, the nature of eye &#xD;
movements, saccades, preclude this illusion at the sensory level of the retina.  Current theories suggest &#xD;
that visual short-term memory (VSTM) may allow for this perceptual illusion through spatial updating of &#xD;
object locations. While spatial updating has been demonstrated to impose a cost on the precision of spatial &#xD;
memory, it is unknown whether saccades also influence feature memory. This thesis investigated whether &#xD;
there is a cost of spatial updating on VSTM of non-spatial features. To this end, participants performed &#xD;
comparisons of features (location, orientation, size) between two bars presented sequentially with or &#xD;
without an intervening saccade. In addition, dependent on the block condition, they had to compare either &#xD;
one of the features or all three features; to test for memory load effects. Saccades imposed a cost on &#xD;
precision of location memory of the first bar in addition to a direction-specific bias; this effect held with &#xD;
greater memory load. Orientation memory became less precise with saccades, and with greater memory &#xD;
load resulted in a remembered rotation of the first bar opposite to the direction of the saccade. Finally, &#xD;
after a saccade, participants consistently underestimated the size of the first bar in addition to being less &#xD;
precise; the precision effect did not hold with greater memory load. Together, the current findings &#xD;
implicate a cost on feature memory with saccades – suggesting that non-spatial feature memory is &#xD;
updated along with their spatial locations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: People with depression struggle with cognitive impairments such as decreased working memory. The brain areas associated with working memory, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are negatively affected by depression; studies have shown decreased volume, activity, and disturbed brain connectivity. Currently, there is a lack of treatment options for improving working memory in depressed patients. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on working memory was explored. iTBS has been shown to be effective in treating mood, increasing plasticity and inducing neurogenesis. These findings suggest a potential for iTBS as a treatment tool for working memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine whether iTBS treatment is associated with improvement in working memory, and connectivity changes between areas in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and the rest of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: We recruited 10 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients received the standard 25 days of iTBS treatment. We used the n-back (2-back) task to test working memory during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Participants received a fMRI scan before and after the final iTBS treatment. Participants also completed clinical measures (i.e., depression scales) before and after their treatments. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The participants did not show significant improvements in mood and the n-back task (accuracy and reaction time) after the iTBS treatments. There were significant changes in functional connectivity during the resting state scans and for the 0 and 2 back conditions of the n-back task between various areas including the left hippocampus and the frontal poles with structures such as the caudate, occipital cortex, lingual gyrus and the temporal lobe. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: Our pilot study showed that iTBS treatment may not be an effective tool for improving behavioural performance on the n-back task. However, the significant functional connectivity changes suggest that iTBS may be responsible for beneficial brain changes in depressed patients. These changes could be explained by increased efficiency and/or cognitive control in the context of the n-back task. Future research with sham controlled design and different working memory tasks are needed to determine the effects of iTBS treatment on WM.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the new applications which benefi t from the exploitation of the digital circuits in the design of RF circuits. Two main applications presented here are the recon figurable circuits design, essential for the design of optimal power consumption receivers and the boost of a circuit's performance beyond its RF-only design&#xD;
limits. The concept of the fi rst environment-aware receiver architecture is introduced for the study of the former application along with a novel, recon figurable, highly linear active mixer. The latter application's practicality is studied through the design of an active phase shifter with improved accuracy regarding its RMS phase and amplitude&#xD;
errors.&#xD;

The Environment-aware receiver is introduced as a method for achieving an optimal power consumption with the minimum required quality of service of a certain standard. This receiver takes advantage from the use of a channel sensing receiving path to estimate the required phase noise and main linearity merits, IIP3 and P1dB.&#xD;
A novel highly linear, recon figurable mixer with four states of power consumption and linearity is designed based on the dynamic current injection method, introduced in this work. The mixer is a crucial part of the proper adjustment of IIP3 and P1dB of the environment-aware receiver. A set of switches in the LO and IF stage of the mixer help in the achievement of the recon figurable mixer.  The dynamic current injection method, used in this design is studied and developed using a pair of cross-coupled pMOS devices. This method improves the linearity of the active mixer without increasing the power consumption or any significant deterioration of other important merits of the mixer.&#xD;
&#xD;
The accuracy of an active phase shifter is improved beyond its RF-only fundamental limits by the use of a  fine passive vector scaling mechanism. While the OTA used in this work introduces large phase gaps and limiting the maximum possible accuracy to 4-bits, the 4-state  ne scaling mechanism improves the possible accuracy to 6-bits without increasing the power consumption of the design.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In Arctic regions subsurface flow is often a dominant flow path of water, especially as the thaw depth progresses and the active layer water storage capacity increases. Subsurface flow through the active layer is important for water delivery to streams and can be potentially routed through subsurface preferential flow pathways (PFP). The majority of research on subsurface hydrological PFP has occurred in the subarctic where organic soils and discontinuous permafrost are predominant. Research on such pathways in the High Arctic where mineral soils with minimal organic layer dominate is limited. This thesis investigated the hydrological response during active layer development in a dominantly mineral soil to understand how soil subsurface and surface water interactions are conditioned by the presence and seasonal development of PFP pathways in a headwater subcatchment at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory, Melville Island, Nunavut.  Subsurface flow and PFP were examined through  cryostructure analysis from two active layer cores, and seasonal active layer development.  A network of piezometers was also installed across four land cover types (high and low hummock, mesic slope, polar semi-desert, and an area with established soil pipe drainage) to evaluate hydrological function of preferential pathways. Electrical conductivity (EC) and stable water isotopes were collected from piezometers to further infer subsurface water sources. Results indicate that drainage and saturation of soil from water in the subsurface is spatially and temporally heterogeneous in High Arctic mineral soils. The timing of the activation (effective drainage) and deactivation (termination of drainage) of subsurface water pathways was similarly heterogeneous across the study site. The timing and depth of the activation of pathways demonstrates that varying cryostructure at depth triggered the emergence of substantial water at select locations. Finally stable isotopes indicate that the source of water moving through the subsurface varies spatially and temporally over short distances with seasonal progressions from rain water to snow/ground ice, and vice versa. This knowledge provides primary observations towards understanding subsurface preferential flow pathways in a High Arctic catchment and the importance of PFP on water delivery to streams in the late thaw season.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rockfalls threaten communities and infrastructure in mountainous regions worldwide and have been a particularly problematic hazard along the transportation corridors in western Canada. These types of failures are traditionally managed using rockfall hazard management frameworks that are based on a historical analysis of rockfall activity. These frameworks do not fully consider the complexity of the natural rock slopes, nor indicate where and when a potential failure may occur. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has been beneficial for monitoring and assessing rock slope hazards and has the potential to identify incipient signs of rock slope failure. &#xD;
The aim of this thesis is to use TLS to better manage rockfall hazard along transportation corridors by including quantitative measures of precursor activity into hazard analysis strategies and through the development of near-real time automated TLS systems for early warning purposes. &#xD;
In the first part of the thesis, monitoring at 2-3-month intervals was conducted with TLS at a variety of rock slopes located along the CN Rail line in the Thompson River valley over the four-year duration of this research. Over one hundred rockfalls in the range of 0.1 to 4200 m3, exhibiting precursor activity in the form of pre-failure deformation, smaller precursor rockfalls and tension crack openings were studied and compiled into a database. The approach included: (i) identifying potential rockfall source zones based on incipient signs of failure; (ii) tracking kinematics in three dimensions to better understand the mechanisms of failure; (iii) estimating potential failure volumes based on bounding joint structure; and (iv) transmitting this information to the railway operator for an assessment of risk. &#xD;
	The second part of the thesis focused on monitoring at near continuous levels, which is required to identify the accelerating phase prior to rockfall failure which is necessary to forecast failure time in early warning systems. A complete series of analysis tools was developed to process and analyze TLS data autonomously in near real-time.  This included tools to filter outliers, register point clouds, conduct change detection using spatial and temporal neighbourhood averaging and to display time series of deformation. The system was tested for a 6-week period at a rockslide in the French alps. &#xD;
	The contributions in this thesis (i) enhance current rockfall hazard analysis methods by including quantitative measurements of precursor activity, (ii) improve our understanding of the pre-failure stage of rock slope failures and (iii) opened the door for future studies of rock slope failure at a high temporal density using TLS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The endothelium is a single layer of cells that lines the inside of all arteries, the proper functioning of which is essential for vasoprotection and control of arterial dilation.  Blood flow through an artery produces a frictional force on the endothelium called shear stress, which causes the artery to dilate.  A larger magnitude of this ‘flow-mediated dilation’ (FMD) response indicates greater endothelial function.  To date, FMD has primarily been experimentally assessed using a transient shear stress stimulus called reactive hyperemia (RH).  There is a paucity of research available which assesses FMD using sustained increases in shear stress, which are more similar to the shear stress stimuli that an artery experiences in everyday life.  Therefore, the objective of this dissertation was to further our understanding of the FMD response to sustained shear stress stimuli and how it is impacted acutely and chronically by endurance exercise.  Methods:  Repeated handgrip squeezing (HGEX) and calf plantar-flexion (LEX) were used create a sustained increase in shear stress, stimulating FMD in the brachial and superficial femoral arteries respectively.  1) HGEX-FMD was assessed before and after an acute bout of high-intensity exercise.  The mechanisms of exercise’s effect on HGEX-FMD were interrogated via the consumption of the antioxidant vitamin C.  2) In the superficial femoral artery, the repeat-trial stability of LEX-FMD was compared to RH-FMD.  3) The EX-FMD and RH-FMD responses to 4 weeks of endurance exercise training were assessed in the brachial and superficial femoral arteries.  Results: 1) Brachial artery HGEX-FMD was augmented by high intensity endurance exercise, and this effect was abolished by vitamin C consumption, suggesting a role of oxidative stress in this adaptation.  2) Superficial femoral artery LEX-FMD was shown to increase systematically upon repeated trials, but RH-FMD did not.  3) Training improved brachial artery RH-FMD, but not HGEX-FMD and not LEX- or RH-FMD in the superficial femoral artery.  Conclusions: The FMD responses to sustained and transient shear stress stimuli are regionally different, functionally different, and differently effected by exercise-related interventions, supporting the idea that they measure different aspects of endothelial function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Steel truss bridges are an important component of the railway network across North America. A majority of this infrastructure has already exceeded its 100 year service life, making the monitoring of these structures critical to ensuring they have adequate capacity to handle the increasing freight loads. Visual inspection remains the primary monitoring method because of its cost and time effectiveness. However it can be subjective, produce varying results between inspectors, and is unable to accurately quantify damage or behaviour. The use of distributed fibre optic sensors has the potential to overcome the shortcomings of visual inspection, along with the added benefit of capturing thousands of measurements with a similar effort required to obtain a single measurement with conventional strain gauges. &#xD;
The current research investigated the use of distributed fibre optic strain measurement to monitor the behaviour of steel truss bridges. A scaled down model truss based on an in service railway bridge was constructed in a laboratory setting. The truss was monitored with both fibre optic sensors and linear potentiometers. The connection conditions were varied by either removing or loosening bolts between vertical and diagonal members. A response change was detected by both sensor technologies when all bolts were loosened versus tightened. Varying degrees of corrosion and cracking damage were simulated on members, and the strain changes in the members were detected using the distributed strain sensors. &#xD;
An in service rail bridge was monitored and static distributed strain measurements were taken as a train of known weight was placed at various positions along the bridge span. The same train then travelled across the bridge at varying speeds as dynamic measurements were taken. Finally, in service measurements for passenger and freight trains were also taken. The static measurements were used to detect localized variations in strain due to changing member geometry as well as global behaviour. The dynamic strain measurements for a train travelling at 4 km/h showed good correlation to the static measurements, however all dynamic measurements gave inconclusive results beyond the first 10 m of sensing fibre. In service vehicles could not be monitored at their normal travelling speed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A portable, digital-microfluidic device for aqueous-two-phase-based extractions is presented. Droplets (50 µL) consist of an aqueous-two-phase-system (sodium sulfate and polyethylene glycol) and an extractant (potassium iodide) to move Cd2+ ions selectively from a mixture of metal ions into the polyethylene glycol top phase.&#xD;
The droplets are confined by hydrophilic surface energy traps on a superhydrophobic substrate that is made of a commercially available coating (Ultra-EverDry™). Surface energy traps are generated by exposing specific regions of the surface to air plasma or by laser micro-machining, where a portion of the superhydrophobic coating is ablated and the hydrophilic glass underneath is exposed. A 3D-printed holder applies another surface energy trap on top of the droplet and&#xD;
lifts it. This allows one to precisely separate different volumes (0.19-14.91 µL) of the polyethylene glycol top phase depending on the surface energy trap size. &#xD;
Subsequent addition of an indicator dye to a separated aliquot of the top phase allows interference free, colorimetric detection of Cd2+ ions with a smartphone camera.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The increased occurrence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a major public health concern within Canada and the United States. NAS is a drug withdrawal syndrome caused by the abrupt cessation of prolonged prenatal exposure to opioids. Because of the increasing number of infants affected with NAS and subsequent increased utilization of hospital resources for NAS, research to improve NAS definition, measurement, and management is needed. This study aims to describe the presentation of NAS in neonates prenatally exposed to buprenorphine vs. methadone.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant women with opioid use disorder and their neonates.  Women were treated with buprenorphine or methadone based on clinical indicators and patient preference. Neonates were assessed using the 31-item Finnegan scale and scored every four hours, increasing to every two hours if NAS pharmacotherapy was initiated. Differences in NAS symptoms were compared among 34 buprenorphine-exposed neonates and 43 methadone-exposed neonates prior to and following NAS pharmacotherapy initiation were statistically assessed. Individual growth curve models (IGC) were applied to the Finnegan score data, adjusted for confounders, and NAS trajectories were plotted by prenatal exposure to buprenorphine or methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Prior to NAS pharmacotherapy initiation, four NAS symptoms were observed significantly more often in buprenorphine exposed neonates compared to methadone exposed neonates: continuous high pitched crying (76.5% vs. 32.6%), hyperactive Moro reflex (47.1% vs. 23.3%), nasal stuffiness (42.4% vs. 15.9%), and loose stools (50.0% vs. 23.3 Furthermore, we were able to successfully apply an IGC approach to modeling change trajectories to repeated Finnegan score data. Differences in NAS progression by prenatal opioid agonist therapy exposure were identified in neonates who required NAS pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: This is one of the first studies to investigate NAS symptom expression by prenatal opioid agonist therapy exposure to buprenorphine and methadone. This study will provide a resource for other researchers to apply these novel procedures which have not been previously used in pediatric research. The findings from this study provide insight into how these two prenatal medications affect NAS symptom expression and NAS progression allowing healthcare professionals to improve NAS definition, measurement, and management.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Leakage phenomena for two types of tailings overlying a 1 cm diameter geomembrane defect were studied. The first type of tailings was a Silty Sand. Various underliners (DF15/DB85=5.6 to 13.5) not meeting typical retention criteria for filtration were placed beneath the tailings and geomembrane defect. The leakage rates and visual findings revealed that a critical stress condition exists where erosion continuously occurred for up to 24 hours. This condition resulted in a leakage rate that was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than previous observed with filter compatible conditions and higher stresses. This condition could be encountered during early deposition or development of a reclaim pond at a tailings storage facility. Visual findings on the surface of the underliner suggested that contact likely had more influence on stability in this critical stress condition than gradation compatibility. Based on the areal coverage of tailings on the surface of the underliner, it was postulated that more intimate contact between the geomembrane and underliner leads to more stable leakage conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second type of tailings studied was fine-grained (approximately 90% passing 75 um). The material was placed on top of a geomembrane with a 1 cm defect, overlying a filter compatible underliner. Leakage rates implied the hydraulic conductivity reduced as the tailing experienced more vertical effective stress (up to 200 kPa).  Small samples (8 mm in diameter, 6 mm in height) were retrieved near the defect after the test and permeated at a variety of effective stresses (0 to 800 kPa). Although some disturbance likely occurred, the permeation results suggested the tailings hydraulic conductivity was in the range of 3 x 10-9 to 6 x 10-9 m/s, which confirmed values estimated using a saturated seepage model (SEEP W/). Permeation results and gradation analysis of the small samples suggested that significant migration of fines did not occur. Further seepage modeling assuming homogeneous tailings hydraulic conductivity suggested the leakage rate from a well-designed, well-constructed, lined facility containing the tailings is likely in the range of 1-2 L/ha/day. Without the liner, the leakage rate is likely 3-4 orders of magnitude higher.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Since the ``Scotch tape" discovery of graphene synthesis over a decade ago there has been significant interest in the industrial scale-up of graphene production, with the understanding that the material's exceptional physical and electrical properties could be used to enhance finished products. One remarkable property of graphene is the degree to which it, an atomically-thin material, can impart hydrophobicity to a surface. Liquid-phase surface treatments are familiar to many industrial engineering practices and it is well-known that graphene oxide, a graphene derivative which can be modified to achieve graphene-like material qualities, disperses well in many solvents. Although graphene oxide is hydrophilic, it can be made hydrophobic by reduction, and perhaps even superhydrophobic with the inclusion of surface topography. Therefore, the reduction of graphene oxide films offers one possible route to graphene's entry to industry as a hydrophobic surface coating treatment. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis begins with an experimental investigation into graphene oxide's dispersibility in different solvents. The influence of these solvents on the physico-chemical characteristics of the resulting graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide thin films cast on a silicon substrate is studied. It is found that the choice of dispersing medium determines the degree of surface coverage and therefore the degree of film wettability. Subsequently, the chemical nature and hydrophobicity increase that is imparted by a new photoreduction process applied to the graphene oxide-based films is researched. From this, it was observed that the chemistry of the photoreduced films greatly differs from that of the thermally reduced films, including larger quantities of oxygen. The thesis concludes with a brief examination of the degree to which substrate topography can enhance the hydrophobicity of graphene oxide-based films deposited on chemically etched glass. It is found that with the addition of a roughened surface topography the water contact angle can be improved by up to 45°.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Current approaches in biomaterial development require a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to identify and optimize candidate materials. Current in vitro assays have low labor requirements and are relatively cheap compared to in vivo studies but fail to recapitulate the host response. Alternatively, in vivo models do not provide a wide array of analytical tools, and are labor intensive. Therefore, a gap exists for a model that retains the low labor requirements and cost of in vitro assays, while allowing researchers the ability to observe a true host-biomaterial interaction. Zebrafish have the potential to provide such a model due to their naturally transparency, high fecundity that enables a single female to produce upwards of a hundred eggs a week, and the wide array of transgenic strains.&#xD;
After establishment of a colony at Queen’s University, microinjection techniques were developed to assess the feasibility of using zebrafish as a model for host-biomaterial interaction using poly(styrene) and poly(ethylene) microparticles with diameters of 10, 25, and 50 μm. Implantation success and retention rates were examined, as well as zebrafish mortality rates out to 30 days post injection (dpi). Successful implantation rates were measured at 33%, 17%, and 12% for 10, 25, and 50 μm microparticles, respectively. Retention rates were identical for 10 and 25 μm microparticles at 78%, but implant retention was 11% for 50 μm microparticles. Furthermore, 10 μm microparticles injected with 20 μm bore needles showed no difference in survival from controls. However, 25 μm implants with 50 μm bore sizes, and 50 μm implants with 100 μm bore sizes both showed a reduction in viability post injection in zebrafish compared to tricaine controls. Based on these preliminary results, zebrafish embryos tolerate implants ranging from 10 – 25 μm in diameter, while 50 μm was deemed too large for the embryo. Further refinement of techniques is anticipated to improve success and retention rates.&#xD;
Histology techniques were developed for use with 3 – 5 mm zebrafish larvae. By embedding tissues in an agar array and reducing fixation times to 2 hours, improvements were observed in tissue cohesion. Additionally, the agar matrix provides a well-organized structure, which lends itself to improved efficiency for future work.</dcterms:abstract>
