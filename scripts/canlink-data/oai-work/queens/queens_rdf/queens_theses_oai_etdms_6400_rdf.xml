      <dcterms:abstract>Docker is a tool used to encapsulate a software package with all of its dependencies and configurations into an isolated environment. Nowadays, developers compose multiple Docker images to form multi-component applications. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
While prior studies of Docker examine the quality and evolution of a single Docker image, no study has explored the use of Docker in a multi-component setting. In this thesis, we first identify how multi-component applications are composed and maintained using Docker Compose, then we examine Docker images that are hosted on DockerHub, a commonly used online registry for Docker images.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
From our first study of 4,103 open-source Github projects that use Docker Compose, we observe that 26.8% of the projects needlessly use Docker Compose to compose a single component application, multi-component applications stick to the basic options of Docker Compose and ignore advanced ones such as security and monitoring related options, and multi-component applications rarely upgrade their Docker Compose version. We also observe that 77% of the studied applications use images from an online registry and 95.2% of these registry images are hosted on DockerHub.  &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Hence, we investigate the available Docker images on DockerHub. We studied 505 DockerHub images for five popular software systems (101 images for each system). We observed that DockerHub community images differ from their official image, while also differing from each other in terms of their installed libraries. We also observe that there exist community images that are more resource-efficient and which contain fewer security vulnerabilities compared to their official image. However, users might not find such images since they are not well-documented. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Our thesis suggests the need for tools and methodologies to help multi-component applications take full advantage of the capabilities and resources that are offered by Docker Compose and DockerHub.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research has shown that estrogen has vasoprotective properties, however there is conflict in the literature regarding whether vascular endothelial function is lower in the low estrogen, early follicular (EF) phase and higher in the high estrogen, late follicular phase (LF) of the menstrual cycle. This may be due to inter-individual variability in responses to cyclic changes in estrogen because, although this has not been systematically examined, studies have shown that individuals may exhibit higher, lower or unchanged endothelial function in LF vs. the EF phase. It is unknown whether this individual variability reflects important, stable, inter-individual differences in responses to estrogen, as research to date has only followed women over one cycle. It is hypothesized that women will respond consistently over multiple cycles such that the phase changes in conduit and microvascular endothelial function during one cycle, will predict the phase change during a subsequent cycle. Fourteen healthy, naturally cycling women (22 +/- 3 years [mean +/- SD]) participated in four visits over two menstrual cycles. During each visit (EF Visit 1, LF Visit 2, EF Visit 3 and LF Visit 4), conduit and microvascular endothelial function were assessed. Blood hormone analysis was used to confirm phase. Data are [mean +/- SD]. There was no impact of phase or cycle on conduit or microvascular endothelial function at the group level. Individual responses varied in each cycle, however the phase changes in endothelial function were inconsistent between cycles, such that phase change in endothelial function during cycle 1 did not predict phase change in cycle 2 (FMD: r = 0.08, p = 0.78, AUC Change LVC: r = 0.002, p = 0.99). This study demonstrated for the first time that at the individual level, phases changes in endothelial function were inconsistent across two phases. Future research is required to investigate potential mechanisms that influence, and the functional relevance of variability, in endothelial function changes with menstrual phase.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Communities dwelling in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside have long been the target of dispossessive strategies. In the earliest days of the city’s development, the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh Peoples were violently removed in the name of ‘civilization’ and for the advancement of the Canadian settler colonial state. In 1942, the Japanese Canadian community who had been living in Paueru-gai (Powell Street) were forcibly uprooted in the name of national security. In the 1960s, the Black community living in Hogan’s Alley were displaced in the name of urban renewal. In 1986, working-class and other tenants who had been living in the Downtown Eastside’s Single Room Occupancy hotels and rooming houses were suddenly evicted for the World Exposition. In recent decades, the Chinatown and low-income communities currently dwelling in the Downtown Eastside have fought an onslaught of gentrification threatening to develop condominiums for white, middle-class, potential-home-buyers at the expense of current residents. In 2014, through a research project titled “Revitalizing Japantown?”, which questioned the toponym “Japantown” as a term deployed by the municipal government for gentrifying the Downtown Eastside in the name of ‘revitalization,’ community members, activists, and scholars articulated the right to remain as an activist counter-brand. Since then, the right to remain has fuelled housing activism in the Downtown Eastside, particularly with the Downtown Eastside (DTES) Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Collaborative, an organization dedicated to improving conditions in the neighbourhood’s SRO hotels as a political matter and practical means of ensuring that the low-income community remains in the neighbourhood. While the right to remain has informed much anti-gentrification activism, this thesis recasts the right to remain in light of the continuous death endured by the community dwelling in the Downtown Eastside. Drawing on eight months of ethnographic embeddedness in the neighbourhood (May 2018 – January 2019), 12 unstructured interviews, as well as theories of haunting and urban geography, I argue that those who remain in the Downtown Eastside include not only the living, but also, and importantly, the dead. I reveal how the dead complicate the right to remain and the Downtown Eastside in ways that strengthen activism and imagine beyond justice. </dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the advances to mandatory corporate disclosures and reporting systems since 1996, including the growing prevalence of optional reporting in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Technology and Innovation (T&amp;I), specifically by the gold sub-industry which has increased year-over-year. Many multinational mining corporation executive officers preach that this optional reporting generates greater value for shareholders and is critical to corporate success. This research explores whether this claim is supported by market data on regulated trading platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
While the social benefits of a strong company-community relationship are immeasurable, the value can be contextualized through econometric techniques which quantify market reactions to various types of corporate disclosures. A custom event study model was built and tested on a case study of a major multinational gold producer. This case study quantified the economic value of mandatory corporate disclosures and evaluated them relative to optional reports. The methodology used benchmarks the company’s equity price to a reconstructed variant of the "NYSE Arca Gold BUGS" (HUI) Index and calculates the abnormal returns for all corporate disclosures. Each abnormal return is then categorized into a performance indicator category (production, financial, corporate, technical), and a T&amp;I or CSR category. Finally, statistical analysis and sentiment analysis determine any economic impacts and trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
Disclosure system shortcomings are discussed along with recommendations provided on improving electronic disclosure systems, from both a policy and practical perspective. Potential further applications of this custom model include stock price prediction given corporate disclosures as an input, anomalous trading behaviour identification for regulatory tools, and communicating social value on equity valuation to corporate board executives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The present work investigates how the relation between pleasure and meaning may vary across cultures, focusing on comparisons between Koreans and Euro-Canadians. Guided by the idea that culture shapes people’s perceptions on pleasure, I proposed that the presence of pleasure would serve as a source of meaning in life among Euro-Canadians but as a motivator for the meaning search among Koreans. Specifically, I hypothesized that, relative to Euro-Canadians, Koreans show a greater tendency to search for meaning in the presence than in the absence of pleasure. Four studies, using between and within cultural comparisons, as well as a meta-analysis, provided some support for the prediction. This research provides a new insight into the dynamic association between pleasure and meaning from the cultural perspective.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For plants, lipid barriers represent a critical adaptation to terrestrial life, providing a first line of defense against biotic and abiotic stressors. Among these lipid barriers, suberized cell walls protect both internal and external tissues of the plant, where they play vital roles including regulation of water and solute exchange, and defense against pathogens. Suberin is a heteropolymer deposited under normal development or as a stress response that is composed of two covalently-linked domains; the polyphenolic domain and the polyaliphatic domain. Because of this complexity, our understanding of the structure, biosynthesis and deposition of suberin has been limited. Overall, the goal of this thesis was to use combined chemical and molecular approaches to identify candidate genes for suberin biosynthesis as well as to investigate the structure of the polyester using the model tree, Populus trichocarpa. RNA-Sequencing of cork tissue generated 455 candidates for suberin biosynthesis, and chemical characterization of the suberin polymer across 4 developmental stages allowed connections between the chemical products and differentially expressed genes to generate hypothesis and candidate genes for future analysis. These chemical methods included the quantification of glycerol using a recently published methodology for the related polymer, cutin, to propose structural motifs. The ratio of acyl monomers to glycerol was determined to be 5:1, leading to the hypothesis that suberin forms an extended polymer in poplar cork. In addition to glycerol, a modified green solvent protocol for thioacidolysis was introduced and shown to perform as well as conventional dioxane methods. By studying the time course of wound-healing suberization, the chemistry and gene expression of selected genes were compared with those of the suberin deposition during normal development. The results indicate that wound healing suberin is chemically distinct from native suberin deposition and therefore may be under different genetic control. The work contained in this thesis furthers our understanding of suberin structure in tree bark, establishes improved methodologies, and generates hypothesis for future targeted studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Canada (NWMO) is currently in the process of site selection for the future development of a high-level nuclear waste Deep Geological Repository (DGR), and locations with crystalline bedrock are the top candidates  (Hirschorn et al. 2017). In support of this process, a study on the effects of water-saturation on the geomechanical response of granitic rock is conducted. Rock-water interactions are investigated in both intact rock and discontinuities. This topic was investigated on two different granites: Lac du Bonnet and Pointe du Bois pink granites. The results of this study show no significant correlations between strength reduction and water content in granite in compression, tension, and confined shear. In addition to the investigation of rock-water interactions, this work also presents the development of a new direct shear sample preparation procedure as well as a technique for normal loading and direct shear test data processing and interpretation: joint deformation correction and analytical representation of joint pre-yield deformation. An exponential function is suggested to determine the instantaneous normal and shear stiffness values.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research in natural language and other modalities is starting to shed light on individuals&#xD;
personal properties. Estimating the personal properties of an individual or a group of individuals&#xD;
is the task of detecting different behavioural signals and studying how they correlate&#xD;
with personal properties such as mental health, personality, and emotions.&#xD;
Multiple disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, sociology, and cognitive science&#xD;
focus on defining and detecting personal properties. With the ease of data collection and&#xD;
analysis, studying and analyzing personal properties has become an easier task. Computer&#xD;
science can contribute to this on-going research by building computational models that&#xD;
mimic or predict an individual/group’s personal properties.&#xD;
This kind of research is done through studying two different behavioural signals. In my&#xD;
research I focus on verbal signals by studying how language usage correlates with personal&#xD;
properties. The other behavioural signal is non-verbal, such as body language, number of&#xD;
friends, eating habits, etc.&#xD;
The contribution of my thesis can be broken down to two parts: building tools to estimate&#xD;
a set of individual/group’s personal properties from mainly online posts through their&#xD;
language usage, and comparing the effectiveness of different data analytic tools/representations&#xD;
in the space of personal properties.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease amongst the Ontario pediatric population; however, the extent to which rural status and distance are associated with unplanned emergency department (ED) use by this population is largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objective: To explore the impact of rurality and geographical distance to services on healthcare utilization by analyzing the use of general practitioner/family physician (GP/FP), specialist and unplanned ED services. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: A population level retrospective cohort study of Ontario children ages 5-14 with newly diagnosed asthma was conducted using health administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Bivariate descriptive statistics were used to assess healthcare use depending on rurality and distance to services. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between unplanned ED use with rural status and distance to GP/FP and specialist healthcare services, while controlling for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: In total, 19,732 individuals met the inclusion criteria. Rurality and geographical distance to services were significantly associated with GP/FP, specialist and unplanned ED use. Rural participants were more likely to visit a GP/FP (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.50-2.01) and less likely to visit a specialist (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.49-0.64) in comparison to urban participants. Distance to a GP/FP or specialist was weakly associated with the number of healthcare provider visits; rs=-0.04 and rs=-0.09 respectively. Individuals who lived in rural locations (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.64-2.44) and travelled &gt;50km to a GP/FP (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06-1.48) or specialist (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.38) were more likely to utilize an ED. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: Children with asthma utilize healthcare services differently based on rural status and distance to services. Rural children were more likely to utilize GP/FP services, less likely to utilize specialist services and more likely to have an unplanned ED visit when compared to urban children. Children who resided further (&gt;50km) from a healthcare provider were less likely to have a GP/FP or specialist visit when compared to those who resided closer (≤50km). To ensure equitable access to care, there is a need to accommodate for these factors in the planning and provision of asthma healthcare services.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The focus of this thesis was on probabilistic analysis of unreinforced cohesive soil slopes and geosynthetic reinforced and unreinforced footings over cohesive foundations. &#xD;
Two open-source random finite element method (RFEM) programs written in FORTRAN were modified to accommodate larger problem domains analysed in this study. For footing analyses, subroutines were added to model geosynthetic reinforcement layers as linear elastic-plastic bar elements together with two-layer random fields. &#xD;
The modified RFEM code for the foundation problem was used to examine the case of the footing sitting directly on a cohesive soil layer, and the same footing seated on unreinforced and geosynthetic reinforced granular layers. Simulations were carried out assuming different isotropic and anisotropic spatial correlation lengths for the undrained shear strength of the foundation soil. The influence of reinforced and unreinforced granular layers on worst-case spatial correlation lengths was identified. The footing investigation showed that introduction of geosynthetic layers in the granular layer placed between the footing and underlying cohesive soil foundation significantly reduced the probability of footing failure. The correlation lengths for isotropic and anisotropic spatial variability of the foundation undrained shear strength that were at or close to the width of the footing corresponded to worst-case scenarios with respect to probability of failure regardless of the number of reinforcement layers and reinforcement stiffness.&#xD;
The modified slope stability code was used to investigate the sensitivity of RFEM analysis outcomes to numerical parameters used to describe the random fields. The results of RFEM analyses were compared to results using the random limit equilibrium method (RLEM) for the same cohesive slope problem. The conditions that are necessary for the two methods to achieve practical agreement with respect to probability of failure and worst-case correlation lengths were identified. The slope investigation showed that critical correlation lengths deduced from probabilistic analyses using RFEM are sensitive to the precision of variables in numerical computations and to the ratio of random field cell size to finite element mesh size. The probabilities of failure computed using RFEM can be replicated with RLEM using Janbu method of slices and with less computational time.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>According to Sustainable Development Goals, water quality assessment is vital to sustainable water management. Bacteria monitoring is an important part of water quality management. Traditional methods for bacteria detection in water have limitations such as being time-consuming, expensive and inconvenient. In this study, a new, rapid bacteria detection system called the TECTATM B16 (TECTA) was used. The TECTA system was designed for clean water, therefore, there has been less experience measuring some highly polluted water samples, where high turbidity may interfere with the detection. In this study, experiments have been done both in the laboratory and the field to determine the interference from turbidity. The results from the laboratory showed that the turbidity from organic particles interfered with the bacteria detection by causing delayed E. coli or total coliform time-to-detection and lower signal. The turbidity from inorganic particles didn’t interfere with total coliform detection but interfered with E. coli detection by creating false signal. If the turbidity of a water sample is lower than 150 NTU, the interference from the turbidity could be ignored. The field research was implemented on a ship on the Yangtze River in China in May 2019. Overall, the turbidity of the Yangtze River was lower than 40 NTU with the exceptions of the upstream part of the Yangtze River, so interference in the results was not expected. The results showed E. coli levels mostly in the 200-2000 CFU/100 mL range, with a few much higher levels at the docks in some cities. The distribution of bacteria levels were consistent with official Government of China data, providing confidence that the TECTA instrument was successfully applied on the ship. The results also indicated that bacteria contamination in the Yangtze River was strongly linked to the location of cities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Education recognizes that creativity is important for students and society. However, teachers have scant direction about how to support it, in part because current understanding of what works is piecemeal, as is the empirical research on creative school environments. &#xD;
This dissertation explores the breadth and depth of the experiences afforded to secondary students in a Western context that support and stifle creativity. This work focuses on student perspective as the meanings that students make of their creativity-experiences determine their consequences.  &#xD;
I used a constructivist grounded theory methodology to guide this research, with the focus of study secondary school experiences of creativity encouragement and discouragement. The experiences students described to me encompassed both the human and non-human elements in the learning environment with which students interacted, and students’ responses to these interactions. In this retrospective study, postsecondary students chose and reflected on experiences that they had two to five years earlier and described the consequences of the experiences in their current lives. Three hundred and sixty-nine students communicated the experiences and their reactions to them through an online questionnaire, and fourteen students through more in-depth, iterative interviews.&#xD;
Through constructivist analytic approaches, three conditions for the support of creativity in secondary schools were conceived: freedom, meaningful challenge, and teacher belief. The parallel opposite conditions—constraint, lack of meaningful challenge, and lack of teacher belief— led to creativity discouragement. &#xD;
In my study, the consequences of creativity-encouragement entailed expanded creativity behaviour and beliefs, enhanced learning, and prosocial beliefs and behaviour. In parallel opposition, creativity-discouraged students consequently curtailed their creativity behaviour and took on diminished beliefs, contracted from learning, and took up anti-social beliefs and behaviour. These consequences lasted into the present day for many students. The responses were psychologically driven by students’ positive/negative emotions and students’ decisions about competence and identity. These findings are discussed in light of intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and self-fulfilling prophecy. &#xD;
The grounded theory developed in this dissertation enriches understanding of the conditions required to support youth in their creativity in education contexts and describes the consequences of this support (or its lack) on students’ future behaviour and beliefs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Historically, mining has had a large negative impact on the environment. In order to combat this legacy of damage, the Government of Canada has implemented regulations in order to ensure the “Polluter Pays’ principle is followed, that is the party responsible for damage will pay for its rehabilitation. Giant Mine, located in Yellowknife, NWT, is a case where this principle was not applied. It is one of the most damaged legacy mine sites in Canada and is currently undergoing rehabilitation by the Government of Canada after its owner became insolvent in the 1990’s. Rehabilitation is estimated to cost B$0.5 CAD and requires maintenance in perpetuity.&#xD;
This thesis examines the Canadian application of environmental financial assurance regulations which are intended ensure that mining companies provide sufficient funding to the government to reclaim a mine in the event of default by applying modern regulations to the case study of the Giant Mine. Four primary types of assurances (cash, letters of credit, trusts, and corporate promises) along with their variations are applied retroactively to determine their impact on financial models of Giant Mine as a critique of modern EFA regulations.&#xD;
This model shows that on a pre-tax, undiscounted basis, Giant Mine would have been able to fund the entirety of its reclamation but would be unable to do so on an after-tax basis. This indicates that the project is sensitive to the tax treatment of the reclamation cash flows, which is variable depending on the specific tax jurisdiction in question. When the time value of money is considered, the project becomes attractive except when the EFA fund is held as cash. All other EFA vehicles showed positive economic value over a range of discount rates applied by mining companies.&#xD;
As a result, this thesis concludes that had modern EFA regulations been in place at the time of Giant Mine’s discovery, the mine could have successfully internalized its environmental impact and still have been considered economic despite the significant environmental damage it caused but would not be an attractive investment to smaller, less financially stable mining firms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The phenology and productivity of temperate forests has changed across eastern North America in recent decades. However, these changes have varied spatially and temporally. And, while climate change has been an important cause of these changes in forest growth, the precise influence of climate remains unclear. This thesis presents the results of research which 1) tested for forest growth trends that could indicate that forest growth has changed in response to environmental stressors; and 2) assessed climate-growth relationships for different forest growth processes (phenology and productivity). Analysis was conducted at a regional scale within the Algonquin-to-Adirondacks (A2A) corridor, and at a sub-regional scale within the four geoclimatologically distinct ecoregions of A2A (Algonquin Highlands, Frontenac Arch, St. Lawrence Lowlands &amp; Adirondack Mountains). We conducted two studies using different, but complimentary, methodologies. In the first study we used dendrochronology to study the growth of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) over a century (1912-2011). We found that sugar maple ring-widths declined recently in the Algonquin Highlands (- 46 mm2/year, 1993-2011) and Adirondack Mountains (- 33 mm2/year, 1991-2011), but that climate-growth relationships with temperature, precipitation and the SPEI drought index were limited (response function coefficients of ± 0.3). In the second study we used remote-sensing to study forest landscapes (i.e., pixels) over 26 years (1989-2014). We found that statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) trends in forest phenology and productivity occurred across only a small proportion of A2A (1-9 %), but that there was notable evidence of an extended growing season (+ 0.6-0.8 days/year) in the St. Lawrence Lowlands and Frontenac Arch ecoregions (25 % &amp; 43 % respectively), driven by a delayed end to the growing season. Relationships between climate and forest growth were strong (pR2 &gt; 80 %), and accumulated heating (&gt; 4 0C) and chilling (&lt; 20 0C) temperatures were the most important climatic variables for driving forest growth. Understanding climate-growth relationships for temperate forests in A2A will improve understandings of how forests have already responded to climate change, and will contribute to our capacity to predict how they may respond to future climate change.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stable isotopic labeling is an important part of structural biology by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.  Novel stable isotopic labeling methods have continuously been developed to enhance protein NMR spectroscopy. Protein structural determination based on 15N- and 13C-labelled proteins is already well established.  However, oxygen, being one of the most abundant elements in biological molecules, has not yet been utilized in NMR studies of proteins.  This is largely because of two factors.  First, the only NMR-active oxygen isotope, 17O, has a very low natural abundance (0.037%).  Second, 17O has a nuclear spin of 5/2 (known as quadrupolar), which usually results in broad 17O NMR signals even for small organic molecules.  Despite the technical difficulties, recent studies have shown 17O NMR to be a valuable tool for studying biological molecules.  In this thesis, we used yeast ubiquitin (8.6 kDa) as a model system to investigate general strategies of incorporating 17O-labelled amino acids into proteins.  We have used an auxotrophic E.coli strain DL39 GlyA λDE3 (aspC- tyrB- ilvE- glyA- λDE3)  to successfully synthesize yeast ubiquitin where glycine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and alanine residues are selectively  17O-labelled.   This is the first demonstration of 17O-labeling of a protein in both backbone groups and sidechain.  Some preliminary solid-state 13C and 17O NMR results on these protein samples are also reported in this thesis.  The synthetic methodology for 17O-labeling yeast ubiquitin reported in this thesis will be useful in future solid-state 17O NMR studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gamer loyalty is important for the sales of a game. However, the gaming industry and the needs of gamers are rapidly increasing, making it difficult for game developers to address these needs. Game mods are modifications of an original game, which can help game developers save cost and time. Hence, it is crucial for game developers to build and maintain an active modding community.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we study mods to provide insights to game and mod developers on building an active modding community. An active modding community consists of two dimensions: (1) continuous growth of mods from mod developers, and (2) continuous adoption of mods from gamers. We investigated these two dimensions respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
To help game developers understand how to help mod developers continuously deliver high quality mods, we investigate the release schedule and post-release support of highly endorsed mods from the top 20 games on the Nexus Mods distribution platform. We observe that supporting the same modding tool within a game franchise is associated with faster release of mods. We also observe that bug reports (i.e., post-release support) of mods is poor in quality, making it difficult to address many of them. However, solved bug reports are often resolved within one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
To help mod developers understand how to build popular mods based on download count, we investigate the impact of 33 features across the following 5 dimensions of popular and unpopular mods in the CurseForge mod distribution platform: mod category, mod documentation, environmental context of mod, remuneration for the mod and community contribution for the mod. We observed that popular mods tend to have a high quality description and promote community contribution. Also, mods that simplify mod development are more likely to be popular.&#xD;
&#xD;
Based on our findings, we suggest game developers who desire an active modding community to provide an officially-supported modding tool. Also, Nexus Mods should improve the quality of their bug reporting system to achieve higher quality bug reports. Furthermore, we suggest mod developers to help improve the support for mod development, to improve the description of their mods, and to welcome community contributions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prostitution is a wicked problem. The debate over prostitution policy in Canada includes a range of differently situated stakeholders centring different problems, proposing solutions that are in apparent conflict, and making divergent and oppositional rights claims. Prostitution policy is largely shaped by value conflicts rather than by material interests. Where contemporary policy models appear to have positive effects for some stakeholders, they have offsetting negative effects for others. Canada’s current prostitution policy aims to eradicate prostitution, but some individuals do and will continue to engage in prostitution. The constitutionality of the new legislative provisions accompanying the policy is uncertain, and the policy’s effectiveness and effects are currently unknown. &#xD;
This thesis applies the conceptual and analytical lens of interest-focussed legal problem solving to reconcile the interests of differently situated seller stakeholders reflected in the contemporary debate. Those who engage in prostitution are exposed to significant risk of harm, including adverse sexual and emotional health consequences and violence. All sellers and potential sellers share an interest in reducing their risk of experiencing the harms associated with prostitution. The current body of empirical knowledge about prostitution and sex work in Canada is incomplete, reflecting issue bias in favour of one group of seller stakeholders and prioritizing one set of harms. Removing criminal sanctions over prostitution has the effect of placing responsibility for risk management on individual sellers; all sellers or potential sellers may not be equally situated to manage the risks or to avoid the harms associated with participating in prostitution. Drawing on recent economic scholarship about prostitution policy regimes and on Martha Fineman’s vulnerability theory and the concept of resilience, this thesis suggests “incomplete commodification” as a means of recognizing and responding to the interests of differently situated sellers or potential sellers in reducing or avoiding the harms associated with prostitution, including in better ensuring that any permissible purchase of sexual services is from those most able to manage their risk of harm.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ovarian cancer is the 8th most common gynecological cancer and the 7th leading cause of cancer death in women, as it has the lowest 5-year survival rate of all common female reproductive system cancers. The first-line standard of care for ovarian cancer patients is primary debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. However, 20-30% of patients are resistant to this treatment. Previous studies have identified genes correlated with chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer, but the underlying mechanisms of resistance remain poorly understood. This study reports novel genes and biological networks associated with platinum-based chemotherapy response as measured by the patient platinum-free interval, using transcriptomics data from high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Univariate analysis of patient gene expression was used to identify differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. A machine-learning multivariate approach was then used to determine co-expression based connections among transcripts using both mRNA and miRNA-sequence data. Next, novel integrated networks were constructed, indicating potential regulation of mRNA co-expression networks by miRNAs. DNA sequence variants that potentially regulate gene expression, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), were detected through integrative analysis of mRNA expression and genome-wide polymorphism datasets from this ovarian cancer cohort. This study identified 92 differentially expressed mRNAs that indicate a downregulation of adaptive immunity in chemo-resistant patients, and one mRNA network enriched for protein ubiquitination. The analysis also identified 21 differentially expressed miRNAs that regulate the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the MET/ERK2 oncogenic pathway, and three miRNA networks enriched for lipoprotein transport and angiogenesis. An expression correlation analysis detected miRNAs that may regulate the transcriptional network associated with resistance. Finally, 74 eQTLs associated with significant mRNAs were reported. This study characterised novel transcriptional networks that potentially regulate chemotherapy response in HGSOC patients and helped elucidate the underlying mechanisms of platinum-based chemo-resistance. The impact of these findings lies in precision medicine, where a better understanding of the genes modulating treatment response can lead to more accurate genetic screening of HGSOC patients and determine novel therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To disarm plant defenses, successful pathogens secrete an arsenal of diverse virulence factors, termed effectors, into the host cell to shut down key components of the plant immune signaling pathway. To protect against effector sabotage, plants have evolved intracellular NUCLEOTIDE BINDING AND LEUCINE RICH REPEAT RECEPTORS (NLRs) that monitor the integrity of critical immune signaling components likely to be effector targets. NLR activation upregulates plant immune responses and triggers a form of localized cell death known as the hypersensitive response (HR). To prevent damaging levels of cell death NLR activation is under tight control. NLRs are maintained in an inactive “OFF” state under stable conditions, and only turn ‘ON’ when perturbations of monitored proteins are detected. MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX/PERFORIN (MACPF) proteins are well known agents of defense in the mammalian immune system, though the exact role of this protein family in plants has not been established. Mutations in two of the four MACPF domain proteins encoded in Arabidopsis thaliana cause salicylic acid - dependent autoimmunity, a phenotype that has been linked to the constitutive activation of NLR receptors. In constitutively activated defense 1 (cad1) mutants this autoimmunity is dependent on ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1, a component of the signaling pathway mediated by a subset of NLR receptors. The first major objective of this thesis was to utilize a recently published library of dominant negative NLR mutants to identify the receptor(s) involved in cad1 autoimmunity. Through screening 67 unique dominant negative transgenic lines for the suppression of cad1-5 rosette stunting and lesion formation phenotypes I did not identify the NLR activated in cad1-5. Additionally, as my second objective I conducted a yeast two hybrid screen to test whether CAD1 or its close relative NECROTIC SPOTTED LESION 1 (NSL1) are targeted by effectors of the Arabidopsis pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato. From this screen I identified one effector that may interact with NSL1. Collectively, this work provides novel insight into the molecular aspects of host-pathogen interactions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Competent English communication skills are essential to success within international business workplaces. To assess employees’ qualifications for international businesses, international companies have used the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) over the past 30 years in South Korea, which houses the largest TOEIC test taker population worldwide.  However, some researchers argue that the TOEIC, designed by Educational Testing Service (ETS), may not fully reflect the use of English in international business contexts. In such contexts, the focus is interactive communication skills, with cognizance of different English accents and business partners’ cultures. Limited empirical studies have investigated the extent to which TOEIC scores represent English constructs and how much the TOEIC achieves its designated purposes in international business workplaces. &#xD;
&#xD;
Drawing on an argument-based validation framework using the stakeholder approach, the perceived constructs of English in international business workplaces and the extent to which the TOEIC’s designated purposes were achieved were investigated by collecting various validity-related evidence from multiple stakeholders, i.e., ETS; YBM, the TOEIC administrator; and employers and employees in international business workplaces. Multiple methods (i.e., documents from ETS and YBM, interviews with six employers and ten employees, and online questionnaires with 281 employees in international business companies in Korea) were used to juxtapose the findings from each stakeholder group. &#xD;
&#xD;
The findings from ETS’s documents framed baseline validity evidence to compare the findings from YBM’s documents and interview/questionnaire data that supported and challenged the TOEIC’s intended interpretations and uses. The overall findings represent the complexity of relationships within English constructs in international business workplaces and between stakeholders’ understanding and uses of TOEIC scores that were affected by contextual factors in South Korea, by highlighting the why and how. &#xD;
&#xD;
The findings can contribute to re-operationalizing the TOEIC’s constructs and call for including contextual factors in validation frameworks and studies. In particular, investigations of contextual factors cannot be overlooked to affect beneficial consequences in score use contexts. ETS and validation researchers may need to pay more attention to contextual factors and collect validity evidence in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, I investigate the impacts of hospital mergers in markets where hospitals compete primarily on quality. In Chapter 2, I use previous literature to discuss the potential impacts of hospital mergers, while in Chapter 3, I discuss a specific wave of mergers occurring in Ontario, Canada from 1997 through 2001 and describe the data I use to study these mergers. In Chapter 4, co-authored with Michael Green, we evaluate the effect of the hospital mergers on measures of hospital quality and cost. We use a matched differences-in-differences approach based on the construction of synthetic controls, and we compare hospital mergers involving the closure of acute care services at one or more hospital sites to hospital mergers without this feature. The results suggest that relative to the matched control group, both types of mergers improve quality but only those involving the closure of acute care services improve financial outcomes. In Chapter 5, co-authored with Eliane H. Barker and Michael Green, we use the same data at the patient level, focusing on the impact of mergers on patient welfare. We use pre-merger data and a patient choice model to estimate preferences parameters for travel distance to the hospital as well as for hospital quality and attributes, finding evidence that patients choose hospitals based on distance and quality. We then estimate the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks to utility, allowing us to control for unobservable utility in two counterfactual scenarios. In the first counterfactual, which represents the immediate effect of mergers, hospital sites that close acute care services during the merger wave are removed from the choice set. In the second, these hospital sites are still removed, and hospital quality and attributes are updated using post-merger data. The results suggest that once hospital quality has adjusted, mergers benefit some patients but harm others. For example, compared to urban patients, a greater proportion of rural patients are harmed by mergers. Taken together, these chapters suggest that hospital mergers have the potential to improve quality and cost but that there are trade-offs in terms of patient welfare.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arsenic is a toxic element and has become a major element of concern in the mining industry. Severe environmental issues may arise if the soluble arsenic species released by mining and extractive metallurgy activities were not responsibly and appropriately managed. Most arsenic immobilization techniques are not efficient for treating trivalent arsenic in solutions. In the cases where soluble trivalent arsenic is predominant in the waters, a first step of oxidation is usually required to yield a desirable overall arsenic removal efficiency.&#xD;
This thesis presents the results of an investigation on the carbon catalyst assisted arsenic oxidation process with emphasis on the impact of the key process parameters on oxidation efficiency. Rapid small-scale continuous column testing method was employed to simulate dynamic and continuous operations. The process residence time, pH and initial arsenic concentration are demonstrated to be the most crucial operational parameters that have significant impacts on arsenic oxidation. The arsenic oxidation efficiency is proven to be highly sensitive to the change of aqueous pH due to the shift of reaction pathways at various pH scenarios, which is correlated to the specific behaviors of different aqueous arsenic species. Both preloaded and recycled activated carbon are validated for competent capacity to catalyze arsenic oxidation. The reliable long-term performance of activated carbon is demonstrated in a 27 days-long test with a steady arsenic oxidation efficiency of above 97%. Another carbon-based catalyst, Lewatit® AF 5, which has a higher surface area and more active sites than activated carbon, is used in a column test to verify that the functionality of carbon, instead of the specific surface area, has the most catalytic ability of carbon to oxidize arsenic. This is further supported by tests with nitric acid treated activated and AF5, in which the arsenic oxidation is greatly improved at the initial stage, though the efficiency eventually declines to the same level of that of the original carbons. The initial improvement of arsenic oxidation is attributed to the nitric acid exploitation of oxidative function groups on the carbon surfaces.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Down syndrome (DS) is a common genetic condition caused by the presence of three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). DS greatly increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and a large percentage of people with DS develop AD neuropathology by the age of 40. To investigate the genetic contribution of trisomy 21 to DS phenotypes, including those related to AD pathology, a range of DS mouse models have been generated consisting of mice that are trisomic for chromosome segments syntenic to human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). The objective of the current study was to determine whether the working and spatial memory impairments seen in AD and AD mouse models are also present in the Dp(16)1Yey/+ mouse model of DS. In this model, the entire Hsa21 orthologous region on mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) (∼119 genes), has been duplicated and added onto the distal portion of one of the endogenous Mmu16 chromosomes. Recognition memory was assessed using the novel object recognition (NOR) task, spatial working memory by spontaneous alternations in the Y-Maze task, and spatial reference memory using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. The light/dark box was used to assess anxiety-like behavior. Behavioural testing was performed at 4, 6, and 9 months of age in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice and age-matched wildtype littermates. The results of the light/dark box test indicated that Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviour, an important non-cognitive behavioral deficit associated with AD. In the NOR and Y-maze tasks, Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice demonstrated no difference in performance compared to wildtype mice. Similarly, in the MWM task, there were no statistically significant differences in performance between genotypes in both hidden and cued platform trials and in the probe trial. Although investigators reported results to the contrary, based on the results of the present study we would conclude that the Dp(16)1Yey/+ DS mouse model thus does not represent a useful comparator for assessing the memory deficits seen in AD and AD mouse models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the effect of microdamage accumulation on the failure mechanisms of bone is important &#xD;
for treatment and prevention in degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis. The common sites of fracture &#xD;
in osteoporotic patients – arm, vertebra, hip – have large proportions of trabecular bone, which make &#xD;
them of particular interest. Degenerative bone diseases disrupt bone’s natural remodeling ability, meaning &#xD;
the microdamage which is normally repaired begins to accumulate, increasing a patient’s risk of fracture.  &#xD;
The current study aims to investigate the effect of microdamage accumulation on subsequent monotonic &#xD;
tests-to-failure using cored bovine trabecular bone samples. Various levels of microdamage were induced &#xD;
via pre-determined quantities of compressive fatigue loading on cored samples, which were subsequently &#xD;
tested in a uniaxial, compressive, test-to-failure. A parabolic relationship was found in the yield strain &#xD;
(from the test-to-failure) plotted against the reduction in modulus from fatigue loading, as well as in the &#xD;
normalized yield stress (from the test-to-failure) plotted against the reduction in modulus from fatigue &#xD;
loading. These results support the hypothesis that increases in yield strain at low quantities of fatigue&#xD;
induced damage could be attributed to a microdamage stress relieving mechanism in which small &#xD;
microdamage sites nucleate rather than growing larger sites. The results are indicative that a critical &#xD;
amount of this proposed mechanism exists, after which point further microdamage accumulation becomes &#xD;
detrimental to the mechanical properties obtained in subsequent compressive testing-to-failure. Once this &#xD;
critical amount of fatigue-induced damage is induced, a significant decrease in the subsequent yield strain &#xD;
is noted representing the growth and coalescence of few, large microdamage sites that become &#xD;
responsible for yielding in the test-to-failure.  &#xD;
X-ray micro-computed tomography was used in an attempt to characterize damage propagation during &#xD;
post-yield loading of select trabecular bone samples during monotonic failure testing. Qualitative three&#xD;
dimensional imaging suggests that two distinct damage propagation types may exist: the first appearing to &#xD;
originate from the centre of trabeculae, while the second appears to originate from trabecular surfaces.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This doctoral dissertation examines the central institutional architecture of the Constitution of Canada through the lens of the Constitution’s written amending procedures.  The thesis proposes that the legal procedures set out in Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982 serve dual purposes, which are always in tension.  The first purpose, which is ostensible on the face of the text, is to permit the amendment of the Constitution by following the relevant procedure.  The second purpose, which underlies the structure of portions of the text, is generally to prevent the amendment of the Constitution except in cases of substantial federal and provincial consensus, and thus to protect certain key institutions, provisions or principles through deep constitutional entrenchment.  The tension between these dual purposes is mediated by law, and reflects other normative tensions in the Constitution:  between constitutional provisions and constitutional principles; constitutional law and constitutional conventions; legislative drafting and judicial interpretation; the written and the unwritten; between rigidity and flexibility.  The dual purposes of the amending procedures were especially at play when the federal government introduced legislative measures such as fixed-date elections legislation, the Succession to the Throne Act, 2013, amendments to the Supreme Court Act, and several Senate reform bills.  In striking down amendments to the Supreme Court Act and most of the Senate reform measures, the Supreme Court relied upon a structural understanding of the Constitution’s framework, or “internal architecture,” including the amending procedures, to limit the extent to which Parliament could reform such federal institutions.  However, in upholding the validity of the Succession to the Throne Act and the fixed-date amendment to the Canada Elections Act (as well as previous legislative measures, such as the Official Languages Act),  the courts have also demonstrated that legislation which is constitutional or quasi-constitutional in an organic sense (albeit not enjoying constitutional status) may implement and advance underlying constitutional principles without offending the complex, multilateral amending procedures.  The dissertation is divided into two parts:  the first examines the nature and structure of the Constitution of Canada and the broad sweep of the amending procedures; the second, their application to key federal institutions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The funerary practices on Crete during the Bronze Age are very diverse in nature. Tomb architecture in the Early Minoan period is characterized by regional variations. In the Middle Minoan and Late Minoan periods the regional variations, present in the Early Minoan period, are not as palpable due to the increased trade within the island that allowed for better circulation of ideas. With the introduction of the palaces there is a shift in the communal burials of the Early Minoan period that left commingled remains. The shift towards a more individualistic nature of burials in the Middle Minoan period saw the introduction and use of pithoi and larnakes to further divide the space within a tomb. The Late Minoan period is the height and fall of Minoan power on Crete. It is also a time when new people were arriving on Crete and this is reflected in the funerary remains. The introduction of cremation to Crete is a drastic change to the island where the main form of burial has been inhumation since the Early Minoan period. Cremation is first noted in areas that have strong trade connections. Cremation is commonly used in the Near East and I attempt to track its progression and appearance on Crete from the East. The Iliad is also consulted on the basis of plausibility for the funeral of Patroklos and the cremated remains that are found within the Mediterranean context during the Bronze Age.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>GM2 Gangliosidoses are a group of severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the inability to catabolize GM2 Gangliosides, leading to a neurotoxic accumulation of the GM2 lipids within the central nervous system. The Hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme is a heterodimeric protein composed of an α- and a β- subunit, which are coded by the HEXA and HEXB genes respectively. Mutations in either of these genes lead to Tay Sachs Disease and Sandhoff Disease, respectively, through the disruption of the HexA enzyme. These debilitating diseases are fatal by the age of 4 in the infantile version and have no effective treatment available to patients other than palliative care. Herein we assessed the efficacy of two distinct hexosaminidase gene therapy treatment strategies in a Sandhoff mouse model – the ‘hexosaminidase hybrid’ and ‘bicistronic’ vector treatments. We found significant extensions in survival, significant improvements in motor coordination, as well as drastic decrease in the accumulation of the GM2 lipid for both strategies. Specifically, in the assessment of the hexosaminidase hybrid, the low dose cohort and the remaining high dose mice had a significant survival benefit with an average/median survival of 40.6/34.5 and 55.9/56.7 weeks, respectively, over that of untreated controls whose humane endpoint is ~16 weeks. The bicistronic vectors also showed significant improvements in survival, where all vector treatments provided at all ages of administration conveyed improvements in the SD mice in their survival compared to vehicle-treated controls (p&lt;0.001). Mice were treated at 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks with the human bicistronic vector survived to a median age of 59, 68.4, 43.6, and 43.8 weeks and mice treated with the murine bicistronic vector survived to median age of 42.2, 76.8, 65.8, and 68.14 weeks, respectively. Mice treated with the ssAAV9/mHexb vector only at 0 and 6 weeks and they survived to a median age of 65.72 and 70.71 weeks respectively, with one mouse from the 0-week ssAAV9/mHexb group surviving to the 104-week study endpoint. Significant behavioral, biochemical, and molecular benefit were also observed in both the hybrid and bicistronic strategies. These findings are significant steps forward in the search for a viable treatment for GM2 Gangliosidosis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In a society where self-indulgence is aggressively promoted, sapping the vitality of our youth and adults, educators have a moral obligation to react. This study offers a reaction through a pedagogy of selflessness. A selfless person: (a) realizes the infinitude of their own and others’ inner potential, feeling intimately connected to the world; (b) has the strength to overcome self-interested desires to help another; and (c) can work without expectation of a reward (Kurth, 1995). Selflessness should be a focal point of educational discourse and practice. &#xD;
       In this qualitative study I develop a conceptual framework for selflessness in education along with a pedagogy called Learning to Serve through Inquiry (LSI) that blends inquiry, service, and explicit teachings on being selfless. This multiple case study explores: (a) how selflessness is expressed in Grade 6 students of a classroom engaged in LSI, (b) how closely these manifestations of selflessness align with the indicators as informed by the domains of selflessness in the framework, and (c) how LSI operates as a vehicle to promote the cultivation of selfless attributes within and among the learning community.&#xD;
	The LSI unit, which was co-planned and taught with the classroom teacher, unfolded over a period of two months. Over 240 hours were spent observing students of one class, with special attention paid to 10 students who agreed to pre- and post-LSI interviews. The classroom teacher was also interviewed. Additional data included daily notes, reflections, a personal audit of the reflections, and student work. &#xD;
       Three cycles of thematic analysis led to three themes. The first theme describes how students could better articulate the progression towards selflessness, regulate their emotions, and overcome fears. The second theme highlights how explicit teaching and practice cultivate prosocial behaviour and selfless thinking. The last theme foregrounds this study’s various positive influences on the learning community, including the teacher’s own pedagogy. &#xD;
       The resulting themes are related to the conceptual framework and additional indicators of selfless attributes nuanced through the data are highlighted. Finally, the impact of selfless pedagogy through LSI and future directions for further research are considered.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In northern latitudes, road salt (sodium chloride; NaCl) application is leading to soil and freshwater salinization, and having widespread environmental impacts. Canada applies over 5 million tonnes of road salt annually in order to maintain road safety during the winter. As there is currently no cost-effective alternative to sodium chloride, there is a need to develop a method of mitigating its detrimental environmental impacts. Phytoremediation offers a sustainable, in situ management option for road salt contamination whereby plants take up the salts and are then harvested to remove this contaminant from the environment. Three native halophytes (salt-tolerant plants) in the genus Atriplex were studied to determine their suitability for the phytoremediation of road salt. The Atriplex spp. accumulated 18-55 mg Na+/g dry weight (DW) and 41-64 mg Cl-/g DW when grown for a two-month period in soil spiked with NaCl to simulate a very highly salt-contaminated roadside (4620 µg/g Cl-). Based on extraction rates, it would theoretically take 6, 19, and 9 growing seasons for A. patula, A. hortensis, and A. canescens to remove all salt from a less highly contaminated area (1540 μg Cl-/g). Analysis of roadside soil samples from a minor highway in southern Ontario indicate that current chloride levels are actually an order of magnitude lower than this scenario (mean of 71 ± 89 μg Cl-/g in April 2019) when salt is applied as a 30% NaCl, 70% sand mixture. Thus, roadsides with relatively low salt input could be remediated in a shorter timeframe. In order for phytoremediation to be effective, it is important to understand how road salt migrates through soil. A mesocosm study was completed to investigate the movement of Na+ and Cl- in roadside soil following the spring melt. Analysis of the soil profiles revealed that Na+ was largely held in the top layer (0-5 cm), with 87% retention in the soil profile with a high salt application rate (300 kg/km). Chloride mainly followed the movement of porewater, with a much lower retention in soil (11% retention). Thus, for phytoremediation, halophytes should be planted early in the spring in order to access the chloride before it leaches into groundwater. The results from this thesis can be used to develop best practices for the phytoremediation of road salt.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Botanical collecting and illustrating had been a key part of an Enlightened education for elite women during the eighteenth century, and botanical practices were an established part of many women’s activities. As British women began to move about the globe in increasing numbers as part of British imperial expansion in the early nineteenth century, the cultural practices around the accumulation and development of scientific knowledge went with them. This thesis explores the practices of botanical science by analyzing the travels and activities of British women, while situating those activities within the global context of imperial expansion and projects of control. By tracing their movements and analyzing the forms that women’s scientific work took, I argue that women’s scientific work was not separate or subordinate to the work of male scientific practitioners, but rather took a variety of forms outside the practices that later defined what formal scientific participation could be. This thesis establishes how gendered forms of science activities were conducted by women in a variety of spaces and introduces how they formed a cultural context for the practice of science abroad in the colonies. Women’s activities were significant components in imperial processes used to establish control through domestic scientific spaces. The scientific activities of women, in a range of spaces, were not marginal to the projects of scientific progress and imperial expansion, but a significant part of the larger project of utilizing scientific knowledge in achieving certain imperial goals. In the frame of global circulation, political and economic instability, and cultural imperialism, women’s botanical work became a key part of the British empire’s goals of securing control over unstable colonial locations. I use the term “imperial science culture” to describe the science work which was such a crucial part of cultural imperialism and which was the context in which British women were practicing botanical activities. Through several case studies set in Britain and in colonial locations, such as British North America, India, Ceylon, and Mauritius, I demonstrate how women contributed to botanical science and acted as informal agents of the British empire through the formation of this imperial science culture.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cognitive load theory is of particular relevance to the learning and practice of medicine, where task demands require a complex interplay of working memory, emotion, and stress. To better understand the role of cognitive load in the performance of medical learners and expert physicians, this thesis aims to explore the ways in which cognitive load can be measured in a clinical setting using wearable technologies. First, both traditional literature and systematic reviews were conducted to identify the methods by which cognitive load can be measured using psychometric scales, secondary task performance, and physiologic response measures. Several themes emerged from the data extracted from the systematic review that identified key limitations in the cognitive load literature, including a lack of real world studies. An experiment was conducted in the emergency department of an academic medical center to measure the cognitive load of expert trauma physicians during real resuscitation response using a combination of physiologic measures and psychometric scales. Physiologic metrics showed correlation to self-reported cognitive load scores and offer a promising avenue for measuring cognitive load in an ambulatory setting. A second study was conducted in a clinical simulation center to measure the effectiveness of psychological skills training to enhance learning of first year medical residents during simulated resuscitation education. Both physiologic and psychometric outcomes revealed that this technique is effective in lowering cognitive load and that it may be used to enhance learning and performance in stressful situations. In summary, the chapters of this thesis present a detailed overview of cognitive load theory and its founding literature, describe the biophysical and engineering principles involved in its measurement, and demonstrate the successful real-world application of these concepts to medical learning and practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The coexistence of closely related species is thought to play an important role in shaping and maintaining local diversity and community organization. However, competition for shared limiting resources can inhibit coexistence unless species can reduce overlap in resource requirements or minimize differences in competitive ability. Many co-occurring species avoid the costs of coexistence by diverging in habitat use through a process known as habitat partitioning, allowing them to spatially avoid potential competitors. Habitat partitioning appears common among coexisting species and is thought to have important consequences for the evolution of species and traits, and community structure. Yet, despite the commonness of habitat partitioning, little is known about how and when habitat partitioning occurs and its role in facilitating species coexistence. Here, we take the first steps to understanding the role habitat partitioning plays in facilitating coexistence between seven species of burying beetles (genus: Nicrophorus) by examining their habitat associations where they co-occur. We test the hypothesis that co-occurring Nicrophorus species in southeastern Ontario partition resources by associating with different habitat characteristics or distinct habitat types, potentially to facilitate coexistence. To test this idea, we conducted a large-scale survey of carrion beetle abundance and 54 quantitative habitat characteristics at 100 randomly generated sites spanning an environmentally diverse and heterogenous region of southeastern Ontario. We identified the habitat associations of six co-occurring Nicrophorus species and three other carrion beetle species in the subfamily Silphinae. Our findings indicate that co-occurring Nicrophorus species do differ in their habitat use in a pattern consistent with habitat partitioning. Specifically, three Nicrophorus species (Nicrophorus pustulatus, N. hebes, and N. marginatus) were found to be habitat specialists for the forest canopy, wetlands, and open fields, respectively. Three other Nicrophorus species (N. orbicollis, N. sayi, and N. tomentosus) were found to be habitat generalists with wider breadths of habitat use and high overlap in habitat use with some other species. Our findings suggest that habitat may be an important resource axis along which some Nicrophorus species partition, however, divergence along other resource axes is likely also important for facilitating Nicrophorus coexistence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>From an early developmental stage, plants are exposed to both beneficial and pathogenic microbes. Upon pathogen detection, receptor complexes on the cell surface can detect conserved microbial molecules, such as bacterial flagellin, to elicit an immune response. Several early immune outputs are triggered by receptor complex activation, such as the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK) cascades and the production of extracellular reactive oxygen species, which ultimately confer broad-spectrum immunity. While this response is necessary for survival, it is energetically costly and can result in developmental trade-offs. The CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE (CPK28) negatively regulates immune output downstream of multiple receptor complexes by promoting turnover of a key positive regulator of immunity. To identify novel positive and regulators of the plant immune response, putative CPK28-associated proteins were previously identified through affinity purification of wild-type and kinase-dead CPK28 from stable Arabidopsis thaliana lines both before and after immune elicitation, followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. A putative MAPK KINASE KINASE (MAPKKK), MLK/RAF-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 1 (MRK1), and two protein phosphatase regulatory subunits, PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A (PP2A)-Bα and PP2A-Bβ, were identified in this screen as potential CPK28-associated proteins. The primary objective of my thesis was to examine the role of MRK1, MRK1-related family members, and the PP2A-B subunits in the plant innate immune response. Through functional characterization of double null lines, I found that MRK1 and two closely related proteins, Raf26 and Raf39, may negatively regulate immune-induced oxidative burst in a partially redundant manner. I also observed that MRK1 localizes to the cytosol in Arabidopsis, and present preliminary findings which suggest that MRK1 may play a role in normal rosette development. Taken together, this work suggests that MRK1 and related protein kinases may be acting as novel regulators of immunity, and primes future analysis on this previously unstudied family.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The disciplines of rehabilitation sciences and engineering are known work extensively in teams and require the competencies for effective collaboration as outlined by each discipline’s regulatory body. To make a positive impact in their respective professions, students must learn with, from, and about each other to create and perform as effective players in a team environment. The course Building Better Together (BBT) was created as a collaborative learning and leadership initiative, that seeks to enable students to gain a deeper understanding of their respective roles during the design process.  To better understand the impacts of interprofessional education and the processes involved in team functioning in Building Better Together, three research objectives were developed. The first objective was to explore the behaviours exhibited during interdisciplinary collaboration in a classroom case study. The second objective was to determine if there were any links between the strength of the team’s collaboration and team grades. The third objective was to examine the students’ perspectives on learning and collaborating in an interdisciplinary environment.&#xD;
Two studies were conducted to address these three objectives. The first study analyzed video footage of four teams to understand patterns in team behaviour and included links to course grades and peer assessments. Three key themes of interprofessional knowledge, partnership, and task focus were identified along with links between high course grades and strong team collaboration. The second study examined four self-report assessment tools to gain understanding of the student perspective on the skills required for interprofessional collaboration. Overall the students’ scores suggest they value the learning experience and feel that they are able to collaborate and learn as part of an interdisciplinary team.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The study of heat and solute transport in fractured rock can provide complementary information in aid of understanding the interaction between surface and groundwater, the long-term isolation of energy by products, the application of renewable energy storage systems, and the treatment of contaminated sites. Employing numerical modeling, this research was undertaken to assess the most influential factors controlling heat migration in discretely fractured rock under natural groundwater flow conditions, to address the effect of fracture aperture variability on the spatial distribution of a migrating thermal front, and to compare heat and solute transport mechanisms. Using factorial analyses, it is shown that the most influential factor controlling heat propagation in a single fracture setting is the velocity of the fluid in the fracture. The combination of effects of the thermal conductivity of the matrix with the velocity of the fluid, and of the thermal conductivity of the matrix with the aperture of the fracture dominantly control the attenuation of the thermal front migration. By integrating variable aperture fields with contact points, it is demonstrated that the effect of aperture variability on the spatial distribution of the thermal front is defined mainly by the thermal conductivity of the rock matrix. The effect of groundwater flow channeling on the spatial distribution of the thermal front is small, contrary to solute transport in a discrete fracture setting, where channeling is sometimes a major contributor to widespread solute migration rates and directions. The thermal plume in the fracture does not reach equilibrium over the 3-year period of the simulation in contrast to the solute plume that reaches steady state in less than ten days, mainly due to thermal conduction in the matrix which remains in disequilibrium. Two-dimensional conduction in the plane of the fracture and three-dimensional conduction in the matrix are important factors to consider when assessing the thermal plume in contrast to solute transport, whereas one-dimensional diffusion in the matrix and two-dimensional dispersion in the fracture are good assumptions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Traditional issue management systems like Bugzilla are widely used in open source and commercial projects. Stack Exchange uses its online question and answer (Q&amp;A) platform to manage bugs, which brings several new unique features that are not offered in traditional bug management systems.  In this thesis, we divide our study into the Q&amp;A features that are being used in the Stack Exchange issue management system, as well as study the differences between bug reports and feature requests that have been refined due to community collaborations. For the former part, we study the unique features of Stack Exchange Q&amp;A platform that allows users to directly edit a bug report (i.e., the in-place editing feature) instead of commenting about the bug report; use different communication channels (i.e., the answering and commenting features) to discuss reported bugs, and vote on those bug reports, answers, and their associated comments (i.e., the voting feature). We study how these unique features are used to manage bugs, and provide insights to the designers of traditional bug management systems who are considering introducing such features in their bug management system. The later part of this thesis performs a study of the differences between bug reports and feature requests in the Stack Exchange issue management system. We perform this study because: 1) Stack Exchange contains a large number of issues that have been carefully tagged as bug reports versus feature requests.  2) the issue management is carried out through a Q&amp;A platform, which provides us with a richer perspective on the differences  between the  management of bug  reports and feature requests. We found that bug reports and feature requests differ significantly from each other along many dimensions such as the amount of community participation, the content of the issues, and the characteristics of the participating users. We are able to automatically identify bug reports from feature requests with a median AUC of 0.90. The developers of issue management systems, software practitioners and researchers can leverage such understanding to improve issue management processes in large software projects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Studies have shown that certain postures, such as squatting and standing, may facilitate labour and birth and may be used by some practitioners. However, a rigorous biomechanical understanding of how different positions affect a woman’s pelvis during labour is currently lacking. It was hypothesized that there is a difference in relative pelvic bone position and orientation between different birthing positions that results in changes in pubic symphysis width. Therefore, we evaluated pubic symphysis width in positions that are used in clinics like lithotomy position and supine, and those suggested by midwives, such as standing and squatting, through three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of pubic symphysis ultrasound images.&#xD;
Eleven women in their seventh to ninth month of pregnancy were recruited to be participants. A 3D freehand ultrasound system was used to scan the pubic symphysis of each participant in the four birthing positions. Image and position data of the probe were acquired. In each position, images were resliced from the reconstructed 3D volume and the same landmarks at the superior and inferior parts of pubic symphysis were located.&#xD;
The results were consistent with two comparable studies. The average superior and inferior pubic symphysis widths in lithotomy, squatting and standing positions were larger than those in the supine position by approximately 1mm. However, there was no significant difference between lithotomy, squatting and standing positions. &#xD;
The angles between right and left bones were calculated in an anatomical coordinate system. A significant difference was only found between standing and squatting and lithotomy in the rotation angle about the medio-lateral axis.&#xD;
The results suggest that positions with thigh hyperflexion and gravity effect make a difference in pubic symphysis width and might have a positive effect in childbirth. However, due to the small sample size, no definite conclusion can be drawn.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The evolution of the passive margin off the coast of Eastern Canada has been characterized by a series of rifting episodes beginning approximately 200 ma which caused widespread extension of the lithosphere and associated structural anomalies, some with the potential to be classified as a result of lithospheric boudinage. Crustal thinning of competent layers is often apparent in seismic sections, and deeper Moho undulations may appear as repeating elongated anomalies in gravity and magnetic surveys. This investigation supplements our knowledge of analogous examples which have been linked to boudinage as a driving mechanism, to determine that similar structures are evident in the context of the Grand Banks. More recently in the last 20 ka, the region has been subject to crustal warping and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA)-induced visco-elastic deformation. Numerical simulations were run using different rheological parameters and ice load histories to obtain a model which may be representative of the isostatic response for the Grand Banks. The goal was to assess the potential impact on hydrocarbon reservoirs and trapping structures as a consequence of GIA processes, which may include various deformation-related implications.. Comparisons may be drawn to related studies, including the postglacial implications on reservoirs in the Barents Sea, as well as validation of GIA model predictions using GPS and Canadian Base Network vertical motion data to determine a best-fitting model to the present-day observations. As a result of this study, it is clear that there are potential effects from GIA since the Last Glacial Maximum, and there is still vertical motion in the region meaning these effects may continue.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This report will provide a contribution to the history of the Community Planning Association of Canada (CPAC) and, more specifically, its Quebec Division, and its role in the development of the planning profession and planning practices. It will look at the historical context that led to the emergence of the CPAC, its expansion into Quebec, and will focus on three particular areas of influence. This report will argue that the role of the CPAC has been underappreciated in urban planning historiography and that the current major treatment of planning history in Quebec, André Boisvert’s Aménagement et Urbanisme au Québec, provides little coverage of the topic. Using archival material from the CPAC, this report attempts to reconstruct some of the vital contributions the association brought to the development of planning in the province of Quebec.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zirconium and its alloys are of great importance to the nuclear power industry due to their unique combination of mechanical properties, low neutron-capture cross-section, and sufficient corrosion resistance under reducing water conditions. Zirconium alloys constitute most nuclear fuel claddings and structural components in CANDU and light water reactors. Despite many desirable material properties, zirconium is susceptible to a corrosion reaction that results in the gradual pick-up of hydrogen during service in nuclear power plants. Once the local hydrogen concentration exceeds the Terminal Solid Solubility of Precipitation, brittle hydrides can form. The precipitated hydride phase has been shown to degrade the bulk mechanical properties of zirconium cladding and introduce mechanisms for failure through delayed hydride cracking. The behavior of Zr-H system at low hydrogen concentrations continues to be the subject of research due to both its wide engineering application and the high complexity of the system. &#xD;
An idea to consider not only each single phase participating in the hydride-matrix interaction but also different hydride orientations (relative to parent Zr texture) opens new horizons for investigation of the Zr-H system. The current study is the first attempt to provide insight regarding the micro-scale direction of possible hydrogen migration within the α-Zr matrix and to evaluate changes in local strains on the grain length scale in the Zr-H system undergoing hydride precipitation. Finally, the research presented in this thesis aimed to improve our understanding of the stability of the Zr-H system. Phase changes occurring in a sample immediately after electrolytic hydriding, was investigated along with a reverse conversion occurring in the as-hydrided sample upon prolonged ageing. Surface hydride formation and its transformation during ageing was inspected using advanced characterization techniques such as SEM and AFM imaging, EBSD, and X-ray diffraction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The mitochondrion is a critical component of the cell and is responsible for producing energy needed by our bodies. One way our body adapts to exercise is by enlarging and creating more mitochondria. A primary protein believed to be involved in regulating these exercise-induced mitochondrial changes is called peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Generally, the harder someone exercises (i.e. higher exercise intensities), the more PGC-1α increases. There are also several proteins that ‘turn on’ or activate PGC-1α, and these too increase as exercise intensity goes up. This means exercise at a given intensity proportionately increases both PGC-1α and its activators. Consequently, it has been difficult for researchers to single out the impact of any one particular activator of PGC-1α on PGC-1α in human muscle. &#xD;
&#xD;
If researchers experimentally reduce blood flow to exercising muscle, it could help them understand the effect of a particular PGC-1α activator on PGC-1α because some activators should be sensitive to amounts of oxygen in our muscle cells. Specifically, because blood flow restricted (BFR) aerobic exercise should reduce the amount of oxygen in exercising muscle, the role of a particular oxygen-sensitive PGC-1α activator may be better understood by using BFR and non-BFR aerobic exercise protocols to compare amounts of PGC-1α produced. Matching the intensity of these two protocols is important because that way the non-oxygen-sensitive PGC-1α activators can remain unchanged while the oxygen sensitive one(s) should increase. &#xD;
&#xD;
Indeed, results from previous studies suggest that this may be the case, however these studies have two general limitations. First, the BFR models used in those studies are expensive and difficult to build. Second, these studies were conducted in a way that leaves them vulnerable to the influence of bias; bias matters because it may lead to potentially incorrect results and interpretations. Minimizing bias is an essential aspect of good research. Therefore, we developed an inexpensive BFR model that uses gravity to reduce muscle oxygenation, and we used experimental best practices to test our hypothesis that our BFR model would increase both PGC-1α and its oxygen-sensitive activator more than intensity-matched non-BFR aerobic exercise. Our results supported this hypothesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Most debates about the viability of a given moral theory are won and lost, or at least brought to an end, through resort to a familiar pattern of argument: if a theory calls for that course of action, can it really claim to offer a substantively correct account of morality? This debate operates on the plausible premise that a moral theory rises and falls with the substantive correctness of its prescriptions. But this debate is also premised on the idea that moral theory has a claim to make on us. Not everyone grants this premise. Indeed, Bernard Williams’ work presents a denial of the claim that moral theory has the normative authority to demand anything of us at all. This familiar inversion of the claim that morality is overly demanding is a serious objection to the task of working out a moral theory. It suggests that interlocutors in the debate detailed above claim ground to which moral theory is not ultimately entitled. This thesis details Contractualism’s capacity to answer to this challenge. In particular, this thesis defends the idea that Contractualism offers an account of inter-personal morality that is substantively correct and accessible to integrated agents. Contractualism’s account of inter-personal wrongness, and the powerful reasons we have to avoid wronging others, satisfies the twin conditions of substantive correctness and normative coherence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogenous disease that includes debilitating cognitive deficits, including working memory (WM). The n-back task used to examine WM as it requires continuous updating and recall. The present study examined the effects of MDD and cognitive load during the n-back task (0- and 2-back). The following were predicted, as cognitive load increased: (1) participants would display decreased accuracy and increased reaction time; (2) increased activity would be found in regions associated with WM; and (3) MDD symptoms and accuracy would be correlated with functional activity in these regions.&#xD;
Methods: MDD patients (n = 29) completed the n-back task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Behavioural and imaging data were analysed between conditions. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores and task accuracy were correlated with functional activity for each participant.&#xD;
Results: Compared to 0-back, participants demonstrated decreased accuracy and longer reaction times in the 2-back condition. During the 0-back condition, activity was seen in the bilateral insula and the middle occipital gyrus; in the 2-back condition, activity was seen in the middle and medial frontal gyri and the inferior parietal lobule. MADRS scores were not significantly correlated with activity in either condition. Activity in all regions identified in the 2-back condition were positively correlated with performance accuracy.&#xD;
Discussion: In the 0-back condition, activated regions are associated with resting state activities and the processing of visual stimuli. Compared to the 0-back condition, higher levels of activity were found during 2-back in the middle and medial frontal gyri and inferior parietal lobule, which are associated with WM, visual processing, and complex cognitive processes, indicating that participants required more neural resources during the more difficult task. Significant and mid-sized effects were found in the 2-back condition between accuracy and activity in the middle and medial frontal gyri and inferior parietal lobule, suggesting that MDD patients require more effort to perform well in cognitively demanding tasks. Limitations include the small and largely female sample, which would be improved by including more participants and considering covariates.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Natural convective heat transfer from two-sided flat plates that are horizontal or inclined to the horizontal has been numerically and experimentally investigated. The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of changes in the plate thickness, of the boundary condition over the plate side surface, of the plate shape, and of the inclination angle on the heat transfer rate. A further objective was to investigate whether the heat transfer rate from a flat plate can be increased by using a plate having a non-flat surface. The heated elements considered were exposed to air. The heat transfer rate was numerically obtained by using the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT© and experimentally determined using the lumped capacity method. &#xD;
In addition, natural convective heat transfer from bottom-heated rectangular enclosures that contain a nanofluid and which have various aspect ratios was numerically studied. The purpose was to determine whether the heat transfer rate from the heated bottom wall of the enclosure can be increased compared to that which would exist with pure water and to study the influence of the nanofluid nanoparticle concentration and of the enclosure aspect ratio on the heat transfer rate.&#xD;
The results of the studies of natural convective heat transfer from heated plates indicated that the plate thickness and the thermal boundary condition have only a modest influence on the heat transfer rate from the bottom surface of the plate. The influence of the inclination angle on the heat transfer rate from the top surface of the plate is higher than its influence on that from the bottom surface. For the case of the plate having a non-flat surface, the results indicated that the heat transfer rate can be enhanced by using a non-flat surface but this enhancement is relatively small.&#xD;
The results of the study of heat transfer across a nanofluid filled enclosure showed that the heat transfer rate is significantly increased by replacing pure water with a nanofluid (Cu-water) and by increasing the nanoparticle concentration. It was also found that the enclosure aspect ratio had only a small influence on the heat transfer rate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the first essay, we build a model investigating how the nature of managerial human capital affects firms' choices of growth strategies. The model shows&#xD;
that when firms are cash constrained, managers with more general managerial skills are more likely to foster growth via acquisitions, which is further moderated by firms’ financial slack and agency concern. We find empirical evidence supporting the model predictions. Moreover, we use variation in enforceability of non-compete agreements in U.S. states as an instrument for general managerial skills and find a positive and causal impact of general managerial skills on growth via acquisitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the second essay, we study whether it is optimal for a firm to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) when regulatory oversight was imperfect. The model suggests that a regulator who cannot perfectly monitor firm compliance may have to set inefficiently loose regulation. It then becomes optimal for the firm to hire a socially responsible worker who chooses to engage more in CSR. We test the model in two ways. Using the EU sample, we find that firms on average had lower CSR ratings after the introduction of the mandatory disclosure policy than the firms from 15 European countries that did not have a mandatory disclosure policy in place. Using US sample, we find that industries most hit by outsourcing and globalization are those that increase their CSR scores the most. Both sets of results support the predictions of the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the third essay, we study how competition between two downstream firms affects an upstream&#xD;
innovator's innovation strategy, which includes selecting how much innovation to produce and whether to license this innovation to one (targeted licensing) or both (market-wide licensing) downstream competitors. Our model points to a U-shaped relationship between downstream competition and upstream innovation: at low levels of competition, market-wide licensing is the optimal and competition reduces innovation, while at high levels of competition targeted licensing is optimal and competition increases innovation. Empirical analysis using a large&#xD;
panel of U.S. data provides clear support for these predictions linking competition, innovation and licensing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Graphene materials have been the center of attention due to their physicochemical properties. Moreover, in the past decade, these materials have attracted increasing attention because of their antimicrobial properties. A variety of antimicrobial mechanisms, both physical and chemical have been proposed but they are not clearly elucidated or the evidence in the literature may be contradictory. Graphene materials in this project were provided by Grafoid Inc. as coatings on glass substrates. &#xD;
These materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy to help understand the effects of different preparation methods and coating properties on their antimicrobial properties. Super oxide anion dependent and independent oxidative stress assays revealed that oxidative stress was not a major pathway to cell inactivation after one hour of contact. Three different microorganisms were placed in contact with the graphene coatings to study the effects of type and shape of microorganisms on cell death. Cells in close contact with the graphene surface were killed and coccal-shaped Staphylococcus epidermidis had the highest survival on the coatings regardless of the preparation method, surface coverage, and functionality of the coatings, whereas rod-shaped cells (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) had higher levels of death, with the Gram negative E. coli usually having a lower level of survival than the Gram positive B. subtilis. Among materials prepared by Method 1, fluorinated reduced graphene oxide coatings had the highest antimicrobial activity, whereas graphene oxide coatings had the lowest antimicrobial activity. Conversely, when (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) was used in Method 2 to enhance the attachment of graphene coating to the glass surface, then the graphene oxide coatings had the highest and the fluorinated reduced graphene oxide coatings had the lowest antimicrobial activity. E. coli death increased slightly with increasing surface coverage of the coating, regardless of the preparation method and surface functionality of the coating. Contact time between bacterial cells and graphene coatings is also important as rod-shaped cells had almost 100% cell death after three hours of contact with graphene coatings prepared by Method 2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Annually, new nurses transition from the role of student to registered nurse as they enter the workforce.  These nurses have described feelings of stress and anxiety about ‘absolutely everything’.  To identify and address factors that facilitate and enhance successful transitions into the workforce, it is vital to understand the perceptions of these new nurses during their orientation and transition periods.  While researchers have examined these experiences, previous methodological limitations have left gaps where further analysis is required.  &#xD;
Purpose:  The aim of this study was to describe new nurses’ perceptions of their hospital orientation and subsequent transition in their first two years of practice after graduating from an undergraduate nursing program.  &#xD;
Methods:  Within an interpretive paradigm, a descriptive, exploratory, qualitative methodology was used to conduct semi-structured interviews.  Eight RNs who graduated from an undergraduate nursing program and completed a hospital orientation within the past two years were interviewed using a secure, online video conferencing platform. &#xD;
Results:  New nurses highlighted the value and importance of the following themes during their orientation and transition into practice: authentic leadership, workplace empowerment, support for professional practice, person-job fit, new graduate support, demographics, psychological capital, and incivility.  New insight into this population showed themes such as the use of technology, physical health, patient impact, and support from family and friends to be important during their orientation and transition. &#xD;
Conclusions:  The interview discussions were about leaders in healthcare, preceptors, education, well-being, patient safety, and support for practice. These results aid in identifying and addressing some of the shortcomings experienced by new nurses.  This research has significant implications for both nursing education, practice, and future research.  It impacts the undergraduate nursing curriculum with the goal to better prepare nursing students for their transitions into practice. Additionally, conclusions could help to develop more encompassing orientation programs in Canadian hospitals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The hypothesis that sleep may have beneficial effects on memory consolidation has been widely reported for many years (Jenkins &amp; Dallenbach, 1924; Van Ormer, 1933; Fowler, Sullivan, &amp; Ekstrand, 1973). Since then, these findings regarding improved memory retention have also been extended to shorter napping periods (Tucker et al., 2006). Given the memory impairments commonly displayed in individuals with depression (Bearden et al., 2006), this study aimed to explore the impacts of napping on memory consolidation in depressed individuals. Specifically, this study attempted to mimic the educational aspect of cognitive remediation therapy to explore whether napping can be beneficial to memory retention of clinically-relevant information in depressed individuals. To simulate the didactic portion of cognitive remediation, we developed a clinically-relevant memory test using a psychoeducational video that introduces the effects of depression on cognition. Subsequently, we determined whether a napping period can benefit the consolidation of this clinically-relevant material in depressed and non-depressed individuals. We found no differences in memory performance over time between individuals who napped and individuals who stayed awake. However, we did observe associations between several sleep parameters and the degree of memory decay. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the relationship between napping and memory consolidation in individuals with depression and may provide a more ecologically valid style of memory testing for future studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: To determine whether participating centre annual accrual and centre-size corrected (“proportional”) accrual are associated with overall survival in Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) clinical trials. &#xD;
Methods: The association between centre annual accrual and overall survival was analyzed for all Canadian participants enrolled by 88 member sites onto 52 phase III clinical trials led by CCTG between 1975 and 2013. Centre annual accrual rate per year was used as a continuous variable. 30 member centres in the Province of Ontario with available referral/treatment data were used to determine the association of centre-size corrected accrual with overall survival, where centre size is estimated by the number of treated cases seen at the centre, and centre-size corrected accrual is defined as the proportion of patients treated at a single centre accrued to clinical trials. The association of accrual measures with overall survival was estimated by a hierarchical mixed effects Cox-proportional hazards models. &#xD;
Results: Median CCTG annual accrual at 88 member centres was 2.47 patients per year (IQR 1.54 – 3.89). Analysis included 20 353 Canadian participants, and 10 338 Ontario participants enrolled onto 52 phase III trials. Centres with higher annual accrual (per 1 patient / year) had longer patient overall survival (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 – 0.99, p = 0.006) after adjustment for covariates. The median centre-size corrected accrual (i.e. as proportion of total incident cases) of Ontario cancer patients that were recruited into CCTG trials, from member centres, was 0.13% (IQR 0.09% – 0.31%). Centre-size corrected accrual (per 0.10% increase in percent of patients accrued to clinical trials) was marginally significantly associated with patient overall survival (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 – 1.02, p = 0.057). &#xD;
Conclusions:  Overall survival is longer for cancer patients on CCTG trials treated by high-accruing centres. When centre-size corrected (“proportional”) accrual is modelled, the association with patient overall survival is marginally significant.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background&#xD;
The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (HSFC) reports that up to 40,000 Canadians experience cardiac arrest per year (HSFC, 2016). Of these 40,000, 13.7 to 22.3 per cent achieve return of spontaneous circulation but only 10.5 per cent survive to discharge (Benjamin et al., 2019; Girotra et al., 2012). Global health authorities have set a target of doubling rates of survival from cardiac arrest by 2020 (Diercks, Al-Khatib, &amp; Link, 2016). Meeting this target will rely heavily on well-educated and highly skilled nurses. &#xD;
Virtual simulation gaming (VSG) is a promising educational tool that helps faculty convey resuscitation education in an engaging and effective way (Borg Sapiano, Sammut, &amp; Trapani, 2018). With the goal of helping students learn how to care for patients in cardiac arrest, a resuscitation-oriented VSG was created. The objective of this thesis was to examine the effect of VSG on nursing students’ during a resuscitation-oriented clinical simulation.&#xD;
Research Question&#xD;
In senior-level undergraduate nursing students undergoing resuscitation education, does VSG pre-simulation preparation, when compared to traditional pre-simulation preparation, result in greater student performance during a resuscitation-oriented clinical simulation, as evaluated through the use of a 12-item performance checklist?&#xD;
Method&#xD;
Twenty (20) senior-level undergraduate nursing students were recruited to participate in a pilot randomised controlled trial. The trial compared student performance during a resuscitation-oriented clinical simulation. Students were provided either the HSFC’s Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) guidelines or a resuscitation-oriented VSG in combination with the HSFC’s BLS and ACLS guidelines.&#xD;
Results&#xD;
A Mann-Whitney U test reported significantly greater overall performance by the intervention group (Median [Mdn] = 12) than the control group (Mdn = 8) during a resuscitation-oriented clinical simulation, as evaluated through a 12-item performance checklist (U = 12, p = .003).&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
The results of this work indicate that inclusion of a VSG as an adjunct pre-simulation preparation tool for resuscitation education could have a positive impact on students’ performance during clinical simulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A novel method is proposed to imperceptibly embed structured light patterns in projected content and decode them to extract a real time range image stream suitable for dynamic projection mapping applications. A commercially available DLP projector is synchronized with camera capture at rates faster than can be perceived. This allows a stream of grey code patterns to be imperceptibly projected and acquired to realize dense, imperceptible, real time, temporally encoded structured light. The method is deployed on a calibrated and stereo rectified procam system to perform depth triangulation from the extracted patterns. The bandwidth achieved imperceptibly is over 6 million points per second using a general &#xD;
 purpose CPU which is comparable to perceptible commercial hardware accelerated structured light depth cameras.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Biolubricants are lubricants with a base oil produced from biological feedstock. Ester-based biolubricants enjoy the most widespread commercial use, even though complex chemical modifications are required to improve their physicochemical properties. Renewable-hydrocarbon biolubricants can be more attractive because they possess desirable qualities such as superior cold-flow properties and oxidative and hydrolytic stability. In addition, hydrocarbon-based biolubricants are more similar to conventional lubricants and can be easily substituted using existing infrastructure and lubricant formulations. Current research on renewable hydrocarbons is heavily focused on hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils involving operating conditions in excess of 50 bar and 450 °C. Alternative routes such as those involving electrochemical decarboxylation through Kolbe electrolysis (KE) benefit from milder conditions and consume less hydrogen overall. A further benefit of Kolbe electrolysis is the potential for integration into renewable energy systems. The biolubricant production process using KE requires a hydrogenation pre-treatment stage and a hydroisomerization (HI) post-treatment stage. Theoretically, this process can be improved by combining both stages into a single pre-treatment HI. Experiments performed using HI of fatty acids have shown difficulty in converting oleic acid to isostearic acid. Key issues include the occurrence of hydrogenation without isomerization and a loss of carboxyl groups during isomerization. A factorial experimental design was used to determine how factors such as temperature and pressure might influence the isomerization process. Additionally, several experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that lactones can be converted via hydrogenation into carboxyl groups. Results indicate that temperature is a highly significant parameter in the isomerization process and that higher temperatures are beneficial for the production of branched compounds. Unfortunately, the production of branched compounds is accompanied by a loss of carboxyl groups. Lactone hydrogenation experiments were unsuccessful in restoring carboxyl functionality. It is possible that a different catalyst than platinum on alumina is required for the hydrogenation of lactones. Another possibility is that lactone formation is a minor contributor to the loss of carboxyls and the main cause for the loss is an irreversible deoxygenation reaction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Those who experience psychosis struggle to find inclusion within educational institutions (Goulding, Chien, &amp; Compton, 2010; Laurence, Rosseau, Foriter, &amp; Mottard, 2016; Morgan et al., 2012) despite a growing recognition of the need to create an equitable environment for students with mental health difficulties. This research explores the complexities of the experiences of students with psychosis in the secondary school environment with a view to improving support for these individuals. The research focused on each student’s unique experiences by using an empowerment and narrative inquiry design. I recruited a small sample of three primary participants from an early psychosis intervention program located in an Ontario community. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured one-on-one interviews and analyzed with narrative processes. My findings are presented through retelling the story of each participant’s high school experiences, and highlighting their perceptions of inclusion and support. Key findings in Mary, Angel, and Isaac’s stories describe: (a) typical high school experiences, external challenges, academic challenges, and social challenges; (b) sense of belonging, community participation, social inclusion at school, and the challenges that impacted how participants were included at school; and (c) feelings of support, environmental supports, supportive people, supportive actions, and the challenges that impacted support at school. Reading the stories of these students will provide teachers, administrators and policy makers with insight into the unique experiences of students who live with early psychosis. My aim is that this insight will contribute to a more inclusive discussion about mental health in education, informed by the voices of students who have experienced psychosis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ever-present demand for increased performance in mechanical systems, with reduced cost and manufacturing time, has led to the adoption of computational design tools and innovative manufacturing methods. Among these tools is topology optimization, which typically produces highly complex designs that can be prohibitively difficult to manufacture. However, recent developments in additive manufacturing provide the means to manufacture such designs, including components suitable for service in industrial and commercial applications. Integration of these two technologies has the potential to reveal further benefits and innovate the design and manufacture of mechanical components. &#xD;
This work presents a novel mathematical methodology for simultaneous build orientation and topology optimization, which considers additive manufacturing cost and time, and structural compliance. Various physical factors that influence additive manufacturing cost and time were researched, with component surface area and support volume implemented as contributors in this work. The presented methodology approximates support volume throughout topology optimization with variable build orientation; a critical ability, as support volume is highly dependent on both part topology and build orientation. This enables direct minimization of support volume in simultaneous density-based topology and build orientation optimization; an area that was previously unaddressed in literature. Sensitivity expressions were derived for the continuous and differentiable methodology, thereby permitting the use of efficient gradient-based optimization solvers. Three numerical examples are provided that demonstrate the proposed methodology is capable of efficiently identifying optimum build orientations, while performing the simultaneous optimization. Evaluation of the support volume and build time required to manufacture the optimization results, using commercial additive manufacturing software, demonstrated the ability of the optimization to reduce additive manufacturing cost and time. The simultaneous optimization performed in these examples produced a range of designs with equivalent performance to designs produced by multi-objective topology optimization performed at a fixed optimal orientation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Teacher turnover, often referred to as teacher attrition or migration, has been a growing worldwide concern for many years, particularly for teachers within their first five years of the teaching profession. Multiple studies have been conducted that identify the causes of teacher turnover and the possible teacher retention strategies within schools that can reduce the impact of this problem. Despite having knowledge of the factors that cause teacher turnover and the potential solutions for teacher retention, much of the research available on teacher turnover is both US-based and quantitative in nature, and as a result the unique and descriptive accounts of the human voices that experience the issue are often underrepresented from outside North America. &#xD;
Inspired by my own experiences while working in an international school, this phenomenological study was conducted with the purpose of discovering and exploring the unique experiences of Canadian-certified early-career teachers surrounding the challenges, barriers and supports connected to teacher turnover and retention decisions in international secondary schools that use a Canadian curriculum in China. In order to carry out this study, a combination of a survey and individual interviews was used. Surveys were analyzed descriptively while interview data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a general inductive approach.&#xD;
The findings of this study suggest that turnover and retention decisions in China are highly individualistic in nature and depend on a multitude of different contextual and individual factors. However, five main themes emerged from participants’ accounts which were influential in turnover and retention decisions. They included: participants motivations for working in China; barriers that influence turnover decisions; existing supports to overcome turnover challenges; supports teachers feel would be beneficial to enhance retention decisions; and, advice from teachers to teachers. By exploring these themes, a more comprehensive understanding of beginning teachers’ perceptions and experiences surrounding the phenomenon of turnover and retention decisions in international schools in China emerged. Moreover, the importance of supporting early-career teachers both individually and professionally during the transition period into the teaching profession was highlighted throughout this study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Storm waves breaking on steeply-sloping sand beaches can generate strong currents across a narrow surf zone, and experience different rates of sediment transport and morphodynamic change compared to &#xD;
beaches with milder slopes. To investigate the dynamics on this type of beach, a three-dimensional &#xD;
physical model is implemented in a wave basin and a long steeply-sloping sandy beach is exposed to a &#xD;
series of different conditions generated by a paddle. Three different experiments are performed to observe &#xD;
the nearshore responses to surface waves. &#xD;
A momentum balance approach is applied to the nearshore hydrodynamics inside and outside the surf &#xD;
zone to investigate the transfer of wave momentum to the alongshore flow. This approach reveals that &#xD;
radiation stress gradients and cross-shore advection terms are dominant in the shoaling region. In the breaking region, the momentum exchange is mainly governed by the radiation stress gradients with a &#xD;
smaller contribution from cross-shore advection that relatively balances with the bottom friction and &#xD;
horizontal mixing terms. &#xD;
To investigate the beach morphology change, topographic surveys of a beach-dune system are performed and related to changes in wave energy during a storm. The results indicate that a near-vertical beach scarp forms, retreats landward, and then becomes controlled by the nearshore beach slope. Sediment eroded to form the scarp is initially deposited at the dune toe, however, as wave energy increases sand is transported by the alongshore current and is deposited in the nearshore zone increasing the surf zone width. &#xD;
A non-hydrostatic phase-resolving numerical model is used to investigate the wave-driven hydrodynamics that correspond to observed beach morphology changes during a storm. The numerical results indicate that the alongshore current is generated by wave breaking in the nearshore zone and it &#xD;
increases in magnitude across a widening surf zone for increasing wave energy. This is associated with a &#xD;
bottom shear stress that exceeds the critical bed shear stress, with the potential to initiate motion and &#xD;
transport sediment in agreement with the experimental observations. Overall, the results of this thesis provide insight into the coupled interaction between the three-dimensional wave-driven hydrodynamics and morphologic evolution of a steep sandy beach.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly heterogeneous in its etiology, symptom presentation, course, and treatment response. Despite knowing this for decades, however, clinicians and researchers have generally treated MDD as homogenous by relying on total symptom severity scores and linking them to broadly defined etiological factors (e.g. childhood adversity). To truly understand the complex associations between MDD etiology and symptom presentation, general etiological factors need to be deconstructed into their distinct components and independently linked to individual symptom dimensions of MDD. This thesis project aimed to untangle heterogeneity in MDD etiology and symptom presentation by investigating symptom dimensions uniquely associated with childhood emotional, physical and sexual maltreatment. MDD symptom dimensions were identified with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) responses, using three archival datasets covering 243 community-sampled depressed participants. The data-driven measurement model of the HRSD was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) alongside a four-factor model taken from a previous meta-analysis of HRSD factor structure. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), associations were estimated between HRSD factors and childhood maltreatment (CM) variables from the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) retrospective clinical interview. A five-factor measurement model of the HRSD was identified, which statistically outperformed the four-factor theoretical model. No structural models were formally retained due to poor model fit with the sample data, meaning that the CM-MDD associations observed in this investigation were inconclusive. Although inconclusive, these results suggested that MDD symptom specificity does vary across the different CM types and that some MDD symptoms are associated more strongly with certain CM types than others. Initial evidence suggests that all symptoms captured by the HRSD are more severe in individuals with a history of sexual maltreatment, that anxiety and anhedonia-like symptoms are worse in individuals with a history of physical maltreatment, and that core depression symptoms are worse in individuals with a history of emotional maltreatment. To determine which of these specific associations generalize beyond the current sample, however, this SEM analysis must be cross-validated with an additional sample of community-residing depressed individuals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding how we gain representations of music is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of music perception. Several studies suggest that listeners extract statistical regularities in music via passive exposure, i.e., statistical learning. Statistical learning could thus underlie our ability to learn about unfamiliar music. While research shows that musical short-term knowledge can be gained via this process, it remains unclear whether longer lasting knowledge can be gained this way. This thesis aims to address this issue.&#xD;
In Study 1, participants gave probe-tone ratings before and after exposure to an artificial music genre defined by its tone distribution.  Participants’ responses to these tones revealed that  they are sensitive to both the tone distribution of the preceding tone sequence and tone distributions encountered earlier in the experiment. This suggests that musical knowledge can be gained via statistical learning over and above short-term knowledge. Participants also distinguished the exposed music genre from another artificial genre after exposure. In Study 2a, I ascertain that this result is not due to prior familiarity with one of the artificial music genres. In Studies 2b and 2c, I show that participants can differentiate the two music genres based on pitch cues.&#xD;
In Studies 3a and 3b, I compared participants’ brain activity following congruent and incongruent tones to familiar or unfamiliar tone distributions using EEG. Activity at frontal electrodes from 380 to 450 ms post stimulus onset was larger for incongruent probe tones, but only when the preceding probe-tone context was based on the familiar tone distribution. This event-related potential can be considered an index of musical long-term knowledge because behavioral results suggest that participants were influenced not just by short-term knowledge when presented with familiar tone distribution probe-tone contexts. In Study 4, participants completed Study 1’s paradigm. Key behavioral results from Study 1 were replicated. Further, EEG data suggest that musical long-term knowledge may form simply through encountering an unfamiliar music genre in short tone sequences, without extended exposure. &#xD;
These findings are discussed regarding their implications for the statistical learning of music, the influence of music training, and the field of statistical learning research in general.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gas bubbles can significantly affect contaminant transport in both sediments and groundwater systems. In some circumstances, gas bubble mobilization can result in the transport of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) as coatings or films on the gas bubble surface, which could move a greater mass of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through a porous medium than what might be transported as volatized, gas-phase mass. Despite this potential enhanced transport, whose outcomes include the appearance of oil sheens created as gas bubbles break at the water surface after being transported out of contaminated sediments, there has been little controlled laboratory study to determine factors that may control bubble-facilitated NAPL transport in porous media. Laboratory experiments conducted in thin, two-dimensional flow cells packed with medium sand showed that both trapped LNAPL (heptane, decane, soltrol 100) and DNAPL (creosote) could be mobilized when subjected to gas flow. In these experiments, LNAPL mobilization originated from the top of the source zone and moved along the gas flow pathway as a clearly visible finger (as high as 11.3 cm). When the emplaced upper sand layer was too thin (5.4 cm), the breakthrough of this LNAPL finger occurred, resulting in contamination of the clean water above the sand. LNAPL fingers occurred predominantly during relaxation and gas redistribution (slow discontinuous gas flow) after air injection was stopped in the 10 mL/min experiments. Observed pore-scale double displacements were considered as the main reason for the LNAPL finger development. In comparison, creosote was mobilized as either thin films on the bubble surface or tails below the bubbles. Petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) concentrations measured above the clean sand indicated that creosote was constantly released out of the sand pack over 8 hours in the short-term experiments, with more mass being released through thinner and finer sand layers. In the long-term experiment, clearly visible evidence suggested significant depletion (~69%) of the DNAPL source zone after 30 days of gas injection. The similar ratios of PAHs in the transported and original source creosote confirmed the stable transport of creosote as a whole in the sand layer without breakdown rather than by mass transfer to the gas bubbles.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:&#xD;
Over the past several years, reports of excessive stress and symptoms of languishing mental health have been increasingly reported among samples of Canadian post-secondary students. Chronic stress is highly correlated with negative mental health outcomes and formal diagnoses for common mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, have continued to climb. The purpose of this doctoral research program was to develop a new instrument to better assess the sources of post-secondary student stress. Existing instruments in this area are imperfect for a number of reasons, including weak (or lack of) psychometric analyses, poorly focused scope, and outdatedness. Importantly, few existing tools have involved students in the process of development. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods:&#xD;
The development of the Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI) spanned two years, and involved students as collaborators and subject matter experts over the course of the project. The instrument was designed to identify stressors specific to the post-secondary setting, with the aim of providing post-secondary institutions with a tool to identify the most significant sources of stress for students on their campuses. To facilitate item pool development, students participated in online surveys and focus group discussions. The initial item pool, derived from these qualitative responses, was then refined through the use of individual cognitive interviews and an online Delphi method. Finally, an online pilot test was conducted to assess psychometric properties. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results:&#xD;
The PSSI is composed of 46 stressors across five domains: academics, learning environment, campus culture, interpersonal, and personal. Students were asked to rate each stressor by severity and frequency. The tool demonstrated strong psychometric properties, with four types of validation evidence collected to support its validity: content, response processes, internal construct (including test-retest reliability), and relations to other variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion:&#xD;
Our exploratory sequential mixed methods research design allowed for the development of a heavily context-based tool demonstrating strong psychometric properties. The PSSI can provide Canadian post-secondary institution administrators, student wellness staff, and program developers with a valid method of identifying the sources of student stress on their campus, and facilitate better targeting of mental health promotion and mental illness prevention efforts to best support students’ needs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent advancements in geophysical exploration have been realized through reliably integrating unmanned aerial vehicle platforms with lightweight, high-resolution magnetometer payloads. Unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic surveys can provide a contemporary data product between the two end-members of coverage and resolution attained using manned airborne and terrestrial magnetic surveys. This new data product is achievable because unmanned aerial vehicle platforms can safely traverse with magnetometer payloads at flight elevations closer to ground targets than manned airborne surveys, while also delivering an increased coverage rate compared to walking conventional terrestrial surveys. This is a promising new development for geophysical and mineral exploration applications, especially in variable terrains. A three-dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic survey was conducted within the Shebandowan Greenstone Belt, northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, in July 2017.  A series of two-dimensional grids (~500 m x 700 m) were flown at approximate elevations of 35 m, 45 m and 70 m above ground level using a Dà-Jiāng Innovations multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (S900) and a GEM Systems, Inc. Potassium Vapour Magnetometer (GSMP-35U). In total, over 48 line-km’s of unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic data were flown with a line spacing of 25 m. The collected aeromagnetic data were compared to a regional heliborne aeromagnetic survey flown at an elevation of approximately 85 m above the terrain, with a line spacing of 100 m, as well as a follow-up terrestrial magnetic survey. The first vertical derivative of the gathered unmanned aerial vehicle total magnetic field data was calculated both directly between each of the different flight elevations, and indirectly by calculating the values predicted using upward continuation. This case study demonstrates that low flight elevation unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic surveys can reliably collect industry standard total magnetic field measurements at an increased resolution when compared to manned airborne magnetic surveys. The enhanced interpretation potential provided by this approach also aided in delineating structural controls and hydrothermal fluid migration pathways (a pair of adjacent shear zones) related to gold mineralization on site. These structural features were not clearly resolved in the regional manned airborne magnetic data alone, further demonstrating the utility of applying high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic surveys to mineral exploration applications. The conclusions and interpretations drawn from the unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic data, coupled with historical data, were applied to make a new gold mineralization discovery on the site, assayed at 15.7 g/t.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The problem of lossy transmission of correlated sources over discrete two-way channels (TWCs) is considered. The objective is to develop a robust low delay and low complexity source-channel coding scheme without using error correction. A simple full-duplex channel optimized scalar quantization (COSQ) scheme that implicitly mitigates TWC interference is designed. Numerical results for sending Gaussian bivariate sources over binary additive-noise TWCs with either additive or multiplicative user interference show that, in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio performance, the proposed full-duplex COSQ scheme compares favourably with half-duplex COSQ. Moreover, our numerical results illustrate that one can achieve significant gain when the proposed two-user COSQ is optimally designed for a discrete TWC with additive Markov noise compared to the case when the TWC is fully interleaved. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that correlation between sources can be useful in order to reduce quantization distortion and boost the decoders' reconstruction reliability.&#xD;

Also, we investigated the effects of feedback in the design of a COSQ over a discrete one-way channel with additive Markov noise by proposing an adaptive COSQ (ACOSQ) where the channel input sequence are adaptively generated based on the received symbols over the feedback link. Numerical results indicate that one can achieve a lower overall distortion by employing feedback in the design of a quantizer for a noisy channel compared to the case where feedback information is not available. Similar to our proposed two-user COSQ, our numerical results demonstrate that one can obtain significant improvement in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio when the ACOSQ scheme is optimally designed for a discrete one-way channel with memory compared to the case where channel is rendered memoryless by interleaving.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Driver risk profiling is an emerging scheme in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Conventionally, a risk score of a driver is calculated on a per-trip basis according to the number of harsh braking, hard cornering, aggressive acceleration, and excessive speeding events. Risk scoring in the academic literature and industry has two main limitations. First, risk scoring has been primitively performed based on a pre-assumption on the risk weights of driving behaviors. Second, the conventional method of risk scoring ignores the individual differences between drivers and the variation in their skillfulness levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we tackle the first limitation through the utilization of the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) large-scale Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) dataset (i.e., the largest of its kind to date) and performed by Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to develop reliable and robust risk scoring functions. We first utilize the behavioral information of more than 3,000 drivers during crash, near-crash and normal driving events to develop a robust machine learning model that is able to predict the driving risk quantified in terms of crash and near-crash events of drivers given their long-term behavioral patterns. A complete driver profiling framework that considers the joint effect of driving behaviors and environment conditions on driving risk is then proposed and validated. Validation results indicate the robustness of the developed models and framework. Then, a novel safety-based route planner that utilizes the personalized risk profiles of drivers in suggesting individualized routing options is proposed and analysed through a real-world case study that highlights the significance of the proposed route planner.&#xD;
&#xD;
To tackle the second limitation, we propose a fault inference profiling system in which drivers are profiled based on their individual risk rate. Following the detection of risky events, proposed system can infer the fault contribution of drivers using the time-series radar and vehicular data prior and after risky events. Fault inference is performed through training five customized Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), each representing a behavioral class, on 248 risky events. Promising classification results are obtained and discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Climate change will have severe impacts on the biosphere that human society depends on, with repercussions increasing in step with the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. These impacts can be avoided by drastically reducing emissions from human society by transitioning to a 100% renewable energy system (100% RE) and reducing the quantity of energy needed overall. In 2016 Oxford County, Ontario set a goal to reach 100% RE by 2050. Using Oxford as a case study, this thesis describes best practices for transitioning to 100% RE for local governments in Canada. This thesis identifies the current progress toward reaching 100% renewable energy in Oxford County and existing strategic gaps that need to be addressed to achieve their goal of 100% RE by 2050 at the community level. It also sets out best practices and recommendations for future research in regards to achieving 100% RE in municipalities across Canada. This thesis also extends thinking on conceptual and theoretical approaches to achieving 100% RE in particular relation to municipal land use planning. The methods used in this analysis are based on the constant comparative method, utilizing a triangulation of (a) literature, (b) policy documents and (c) interviews with 17 expert informants from Canada and abroad. The value of communicative planning, planning tools and the various roles of planners are defined in the context of contributing to a 100% RE transition. Oxford County’s energy and land use planning policies were reviewed and compared against those of other jurisdictions. Engagement, dwelling density, mixed use development, energy mapping, building retrofits and energy efficient building codes can all serve as effective tools to reduce GHG emissions when properly utilized. Oxford County has laid the ground work for a 100% RE future, though much work will need to be done to help it reach this ambitious goal. The policies of other jurisdictions provide some guidance. Over the past decade, the concept of utilizing land use planning to develop low GHG emission communities has become part of mainstream discourse. More recently, plans to reach 100% RE at the community level have become a globally phenomenon. This research is part of an emerging trend in research and policy, recognizing land use planning as an integral part of 100% RE Plans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis provides empirical evidence on heterogeneity in returns on wealth among U.S. households. Chapter 1 provides a summary of how return heterogeneity has been theoretically and quantitatively shown to be necessary in explaining wealth inequality. It discusses the limited empirical evidence driven primarily by a lack of adequate panel data on household returns. Chapter 2 presents a new method to construct panel data on household-level rates of return in the United States using the newly revised Panel Study of Income and Dynamics (PSID) data. Returns are calculated for total household assets and wealth as well as within five asset classes. This panel data provides the first return measure for the total household portfolio, and it is the first to include net investment in the measure of capital gains. Empirical evidence is documented on the degree of return and risk-adjusted return heterogeneity and returns' correlation with wages. Chapter 3 uses fixed effects with empirical Bayes shrinkage to document permanent heterogeneity in returns across households, even within asset classes. The majority of the permanent heterogeneity in the returns to wealth are driven by heterogeneity in the degree and cost of borrowing. Permanent heterogeneity in leverage across households is also documented. Evidence is provided on how returns differ across the wealth distribution. Chapter 4 documents the degree of idiosyncratic asset return risk, its serial correlation, and its correlation with wage risk. Sizeable transitory idiosyncratic return risk is documented for total household assets and for returns within each asset class. Idiosyncratic shocks to wages are found to be correlated with idiosyncratic shocks to returns in specific asset classes. Return and wage risk correlation and return serial correlation are found to depend on a household's age and homeownership. By providing a new source for panel data on rates of return, this thesis presents the first empirical evidence on the nature and degree of return heterogeneity in the United States. Chapter 5 summarizes the empirical evidence. It highlights the implications for the literature on portfolio choice and for the structure and calibration of return heterogeneity in quantitative models to study wealth and income inequality.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Numerical modelling of excavations in rock has advanced considerably in recent decades. While continuum numerical models form their basis in methods which can be verified by analytical solutions, discontinuum and hybrid numerical modelling software are challenging to verify. This necessitates the development of processes that can verify individual aspects of complex models. The combined finitediscrete element method (FDEM) allows for the numerical representation of progressive fracture in a simulated elastic material. The FDEM is a powerful tool for modelling instability around tunnels in brittle rock; however, significant verification of the method is required for its use in predictive modelling in critical engineering projects. To verify the FDEM for the purpose of modelling instability around tunnels in brittle rock, a multi-method and multi-scale stepwise verification approach is proposed.&#xD;
Multi-scale verification is required due to the practical limitations of current computational power. Simulation of a laboratory scale tests generally requires a mesh size not significantly larger than the median grain size of the material, limiting the size of elements to a few millimeters for most rock types. In tunnel scale models, a larger element sizes must be used. To relate the input parameters obtained from the laboratory scale calibration to parameters which can be used in tunnel-scale modelling, a gradual upscaling process for Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) test simulations is developed. The results of the upscaling process provide guidance for input parameter selection for tunnel-scale models,  and insight into scale effects in FDEM models.&#xD;
In multi-method verification, equivalent modelling scenarios are represented using analytical and numerical methods of increasing complexity, to allow individual model behaviours to be progressively verified. A pseudo-discontinuum finite element method (FEM) approach is compared with the FDEM for modelling fracture propagation. Agreement of results is found for simulated non-frictional materials; however, for frictional materials, results agreement is not achieved. Further assessment of tunnel model response to pseudo-discontinuum FEM and FDEM input parameters will lead to improvement of input parameter and result equivalency between methods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Emerging adulthood is the age between late teens into mid to late 20s. This transition is characterized by a lack of role permanence, where self-reliance and independence are sought. During this period, emerging adults with chronic pain struggle with achieving age-specific expectations while dealing with physical limitations imposed by their pain. Although frequently viewed as synonymous with the general adult population (ages 18-64), well documented differences including unstable societal roles and identity have been acknowledged in this group. This quantitative study is a descriptive analysis of demographic, pain characteristics, and management interventions of emerging adults accessing chronic pain care, an important first step in the inquiry process.&#xD;
Methods: Using retrospective chart review over a six-month period, 41 emerging adults (aged 18-29) and 41 middle aged adults (aged 30-64) receiving care from a chronic pain clinic in Southeastern Ontario were examined. Groups were matched based on sex and number of pain sites. Demographic and pain characteristics (severity, interference, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, and catastrophizing), interventions, referrals, and clinic utilization were described. Group differences were examined using descriptive and multivariate analysis. &#xD;
Results: The emerging adult group were mostly female (66%) and the majority reported two or more pain sites (80%). While demographic, pain characteristics, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were similar between groups, pain severity differed, t(80) = -2.15, p = 0.035, with middle aged adults reporting higher scores. Emerging adults more frequently received referrals for additional consultation and/or diagnostic investigations, compared to middle aged adults (X2 (1, N = 82) = 4.97, p = 0.026). Moreover, the number of psychology visits was significantly different between groups (X2 (1, N = 82) = 7.29, p = 0.007), with more emerging adults having at least one visit. When investigated using multivariate analysis, emerging adults with higher patient health questionnaire scores were more likely to see a psychologist (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.014-1.492).&#xD;
Conclusion: Findings of this study inform our understanding of emerging adults who utilize chronic pain services. Further research is needed to better understand the efficacy of treatments offered and if current pain management approaches are meeting the needs of this population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Type 1 von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder resulting from a quantitative deficiency in the procoagulant protein von Willebrand factor (VWF). Diagnosis is dependent on a reduction in VWF levels and the identification of an abnormal bleeding history. However, diagnosis and management of this condition are challenging due to the significant heterogeneity reported in bleeding symptoms and the absence of a correlation between circulating VWF levels and bleeding severity. The ability to increase VWF levels in response to hemostatic stress (i.e. vascular injury) is important in managing bleeding. To date, this ability, referred to as the hemostatic stress response, has not been prospectively evaluated as a disease modifier of the bleeding symptoms seen in Type 1 VWD. Desmopressin, used therapeutically, can also be used as a hemostatic stress surrogate, as can exercise, to study the response to injury. By performing desmopressin trials over two consecutive days, the response to repeated stress can be evaluated. The hemostatic stress response can also be characterized by studying subject-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). We aim to show that a decreased and less sustained rise in VWF in response to hemostatic stress surrogates contributes to a more severe bleeding phenotype in individuals with Type 1 VWD.&#xD;
This thesis demonstrated that Type 1 VWD individuals have a decreased and less sustained rise in VWF in response to hemostatic stress surrogates compared to controls. We demonstrated that the differences in VWF and FVIII levels between Type 1 VWD and control groups increases in response to desmopressin and that this increased difference was maintained for at least twenty-four hours. Further, Type 1 VWD participants exhibited indicators of increased clearance and decreased synthesis of VWF. Overall, we demonstrated that the decreased response is correlated with increased bleeding. ECFCs isolated from these participants were further characterized for VWF expression and secretion demonstrating that the hemostatic stress response may be modelled ex vivo.&#xD;
	In conclusion, these data may be used to provide clinicians with a better understanding of the determinants of bleeding in Type 1 VWD and allow for better risk stratification in this patient population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Humans have the remarkable ability to learn and perform motor skills, often involving the manipulation of different objects or tools, such as swinging a hammer or a tennis racket. The objects that we manipulate are usually associated with different dynamics, which determine the movement of an object as a result of the force applied. Skillful manipulation requires forming and recalling memories of these object dynamics. Although it has been assumed that such memories are linked to objects, per se, it was recently shown that people can form separate memories, for opposing dynamics, when these are linked to different locations, or ‘control points’, on an object (Heald, Ingram, Flanagan, &amp; Wolpert, 2018). In the previous study, participants controlled the handle of a robotic device to move a virtual rectangular object with circles (control points) on the left and right sides. In different trials, they were instructed to move either the left or right control point to different targets. When these control points were paired with opposing force fields, adaptation was observed even though the required movement was constant, a situation that typically cannot be learned. In this previous study, both the controlled point and the target location changed between contexts. The aim of the current study was to assess whether one or both of these factors is critical for learning. The first experiment was similar to our previous study, except that the bar automatically rotated as it was moved forward such that the left and right control points, controlled in different contexts, moved to a common target. In the second experiment, the bar was aligned vertically with a single control point at the far end. Again, the bar rotated as it was moved forward such that the control point moved to a target located on either the left or right in different contexts. We found that, in both experiments, participants learned opposing force fields applied in the two contexts. We conclude that separate memories of dynamics can be formed for different ‘contact events’ involving a unique combination of the controlled point on the manipulated object and the target object this point contacts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: The primary goal of this study was to determine if a relationship existed between how often a person perceives public drinking in their neighbourhood and if they discriminate against individuals living with alcohol use disorders. The second study goal was to identify if the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among drinkers in a country modified this relationship. Methods: Our secondary analysis used publicly available data from the World Value Survey Wave 6, in addition to the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2014 provided by the World Health Organization. To investigate the relationships of interest, a two-level multivariate hierarchal logistic regression model with random intercept was created. Prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among drinkers in a country was categorized into quartiles of approximately equal size. Several sensitivity analyses were used to investigate country-specific relationships and the effects of missing data. &#xD;
Results: While the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among drinkers in a country did modify the relationship, there was no dose response. All of the significant relationships were found within the relative low category of heavy episodic drinking prevalence among drinkers. Additionally, when missing data was accounted for, only one significant relationship remained. When a single level model was created to examine the relationship between perceived frequency of neighbourhood public drinking and discrimination against individuals living with alcohol use disorder within individual countries, unique relationships were found within each country. Conclusion: Although prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among drinkers appeared to be largely unrelated to the main relationship between the perceived frequency of neighbourhood public drinking and discrimination against individuals living with alcohol use disorders, it was clear that the main relationship does exist within certain countries. These results aim to inspire future studies to identify a link between direct contact, second-hand alcohol harms, and how these harmful encounters may motivate discrimination against individuals living with alcohol use disorders within specific cultural contexts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the concept of electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL is the basis of all electrokinetic phenomena. Despite numerous studies in the span of over a century, our perception of this concept is far from complete owing to its complex nature. In this work, we revisit the structure and properties of EDL in polar and nonpolar media. First, we investigate the change of the zeta potential of a representative polymeric particle in the presence of various types of surfactants using electrophoretic light scattering. This study allows us to comprehend the tuning of the zeta potential of a polymeric substrate as well as the adsorption mechanisms of the different types of surfactants. Second, we use dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) to understand the EDL formation around the micelles in an aqueous medium. This method can be implemented for determining the surface conductivity as well as the zeta potential of the dispersed species in an opaque sample. Third, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to resolve the structure of an EDL in aqueous electrolyte and surfactant solutions. This study allows us to infer the dominance of the compact layer in determining the equivalent capacitance of the EDL as well as the change in the permittivity of the medium within this compact layer. Finally, the EIS measurements are also conducted in a nonpolar medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant. The electric charge formation and the emergence of the EDL are explored and compared to the charge formation mechanisms proposed in the literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Expert Tattooing: The Development of a Profession in Canada, 1891-1986 examines professional tattooing in Canada from the late nineteenth century to the mid 1980s, a period that saw the practice’s emergence, expansion, and mainstreaming in the country. Using several cities and regions as case studies and employing a breadth of sources including archival material, oral histories, print media, and visual culture, I explore how tattooists navigated their profession’s complex occupational terrain. Tattooing—as a form of work, cultural practice, and social sphere—was much more pervasive and normalized than is often presumed. I provide a counterpoint to such misconceptions, which have marginalized those involved with tattooing, their contributions to the cities they lived and worked in, and the array of visual culture produced in the process. Using Ottawa as a loose geographic frame, I begin by developing my theoretical and methodological approach and examine the concept of “professional” as it relates to tattooing. I then assess how authorities across Canada used legal, moral, and health concerns to control tattooing while considering how tattooers worked within and against regulation. Next, I investigate tattooing in Toronto and beyond through the relationship between tattooists and print media, which I position as a medium that captured and distributed the profession’s oral discourse. The following case study examines tattooing in Vancouver and Victoria by analyzing the circulation of people, images, and knowledge, in, out, and around the two coastal cities. I then consider the relationship between tattooers and other cultural producers in Halifax by studying the visual culture produced as a result of their interaction. In my final substantive chapter, I interrogate connections between tattooing in Toronto and Japan through the work of fine artist Aba Bayefsky. Lastly, my epilogue considers the implications of this research through a tattoo artist named Nels Johnson who worked in Thunder Bay, Ontario. I argue that professional tattooing existed on a continuum of expertise, occupying the interstices between cultural production and work, on which practitioners developed methods to present themselves and their work as a legitimate, professional occupation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sandhoff Disease (SD) is a rare genetic disorder which results in progressive neurodegeneration. SD is caused by a build-up of GM2 Gangliosides, a lipid which is stored in the lysosome of neurons. It can occur in infantile, juvenile and adult forms; in the severe, infantile form, death occurs by the age of 4. It is well understood that this lipid build-up is the result of a mutation of the HEXB gene, which results in a deficiency of the ‘beta-hexosaminidase A’ enzyme for which it codes; however, a better understanding of the pathology is needed. The objective of this study was, therefore, to better characterize SD to improve our understanding of the disease. This study took two approaches; the first approach was to monitor gene expression changes of six genes previously identified as showing increased expression the brains of 4 week old SD mice. Three of these genes were related to inflammation: Ccl3, Lyz, and Wfdc17; whilst three genes were related to myelination: Ugt8a, Fa2h, and Mog. They were assessed at 3 time points: 5 weeks, 10 weeks, and 16 weeks. Secondly, this study profiled metabolite changes in the serum and urine of SD mice, at the same time points, through the use of mass spectrometry. Gene expression analysis showed that there is an inflammatory response occurring from 5 weeks in SD mice that continues to increase over the course of the disease. Demyelination was also shown to occur, varying with disease progression. Metabolomic analysis showed a decrease in two metabolites of glycerophospholipids and acylcarnitines suggesting that the breakdown and synthesis is interrupted downstream of the GM2 Ganglioside storage. Lastly, consistent with other findings, we have shown amino acids (particularly alanine) to be elevated, which is a likely consequence of increased demand for energy following the interruption of lipid breakdown and reduced food intake. Whilst this study did not identify any candidate biomarkers for SD, it has contributed towards the understanding of the pathology behind the disease. Future studies will be needed to further characterize SD in mouse models and in humans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To study the devolatilisation process associated with coal combustion, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a very useful tool. The aim of this thesis is to accurately model coal devolatilisation at high temperatures associated with cement kilns to facilitate the further study of coal combustion within a cement kiln, to increase combustion efficiency thereby decreasing the environmental impact associated with cement production. The devolatilisation process can be modeled using two main types of models: the global and the structural model. Global models use parameters found by a simple kinetic analysis whereas the structural models require thorough analysis of the coal particles chemical structure. Due to it's simplicity and ability to model all types of coal without relying on in-depth analytical methods and parameter predictions for unknown coal types, the global model of the 'dual-competing rate' type was used. This model was implemented and optimized in the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM to allow increased accuracy when examining high temperature, high heating rate, and/or multi-peak rate volatile release coal devolatilisation. It has proven to be effective in high temperature and heating rate scenarios (such as those found in a cement kiln) and when modelling multi-peak rate volatile releases. Additionally, the particle specific heat (cp) model used within the original OpenFOAM code was modified as it does not allow for particle phase or specie mass fraction modifications without altering the particle cp value. Due to the high working temperatures, the Kirov cp model is used. The implementation of both models have shown an increase in high temperature devolatilisation dynamics and heating rate accuracy in addition to an increase in modelling multi-peak rate volatile release accuracy by a factor of 5 when compared to the single kinetic rate model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The building and construction industry is the third-largest producer of CO2 in Canada. Additionally, emissions from this industry are expected to go up by more than nine megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2 eq) by the year 2030. As such, we need to find ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the construction industry. Any decrease in the emissions of carbon from the construction industry will help improve the long-term sustainability of the industry and also help the environment.&#xD;
Biochar is an excellent way of achieving carbon reductions. Biochar is made from wood waste using the process of slow pyrolysis, and it can be mixed with cement in construction to create potential carbon sinks. This study will focus on biochar as a cementitious additive for cement mortar. Biochar is added to the cement mortar in different proportions of cement by weight (1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% 10% and 12.5%) to create small-scale specimens that are tested under compressive load after 7, 28, and 56 days. It is noticed that there is a slight reduction in strength as the proportion of biochar is increased when it is used as a cement replacement. Biochar also increases the absorption in cement mortar because of its ability to store water and release it slowly, which provides internal curing to the mortar, helping it gain strength over time.&#xD;
The second part of this thesis examines recycled concrete aggregate for the production of concrete blocks. Ontario has one of the highest rates of production of concrete blocks in North America. In addition to using large amounts of raw material, concrete block fabrication produced concrete waste at the production facilities in the form of spillage and culled blocks that are not fit for use. This waste is generally sent to landfills. A novel way to reduce this waste is to reuse it to make new blocks. In this study, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) procured from a block manufacturer is used to replace coarse aggregate in proportions of 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% by volume of aggregate. The blocks are cast in the Queen’s University Concrete Lab and are tested for compression after 28 days. Results indicate that the use of RCA in blocks does not affect the compressive strength adversely.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are phenotypically plastic. Thus, while the VSMCs in healthy blood vessels are ‘contractile’ and control vascular tone, these cells can increase their synthetic, migratory and proliferative capacities in response to vessel injury. While largely adaptive, actions of “synthetic” VSMCs can promote arterial wall thickening and contribute to atherosclerosis and vessel stenosis. Currently, vessel stenosis is reversed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and the placement of drug eluting stents (DES) coated with pan-cellular anti-proliferative agents. Although these approaches are effective, in-stent restenosis and thrombosis remain problematic, in part due to limited re-endothelialization. Thus, DESs coated with drugs targeting specifically synthetic VSMCs, but not the endothelium, might limit these problems. Since the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, PDE1C, a dual cAMP/cGMP hydrolyzing PDE, is exclusively expressed by synthetic VSMCs and regulates their synthetic, migratory and proliferative actions, it may represent a valid synthetic VSMC specific therapeutic target. Store operated calcium entry (SOCE) allows refilling of depleted ER-Ca2+ stores in non-excited cells, including in synthetic VSMCs, and supports migration and proliferation of synthetic VSMCs. Herein, we identify a critical role for PDE1C in regulating the polarization of synthetic human arterial VSMCs (HASMCs) required for their migration and show how this PDE acts as a nexus allowing reciprocal regulation of the SOCE- and cAMP-signaling systems in these cells. Thus, we show that PDE1C localizes at lamellipodia formed by polarized/migrating HASMCs and coordinates a series of hyper-localized Ca2+ and cAMP signaling events within these structures which chronically antagonize their formation. Moreover, we show that these events are dependent on localized actions of the SOCE promoting machinery (i.e. Orai1/STIM1), a Ca2+-activated adenylyl cyclase (ADCY8), PKA and the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP79). Based on our findings, we suggest that inhibiting the actions of PDE1C may represent a valid novel therapeutic approach to decrease the burden associated with unregulated migration and proliferation of synthetic VSMCs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Silicon photonics has attracted significant attention due to its compatibility with CMOS technology and the potential for both discrete and integrated devices. As a critical component in silicon-based communication systems, silicon optical modulators have been widely investigated, including solitary Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs), IQ MZMs, and micro-ring modulators (MRMs). Compared with Si-MZM, Si-MRM has smaller chip size, lower power consumption, and enhanced modulation efficiency, and is potentially preferable for short reach transmission systems. This research focuses on the implementation of an MRM in a high-speed short reach communication system.&#xD;
&#xD;
One issue with Si-MRMs is the nonlinear electrical-to-optical modulation dynamics. This work investigates pre-compensation of this nonlinear distortion by back-calculation. An MRM model is firstly set up using Matlab. Through back-calculation of the model, an electrical drive signal is calculated based on a desired modulator output optical intensity. The back-calculated drive signal has a broad frequency spectrum which would be difficult to generate using a practical digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Truncation of the drive signal bandwidth shows that a DAC sampling rate working at twice the symbol rate produces relatively good results. &#xD;
&#xD;
The system bit-to-error ratio (BER) performance is investigated with and without fiber transmission for a 28 Gbaud PAM-4 signal. The systematic simulation includes drive signal generation, electrical to optical conversion by the MRM model, fiber transmission, optical to electrical conversion and receiver side digital signal processing. Since the pre-compensation technique only deals with the distortion in modulation, fiber dispersion during transmission becomes the main factor affecting the system BER performance. Thus a linear decision-directed least mean square (DD-LMS) equalizer and a Volterra nonlinear equalizer are implemented at the receiver to equalize the signal distortion induced by fiber dispersion. In order to verify the simulation results, experiment has been performed using an un-packaged MRM chip. The chip exhibits bit error free transmission for 28 Gb/s on-off keying (OOK) modulation, but signal distortion is induced during the modulation, which produces poor results for PAM-4 signal modulation. Thus a direct comparison between simulation and experimental results was not possible.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The asymmetric alkylation of enolates is a particularly versatile method for the construction of -stereogenic carbonyl motifs, which are ubiquitous in synthetic chemistry.  Over the past several decades, the focus has shifted to the development of new catalytic methods that depart from classical stoichiometric stereoinduction strategies (eg. chiral auxiliary).  In this way, the enantioselective alkylation of prochiral enolates greatly improves the step- and redox-economy of this process, in addition to enhancing the scope and selectivity of these reactions.  The following thesis outlines some of our efforts in this area, in which we have recently developed an enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction with unstabilized enolates and related nucleophiles.  The thesis is divided into three chapters, including a comprehensive literature review that highlights the current state-of-the-art methods, followed by two research chapters that detail the development, scope and mechanistic aspects of two novel “enolate” alkylation processes.&#xD;
Chapter 1 commences with a brief introduction to enolate alkylation, which is followed by a detailed analysis of the historical development and modern approaches for catalytic enantioselective enolate alkylation.  The review is divided into two major subsections; namely, the reactions of cyclic and acyclic enolates will be treated separately, thus delineating the significant achievements in each area.&#xD;
Chapter 2 highlights our development of the enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of prochiral aldehyde enolates.  This chapter opens with a summary of the related organocatalytic methods that employ enamine nucleophiles to construct α-stereogenic aldehydes.  In this regard, the limitations with these methods set the stage for the development an alternative approach involving unstabilized aldehyde enolates.  Hence, we have utilized an enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction to enable the construction of acyclic quaternary stereogenic centers from α-aryl aldehyde pronucleophiles.&#xD;
Chapter 3 illustrates the enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of a homoenolate nucleophile.  After a brief introduction on homoenolate alkylation; namely, the use of heteroatom-stabilized allylic anions as synthetic homoenolate equivalents, our development of a catalytic enantioselective variant of this process is discussed.  To this end, we have shown that lithiated unsaturated α-amino nitriles deliver β-stereogenic carbonyls via regioselective allylic alkylation followed by in situ hydrolysis of the cyanoenamine intermediates.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: The growing prevalence of chronic conditions in childhood calls for a child and family engaged approach to research. Engaging with children and families across the selection of outcomes and development of measures may be a promising way to optimize the impact of research that evaluates interventions by measuring what matters to these populations. The extent to which children and families have been engaged in outcome selection and development is unknown. OBJECTIVES: 1) identify the extent to which children and families are currently engaged in the selection of outcomes and development of measures and, 2) elicit the preferences of caregivers and complex care providers of children with medical complexity pertaining to the development of feeding and medical technology experience measures. METHODS: Manuscript 1. A systematic review assessed the extent to which children or families were involved in the selection or development of child-specific outcomes and measures using the IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation. Manuscript 2. A cross-sectional survey design rated preferences for measurement development between stakeholder (parent versus service provider) groups using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-Square statistical tests. RESULTS: Manuscript 1. Seven studies focused on the selection of outcomes and 29 studies pertained to measure development; child or family engagement in outcomes research was focused at the ‘Involve’ level of the IAP2. Manuscript 2. A total of 39 caregivers and 33 complex care providers of CMC who completed the survey demonstrated non-significant differences in preference with the exception of measure length and transparency preferences. Both groups identified that measure results should be responsive to change instead of producing norm-referenced results. Caregivers expressed further preference to complete measures remotely (e.g. on smartphones) in lieu of during clinical appointments. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging children and families as equals in outcome selection and development is an unexplored area of research. Furthermore, eliciting family preferences is a feasible way to make decisions in the development of a measure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this research is to investigate the origin and evolution of meta-siliciclastic rocks within the Mesoproterozoic Upper Vazante Sequence (1300 to 1100 Ma) in order to improve understanding of metal sources and metal mobility in the Vazante – Paracatu zinc mining district, Brazil. This was achieved through integrated study of the mineralogy, geochemistry, detrital zircon geochronology and whole-rock lead isotope compositions of meta-siliciclastic rocks occurring below and within carbonate strata that host pre-orogenic (1200 to 1000 Ma) and syn-orogenic (850 to 650 Ma) Zn – Pb silicate and sulfide orebodies.&#xD;
Lithogeochemistry of meta-siliciclastic rocks from the Serra do Garrote Formation (below carbonate rocks) and Serra do Poço Verde Formation (interbedded with carbonate rocks) indicates sediments were derived from andesitic to felsic, continental arc-related rocks. Detrital zircon U – Pb dates and provenance patterns suggest major sources of detrital material were Paleoproterozoic arc rocks, related to the Trans-Amazonian orogeny that built the Columbia Supercontinent (2.20 to 1.90 Ga). Deposition of these meta-siliciclastic rocks occurred between 1.30 and 1.20 Ga, during or after continental rifting related to continental breakup.&#xD;
Carbonaceous phyllites and phyllites from the Serra do Garrote Formation are enriched with respect to Zn and associated elements (e.g. Cd, Hg, In, Cu, V, U). Zn-enrichment is related to pre-orogenic hydrothermal sulfides that formed between 1200 and 665 Ma. Lithogeochemistry and whole-rock Pb isotope compositions of Zn-enriched phyllites suggest that metals were derived from upper crustal material and transported by U-bearing fluids.&#xD;
The lithogeochemical and Pb isotope signatures of siliciclastic-hosted mineralization, occurring underneath mineralized and un-mineralized carbonate strata, are similar to those from syn-orogenic carbonate-hosted Zn deposits. Although there is textural evidence that pre-orogenic sulfide mineralization was locally remobilized during the Brasiliano Orogeny, there is little evidence that measurable quantities of Zn were removed from the Serra do Garrote Formation during its evolution. The similar geochemical and isotopic signatures in the carbonate-hosted syn-orogenic orebodies and the Serra do Garrote pre-orogenic mineralization suggest that metals were derived from similar sources, such as the underlying basement that siliciclastic detritus originated from and upon which, the Upper Vazante Sequence was deposited.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Genetic variation is an important predictor of population persistence under changing or stressful environmental conditions. Consequently, efforts to preserve genetic variation by identifying genetically distinct populations and delineating management units are primary goals of conservation genetics and fisheries management. Accelerated melting of sea ice in the lower Northwest Passage (LNWP) in Nunavut has recently opened the passage to shipping, providing an opportunity for fishery establishment. Nunavut communities have some of the highest rates of food insecurity across Canada, so the commercial harvest of profitable fish species could help to alleviate this crisis. However, sustainable fishery management in the LNWP requires the characterization of genetic structure in focal species to determine the best practices for managing demographically independent populations and, over the longer term, conserving genetic variation. The lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) is an important commercial species across Canada, is abundant in the LNWP, and is valued by the local people in Nunavut. However, lake whitefish have only recently expanded their range into this area, and the distribution of their genetic variation across the LNWP is unknown. Using genome-wide panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms, my results suggest one genetic population of lake whitefish in the LNWP. However, using putatively adaptive markers, I find weak evidence for two to three units of lake whitefish in the area. Further, I uncover genetic indication of hybridization between lake whitefish, Arctic cisco (C. autumnalis), and sardine cisco (C. sardinella) in the LNWP. Admixture among these species may make setting sustainable catch limits for lake whitefish challenging, as fishing pressures will likely decrease the abundance and genetic diversity of each species. Thus, my work aims to inform fishing regulations that reduce the relative exploitation of genetically distinct units of lake whitefish and minimize impacts of harvest on hybrids and their parental species. Setting reasonable fishing limits and preserving the genetic diversity of lake whitefish in the LNWP will reduce the likelihood of a fishery collapse, and increase probability for the species to become a sustainable resource for the people of Nunavut.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Climate change in the Arctic is moving at a greater rate than the rest of the world, and the urgency of characterizing greenhouse gas emissions from water bodies located in high latitudes has become a subject of intensive research during the last two decades. Methane (CH4) emissions from freshwater systems are believed to be the most important source of uncertainty in the global greenhouse gas budget, and their positive feedback has been excluded from earth systems models. This powerful gaseous fuel can be emitted to the atmosphere via diffusion or ebullition, with fieldwork suggesting the latter is the primary mode of release. &#xD;
	Previous process-based models have been developed in the past to determine these emissions; however, they often require several inputs and lakes characteristics that are not readily available. Bearing these limitations in mind, this study quantifies ebullition during the ice-free season from four kettle oligotrophic lakes located in Arctic Alaska. By using a one-dimensional bulk mixed-layer thermodynamic lake model, temperature profiles were obtained, and a CH4 subroutine was also included to determine ebullition and diffusion fluxes as well as CH4 concentrations in the water column. Following model validation, meteorological data from a general circulation model was then implemented to predict future CH4 sediment emissions and their resulting atmospheric fluxes.&#xD;
	Results were validated against published observed data from the literature; the model calculated the temperature profile of the lakes with root mean square errors of &lt;4°C. Accordingly, CH4 water concentrations were modelled with root mean square errors of &lt;&lt;1µM, in both deep and shallow systems. Ebullition fluxes showed a high interannual variability which further validated previous evidence of the high heterogeneity of this process. Results of increases in atmospheric fluxes were significant; under three Representative Concentration Pathways, emissions from all systems are expected to increase at least 21% over the next 80 years. This study presents a simple formulation with limited constraints to estimate emissions via ebullition; it is expected that this model will be embedded into land surface schemes of global and regional climate models to predict emissions from the Arctic and potentially from the rest of the globe.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Surface mining of Alberta's oil sands produces large volumes of water and solid wastes stored in oil sands tailings ponds. Tailings ponds contain numerous contaminants that have negative effects on the environment (air, water, and land). Each tailings pond has its unique characteristics depending on different chemical additive used during bitumen extraction. Diverse microbial populations developed within each pond which have a vital role in the bioremediation of toxic compounds therein. As tailings ponds age and at low redox conditions (~ -250 mV), some prokaryotes, particularly methanogenic archaea, oxidize petroleum hydrocarbons (such as naphtha) using acetic acid or CO2 as a terminal electron acceptor (TEA) resulted in methane (greenhouse gas) efflux from OSTPs. Some studies estimated the current methane emissions to be up to 43 million liters/day. GHG evolution is stimulated by the naphtha diluent that ends up in tailings ponds during the bitumen extraction process but the processes controlling methane production are not well understood.&#xD;
In this study, the effect of TEA (SO42- and NO3-), nutrients (PO43- and NH4+), and carbon source (naphtha) on GHG production was investigated in microcosm experiments using mature fine tailings of Suncor Energy Pond 7. In NO3- and SO4-amended microcosms, methanogenesis was reduced by 98.5 and 97.8%, respectively, as initial NO3- or SO42- concentration increased. In MFT-amended with phosphate under methanogenic conditions, CH4 production increased with increasing PO43- concentration by a factor 2.4 times that of the unamended biotic control. Biogenic gas production (CH4, H2S, and N2O) increased with increasing naphtha concentration. The yield of CH4 produced from naphtha consumed under methanogenic conditions was 0.058 g/g which is lower than the theoretical yield since some of the carbon from naphtha was likely used to make microbial biomass and/or the formation of biogenic CO2 or other intermediates like acetate. There was a difficulty in measuring the biogenic CO2 produced due to the equilibrium between HCO3− and CO32− in MFT and biogenic CO2. In conclusion, it is possible to minimize GHG emissions by manipulation of TEA. However, increasing naphtha and/or phosphate concentration will result in increasing CH4 production.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the intellectual origins of the Canadian federal government’s official policy of multiculturalism. The first half employs the methodology of historical biography and examines the life and thought of three Canadian public intellectuals: T. Watson Kirkconnell, Robert England, and John Murray Gibbon. While each of these men developed philosophies of cultural pluralism in the context of larger projects, all three philosophies were rooted in colonialism, relied on the idea of race as a biological reality, focused on European groups, and excluded (and often denigrated) those racialized as non-white. These three men were recognized by the State and civil society as experts on racial diversity, and in the late interwar period they were called upon by governmental agencies such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The programs they designed, which were aimed at fostering national unity, were also limited by whiteness. During the Second World War, the lines between State and civil society blurred as the promotion of “racial” or cultural diversity became an increasingly official endeavour. The State utilized these public intellectuals to help shape official approaches to “racial” unity but again these efforts focused only on Canadians of European descent. The second half of the dissertation examines shifting notions of race in the postwar period and details how these ideas continued to shape discussions about diversity and citizenship. It unpacks the debates over changing immigration policy, citizenship, and finally the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. The final chapter examines the shift from ad-hoc cultural pluralism to an official policy of multiculturalism. It demonstrates that this policy was focused on Canadians of non- British, non-French, European descent, with an emphasis on their folk cultures. The dissertation therefore concludes that the original policy of multiculturalism is best understood not as a break with but rather as a manifestation of white normativity in Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gram-negative bacteria have a polysaccharide coat (O antigen) consisting of repeating units of oligosaccharides that is assembled by glycosyltransferases. Many of these bacteria are associated with disease, and the polysaccharides are functionally important for immune responses. In light of increasing antibiotic resistance it is critical to develop new antibacterial strategies and gain knowledge of the mechanisms by which bacteria assemble their virulence factors. We hypothesize that inhibition of the glycosyltransferases responsible for O antigen synthesis in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria can lead to the attenuation of bacteria’s virulence. The O antigens in O117 and O107 serotypes of Escherichia coli, differ by a single sugar residue. The glucose (Glc) residue found in the O antigen of E. coli O117 [D-GalNAcβ1-3-L-Rhaα1-4-D-Glcα1-4-D-Galβ1-3-D-GalNAc]n is replaced by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the O antigen of E. coli O107 (GalNAc is N-acetylgalactosamine, Rha is Rhamnose, Gal is galactose). The glycosyltransferases that create the Glc/GlcNAcα1-4Gal linkage are WclY(O117) and WclY(O107), and differ in only 3 amino acid residues. We have expressed WclY(O117) in a soluble and active form in the Lemo21 (DE3) expression system. We developed an activity assay for Glc-transferase WclY using a synthetic analog of its natural acceptor substrate and subsequently characterized the enzyme. WclY(O117) is a retaining Glc-transferase (sugar of the donor substrate retains α/β stereochemistry post-transfer) of the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) GT4 family; it has a strict substrate specificity requiring Galβ1-3GalNAcα-diphosphate lipid as the acceptor. In contrast, the donor substrate specificity is more relaxed. The structures of reaction products were confirmed using Electrospray Ionization-Negative ion mode Mass Spectrometry as well as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Mutants were expressed to provide insight into the catalytic mechanism of WclY. Mutants transferred sugars from UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc at varying levels. By mutating Arg194 we were able to convert the Glc-transferase to a GlcNAc-transferase. Protein modeling confirmed the role of Arg194 and other amino acids in the catalytic activity of WclY. Characterization of the enzyme has opened the door for testing of compounds with the potential to act as antimicrobial and antiseptic agents.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The microstructure of deposited materials is characterized using a variety of techniques. The two specific types of deposited materials studied are electrodeposited nickel and additive manufactured stainless steel. A focus is on utilizing optimal cross-sectional characterization techniques to observe the microstructure, where optimal refers to the length scale being probed and the cost of preparation and characterization methods. Techniques ranging from optical transmission electron microscopy are used. Three different length scales of electrodeposited nickel are observed, and a set of 16 SLM processed 316L stainless steel weld tracks are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
The largest length scale nickel material is a commercially available foam, likely produced by electroplating nickel onto a sacrificial polymer template. The foam was prepared for EBSD using modification to standard metallography techniques. The average grain size was 5.73 µm with a random texture, suggesting a heat treatment used to remove the polymer template.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secondly, we studied mesoporous nickel samples. A measure of particle size as well as deposition layer thickness was performed using ImageJ in conjunction with SEM imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
The smallest microstructural length scale of nickel materials was a set of nanostructured electrode catalysts. The grain size seen in the deposition layers was in the hundreds of nanometers, and an overall growth texture in the {112} direction was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 316L stainless steel weld tracks were polished using standard metallographic techniques and etched in oxalic acid. This revealed a cellular structure. The cell sizes of two weld tracks were measured in ImageJ and compared with their applied energy densities. It was found that the track with the lower energy density had a slightly smaller cell size, the sizes being 4.7 ± 1.5 µm and 6.2 ± 1.2 µm respectively. An EBSD map of one weld track was also taken, illustrating the directional growth of SLM processed grains.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Throughout the central Nepal Himalaya, the Tethyan sedimentary sequence (TSS) is structurally dominated by a train of north-verging folds, in apparent contradiction to the dominantly south-propagating Himalayan orogen. The absolute age of folding is unknown, although previous structural observations have suggested that folding may predate Miocene movement of the South Tibetan detachment system. Age dating and characterization of this deformation event is critical for determining the timing of coupling and/or decoupling of the upper crust from the mid-crust during the Himalayan orogen, as well as elucidating the early collisional history of the orogen.&#xD;
Structural mapping in Hidden valley, central Nepal, reveals four phases of deformation (D2, D3, D4 and D5) within anchizonal to epizonal metamorphic grade Ordovician to Jurassic TSS rocks. Megascopically, D2 is defined by large, asymmetric north-verging folds; microscopically, D2 is seen as an axial planar continuous to spaced cleavage. Bed length restoration of F2 folds indicates a minimum of 40% shortening and 180% thickening during D2. Muscovite geochemistry, geochronology and microstructural analyses are used to identify two chemically and structurally distinct generations of muscovite in the TSS, one of which is detrital (Al), and one of which is new growth (A2). Structurally, Al is randomly oriented and intermittently rotated into S2 and S4 cleavage planes, while A2 is parallel to S2 axial-planar cleavage and also occurs as growth rims on Al. Conventional 40Ar/39Ar step heating methods indicate that Proterozoic and Paleozoic detrital Al muscovite Ar systematics have been weakly reset. A2 muscovite, dated by the in situ UV laser 40Ar/39Ar spot-fusion method and assuming closed system since metamorphism, is at least as young as 35.5±1.7 Ma, which is interpreted as a maximum age for F2 folding. The UV laser shows great potential for in situ dating of cleavage domains. D2 north-verging folds are Himalayan in age, likely occurring between ~35 and 22 Ma; this is the first maximum age constraint obtained for this deformation. D2 folds are interpreted to have formed in Eocene-Early Oligocene time, near the maximum age limit of this range (~35 Ma), coeval with kyanite-grade metamorphism in the mid-crust. The north-verging folds, which formed in the upper crust, were then subsequently detached/decoupled during midcrustal southward extrusion at 22-18 Ma.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although Cured-In-Place Pipe (CIPP) liners have been used extensively across North America, their in-situ performance in deteriorated pipe conditions has not been extensively studied. The purpose of this research work is to develop a better understanding of the service performance of CIPP liners in cast iron water pressure pipes by experimentally quantifying the hoop and axial strains in the liner when exposed to various loading conditions. In this research, the application of distributed optical fiber sensing to study the mechanical properties of a commercially available structural CIPP liner used for pressure pipe repair was demonstrated. &#xD;
Using distributed strain sensing, large-scale experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the mechanical response of a CIPP liner where it spans across localized areas of failure in the host pipe (i.e. perforation and ring fracture) by quantifying the strains in the liner. Axial strain measurements obtained from surface bonded optical fibers support the use of the current ASTM F1216-16 design rules for pressure pipe liners spanning across small sized perforations (up to 50 mm in diameter in a pipe with a 154 mm overall diameter). However, ASTM F1216-16 design recommendations produce unconservative estimates for larger perforations (up to 75 mm diameter in a pipe with a 154 mm diameter). For the case of a liner which spans a pre-existing ring fracture in a host pipe subjected to angular rotation, it was observed that the location of maximum opening in the fracture is the critical location where the liner could experience failure. Results also showed that debonding (i.e. separation between the liner and the host pipe) decreases the maximum strains in a liner and that the extent of debonding is impacted by internal pressure and alignment of the pipe across the fracture. Due to the polymeric nature of the liner, the tensile creep properties of the liner were investigated. Results suggest that the use of an industry-accepted 50% creep retention factor to estimate the 50-year service life of a liner could produce unconservative results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bitumen mined from the Canadian oil sands is viscous to such a degree that it must be diluted to flow in pipelines resulting in diluted bitumen (dilbit). Dilbit has chemical and physical properties that differ it from conventional crude oils so research into dilbit’s behaviour is needed to inform spill response. Monitored natural attenuation relies on the biodegradation of petroleum by indigenous biota resulting in an assimilation of petrogenic carbon. Researchers inferred this assimilation by measuring stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) at the site of a marine crude oil spill, but this approach has never been applied to dilbit spills into freshwater. We experimentally spilled dilbit into nine 10-m diameter limnocorrals installed into the littoral zone of a boreal lake in northwestern, Ontario, Canada. I hypothesize that if petrogenic carbon is being assimilated, then I will measure a 13C-depletion in exposure organisms because hydrocarbons from crude oil tend to be 13C-depleted compared to most organisms. The δ13C values of phytoplankton increased more in the control limnocorral (5 ‰) than the 180-L dilbit-treated limnocorral (1‰), suggesting that the natural enrichment seen in the control was dampened in the dilbit-treated limnocorrals due to the phytoplankton assimilating 13C-depleted hydrocarbons. Periphyton harvested from dilbit-treated limnocorrals were depleted in 13C relative to the control periphyton. We also measured δ13C of Pyganodon grandis mussels housed for 25 days in aquaria containing water from the limnocorrals. The δ13C value of mussels exposed to oil-contaminated water from the 42-L and 82-L limnocorrals was significantly 13C-depleted compared to the control (p &lt; 0.01), indicating that mussels may be filtering oil components and assimilating petrogenic carbon. The lack of substantial 13C-depletions in the food web suggests that the incorporation of oil carbon and, by extension, rates of biodegradation from the dilbit spills was minimal. Researchers should be cautious when using stable isotopic analysis of carbon as organism’s natural isotopic values are highly variable, the δ13C of study organisms and crude oil can be similar which complicates interpretation, and measurable 13C-depletions occur over extended time frames.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is a growing need in transportation industries for design tools and methodologies that can quickly and effectively assist designers in developing designs that are lighter and simple to manufacture. This research outlines a methodology using existing advanced design tools to re-design a series of components in a monorail ceiling structure. The goal of the redesign was to reduce the mass, manufacturing complexity and manufacturing cost to the ceiling structure while maintaining structural performance. For the redesign, structurally critical components in the center web structure were selected for optimization. These components were a cross-beam, and the bracket that attaches the cross-beam to the roof.&#xD;
	Initial finite element analysis was completed on each component and the entire center web to obtain a baseline performance metric. Optimization was then completed in two stages. First a topology optimization was completed for the entire center web area to assess placement of components. Secondly topology optimization was completed on each of the component of interest. The optimization of the components was completed multiple times with alterations to the design space and objective function optimization to yield improved results. This process yielded two potential designs for each component. &#xD;
From the results in the optimization stage, re-designed components were created for both the secondary and tertiary topology optimized component designs. Using these re-designed components, an updated center web was created based off these designs and the initial optimization. Finite element analysis was completed on the updated components and the updated center web. These results were compared to the original finite element analysis results. From this result, the updated components and center web were found to be lighter and were easier to manufacture than the original designs, while meeting performance criteria. In the center web structure, the number of components was reduced by 30%, and the mass was reduced by 43%.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the need for improved performance becoming more apparent in the engineering workplace, numerical tools like design optimization and topology optimization have been turned to in order to generate new unconventional design concepts. Leveraging concepts from traditional design optimization, topology optimization is a generalized tool suitable for many different applications. However, a challenge posed by topology optimization has been the determination of feasible results from a manufacturing perspective. Manufacturing constraints for topology optimization have been developed over the years in order to guide the optimization problem to a result that is feasible for manufacturing. Many methods have been proposed and have shown that topology optimization results can be developed with specific manufacturing considerations in mind.&#xD;
This work presents a new manufacturing constraint methodology for topology optimization which utilizes a particle diffusion method to mathematically model and eliminate non-desirable geometric features in the topology optimization procedure. Here, the geometric feature modeling and elimination vary based on the given manufacturing process. The chosen manufacturing constraints studied in this work are single plane casting, split plane casting, 3-axis milling, 5-axis milling, and turning.&#xD;
The particle diffusion problem leverages the finite element discretization of the topology optimization problem for setup but does not require a finite element solution to the problem. Through the mathematical relationship developed with particle diffusion times and not requiring a finite element solution, particle diffusion for manufacturing constraints overcomes some of the shortcomings of other methods in the existing literature. The entire methodology is formulated in a differentiable manner where design sensitivity calculations can be taken and used in a gradient based optimization scheme. In five numerical examples these manufacturing constraints utilizing particle diffusion are shown. For all examples, manufacturing feasibility for the chosen manufacturing process was achieved at the cost of increased structural compliance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As industry competition and increasingly stringent safety concerns drive the need for increased part performance and decreased part weight, additive manufacturing methods are being turned to as an innovative fabrication method able to produce more complex parts. Despite significant advances in technology since the inception of additive manufacturing in 1980, high thermal gradients during part manufacture can generate residual stresses, part deformation, and even part failure due to cracking. Among other factors such as laser power and speed, scan path directly affects the thermal gradients during manufacturing.&#xD;
	The work in this thesis compares the thermal gradients generated by nine different scanning methods; six of which have been tested and discussed in previous literature, and three of which are new paths proposed for the first time in this document. A finite element model was created and validated in order to easily test all nine paths, while keeping machine parameters such as hatch distance and laser power constant for all tests. This model can change machine parameters and scan paths easily, and has the ability to change scan paths between layers. The tests found that scan paths that subsection powder layers into smaller areas before scanning produce lower thermal gradients than those that scan the full layer without sectioning. One of the new scan path concepts, deemed the “subsectioned spiral method”, produced the most favourable results most consistently when compared to the other eight paths, and shows signs of being an effective scan path that could outperform the other methods used widely today.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A non-research thesis submitted to the Department of Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. -- The Troilus Au-Cu deposit is a low-grade, high-tonnage deposit, located in the eastern part of the Archean Frotet-Evans greenstone belt, in the Opatica Subprovince, Superior Province, Quebec. Total past production and current combined indicated and inferred resources were estimated over 6.4 Moz of contained gold (or 200 t Au, in approximately 230 Mt of ore grading 0.87 g/t Au, Troilus Gold Corp., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
The deposit comprises two main orebodies, the 87- and the J-zones. Both are hosted in ca. 2791 Ma calc-alkaline intrusive rocks, consisting of a metadioritic stock, an amphibolitic unit, and a magmatic or magmatic-hydrothermal breccia. These rocks are crosscut by ca. 2782 Ma felsic dikes. The calc-alkaline suite was emplaced into the volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Troilus Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Troilus deposit is hosted in a zone of intense deformation and experienced upper-greenschist to lower-amphibolite metamorphic conditions. The orebodies in the Troilus deposit display an anastomosed pattern, being parallel to subparallel to a penetrative NE-trending foliation, moderately to steeply-dipping to NW.&#xD;
&#xD;
The amphibolite, the brecciated unit, and the felsic dikes represent the main host rocks for the mineralization, which has been broadly divided in two distinct types: (i) Au-Cu in fine-grained chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite-pyrite disseminations and stringers parallel to the foliation, representing the dominant ore in the Troilus deposit. It occurs in association with a strong biotitic alteration zone, and it is restricted to the amphibolite and to the matrix of the breccia, in a corridor zone between two main felsic dikes; and (ii) Au-bearing quartz-veins and veinlets in association with sericitic alteration and silicification in secondary high-strain zones, occurring in amphibolite, breccia and felsic dikes.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Troilus Au-Cu deposit has been interpreted to be formed similarly to porphyry Au-Cu deposits, based on the disseminated style of the mineralization in association with a zoned hydrothermal alteration assemblage, the presence of multi-stage felsic porphyry intrusions and an in-situ hydrothermal breccia. Some studies have suggested a multi-stage structurally controlled “orogenic” gold type model, based on the recognition of two styles of mineralization and their restriction to superimposed distinct and unrelated structures. However, the difficulties imposed by the intense deformation that occurred in the deposit region, associated with a lack of robust structural, geochemical, petrological, and mineralogical data from the deposit- to district-scale have resulted in a limited understanding of the ore system at Troilus.&#xD;
&#xD;
This report presents a literature review, summarizes and discusses relevant points and controversies regarding the previous studies, while addressing future recommendations to achieve a better understanding of ore genesis at the Troilus Au-Cu deposit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the biggest challenges faced in the nuclear industry is understanding and accurately predicting the complex environment found in a nuclear power reactor and its impact on core components and materials. The extreme environment inside a reactor core provides challenges to component design and operation as the large amounts of radiation experienced by reactor components begins to fundamentally change the otherwise well understood material properties. At the Reactor Material Testing Laboratory (RMTL) at Queen’s University, a high energy proton accelerator is used to simulate the neutron damage found in a nuclear reactor and conduct experiments to develop a mechanistic understanding of irradiated material samples and their changing material properties.&#xD;
This Thesis details the design and integration of an in-situ proton irradiation tensile rig (PITR) at the RMTL facility. The purpose of this apparatus is to provide the means of systematically exploring degradation phenomenon of reactor materials in controlled single variable experiments. &#xD;
The results from these studies will lead to an improved understanding of irradiation behavior of materials and ultimately help lead to the development of improved safety and efficiency for current and future reactors.&#xD;
After evaluating the reliability and accuracy of each individual system and component of the PITR, a proof of concept experiment was conducted to demonstrate its capability of conducting an in-situ proton irradiation tensile test. A 75 µm thick pure zirconium foil was irradiated at a damage rate of 1.37 × 10-7 dpa/s, a constant temperature of 350 °C, and a constant applied stress of 30 MPa. The resulting strain rate was compared against that of an identical sample held at the same temperature and applied stress without the applied proton beam. The sample subjected to proton irradiation was found to have a much higher strain rate for the given parameters than the non-irradiated sample.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Aluminum hexagonal honeycomb panels are commonly used in the aerospace industry to reduce weight due to their high stiffness to mass ratio. The panels are commonly involved in incidents where they are dented in the out-of-plane direction which causes plastic deformation in the face-sheet and buckling collapse of the thin repeating cell-walls in the core. This thesis investigates the responses to barely-visible-impact-damage (BVID) in aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels in the out-of-plane direction with particular attention to the structural adhesive. The structural adhesive forms a fillet shape between the face-sheet and the aluminum core during the 120oC curing process and can coat over 50% of the honeycomb core thickness in some cases. Because BVID is common in honeycomb panels, this study looks to improve the understanding of how various factors affect the panel’s response to denting, starting with the adhesive at the interface between the face-sheets and core.&#xD;
To simplify the problem, the out-of-plane direction was isolated by compressing a panel uniformly. This provided results showing how the adhesive geometry affects the stiffness in a key loading direction with respect to denting. The adhesive was found to cause a higher critical buckling stress and a lower percent compaction before densification. Buckling location was more random when compared to the honeycomb core with no adhesive due to fixed constraints at the top and bottom of the core, where damage would usually initiate. A new mathematical prediction of the stress-strain response was developed, which will be referenced as a material model, to account for adhesive effects. The proposed mathematical material model for the stress-strain curve resulted in R-squared values above 0.82 when compared to experimental data.&#xD;
Force-displacement data collected from quasi-static experiments with a spherical contact showed that the amount of adhesive was positively correlated to the damage resistance, energy absorbed and the depth of interior buckling damage in the core. This study provides researchers and engineers with experimental results that present a relationship between the structural adhesive and the response to BVID in honeycomb panels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis looks at the human relationship to other animals in the eyes of the law. Many contemporary legal systems categorize nonhuman animals as property, which means that they can be objectified and commodified. The property status has been widely criticized for its inability to provide the most vulnerable among us with protection from human violence and exploitation. Animal law scholars have thoroughly documented the failures of welfarist reform, and call for the recognition of nonhuman animals as legal subjects and rightsholders via legal personhood as a requirement of justice. In this thesis, I turn to Maneesha Deckha’s postcolonial feminist critique of personhood as an exclusionary and anthropocentric legal subjectivity that settler colonial legal systems have inherited. In response, I argue that we should redefine personhood in animal terms for the sake of those who are marginalized and oppressed. I propose “animal personhood” as a human and nonhuman legal subjectivity that is grounded in equality as well as the embodied and relational dimensions of our vulnerability as sentient beings. Animal personhood is meant to legally affirm the moral and political rights of animal persons.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation comprises two studies that examine predictors of children’s reading. In Study 1, I investigated the unique contributions of prosodic awareness and morphological awareness to word reading and reading comprehension in English-only children (n=110) across Grades 4 and 5. Prosodic awareness and morphological awareness were unique predictors of word reading, and morphological awareness was the only predictor of word reading that also explained individual differences in reading comprehension. The relationship between prosodic awareness and word reading was partially mediated by phonemic awareness and morphological awareness, and the relationship between prosodic awareness and reading comprehension was fully mediated by morphological awareness and word reading. In Study 2, I examined prosodic awareness and morphological awareness among a comprehensive set of predictors in English-only (n=90) and Chinese-English bilingual (n=128) children between Grades 3 to 6. I provide evidence illustrating that prosody represents a separate dimension of phonology. Prosody explained unique variance in word reading after accounting for segmental phonological awareness in both language groups, but these effects did not remain after accounting for morphological awareness and orthographic awareness in the model. The path analyses revealed indirect effects of prosody on word reading through morphological awareness in the English-only group, and indirect effects of prosody on word reading through morphological awareness and segmental phonology in the Chinese-English bilingual group. To conclude, prosody was a contributor to word reading processes, and morphology had unique effects on word reading and reading comprehension processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Prosody represents a broad construct, which I have focused my examination on word-level prosodic awareness in relation to reading outcomes. Across the three samples of children across Grades 3 to 6, prosody was a significant correlate with reading outcomes and established predictors including vocabulary, segmental phonological awareness, and morphological awareness. I extended this investigation of prosody to a second language group and provided insight into the relative contributions of these predictors within a comprehensive and complex model of word reading. To conclude, prosody may play a supportive role in the reading network, but it is a distinct construct that should be considered seriously in theoretical models of reading.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mental health conditions create incredibly complex experiences in the world. Some medical professionals argue that mental health conditions are purely physical phenomena – simply a deficiency of brain chemicals. Some philosophers construe reason (and therefore the limits of philosophy) too narrowly to say anything interesting about mental health conditions. I aim to develop a complex account of rational agency that explains how we navigate the world in general, and mental health conditions in particular. I then develop examples to show how this account of agency can help explain what it is like to live with a mental health condition. My account aspires to shed light on the nature of agency and provide some much-needed theoretical backing for psychological methods of treating mental health conditions.</dcterms:abstract>
