      <dcterms:abstract>The properties of the satellite populations of galaxies are vital for understanding their structure and evolution in a cosmological context. Deep optical imaging surveys have revealed a host of low surface brightness (LSB) features near Local Volume galaxies, that may be satellites of the latter. We conduct atomic gas (HI) observations of 48 such satellite candidate galaxies discovered around 10 different hosts using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. Detections of HI reservoirs in these systems will provide spectroscopic distances that can be used to confirm an association to their putative hosts. Non-detections imply that the objects are gas-poor, irrespective of their distance along the line-of-sight. We first search for HI in six ultra-faint dwarf candidates discovered near NGC 3109. One is detected in HI, placing it in the background as a gas-rich field dwarf, while the remaining five have no detectable HI emission. We also searched for HI along the lines of sight to 27 LSB features that project around M101, and the majority (23/27) were found to be gas-poor. The other four were detected in HI, though only one has a recessional velocity consistent with that of M101. Two of the other galaxies have systemic velocities suggesting an association with a background group and the fourth detection places it in the background. Finally, we searched for HI in 15 satellite candidates around 8 hosts finding just one gas-rich satellite. Using the HI and optical properties of all non-detections, we compare them with other samples of dwarf galaxies. We find that in order for our non-detections to be consistent with well-studied scaling relations for gas-rich field galaxies, the most plausible scenario is that the Local Volume LSBs are associated with their hosts, the M101 candidates are associated with it or the background group, and the satellite candidates around NGC 3109 are in fact field galaxies that have distances in the range 17.5-38 Mpc. Therefore, both detections and non-detections place important constraints on the physical properties of candidate satellite galaxies detected in the optical.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>PHP is an open source scripting language mainly used for web development such as building websites.  PHP is one of the most popular programming languages, and most websites are programmed using PHP.   PHP is constantly evolving by adding and deprecating functions and syntactic features over time.  Some of these features appear often in PHP applications, while some others are rarely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis examines the usage of PHP features in open source PHP applications in three parts.  First, the appearance of PHP features in PHP files and applications is examined.  It was found that most PHP features are present in almost all PHP files and applications, while some PHP features rarely appear in PHP applications.  Second, the usage frequency of PHP features in PHP files and applications is examined.  It seems that some PHP features are not used very frequently, even though they appear in almost all PHP applications.  Lastly, differences in how PHP applications use the PHP language are examined.  The examination shows major differences in the use of PHP in different PHP applications, and identifies clusters of PHP applications that use the language in similar ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
The analyses are carried out on a dataset of 20 well-known open source PHP applications, consisting of 51,871 PHP files with 9,501,386 lines of code.  The dataset is analyzed using a parser written in the TXL source transformation language, which extracts and counts functions and syntactic features used in PHP applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
The analyses in the thesis aim to give PHP application developers and language designers a better understanding of the use of the PHP language in open source PHP applications, to better guide the rapid evolution of the language.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Conventional solutions to nonlinear filtering problems fall into two categories, deterministic and stochastic approaches. While the former is heavily used due to low computational demand, approximation error is tied to their initialization, which causes difficulty during long term application. The latter circumvents this but at the cost of a significant increase in computation. An extremely popular stochastic filter termed the particle filter is especially notorious for this. However its superior performance (over the conventional nonlinear filters) and generality of use makes it ideal in environments where high nonlinearity plagues the state-space model. Estimation error and computational complexity for the particle filter are both related to the number of particles utilized. Yet, many researchers have observed that particles in the vicinity of one another, perhaps because they represent the same state, might be redundant. A new type of filter is proposed where particles in addition to a (linearized) Gaussian component are tracked. This can be seen as a parallel solution to the estimation problem, each component can be separately filtered and constituent outputs summed up to form the filtering distribution. This new filter is then used in two classical scenarios used to benchmark nonlinear filters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Social interventions that promote social capital and social support have the potential to reduce depression at a population level, yet fundamental gaps in the study of social capital, and uncertainty of how social interventions should be designed act as barriers to their implementation. Uncertainty remains regarding (1) the longitudinal relationships between the dimensions of social capital and depression, (2) the complex pathways that can lead to depression in vulnerable groups, and (3) the types of social interventions that could effectively reduce depression. This dissertation included three studies to reduce these knowledge gaps and create recommendations for public health interventions.&#xD;
The first study investigated the longitudinal relationships among cognitive, structural, and network dimensions of social capital and depressive status in adults over a six-year period. The cognitive dimension of social capital was most strongly related to lower odds of depressive status over the study period. Findings speak to the importance of conducting community-based programs for depression, which aim to strengthen cognitive social capital, by fostering trust in neighbours and improving neighbourhood social cohesion.&#xD;
The second study examined the key pathways that lead to depression in a sample of low income mothers. The study found that higher parental stress partially explained the relationship between low income and depressive symptoms in mothers. Having diverse social networks was protective against the effects of high parental stress on depressive symptoms. Findings demonstrate the importance of considering network social capital as a potential buffer against stress, and also the complex factors that can lead to depression when designing social interventions.&#xD;
The third study included a systematic review of the literature that classified and reported on community-based social interventions that have been implemented to target depression in adults. Seventeen of the twenty-four interventions included in the review were effective in reducing depression among participants. Most interventions incorporated multiple approaches to promoting mental health. The review concluded that social interventions have the potential to be effective, can be tailored to diverse groups, and can be feasible in resource-scarce communities.&#xD;
The findings of this dissertation generated recommendations that can be directly applied to the design of public health interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The focus of this project is to think more deeply, and also differently, about the injustices experienced by Black people. One initial problem is that of reparations: why have reparations never been given to Black people despite their enslavement, continued dehumanization, imposed poverty, and colonization? Given that Black people comprise a group that has endured racially based injustices for centuries, and continue to face grave injustices, it must be the case that something is being misunderstood. This misunderstanding is an epistemological problem, one that perpetuates epistemic injustice for Black people. Some deny that these injustices still exist, but even those who acknowledge their existence do little to address it.&#xD;
 	There are some practical, more visible ways to expose people to the injustices experienced by Black people, such as presenting facts and figures, but these methods often fail on their own. Instead, what is needed is a deeper understanding of reality. Reality reveals that although all people suffer, some people suffer because of their perceived race. This can affect Black people in many different areas of their life, as it penetrates into all of our social institutions. This ranges from politics, to language, to education. Although these injustices are normally framed politically and economically, it is important to move these discussions into other institutions like education. &#xD;
 	If we are to think clearly about the injustices experienced by Black people, we must feel clearly about the injustices experienced by Black people. It is necessary that people lose preconceived notions of themselves and of others because if we remain attached to these notions, then we will be clouded by illusions about ourselves and the world. We can find meditative practices within Buddhism that can help with this process. These practices can illuminate methods for progression and stir up movement in institutions like education. Given the epistemological issues relevant here, this can perhaps motivate conversations about the injustices experienced by Black people, including the problem of reparations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research on the degradation of platinum (Pt) and nickel (Ni) materials is of high importance to the fuel cell and electrolyser technologies, because their degradation translates into irreversible materials loss and deterioration of these energy systems’ performance.  Polycrystalline platinum (Pt(poly)) serves as a model system, and experimental studies using Pt(poly) create important background knowledge that will facilitate the identification and quantification of phenomena unique to the nanoscopic Pt-based electrocatalysts.  In the thesis, I present original results on the preparation, characterization, catalytic activity and corrosion behaviour of bulk Pt and nanoscopic Pt, PtNi, PtCo and Ni(OH)2 materials.  I studied the electrochemical and corrosion behaviour of Pt(poly) in acidic media saturated with N2(g), O2(g) or H2(g).  I analyzed the influence of the potential scan rate (s) (1.00–50.0 mV s−1 range) on the cyclic-voltammetry (CV) behaviour of Pt(poly).  The results indicated that the Pt surface oxide reveals catalytic duality and acts both as an inhibitor and a catalyst in the oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions (ORR and HOR).  I also analyzed the influence of the value of s (0.10–1.00 mV s−1 range) on the polarization behaviour of Pt(poly) in anodic and cathodic directions.  The results demonstrated that the corrosion data obtained at s = 0.10 mV s−1 are the most representative of the corrosion of Pt(poly).  I employed a similar methodology to study the electrochemical and corrosion behaviour of the Pt-base nanocatalysts.  Nanocatalysts were synthesized using the “water-in-oil” microemulsion method.  X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to examine their average size, shape, and size distribution; they were determined to be spherical with a fine average size and a narrow size distribution.  Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out to evaluate the metal loading, which was very close to the predetermined target values.  Surface oxide formation and reduction were examined using in-situ confocal Raman spectroscopy.  A comparison of the corrosion data (obtained by performing polarization experiments) demonstrated that nanocatalysts do not corrode in the presence of H2(g), corrode slightly in the presence of N2(g), and corrode severely in the presence of O2(g).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation investigates the meaning and function of ‘masculinity’ among Algonquin peoples in contemporary and historical contexts in lands claimed by Canada. As an Algonquin scholar, I examine historical sources alongside interviews with other Algonquin people to consider the relationship between ‘roles,’ as discussed by the interview participants, and the erroneous identity politics and status/non-status debates emergent in Algonquin realities via the Indian Act and the current land claim process.&#xD;
The purpose of this study is to explore and examine modes of Algonquin masculinity and their reinvigoration alongside understandings and articulations of other Indigenous masculinities.  As such, the research question is:  How do Algonquin people view masculine identities among our people, and how do these identities interact with identity politics and the gendered process of settler colonialism?&#xD;
The response to the research question is three-fold.  First, selected theoretical positions are considered as lenses of analysis for the literature and interview responses which inform the work in the dissertation.  Second, the complexities of identity politics impacting Algonquin masculinities are examined.  Finally, it is argued that the roles and responsibilities of Algonquin people are formative and central to modes of Algonquin masculinity.&#xD;
The results of this study indicate that the crucial focus of the participants on “roles” and “responsibilities” functions to liberate individual Algonquin people from the colonial (and colonizing) discourse of status/non-status by producing understandings of self-worth through ethics of behaviour rather than imposed identities.  By focusing on “roles” and “responsibilities,” Algonquin individuals move away from the erroneous gender binaries that perpetuate hetero-patriarchy.  It is not just those who identify as men who can take on protectorship and provision. A “role” is something you enact, you perform; “status” is something that is assigned.  In this way, the discussion of Algonquin masculinities in this dissertation pushes toward greater openness at the same time that it binds understandings of ethical behaviour back to the community and to the land.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) was a period of enhanced warmth during the early-to- mid Holocene period largely caused by enhanced solar insolation. In northwestern Ontario, the HTM was characterized by a lower abundance of Picea pollen and an increase in Cupressaceae and Ambrosia pollen. Pollen-based inferences suggest HTM temperatures were elevated by approximately 2-3°C, and lake levels were regionally lower than today, suggesting warmer and more arid conditions than today. This warming resulted in increased algal production and associated cyanobacteria blooms in lakes in northwestern Ontario. In northeastern Ontario, climate projections suggest the HTM was 2-3°C warmer. However, to date, there has been little research on the impact of the HTM on boreal lakes in northeastern Ontario, creating a gap in our understanding of the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems. A pollen study conducted previously suggests the HTM was warm and wet in northeastern Ontario, and his pollen framework is used to infer past changes in climate for this study. In this thesis a paleolimnological approach is used to assess how algal assemblages changed over the Holocene from a sediment core from Charland Lake, a boreal lake in northeastern Ontario near Timmins, and if the proxy data supports a conclusion of higher levels of algal production during the warmer HTM. A carbon-dated sediment core taken from the deep-water flat central basin of Charland Lake was examined for sedimentary pigments, diatom assemblages, and percent organic matter. Statistical analysis revealed diatom and pigment assemblages and concentrations varied throughout the Holocene, broadly coinciding with changes in the regional climate as inferred from past research. Lake-water production was low after deglaciation and through the HTM, potentially attributable with an unstable landscape and associated contributions of fine clastic material to the lake. Lake-water production was highest during the post-HTM period (~4460-2590 cal yr BP), but before the onset of modern conditions. The results also suggest that the last ~4500 years had higher levels of lake-water production, than during the HTM, likely related to interactions that depend on location and landscape characteristics. In comparison to northwestern Ontario, changes in the proxies of production were not very large.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Faster dynamic response and higher power density are the major achievements obtained by increasing the switching frequency of power supplies. However, switching frequencies are limited by topology, control, semiconductor materials, and packaging methods.&#xD;
To address these issues, the thesis first proposes a new quasi-resonant converter topology reduces the switching components’ voltage stress to half, and nearly eliminates the switching losses in quasi-resonant converters specifically under on-off control strategy. &#xD;
The second major thesis achievement is the introduction of the first cycle control method that enhances the performance of the so-called ‘on-off’ control method. This method suffers from overvoltage stress and the hard-switching power losses in on-off transients. The proposed first cycle control method substantially alleviates the voltage stress and switching losses. This achievement makes better use of the switches, and paves the way to further increase the on-off rate.&#xD;
Final contribution is the proposed (ZVT) cell that is introduced to have a fully ZVS on-off control. Simple structure, low number of components, and avoidance of inductive components in the cell are advantages of the circuit. Higher modulation frequency, lower input and output filter sizes, and faster dynamic responses are the benefits of this method. The zero voltage switching operation of all semiconductor components allows the designer to increase the modulation frequency without any significant drop in the overall efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The McArthur River unconformity-related uranium deposit (~500 m depth) and the deep&#xD;
Stewardson Lake uranium project (~1100 m depth) are located in the eastern and south-central&#xD;
sections of the Athabasca Basin. By examining fractures and wall rock from McArthur River and&#xD;
comparing this analysis with the chemistry from the Stewardson Lake uranium project, this study&#xD;
determined that fractures can be used to detect dispersion from uranium mineralization at depth.&#xD;
Petrographic, shortwave infrared reflectance spectroscopic (SWIR) and geochemical studies were&#xD;
conducted to identify distinct colors, mineral assemblages, and chemical compositions of&#xD;
fractures. Weak acid leach (WAL) and modified aqua regia (AR) leach analyzed by high-resolution&#xD;
inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry (HR ICP-MS), indicate that brown&#xD;
(Type 1) and white and yellow (Type 2) fractures best record evidence of uranium mineralization&#xD;
at McArthur River through post-mineralization dispersion, as many fractures have low uranium&#xD;
concentrations and low 207Pb/206Pb values. Brown fractures show elevated concentrations of&#xD;
pathfinder elements, Co, Ba, Tl, Mn and radiogenic Pb. The 207Pb/206Pb values of fractures and&#xD;
wall rock reflect post-mineralization dispersion fluids imprinted on wall rock near fractures (low&#xD;
207Pb/206Pb values; 0.09-0.50), followed by a less radiogenic fluid related to the fracture coatings&#xD;
(higher 207Pb/206Pb values) at McArthur River and Stewardson Lake. Stable isotope results,&#xD;
shown by δ18O and δ2H values, indicate that the footprint of the deposit extends upwards by&#xD;
hydrothermal fluids, through some fractures, including white and yellow fractures rich in fibrous&#xD;
goethite. Continuous leach (CL)-ICP-MS results show an association between Ni, V, and&#xD;
radiogenic Pb with Fe oxide and clay minerals during the 30% HNO3 leach phase for these&#xD;
fracture types.&#xD;
The mineral chemistry of seven fracture types from McArthur River and five fracture&#xD;
types from Stewardson Lake indicates that, although multiple fluid events have affected some&#xD;
fractures, they still preserve evidence of syn-mineralization and post-mineralization dispersion of&#xD;
elements. The mineralogy and geochemistry of fracture fillings indicate syn- and post-mineralization&#xD;
mobilization of pathfinder elements from the McArthur River uranium deposit and&#xD;
Stewardson Lake uranium occurrence at depth, but also provide evidence of a downward&#xD;
migration of elements from the surface, shown by McArthur River fractures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>When stakeholders in legal education discuss skills teaching and learning, do they share conceptual and linguistic common ground? Or do they simply assume that such common ground exists? This qualitative study explores those questions against the backdrop of a rapidly changing practice and licensing environment in Ontario. The goal of the study was to create a preliminary taxonomy that describes in the broadest possible terms what stakeholders in Ontario legal education collectively identify and refer to as legal skills.  Using the method of computer-assisted qualitative content analysis, text data referring to skills was extracted from publicly available documents produced by three stakeholder groups: Ontario law firms and bar associations, collectively representing the Profession; the Law Society of Upper Canada and the Federation of Law Societies of Canada, representing the Regulator in Ontario; and Ontario law schools. Text excerpts were classified and assigned to thematic categories based on both inductive and deductive coding methods. This resulted in a taxonomy of over 100 individually identified skills referenced by the stakeholders.  Whereas other studies have described skills in the narrow terms of what lawyers do in practice, in order to drive skills curriculum in law schools, the method used here collected data without prioritizing one voice over another.  Thus, the resulting taxonomy, rather than defining skills in accordance with a single stakeholder’s interests, instead expands the way in which legal educators might imagine and program skills teaching and learning. It provides common ground for discussion among legal educators about skills curriculum, and encourages stakeholders to work collaboratively to design curriculum that is responsive to our students’ needs for innovative legal education, which will in turn prepare them to successfully navigate the demands of practice in a “new law” environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigated and evaluated non-destructive condition assessment methods for both cast iron water pipes and large diameter sewer and culvert systems. A state-of-the-art review of Non-destructive Testing (NDT) technologies available for cast iron water pipes and corrugated steel culverts identified the strengths and weaknesses of each technology. Guidelines were developed for selecting NDT technologies for use in industry. An investigation of NDT techniques to help establish the relationship between ground movement and cast iron water pipe breaks was then undertaken. A total of fifteen segments of 150 mm cast iron water pipes were monitored using an acoustic-based pipe condition assessment technique to estimate the remaining wall thickness and presence of leaks. Three of the fifteen segments were then selected for seasonal ground deformation monitoring using both a Total Station and LiDAR system. Results showed that both technologies could be used to monitor differential ground movement. Ground movements of 20-25 mm were observed for the pavement above a location with a confirmed leak while minimal movement was seen on the street without leaks. Finally, an investigation of NDT techniques for erosion void detection was conducted. A testbed consisting of two buried pipes (a reinforced concrete pipe with 1.2 m internal diameter and a corrugated steel horizontal ellipse culvert with a span of 1.6 m and a height of 1.35 m) was prepared in the West Pit of the Geoengineering Laboratory at Queen’s University, featuring prefabricated erosion voids of known dimensions adjacent to the pipes. Tests were conducted using handheld and conventional Backscatter Computed Tomography (BCT), Pipe Penetrating Radar (PPR), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), and Infrared Thermography (IRT) to evaluate the detection and characterization accuracy of these technologies. Results showed that both the BCT technologies detected all three voids behind the corrugated steel pipe wall, while PPR and GPR found one of the three voids next to the reinforced concrete pipe. Results also showed that cooling down thermography was success in detecting three voids behind the corrugated steel pipe wall and their approximate locations as well as the longitudinal and circumferential dimensions of void contact with the pipe.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Issue tracking systems, such as Bugzilla, are commonly used to track reported bugs and change requests. Duplicate reports have been considered as a hindrance to developers and a drain on their resources.  To avoid wasting developer resources on previously-reported (i.e., duplicate) issues, it is necessary to identify such duplicates as soon as they are reported. &#xD;
In recent years, several approaches have been proposed for the automated  retrieval of duplicate reports. These approaches leverage the textual, categorical, and contextual information in previously reported issues to determine whether a newly-reported issue has  been previously-reported. In general, studies that are designed to evaluate these approaches treat all the duplicate issue reports equally, make use of data chunks that span a relatively short period of time, and ignore the impact of newly-activated features (e.g., just-in-time lightweight retrieval of duplicates at filing time)  in the recent issue tracking systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis revisits the experimental design choices of such prior studies  along three perspectives: 1) Used performance measures, 2) Evaluation process, and 3) Experiment's data choice.  For the performance measures, we  highlight the need for effort-aware evaluation of such approaches, since the identification of a considerable amount of duplicate reports (over 50%) appears to be a relatively trivial task. &#xD;
 &#xD;
 For the evaluation process,&#xD;
  we show that the previously-reported performance of such approaches   is significantly overestimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
 Finally, recent versions of ITSs  perform  just-in-time lightweight  retrieval of duplicate issue reports at the filing time of an issue report. The aim of such just-in-time retrieval is to avoid the filing of duplicates. We show that future studies of the automated retrieval of duplicate reports have to focus on after-JIT duplicates, as these duplicates are more representative of issue reports in practice nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
 Our results   through this thesis highlight the current state of progress in the automated retrieval of duplicate reports while charting directions for future research efforts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Communication between humans is not limited to the spoken word. We use a number of non-verbal cues such as facial expression, eye contact, body orientation and movement, among others. Research on display technology has made it possible to provide a convincing reconstruction of facial—and sometimes body—features preserving eye contact between local and remote users in telecommunication. A variety of light field displays have been developed to support eye contact in one-to-many teleconferencing scenarios. Unfortunately, most of these systems focus exclusively on display technology, disregarding mobility issues. Telepresence robots allow some degree of mobility. Self-levitating telepresence robots, such as blimps and drones, could move freely through the air. But they do not provide a three-dimensional appearance of a remote user.&#xD;
In this thesis, we present a telepresence system featuring a self-levitating light field display, LightBee. The display is a drone that flies a projection of a remote user's head in 3D in a space. The remote user’s head movements are used to control the movements of the drone, offering support for non-verbal communication through proxemics and eye contact across a distance. The light field display is created by a cylindrical retroreflective sheet mounted on a quadcopter. 45 projectors, mounted in a ring, project images onto the LightBee’s retroreflector, creating a light field providing motion parallax and stereoscopy without the aid of glasses. This allows multiple local users to experience a “hologrammatic” view of the remote user’s head, as seen from varying angles. Two small cameras mounted on LightBee allow the remote user to fly through and experience the local environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Shizhe shengcun was the best-known Chinese phrase associated with Darwinism and Social Darwinism during the twentieth century. It has remained in use to this day, and continues to be accepted as the best translation of the “survival of the fittest.”  Variation in use of the term shizhe shengcun reflects the rise and fall of social Darwinist ideas in China. By tracing a thread in the development of social Darwinist terminology in modern China, this study illuminates the intellectual lineage of Chinese social Darwinist thought.&#xD;
Two modes of thought in Chinese philosophy have been identified as relevant to the reception of Darwinist concepts, namely the materialistic worldview of Wang Fuzhi (1619-1692) and the primitive theory of evolution expounded much earlier by Zhuangzi (370-287 BC). These two modes of thought contributed to a conceptual framework for the reception of Darwinist and social Darwinist ideas in China. In the last a few decades of the nineteenth century, Darwinist and social Darwinist terms began to be translated into Chinese. As this thesis points out, an essay composed by Zhong Tianwei in 1889 was the first work in Chinese to convey identifiable social Darwinist terms, and Yan Fu’s book Tianyan Lun (1898) was the first to express social Darwinist ideas in detail. The thesis argues that Zhong and Yan both introduced terms associated with evolution while placing them within the framework of Chinese philosophy.&#xD;
Through discussion of the emergence and acceptance of shizhe shengcun and other terms, this study constructs a new explanation of the introduction and changing usage of social Darwinist concepts in China. There has as yet been no comprehensive study of how Chinese intellectuals introduced and understood the key terms and concepts associated with Darwinism and how their work led to the coalescence of a conceptual system associated with Social Darwinism. In further discussion, the thesis presents a case study of the approach to suzhi jiaoyu, a concept based on Herbert Spencer’s educational principles. The case study illustrates the application of social Darwinist ideas in contemporary China.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Modern coherent optical communication systems transmit 100 Gb/s dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) signals on each of the 100 channels in a dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) system. Each of these channels require an individual optical carrier frequency to be generated from a discrete high-performance tunable laser. These arrays of discrete lasers are an expensive component in the transmitter of an optical communication channel. Thus, recent research has investigated an alternative laser source - optical frequency combs (OFCs). OFCs generate numerous spectral modes, referred to as comb lines, from a single photonic device. Each of these comb lines can be used as an optical carrier frequency for a channel in a DWDM system. Thus, the implementation of an OFC as a laser source for coherent optical communications minimizes the number of laser modules in a DWDM system leading to a drastic reduction in system cost and complexity. Additionally, OFCs exhibit an intrinsic coherence among each comb line across the spectrum. This coherence implies that the phase noise exhibited by each comb line in the OFC is related which allows for effective methods of phase noise compensation. Consequently, OFCs are heavily under research and development.&#xD;
In this research, a prototype 25 GHz quantum-dot coherent optical frequency comb source laser is characterized in both the time and frequency domains. The output of the comb source laser is extensively observed and the optical and electrical spectra, spectral flatness, relative intensity noise, phase noise, linewidth and timing jitter are measured. These preliminary results led to the development of a coherent phase noise detection scheme capable of recovering time domain phase noise trajectories for pairs of comb lines. The detection scheme allowed the coherence exhibited by the comb source to be quantified using a correlation coefficient which compared recovered phase noise trajectories for pairs of comb lines. Additionally, the statistical properties of the recovered phase noise trajectories are explored which enables experimental quantification of the relative contribution of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise and timing jitter for each mode. Experimental results are shown to align with theoretical descriptions of phase noise in mode-locked lasers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Developing alternatives to organic solvents and salts in chromatographic separation is highly desired. In this thesis, original studies were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of using CO2-modified aqueous solvents as an environmentally friendly mobile phase. &#xD;
Porous polymer monoliths were considered as a straightforward approach for the preparation of capillary columns with various functionality. A copolymer column containing dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) was investigated for the effect of CO2 on separation. Although a slight decrease of retention time of aromatic compounds was initially observed using acetic acid-modified solvent, the chromatographic separation using CO2-modified solvent was not reproducible, presumably resulting from the difficulty of reliably introducing gaseous CO2 into the nano LC system. Because different pH and temperature conditions can be easily applied, the pH and thermo-responsive behaviour of the copolymer column was also investigated. It showed the capability of pH and temperature for manipulating retention time and selectivity for various compounds. Because of the presence of ionizable groups, the column was also demonstrated for ion exchange separation of proteins.&#xD;
Following the initial work, a conventional HPLC system was used instead. A custom CO2 delivery system (1 bar CO2) was assembled to provide CO2-modified aqueous solvent with pH 3.9 ~ 6.5. A significant hydrophobicity switch of the stationary phase was observed by a reduction in retention time, when using CO2-modified solvents for the diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) and polyethylenimine (PEI) functionalized columns. In particular, the polyethylenimine column can be used to perform separation of organic molecules using 100% water without any organic solvent added. Another study was also conducted utilizing primary, secondary and tertiary amine functionalized silica particles (3.5 µm). A pH-/CO2-dependent ion exchange separation was demonstrated considering the protonation / deprotonation of both stationary phase and analytes. Carboxylic acid compounds were effectively separated using only carbonated water as the mobile phase. &#xD;
Despite the development of green chromatographic separations, this thesis also demonstrated the pH-/CO2-responsive surface wettability / adhesion of a polymer monolith surface grafted with functional polymers. Preliminary results indicate significant potential for applications such as drug screening and cell culture by introducing stimuli-responsive domains in droplet microarrays.</dcterms:abstract>

Yet, physical activity interventions in MS rarely focus on people with moderate-to-severe MS disability or target dyads.&#xD;
The overall purpose of this dissertation was to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the development of a dyadic physical activity intervention for people with moderate-to-severe MS disability and their family caregivers. Guided by the Developmental Contextual Coping Model and the Concerns Report Methodology, three studies were conducted as part of this dissertation. First, a qualitative focus group study was conducted to explore the shared perspectives of the dyads about physical activity. Next, a cross-sectional accelerometry study was conducted to determine physical activity pattern interdependence within the dyads. Finally, a cross-sectional survey study was conducted to determine the needs, issues and concerns for community resources to support physical activity participation, factors associated with perceived need and barriers to sole- versus co-participation in physical activity among the target groups.&#xD;
The results indicate that structured and unstructured physical activity are not perceived as mutually exclusive and each partner can go back and forth along the continuum depending on current circumstances. Physical activity was described an interpersonal experience with caregivers and care-recipients sharing similar struggles, frustrations and adjustments when trying to be physically active. The results also show that both people with moderate-to-severe MS disability and their caregivers are far below the public health recommendations for physical activity. Findings highlight the critical need for a multilevel resource that incorporates affordable options for exercising together and innovative methods of outreach to people with moderate-to-severe MS disability and the caregivers who support them. A broad range of predisposing, enabling and health need factors were associated with perceived need for community resources. The variability in barriers to sole- versus co-participation in physical activity among people with MS and their caregivers suggest that the success of dyadic physical activity interventions in MS may be contingent upon adequate diminution of care-recipients and caregivers unique barriers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accelerated ageing tests are used to examine the performance of geomembranes in three applications. The thesis examines a broad range of geomembranes produced over a time span of 30 years and highlights the progress made in the antioxidant/stabilizer packages as well as the resins.&#xD;
First, two high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes exhumed from a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated waste storage site constructed in the mid-1980’s are examined. The two geomembranes exhibited different antioxidant depletion mechanisms and mechanical performances. Both geomembranes were still performing their design function when exhumed after 22-23 years and a long period of effective performance is projected based on accelerated aging tests.&#xD;
Second, five high-performance geomembranes manufactured in 2014 and boosted with antioxidants and stabilizers are immersed in brine solution (the concentrate from the reverse osmosis process used to clean up hydraulic fracturing flowback waters from coal/shale gas recovery so that most of the water can be released as surface water for agricultural use). The thesis shows a difference in the performance between the five products in terms of antioxidants depletion, the estimated time to depletion (Stage I), morphological changes at the six test temperatures (95 to 40ºC) and the considerable decrease in stress crack resistance of 2-mm HDPE geomembrane with time prior to any oxidative degradation. The brine concentration greatly affects the antioxidant’s depletion rate.&#xD;
Third, the performance of the same five high-performance geomembranes is examined for immersion in reverse osmosis water (the clean side output from the reverse osmosis process used to clean up hydraulic fracturing flowback waters) at three temperatures. The products were also immersed in synthetic leachate at a high temperature for comparison. The geomembranes immersed in water behaved differently than in leachate and brine even at the lowest concentration. When compared to geomembranes produced in the 2000’s, the boost in the antioxidants/stabilizers concentrations of the high-performance geomembranes was not highly efficient in increasing the time to depletion. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of the high-performance geomembranes did not decrease for the testing period unlike those produced in the 2000’s that exhibited a relatively an early degradation in mechanical properties.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Biofuels have recently emerged as renewable, biodegradable, and cost-effective alternatives to fossil fuels. Microalgae serve as promising feedstocks to produce biofuel because of their fast growth rates, ability to grow on non-arable land or in wastewater, and high lipid content, which is essential for biofuel production. Unfortunately, current laboratory methods for the extraction of microalgal lipids have high capital/energy costs. Therefore, this thesis examines liquid CO2 as a potential greener technique for extracting these intracellular lipids. In the literature review, microalgal cell disruption and extraction techniques are discussed extensively. Current extraction techniques, with or without cell disruption, have high energy and capital costs. Therefore, it is essential to discover greener extraction techniques. Other improvements to reduce cost include using microalgal slurries, combining process steps, and minimizing solvent use. Life cycle assessments are necessary to identify the environmental impact associated with each lipid extraction method. The lipid extract yields from Chlorella vulgaris using liquid CO2, co-solvents, and/or additional modifiers, were investigated. When C. vulgaris in the presence of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and water was exposed to liquid CO2, the highest extract yield was obtained compared to all other co-solvents and/or modifiers tested. In a study of the transesterification of soybean oil using a switchable-hydrophilicity solvent, 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol, fatty acid methyl ester yields and the recyclability of 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol were reported. After 5 cycles, the yield of fatty acid methyl esters was 80-85 % of the original mass of soybean oil and the recovery of 2-DBAE was 65-90 % of the original volume. This project served as a proof of concept for future applications to microalgae. The extraction of lipids from Scenedesmus sp. using liquid CO2, methanol, and/or prior cell disruption techniques was investigated. When microwave radiation in the presence of distilled water followed by extraction using liquid CO2 and methanol, the highest neutral lipid and free fatty acids yields were obtained. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy was able to effectively monitor cell disruption upon microwave radiation and grinding following freezing with liquid N2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: In light of the current directives of the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services (MCSS) towards providing more inclusive employment opportunities and closure of sheltered workshops, service providers are working to shift their employment services to be more community-based. This study investigated the needs of clients in one community agency, their caregivers, agency staff and administration, regarding the development of a community-based employment program for service users with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Methods: This qualitative case study used a needs assessment framework based on the model developed by Witkin and Altschuld (1995). Prior the start of the data collection, a pre-assessment was conducted which provided the background and premise for the current assessment. The full needs assessment included four participant groups: agency clients, caregivers, day program staff and senior management. Clients and their caregivers participated in individual, semi structured interviews. Day program staff and senior management participated in separate focus groups. Results/Discussion: This evaluation determined that all stakeholders would like community-based employment services to be offered by the agency, and clients expressed an interest in supported employment services, vocational services and a social enterprise. The results of this assessment also highlight factors that impact stakeholders’ motives for pursuing community based employment services, and the organizational and structural barriers that hinder the agency’s development of such services. Due to the diversity in the clientele, there was ambivalence amongst stakeholders about which type of employment program will best suit service users and the organization overall.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A ventilation planning framework with a focus on life-of-mine plans has been developed and was validated with a case study. The framework reconciles the mine production plan with the ventilation plan by creating design acceptability criteria, and from these, minimum airflow requirements for the production plan are set. The framework continues with the development of a ventilation model that is extrapolated forward, and the predicted future flows are tested against the ventilation acceptability criteria and the model is also checked for other bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Where gaps exist between the available and required ventilation, ideas are generated and ranked rapidly according to the value-ease principle and preliminary modelling. Those potential solutions which appear most likely to succeed are then modelled in detail before a fuller economic analysis is undertaken, a recommendation arrived at, and final optimizations made. &#xD;
The framework was validated with a case study of the Diavik Diamond Mine. Diavik has been an underground operation since 2012 and has a mine life of only 13 years. With less than eight years remaining the mine will go through some fundamental milestones, including the opening of two new mining blocks in one orebody, and closing of two other orebodies currently in production. A single orebody will be left in operation for the final three years of mine life. A significant change to the ventilation system will be required to support these transitions to the final configuration. The proposed framework was successfully utilized to select the optimal project scope to meet the ventilation requirements of the life-of-mine plan.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Queen’s Reactor Material Testing Laboratory uses proton irradiation to simulate the damage induced in a material from neutrons, within a nuclear reactor environment. Inconel X-750 is a 70wt% Ni superalloy, used for the spacer material in the CANDU® reactor. In this work, 99.4% Ni is irradiated to 0.1dpa, with 6MeV protons, at an average temperature of 120oC using the Proton Irradiation Sample Holder. The motivation for this work was to distinguish between damage mechanisms versus phase transformation effects that are exhibited in X-750 from γ’ precipitates and disordered phases. Cross-sectional nano-indentation showed an increase in hardness with increasing dpa from proton irradiation. The Nix-Gao (NG) model, a strain gradient plasticity model, was applied to Indentation Size Effect (ISE) experimentation. A bi-linear trend was observed in the NG model for both the irradiated and unirradiated material.  The increase in hardness, in the micro-scale regime, was measured to be 558.3±138.1MPa and using the Busby relationship the increase in the shear yield strength was measured to be 171.4±42.2MPa. TEM characterization identified three types of irradiation induced defects: 1/3&lt;111&gt; Frank Loops, ½&lt;110&gt; Perfect loops and SFTs, with a mean loop size of 7.20, 11.50 and 3.02nm, respectively. The total defect density was measured to be 3.1∙1022m-3, with 24.3% consisting of SFTs, 49.5% and 26.2% consisting of Frank Loops and Perfect Loops respectively. Using the hardening contributions of various microstructural features proposed by G.E Lucas, obstacle barrier hardening models and the super-position principle, the increase in shear tensile strength was calculated. The Bacon-Kocks-Scattergood model yielded a value of 169.8±25.8MPa, which directly agrees with the experimentally measured value. It is proposed that irradiation induced defects result in a smaller ISE, bi-linear transition at a shallower depth and a larger density of geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) to accommodate an indentation of specific depth, shallower than 500nm. The Ma and Clarke model and independent SEM/EBSD analysis provide evidence for a larger GND density in an irradiated material compared to an unirradiated material. It is believed that irradiation induced defects reduced the size of plastic deformation from an indentation and produced larger elastic recovery.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability to express a gene of interest in a directed place, time and at a certain level can be achieved by the use of gene expression control tools. The UAS/GAL4 system is by far the most widely used tool in Drosophila with a collection of thousands of GAL4 drivers available. Despite the system’s vast applications, the UAS/GAL4 system does not allow for temporal control of gene expression. A major focus of many fly geneticists has been to create a new system by generating new transgenes based on entirely different transcriptional regulators. However, it is much more convenient to take advantage of the existing UAS and/or GAL4 lines, many of which have previously been spatially and temporally characterized through adult life. Two new inducible GAL4-based gene expression systems were generated: the tetracycline inducible (Tet- Off) GAL80 transgenes and the lactose (Lac) Inducible UAS/GAL4 system.&#xD;
The Tet-Off GAL80 transgenes were designed to express GAL80 under the control of a Tet-Off promoter to regulate GAL4 activity. Two versions of the transgene were generated each with a unique ubiquitous promoter that drives expression of tTA. After exhaustively examining the repressive ability of this GAL80 system it was found that the best repression was achieved in genotypes with four copies and both versions of the transgene. Induction was observed in tetracycline treated animals but was found to be dependent on sex, age, and the anatomical location of transcription and translation. The repressive ability of GAL80 was also affected by age which would limit its use to regulate expression in adult animals.&#xD;
The Lac Inducible UAS/GAL4 System was designed to regulate the UAS promoter by incorporating lac operator (LacO) sequences to which LacI could bind and repress UAS transcriptional activity. Two different versions of the modified LacO-UAS were built previously containing 2 or 3 operators, pHN1 and pHN4. The influence of the addition of the lac operators was studied and found to negatively affect UAS transcriptional activity during adulthood, independent of LacI.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Digital games struggle to blend compelling narrative with interactivity. For example, computer role-playing games allow players the freedom to explore an open world, yet limit their interaction with the world’s inhabitants to selecting from pre-determined dialogue choices. This constrains players’ interactions and the game’s narrative to those conceived in advance by the game’s designers. We show how game orchestration enables a human to play the role of non-player characters, expanding interactive narrative through truly open-ended conversation. This idea is concretely realized in the novel game Persiflage. Through a study of five groups playing the game, we show how players and orchestrator converse, interact, and play using natural language. Players engage deeply in the game’s story, but do not adhere rigidly to the game’s setting, liberally employing slang and anachronistic references. Orchestrators accommodate the players but themselves play truer to the game’s setting, leading to asymmetric dialogue. Groups exhibited a range of dominance structures that affect the fluidity of the gameplay. Players and orchestrators use open ended conversations to collaboratively construct a narrative that emerges through gameplay. Orchestrators take the lead in authoring the story by preparing the game world for the players to explore. As the game progresses players make contributions and authorial control shifts between players and orchestrators. We show that orchestrated computer roleplaying games are an enjoyable outlet for players to exercise their creativity and that interesting and complex narratives can emerge from their play.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Influenza is an infectious disease. Its seasonality is commonly modeled focusing on the yearly cycle. The log transform of pneumonia and influenza mortality data from the United States from 1910 to 2015 showed an approximate 30 year recurring pattern. The data were analyzed in the time domain and then in the frequency domain using the multitaper spectrum estimation method. Significant frequencies were identified using the F-test and confirmed by the presence of distinct square peaks in the spectrum plot. This monthly sampled data identified long-term trends at 136 year, 14 year, 11 year and 7.5 year periods as well as high frequencies of 2, 3, 4 and 5 c/y. These intriguing results led to the analysis of influenza incidence data from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan. Simulated data was generated from a susceptible-infected epidemiological model with the contact rate of influenza transmission set to a one-year period. It was also modified to include multiple periodic terms that were identified as significant in the collected datasets. After comparing the spectral results of the collected and simulated data, similarities were easier to notice and interpret. Spectral analysis identifies frequencies that contribute to the variations in the data.  These frequencies could have individual biological significance and/or aid in the attempt to represent the data that are non-sinusoidal by summing their sinusoids.  The high frequencies are most likely harmonics of the yearly cycle, where 2, 8 and 9 c/y are recommended to be considered in inclusion in multi-term periodic models. Simulations presented the opportunity to compare the effect of sampling rates and data length on the spectral results. It is recommended to use weekly sampled data of at least 30 years. The results from investigating influenza morbidity and mortality data in the frequency domain aid to better understand the patterns of the data, which can be used to improve forecasting of influenza data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives that offer a multitude of features in a small form factor. Users store sensitive personal information on their phones and perform financial transactions. Moreover, people use their personal phones to access corporate/government resources and vice versa. We perform tasks on smartphones that require multiple security models to execute the tasks securely. However, most smartphone operating systems need to focus on the usability which compromises security. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents a security framework for smartphone operating systems. The core idea of the framework resembles the security of a modern smart city. The operating system acts as the government of the city and the applications are the citizens. It has components to protect resources and perform policing (monitor, detect, and control). There are multiple application zones with different security constraints. Smartphones with this framework automatically switch to a different security mode based on the detected context to satisfy the security requirements in different use cases. Installed applications are monitored to identify anomalous behavior as well as certain specific malicious behavior like click-fraud. The operation of the framework is mostly automated and requires no input from users for default operations. We implement a significant portion of the framework for Android and our experiments suggest that the framework improves the overall security of Android increasing its ability to protect user resources as well as to detect and control malware.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I use food recalls—the removal from the market of food that violates laws or standardsas a lens to understand how efforts to secure the Canadian food system and Canadian consumers more broadly intersect with the limits of human control. I draw on the related concepts of biopolitics, biosecurity, and risk, as a frame for critically examining the imbroglio that constitutes the simultaneous control of microbial life on the one hand, and the enriching of human life on the other. Data come from interviews with 22 key informants; documentary analysis of Canadian government and industry documents publicly available or obtained through Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) requests; and attendance at a conference on food safety. This dissertation is comprised of three core studies. The first study uses microbiological end-product testing of food as a lens through which to better understand how (scientific) indeterminacy is managed in the food industry and in the context of regulatory enforcement. The second study situates food safety and food recalls as a site in which to better understand the challenge that entanglements of human and nonhuman pose to the security of the food system. From this foundation, I provide a critique of conventional notions of the Anthropocene in which I re-characterize the Anthropocene as a moment of indeterminacy and asymmetry rather than of profound human control and domination. The third study develops a conceptual map of the reverse supply chain (RSC; the processes and actors involved in handling recalled products) for recalled food. The RSC is synthesized with concepts of divestment and conduits from the interdisciplinary discard studies literature as a foundation to better understand the challenges to biosecurity and biopolitics that a move towards closed loop (reverse) supply chains may engender. Taken together, I suggest that the foodborne hazards we confront are often beyond human knowledge; the unknownunknowns associated with, and immanent in technoscientific intervention, microbiological abundance, and the complex sociomaterial entanglements of life and living. In these ways, and with respect to how recalled food is divested, the biopolitics and the biopolitical governance of food are inextricable from environmental considerations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of preventable developmental disability among Canadians, affecting at least 1% of the population. Diagnosis of FASD requires collaboration from a multidisciplinary team and can be a lengthy process frequently involving long wait times. Our objective was to conduct a validation study to confirm the ability of eye tracking to efficiently and objectively identify children with FASD. In the validation study, 32 children with an FASD diagnosis and 25 typically developing control children completed three eye-tracking tasks, measuring automatic and voluntary eye movement responses, spatial working memory and visuospatial skills. Data previously collected (105 typically developing control children and 68 children with FASD) was analyzed using the same automated program, and used as the training data for the classifier. Features extracted from the eye movement control tasks were used as input to test an extreme learning machine model’s ability to accurately classify children into their respective groups. Children with FASD exhibited significant differences in eye movement performance in each of the three eye-tracking tasks, including end point error, percentage of direction errors, percentage of trials with step saccades, and overall accuracy. Classification of the validation cohort participants (FASD and control) was fairly high, producing a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 88%, and an overall accuracy of 79%. Features recognized as important for distinguishing between the control and FASD groups were similar or related to features that were shown to differ significantly between groups. These results support the notion that eye-tracking provides information about differences in brain function between clinical and control groups that can be used to train computational models to classify participant groups with a fairly high degree of accuracy. Measuring eye movement behaviours can help identify brain dysfunction due to prenatal alcohol exposure, providing insight into potential functional biomarkers of FASD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the design of advanced downconversion mixers in CMOS RF integrated circuits. First, a novel switched transconductor mixer with low power,  low noise, and ultra-wide bandwidth is proposed. The transconductor stage with fixed DC operating point is switched by the ac-coupled local oscillator (LO) signal to realize the mixing so that a decade bandwidth is achieved with power-efficient LO buffer. The proposed mixer topology is investigated thoroughly with its bandwidth analysis, design process and a performance comparison to the traditional switched transconductor mixer is provided. The measurement results of the mixer demonstrate a 15.5 – 17.5 dB gain and a 4 –5.2 dB noise figure over 1 – 10 GHz, and the power consumption is only 8.3 mW from a 1.2 V supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since a wideband mixer usually requires exceptional linearity to resist large in/out-of-band blockers, a novel feedforward linearization technique for the active mixer is presented. As it generates the low-frequency IM3 for the cancellation fully in the IF band, the technique can bring third-order input intercept point (IIP3) of the mixer that is robust against parasitic parameters and process variations. Furthermore, this method can be applied to any active mixers regardless of its circuit topology. The measurement results of a Gilbert cell mixer with this method applied has shown a 12.5 dB IIP3 improvement at cost of 4-mA current from 1.2 V supply. The adoption of this method does not introduce noticeable noise and&#xD;
gain degradation to the mixer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Last, but not the least, a low-power, wideband, Gilbert-cell-based mixer with an on-chip balun is also presented. The mixer adopts a folded structure with its transconductor and the switching stages coupled with an on-chip, multifilament-transformer-based balun. With this balun integrated, the single-ended-to-differential conversion is realized within the mixer&#xD;
block. For the first time, the double-tuned resonator is utilized to expand the bandwidth of the mixer. The measurement results demonstrate a gain of 13.5 dB over 4 to 10 GHz, with amplitude and phase imbalances limited to only 0.9 dB and  2 over the whole band.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Water quality degradation, in the form of undesirable algae, occurs near the Nottawasaga River mouth and along Wasaga Beach, located in southeastern Georgian Bay, Ontario. Runoff from fertilized agricultural areas, in the Nottawasaga River basin, is major source of nutrients (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)) entering Nottawasaga Bay through the river, which stimulate the growth of excessive phytoplankton along Wasaga Beach. &#xD;
Coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and ecological models ELCOM – CAEDYM (ELCD) were applied to investigate (i) the advection and dispersion of a passive tracer, flowing from the Nottawasaga River, to examine the physical processes that can trap nutrients along Wasaga Beach and (ii) the difference, in model results, between using literature and observed values for P fractions and phytoplankton community distributions in Nottawasaga Bay. Model hydrodynamics were comprehensively validated against temperature and current profiles collected during May-September, 2015, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) between 1.5 oC to 2.5 oC and ~0.06 m/s, respectively.  For an average river discharge rate of 17.6 m3/s, the tracer concentration and occurrence were dominated either by wind speeds &gt;2 m/s or by river discharge for wind speeds &lt; 2 m/s. Hydrodynamics also controlled the distribution of total chlorophyll-a (TChl-a) in Nottawasaga Bay. After model initialization, the initial condition predominated, until an upwelling event in northern Nottawasaga Bay propagated along Wasaga Beach. This caused a sudden drop in the simulated TChl-a and the model to reset from the lake initial conditions. Thereafter, Nottawasaga River inputs, trapped nearshore, regulated Wasaga Beach water quality. &#xD;
The simulations did not show much discrepancy between using constant literature and observed values for phytoplankton community initial and boundary conditions in Nottawasaga Bay, where calculated RMSE were ~1.2 g chl-a/L. However, there was a noticeable influence in including particulate inorganic P as a measured P fraction on simulated TChl-a (RMSE = 1.06 mg chl-a/L). Neglecting PIP in the total P budget, as is commonly done in model applications, resulted in all particulate organic P (POP), from the Nottawasaga River, being available for uptake by phytoplankton, causing spurious algal growth in the P limited system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Quality of care includes both technical and non-technical elements of care (personal care). We previously developed a questionnaire to assess the quality of personal care in prostate cancer radiotherapy. The objectives of this thesis were: 1) to determine which elements of personal care were most important to patients; 2) to develop a method of integrating ratings of importance and ratings of quality to identify elements of care that should become targets for quality improvement; 3) to describe the quality of personal care and identify the elements of care that should be targeted for quality improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: We surveyed 108 patients undergoing radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Patients completed a self-administered questionnaire and rated both the importance and the quality of their care for each of the 143 elements. The importance and the quality of each element was measured by the percentage of respondents who rated it “very important” and “very good”, respectively.  Different methods for identifying elements to target for quality improvement were developed and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The percentage of elements rated “very important” and “very good” varied from patient to patient. Aspects of care deemed important to most patients were: the perceived competence of their caregivers, the empathy and respectfulness of their caregivers, and the adequacy of information sharing. Patients assigned their lowest quality ratings to elements relating to the treatment environment and comprehensiveness of services, but they also rated these elements as relatively unimportant. We developed three methods of identifying priorities for quality improvement and found that incorporating importance ratings with quality ratings identified different priorities than quality ratings alone. One method was theoretically superior since the ratings for importance and quality were linked for each individual. Elements of care relating to communication of information about the disease and its treatment were identified as the highest priorities for improvement. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: We have developed indicators for measuring the quality of personal care in prostate cancer radiotherapy. We have shown that it is possible to measure the quality of personal care in routine practice and we developed a method for identifying priorities for quality improvement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Cisco (Coregonus artedi) is a cold-water planktivorous fish species that has undergone significant declines within Lake Ontario as a result of over-exploitation and other anthropogenic impacts. The goal of this project was to expand upon the current scientific knowledge base for Cisco within Eastern Lake Ontario [ELO] by providing an up-to-date assessment of the current status of this population. This thesis focusses on two distinct topics, each related to a distinct natural history characteristic of the ELO Cisco population that could represent a factor limiting population recovery in this region: fisheries-induced alterations to life-history traits, and fluctuations in year-class strength. In order to identify whether fisheries-induced change has occurred in this population, I compared the size-at-age and maturation of the ELO population both before [1926-1928] and after [1992-2016] the collapse of the fishery. The modern population had larger body sizes at a given age compared to the historical group, as well as a lower age-at-maturity [size-at-maturity remained similar]. It appears as though Cisco within the historical population may have been experiencing fisheries-induced selection in size-at-age, with potential recovery of this trait occurring in the modern population after a reduction in fishing pressure. This suggests that Cisco have a high capacity for adaptation through either phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary change. To assess patterns in year-class strength [YCS] within the ELO population, I used a residual catch-curve method to first calculate relative YCS, and then used linear models to correlate any fluctuations in YCS with environmental variables [temperature, ice cover, wind velocity]. The ELO population of Cisco demonstrated high variability in YCS, and only the timing of first consistent ice cover appeared to be correlated with these fluctuations. The environmental conditions influencing YCS in Lake Ontario may be different from those acting in other Great Lakes, highlighting the importance of local assessment. Advancing our knowledge of Cisco life-history within Lake Ontario provides important insights into the current condition of this population, which could have potential implications for future rehabilitation in this region.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>DC to AC power conversion is a key technology in the modern set-up of generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electric power. Among the various schemes of prevalent inverters, the multi-level inverters have been innovated as necessary cost-benefit DC to AC devices with a wide range of applications. They have been in the focus for decades because of interesting features, such as high-quality output voltage, operation in high voltage/power, low stress on switches, etc. &#xD;
While the conventional multi-level inverter topologies have proven to be a viable alternative in a wide range of high-power medium-voltage/high-voltage applications, there has been an active interest in the evolution of newer topologies. Reduction in overall part count as compared to the conventional topologies has been an important objective. In this thesis, two novel five-level inverter topologies with reduced number of active switches are proposed, which are called the Six-Switch Five-Level Active-Neutral-Point-Clamped (6S-5L-ANPC) and the Seven-Switch Five-Level Active-Neutral-Point-Clamped (7S-5L-ANPC) inverters respectively. As compared with the conventional eight-switch (8S) 5L-ANPC inverters, the 6S-5L-ANPC reduces two active switches. The 7S-5L-ANPC inverter aims to solve the flying-capacitor voltage drop problem of the 6S-5L-ANPC inverter operating in reactive power condition.&#xD;
The operating principles of two novel topologies are presented. The loss comparison results between the 6S-5L-ANPC/7S-5L-ANPC and the conventional 8S-5L-ANPC inverters show the proposed topologies can achieve the same performance as the conventional 8S-5L-ANPC inverters in high power applications with the reduction of active switches. &#xD;
In addition, a new DC-link capacitor voltages balancing technique for 5L-ANPC inverters is proposed to achieve better dynamic response and no flying-capacitor voltage ripples in steady state over the conventional method. The proposed DC capacitor voltages balancing method can be applied to all 5L-ANPC inverters.&#xD;
Finally, three different hybrid modulation methods are proposed to reduce or eliminate the flying-capacitor voltage drop of the 6S-5L-ANPC inverter under reactive power operation. Simulation models and experimental prototypes are developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed topologies, DC capacitor voltages balancing strategy and hybrid modulation methods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, a deeper understanding of the theory of cyclostationary processes is sought. Conventional spectrum estimation techniques assume that the data is a realization of a stationary process. If the data&#xD;
is cyclostationary, standard methodology, which assumes stationarity and so autocovariances that are unchanging over time, may lead to poor data analysis. &#xD;
&#xD;
A contribution of this thesis is the development, testing and comparison of three proposed statistical tests for the presence of cyclostationarity in time series data. Moreover, it is hypothesized here that interplanetary magnetic field data collected at ACE is almost-cyclostationary and this thesis aims to determine a set of low-frequency periodic components of its autocorrelation function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project synthesizes 11 resources aimed at supporting student with learning disabilities (LDs) transition from secondary to postsecondary education.  Despite the increased access to postsecondary education for individuals with disabilities, students with LDs are not graduating at the same rate as their peers without LD. As a result, students with LDs may require a higher level of support in order to manage their disability against the postsecondary expectations. The review of the literature reveals systemic, attitudinal and disability-related barriers that negatively impact students’ abilities to transition from an environment with school and family supports, to that of individual responsibility. &#xD;
While there are existing resources for this population, students with LDs may struggle to locate specific tools as they exist in isolation or may be found in a larger, less accessible resource. The format of this project was purposefully designed to connect areas of concern with relevant resources. This approach offers the reader a practical opportunity to identify specific tools or awareness-building resources pertinent to their individual concerns. &#xD;
Ultimately, this project serves as a way of validating that students’ struggles are a direct result of disability and academic preparation. The belief is that students can improve their coping strategies and compensate with appropriate services and tools. This project intends to help students navigate the transition between two very different systems, with differing expectations and supports.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid transformation taking place in lighting technology, light-emitting diode (LED) becomes the new promising light source for the future world. In the recent years, indoor application becomes the new battlefield for the industry, so higher price-performance ratio is the key in today and future LED lighting applications. This thesis comprises of a comprehensive overview of the latest technologies in LED lighting and presents several novel techniques to significantly improve the overall performance for indoor dimmable LED systems. More importantly, all the proposed novel technologies can be practically implemented with very high reliability and low cost.&#xD;
The first contribution is a topology and control innovation for indoor dimmable lighting applications. The proposed LED driver delivers a high quality constant current (CC) output for LED driving and another constant voltage (CV) auxiliary output simultaneously for the use of active cooling, digital lighting controller, etc. To decouple the two outputs and avoid the loading interaction, a novel nonlinear ramp control scheme is proposed, resulting in significant overall system cost saving. &#xD;
Secondly, a new adjustable off-time power factor correction (PFC) control method is proposed for a low power dimmable single stage Flyback LED driver to achieve high power factor (PF, &gt;0.90) and low total harmonic distortion (THD, &lt;20%) even down to half load condition for universal AC input (120V~277Vac). It has several unique advantages, such as: 1) wider LED output operating window; and 2) high accuracy of current control in deep dimming application. &#xD;
The third contribution is the modeling of the cascode switching Flyback converter for fast startup in deeply dimmed phase-cut LED driver. The structure’s inherent instability issue is modeled and analyzed quantitatively. Three solutions are proposed to stabilize the structure and suppress the unstable voltage oscillation.&#xD;
The final contribution is the conducted common mode (CM) noise path modeling and EMI reduction method for two-wire input LED lighting system. The model demonstrates 1) the potential resonance issue caused by the CM inductor and the parasitic capacitors in the system; 2) the impact of modeled design elements on EMI result; and 3) the harmful parasitic coupling paths using Miller Theorem.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this research, a methodology and computational tool that solves multi-material topology optimization problems while also optimizing the quantity and type of joints between dissimilar materials was developed. Multi-material topology optimization is a design optimization technique that can determine the optimal distribution of multiple materials within a domain and is typically used to create lightweight designs superior to those created by conventional single-material topology optimization. The usefulness of the technique is limited, however, since all current approaches for multi-material topology optimization assume that all materials are perfectly fused together as a single piece. Since the ideal geometry of a real-world, multi-material design is mutually dependent on the configuration of joints, it follows that current approaches are insufficient for creating practical multi-material designs.&#xD;
The presented methodology uses a novel decomposition approach to determine both the optimal geometry of a multi-material design as well as the optimal joint design along the interfaces. By decomposing the problem into two simpler subproblems that are solved iteratively, gradient-based optimization techniques can be used, facilitating the solution of large problems that cannot be considered by combinatorial approaches including genetic algorithms. Since the joining interfaces are interpreted directly from multi-material topology optimization results, the shape of the interfaces and the quantity of joints connecting dissimilar materials do not need to be defined by the user a priori. By changing the design variable definition in each subproblem, the computational tool is able to solve both subproblems using the same finite element model provided by the user. Once optimization begins, all model preparation tasks are completed automatically by the tool and no further input is needed from the user.&#xD;
The methodology and computational tool were verified with three numerical examples. In each example, the tool optimized the geometry of a multi-material design to maximize stiffness while also minimizing the cost of required joints. This study was the first of its kind to not only consider and optimize joints in multi-material topology optimization, but was also the first study to consider multiple types of joints in a joining optimization process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many standard methods of time series analysis assume that observation times are both known and regularly-spaced. Regular sampling and known observation times are cornerstones of methods such as autoregressive/moving-average models and spectral estimation using the Fast Fourier Transform. When the measurement process is controlled by the experimenter, these assumptions can be largely met by design. However, there are cases in which the measurement process is not under complete experimental control, and the observation times are either irregular or unknown. For example, many data sets in astronomy have irregular sampling due to the effects of orbital geometry and interfering &#xD;
processes such as celestial bodies or atmospheric processes. &#xD;
In paleoclimate studies, time series data may consist of core samples of known depth, but unknown age. Extending common time series analysis methods to these types of data is a challenge. This thesis makes three key contributions. &#xD;
The first is a new Bayesian method for inferring the chronology -- or age versus depth relationship -- of a core taken from a sedimentary record. The second is an approximate multitaper statistic (mtLS) for irregularly sampled time series.&#xD;
The third is a Bayesian model for the spectrum inspired by the previous work of Mann and Lees (1996) and Thomson et al. (2001), who separate the spectrum into noise and signal components. Together, the three contributions are used for spectral inference of time series obtained from one peat core and three lake cores. The approach quantifies and includes uncertainty from both the chronology and the time series process. In addition, the application of the mtLS statistic as an estimator for the spectrum of an irregularly sampled time series in astronomy is presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the ectopic presence of hormonally-responsive endometrial epithelial glands and stroma in the pelvic cavity. Theorized to arise from the phenomenon of retrograde menstruation whereby menstrual tissue is refluxed into the peritoneal cavity through the fallopian tubes, the pathogenesis of endometriosis is not only characterized by peritoneal inflammation, but its development has also been linked to abnormal immune system response that is unable to clear away menstrual debris in the pelvic cavity. Numerous studies have shown elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and abnormally activated immune cells in the peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood of women with endometriosis. However, a comprehensive overview of immune dysfunction and inflammation in women with endometriosis is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a targeted transcriptomic profiling on the molecular pathways of inflammation and immune cell signaling to uncover pathways associated to endometriosis pathogenesis. We hypothesized that genes encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell activation will be abnormally expressed in patient tissue samples compared to controls. We report that indeed, genes involved in inflammation and immune cell signaling are aberrantly expressed in women with endometriosis. Further, we explored the potential involvement of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. In diseases with chronic inflammation, IL-17A is known to exacerbate disease progression by promoting inflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil recruitment via the production of IL-6, IL-8, GRO-α, and G-CSF. We hypothesized that IL-17A will also exacerbate endometriosis development by promoting local inflammation. We found increased concentration of IL-17A in plasma of women with disease. It can also promote inflammatory cytokines (G-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8) in vitro. In mouse model of endometriosis, intraperitoneal injection of IL-17A did not promote proliferation of vascularization of lesions compared to controls. We also observed increased G-CSF and CD11b+Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes in mice treated with IL-17A. As a whole, we demonstrate how eutopic endometrium and ectopic endometriotic lesions are molecularly distinct entities compared to fertile endometrium. Further, we provide novel findings on the contribution of IL-17A in peritoneal inflammation, macrophage infiltration and polarization using mouse model of endometriosis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>New reimagined higher education classrooms called Active Learning Classrooms (ALCs) have been increasingly implemented across the world in the past decade (SCALE-UP Site, 2011), providing a more engaging and lively learning environment for students as compared to traditional lecture halls (Baepler, Brooks, &amp; Walker, 2014; Chiu &amp; Cheng, 2017; Morrone, Ouimet, Siering, &amp; Arthur, 2014), but are these experiences meaningful? In studies by Chen, Leger, and Riel (2015a) and Ravenscroft and Chen (2017), instructors and students have hinted that these rooms allow students to make connections between their learning and planned careers, in other words Authentic Learning could be occurring. This could mean that ALCs may not be only engaging learning environments but also authentic learning environments. &#xD;
Building on the existing literature of ALCs and theories on Authentic Learning presented in Chapter 1 and 2, this dissertation uses a qualitative approach to capture, retell, and analyze the learning experiences of an instructor and 10 students in a 3rd year elective ethics course. Three research questions are addressed: (1) From the instructor’s perspective, what reasons lead to a decision to teach in an ALCs and how was a course planned and enacted in this classroom environment? (2) From the students’ perspectives, what are their learning experiences in a course taught in an ALCs? (3) Do the learning experiences in an ALCs represent Authentic Learning? If so, what influence does the learning environment have on Authentic Learning?&#xD;
Data was collected through semi-structured interviews, observations, and student artifacts, and analyzed using analysis of narrative and a combination of deductive analyses (see Chapter 3). Chapter 4 presents the instructor and students’ lived experiences in a series of cases, followed by a comparison of the data to factors of the Theory of Authentic Learning (Hill, in-press) in Chapter 5, which revealed the learning experiences of students in the course were indeed authentic. Chapter 6 concludes the dissertation with implications of the findings and recommendations for educators on how they too can foster an authentic learning environment in the ALCs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study is to investigate and identify the best financial assurance payment mechanism for mine rehabilitation in Malaysia, and to make recommendations for a practical system to be used in the Malaysian small scale mining industry. Financial assurance is a requirement for potential miners to demonstrate that they have the resources for any environmental damage correction that may be caused by their operation. Currently, the Malaysian Government has imposed on every mining company a certain fee for payment to a common rehabilitation fund in every state that already has adopted the State Mineral Enactment. This common fund is meant for rehabilitation of small scale mines. However, there is no detail or standard mechanism on how payments should be made to the fund. This thesis first examines the types of financial assurance used in four selected countries which are Canada, the USA, Australia and Ghana, reviews some of the common forms of payment currently used in these countries and presents the results. Based on the findings in this recent literature review, several criteria for establishing a rehabilitation fund and a method of collecting the fund were tested and weighted, in order to get the best method that is suitable for the Malaysian mining environment. The methods that have been tested were Upfront Full Payment, Upfront Partial Payment, Pay As You Go and No System. The results show that the Pay As You Go system scores the highest among the other methods that were tested. The Pay As You Go method is the recommended method for companies that operate small scale mines as it will not significantly harm marginal small businesses which operate on short term mining leases. These companies will deposit their payments into the funds as land disturbances increase after the mining production has started. The funds collected from this system will protect the government from liabilities, and at the same time encourage progressive land rehabilitation by the mine operators. The researcher recommended the Pay As You Go system as the best system to be applied for the mine rehabilitation fund in Malaysia.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Water ice is prevalent in many environments, from the surface and atmosphere of Earth to molecular clouds in the interstellar medium. High energy photons initiate photoreactions via excitation of water or contaminant species within these environments. This thesis describes increasingly sophisticated Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations applied to investigate photodynamics in amorphous solid water (ASW), ice XI, and ice Ih. Additionally, results from a velocity map imaging apparatus, which has been augmented for the study of low temperature solid samples, are presented. Specifically, preliminary results for NO2:Ar photodissociation are shown.&#xD;
In the MD simulations, dynamics of the primary photodissociation products - H and OH - are followed until they desorb, recombine, or are trapped in the ice matrix. Photoexcitation is described using ground   and excited   ab initio potential energy surfaces for H2O. Additionally, the impact of including flexible water models, zero point energy consistent vibrational motion, and a secondary reaction (formation of H3O) is discussed. &#xD;
Overall, OH radicals are much less mobile than H.  For this reason, OH desorption is rare and OH typically traps very close to the photoexcitation location. In contrast, H usually travels past several water molecules, to settle between hexagonal rings of water molecules present in crystalline ice. H atom desorption is frequent and occurs with a kinetic energy distribution reflective of surface H atoms which leave the matrix with little to no collisions. Excitation deeper in the ice leads to a broadened kinetic energy distribution which favors lower energies. Inclusion of H3O formation leads to H exchange reactions and slowed H and OH dynamics. H3O formation is thought to be a source of H2, but the ice structure prevents H approaching H2O along the reaction coordinate. H2 is not formed in the simulations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ever-present drive for increasingly high-performance designs realized on shorter timelines has fostered the need for computational design generation tools such as topology optimization. However, topology optimization has always posed the challenge of generating difficult, if not impossible to manufacture designs. The recent proliferation of additive manufacturing technologies provides a solution to this challenge. The integration of these technologies undoubtedly has the potential for significant impact in the world of mechanical design and engineering.&#xD;
This work presents a new methodology which mathematically considers additive manufacturing build time and cost alongside the structural performance of a component during the topology optimization procedure. Three geometric factors are found which have influence on the additive manufacturing build time and cost: total surface area, total overhung supported area, and total support structure volume. An innovative methodology to approximate each of these factors dynamically during the topology optimization procedure is presented. The methodology, based largely on the use of spatial density gradients, is developed in such a way that it does not leverage the finite element discretization scheme. This is done in order to overcome some of the shortcomings of the methods in the existing literature. Moreover, it investigates a problem which has not yet been explored in the literature: direct minimization of support material volume in density-based topology optimization. The entire methodology is formulated in a smooth and differentiable manner, and the sensitivity expressions required by gradient based optimization solvers are derived. In two numerical examples, minimization of compliance and total surface area was performed, and reduced build time by an average of 13% over minimization of compliance alone. For the same two numerical examples, minimization of compliance and support volume was performed. Support volume was reduced by an average of 40%, and build time by 25%, but came at the cost of increased compliance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research thesis follows up on research conducted by Nathan Medeiros in 2005 that studied planning for creativity in Winnipeg’s Exchange District. The thesis is guided by two research questions “What policies and planning approaches have supported the development of creative industries in Winnipeg’s Exchange District?” and, “In particular, what policies and planning approaches support the creative entrepreneurs and workers that live and work there? These research questions are translated into two objectives: (1) compare changes in the Exchange District since 2005, and (2) make policy recommendations for the City of Winnipeg especially on how to attract and retain creative entrepreneurs and workers that live and work in the Exchange District. The case study includes a document analysis of planning and policy documents for Winnipeg, MB., interviews with thirteen (13) participants, and participant observations. Medeiros conducted a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of Charles Landry’s “Cycle of Urban Creativity” in relation to the Exchange District. A similar SWOT has been conducted in order to compare findings from 2005 to 2017. Three elements have been identified as contributing to the development of creative industries in the Exchange District: (1) a strong public realm; (2) internal/external networking for arts, culture, and creative industries; and, (3) support and advocacy organizations for arts, culture, and creativity. Three additional elements have been identified as equally as important, although are not present in the Exchange District: (1) connectivity to surrounding areas; (2) multilateral civic collaboration and leadership; and, (3) mixed-income and mixed-type housing and workspaces. Five recommendations for the City of Winnipeg: (1) develop and implement an affordable housing strategy for Winnipeg’s downtown; (2) incentivize heritage building redevelopment, and at the same time de-incentivize empty buildings and empty lots; (3) recognize the uniqueness of the Exchange District in official planning documents; (4) support opportunities for cross industry collaboration as well as outreach to other creative centres; and, (5) create a ‘creative spaces strategy’ for the Exchange District.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is implicated in both normal development and cancer.&#xD;
RET is expressed as two protein isoforms, RET9 and RET51, which differ in the number of their&#xD;
C-terminal amino acids. RET isoforms are activated at the cell surface in response to glial cell&#xD;
line-derived neurotropic factor ligand stimulation but the specific mechanisms of RET trafficking&#xD;
remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that interactions with the AP2 complex promote&#xD;
RET receptor internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis but that RET9 and RET51 have&#xD;
distinct internalization kinetics that may contribute to differences in their biological functions.&#xD;
We also showed that RET9 and RET51 differ in their abilities to recruit E3-ubiquitin ligase&#xD;
complexes. RET51, but not RET9, interacts with, and is ubiquitinated by CBL, which is recruited&#xD;
through interactions with the GRB2 adaptor protein. RET51 internalization was not affected by&#xD;
CBL knockout but was delayed in GRB2-depleted cells. In contrast, RET9 ubiquitination requires&#xD;
interactions with multiple adaptor proteins, including GRB10 and SHANK2, to recruit the&#xD;
NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase. We showed that NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination is required for RET9&#xD;
localization to clathrin coated pits and subsequent internalization. Our data establish differences&#xD;
in the mechanisms of RET9 and RET51 ubiquitination and internalization that may influence the&#xD;
strength and duration of RET isoform signals and cellular outputs. Finally, we investigated the&#xD;
ability of RET51 to recycling back to the plasma membrane. We observed that isoform-specific&#xD;
interactions of RET51 with GGA3 and ARF6 promote RAB11 recycling, as well as cell motility,&#xD;
migration and invasion through activation of AKT signalling. Together, our findings provide&#xD;
novel insight into the trafficking and signalling pathways of RET that may in future be targeted in&#xD;
cancer therapy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I am working to create a toolkit for teachers and contribute to the body of resources that aim to strengthen the field of teacher education and inclusion of Indigenous voices, students and content. In Canada, there are many teaching professionals who value inclusive Indigenous education, but unfortunately, due to an assortment of factors such as access to resources, funding, and professional development opportunities, they experience anxiety around these subjects, and lack the confidence to fully engage with this material (Brandon, 2002). This toolkit may provide resources that support the inclusion ofIndigenous content, and encourage the ongoing decolonization of our educational system. The first step toward decolonization is to understand colonialism, be exposed to, and stop the denial of Canada’s colonial history, and begin to embrace Indigenous ancestral knowledge (Commanda, 2016). I intend for this toolkit to be flexible, constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of Indigenous communities, pre-service teachers, and instructors. I hope that through beginning these structured dialogues, I can help the educational community to work in collaboration to carve out spaces for Indigenous voices, and advocate for true reconciliation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation deals with what I call the “visual culture of Arctic sovereignty” by attending to the political context of representations of the Arctic and Subarctic regions in Canadian modern art between 1927 and 1974.  In the years covered by this study, Canada not only witnessed a number of state-sponsored expeditions of southern-based Canadian artists to “the Far North”—defined as the area north of the sixtieth parallel—but also saw the rapid growth and development of Inuit art through the promotional and organizational efforts of the Canadian government and cultural institutions. This dissertation argues that these developments in how art was created, organized, and then later circulated to audiences were part of a larger process on the part of southern Canadians to visibly define and assert Canada’s sovereign presence in the North using art.&#xD;
&#xD;
Drawing on primary source material and a wide range of secondary literature, this dissertation examines these government-sponsored initiatives in connection with the promotion of the artists’ works, to probe the ways in which Canadian art was mobilized to establish the idea of Canada’s northern sovereignty in the public mind. It focuses on the contemporary framing of the activities that were involved in the production, circulation, and exhibition of the artworks from the artistic ventures between 1927 and 1974, to uncover how efforts toward imagining the North were based on a mutual interest among artists, cultural organizations, and the state in advancing Canadian initiatives, both culturally and politically. In tracing the complex relationships that developed between the state, artists, and various private and public interests, this dissertation provides insight into how, and why, art was used to disseminate information about the Canadian North, and how such visual constructs—ranging from works by members of the Group of Seven to Inuit art—contributed to the collective imaginings of the region as “Canadian,” both at home and abroad.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dominion scientific agriculture played a rich but often over-looked role in the historical geography of Canada, in general, and in the expansion of agricultural settler colonialism across northern North America, in particular. The development of agricultural economies was undertaken with extensive state support. The Central Experimental Farm, established at Ottawa, Ontario in 1886 and still used for its original purpose today, was a key institutional player as the primary agricultural research station of the Department of Agriculture. This thesis places the Farm in its national context through a number of interrelated case studies, divided into two informal groupings, that elucidate the different ways dominion scientific agriculture operated in Canada during the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-centuries. The first grouping is focused on plants—such as trees, hybrid wheat varieties, and wild rice/manoomin—and animals—specifically chickens—that underscore the racial, gendered, and spatial hierarchies operating within dominion scientific agriculture itself as well as across Canada at large. The second grouping builds on these cases to examine the role of information movement and time in the scientific work of Farm scientists. Through these diverse cases I underline the importance of agricultural science in advancing and helping to constitute liberal governmentality across the heterogeneous terrain of northern North America. By exploring the Farm’s centrality in scientific and colonial networks, this thesis advances our understanding of the role of agricultural and scientific knowledge and practices in the development of Canada between 1886 and 1938.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Deficits in self-regulation place young children at considerable academic and social risk. Evidence suggests that the underlying executive function skills that are the building blocks of self-regulation (i.e., working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) are malleable, and that educators can play an important role in fostering the development of self-regulation in children. The initial purpose of this study, therefore, was to identify features of teacher-student relationships, classroom activities, and routines that support the development of self-regulation in kindergarten students. Next, I explored how a collaborative professional development inquiry model, with a focus on bridging research to practice, could support kindergarten teachers’ classroom practices for fostering self-regulated learning. I also examined how such an approach contributed to teachers’ understanding and to the co-creation of knowledge about student self-regulation in the kindergarten classroom. Participants in this single case study of a collaborative inquiry team included myself as the researcher, as well as seven kindergarten teachers and five early childhood educators. Data were collected over a six-month period, through after-school meetings, classroom observations, reflective journaling, free-writing activities, an online chat group, and interviews. These data were analyzed using standard qualitative protocols. The first set of findings was presented as a set of activities that provided evidence of how research and practice were bridged in the kindergarten classroom. Using a collaborative inquiry team approach, we co-constructed knowledge by trying, testing, modifying, and embellishing games and activities intended to foster self-regulation. In the second set of findings, Expectancy-Value and Self-Determination theories of motivation served to frame the analysis. Key findings suggested that the collaborative inquiry team approach enhanced teachers’ self-efficacy and facilitated the co-creation of knowledge. Teachers were highly motivated to participate by the topic, as well as by their collective desire to collaborate with colleagues and develop classroom strategies. Teachers demonstrated extraordinary shifts in their thinking as they examined their teaching practices in light of new understandings. This study demonstrated that music, drama, and dance can offer age-appropriate and engaging activities to foster self-regulation, and that these activities afforded teachers the freedom to scaffold supports to suit the needs of their particular students.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>School principals need to develop shared visions, develop leadership skills in others, develop relationships with stakeholders, and communicate data to foster and maintain school growth. For principals to be successful in these areas, they need to understand the dimensions and domains of administrative leadership. Throughout this research, it is evident that Yukon principals value personal relationships with their school community. This focus on relationships is important in building reciprocal understanding and is supported by the broader literature as well as within the Yukon context in Yukon frameworks released by the Department of Education and the responses from Yukon Principals. Once there is a reciprocal understanding, it enables principals to engage stakeholders in communication, volunteerism, and governance. Principals also need an understanding of the leadership domains and possess a combination of the leadership skills. &#xD;
	The purpose of this research study was to examine Yukon principals’ perceptions towards cultivating and maintaining reciprocal communication, active participation, and shared governance with stakeholders for school growth. This study was guided by four research questions: (a) How do Yukon principals demonstrate reciprocal communication with stakeholders for school growth? (b) How do Yukon principals promote active participation from stakeholders for school growth? (c) How do Yukon principals share school governance with stakeholders for school growth? and (d) What policies and documents do Yukon principals use for school growth?&#xD;
	The research used a qualitative questionnaire distributed to Yukon principals to gain data in response to the research questions. Key findings from this research resulted in a total of 13 themes, about the four research questions. The themes included parallels between Yukon principals’ responses and the literature around the principal’s need to be able to develop shared visions, develop leadership skills in others, develop relationships with the stakeholders, and communicate data in order to foster and maintain school growth (Fullan, 2006, 2010; LaFee, 2002; Leithwood, 1994; Wallace Foundation, 2013). Additionally, the research extended the literature related to various place-based differences in how leadership is leveraged to promote and maintain engagement for school growth including relationships between the principal and liaison positions, Yukon First Nation Governments, and school councils.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth. From cellulose, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) can be obtained through various hydrolysis processes. There is interest in grafting different types of polymers onto CNC as their applications are limited due to their poor dispersibility in low polarity and non-polar systems. The potential versatility and value of modified CNC can be enhanced even further if the polymers used in the grafting process are CO2-responsive, including for example poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), poly(diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) and poly(diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDPAEMA), since stimuli responsive composites have shown promise in applications such as Pickering emulsifiers, water treatment and as polymer reinforcing agents. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this work, reaction conditions for the homopolymerization of dialkylaminoethyl methacrlyates (DMAEMA, DEAEMA and DPAEMA) by Cu(0) and RAFT-mediated polymerizations were determine. Cu(0)-ATRP polymerization showed a linear evolution of Mn vs. conversion and first order kinetics; however, poor livingness of the macro-initiators was observed. RAFT-mediated polymerization showed good livingness and the Mn  of exclusively the living chains of the macro-RAFT agents was determined by GPC-UV. These macro-RAFT agents were suitable to be used for the grafting-to approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
The grafting of CNC surfaces via grafting-from and grafting-to using Cu(0)-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization is also reported. For the grafting-from approach, the CNC surfaces were first chemically modified with an ATRP initiating group or a RAFT agent molecule capable of mediating the polymerization of dialkylaminoethyl methacrylates and their corresponding macro-RAFT agents. A grafting-from polymerization was then performed using the CO2 switchable monomers DEAEMA, DMAEMA and DPAEMA via SI-Cu(0)-ATRP and SI-RAFT. For the grafting-to approach, the CNC surfaces were modified with a double bond containing molecule which was then reacted with fully characterized macro-RAFT agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
All of the grafted products were found to be CO2-responsive. Products made via grafting-from were colloidally stable under CO2; whereas the products made via grafting-to were colloidally unstable under CO2, but dispersible under mildly basic conditions. It was determined that both the Mn of the polymer grafts and graft densities play an important role on grafted CNC dispersibility.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, the Ontario Government (2013) has recognized that schools have a vital role in facilitating the prevention, intervention, and awareness of student mental wellness. Increased political attention to student mental health parallels studies that have found that 68.8% of the mental health problems in Canada have their onset in childhood and adolescence (Government of Canada, 2006). Of particular concern is anxiety since almost 5% of Canadians report experiencing threshold or subthreshold levels of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Therefore, it is crucial that we find tools that can be used to promote mental wellness in anxious adolescents.&#xD;
	Stories have great cultural importance because they help us explore abstract and difficult concepts and experiences. For this reason, literature provides a rich opportunity to promote mental wellness in anxious adolescents. In my study, I looked inwards at my own experiences as an anxious adolescent for insight into how reading literature can help adolescents understand and cope with their anxiety. &#xD;
Using autoethnography and literary anthropology as the methodologies for my study, I analyzed internal (autobiographical memories and reflections) and external (personal journals, social media posts, letters, and high school assignments) data sources from my adolescence (ages 14 to 18 years) and found that my aesthetic reading responses to literature helped me understand and cope with my anxiety by building my self-compassion. This study adds to current research investigating the relationship between anxiety and self-compassion by contributing a first-person exploration of the intersections between literacy experiences, adolescent anxiety, and self-compassion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nineteenth-century Paris witnessed a proliferation of representations of prostitution, including extensive visual imagery of women of ill repute. Completed in 1896 and comprised of a cover, frontispiece and ten colour lithographs, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s Elles series observes fin-de-siècle brothel sex workers in intimate moments of daily ritual: brushing their hair, adjusting their corsets, lounging in bed. The series is outstanding in both subject matter and medium; female prostitutes are presented not in relation to their work but in private moments of solitude and Lautrec deliberately chose to illustrate these moments within the intimate pages of a print portfolio. This thesis is the first study dedicated entirely to Elles, which is often overlooked in art historical literature. Lautrec monumentalizes sex workers by treating them as subjects rather than objects, in contrast to conventional visual tropes on the topic of commercial sexuality. By contextualizing the series in relation to nineteenth-century prostitution and print culture I provide a thorough visual analysis of Elles and consider the reasoning for the album’s commercial failure. To understand the way in which Lautrec used brothel workers to present the binary notion of intimacy as both sensual and private, this study includes analysis of the rise of colour lithography and the personal viewing experience of the print portfolio; the way in which the women in Elles are captured seemingly enjoying intimate moments within the private chambers of a public brothel; the dichotomous nature of the brothel as an interior that is inherently both public and private; and bourgeois ideals of domestic interiors and the notion of collecting as a private pursuit. Lautrec’s unconventional treatment of late nineteenth-century prostitution engages interiority and intimacy and Elles’s combined medium and subject matter make it a distinctly modern body of work. Ultimately, this thesis evaluates what it means to create a print portfolio on the theme of prostitution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Our understanding of the mechanisms driving population divergence is dependent on our ability to effectively detect and interpret patterns of genetic differentiation. In natural populations, the evolutionary processes influencing genetic differentiation can be difficult to ascertain. Seabirds are highly mobile, yet often display population differentiation, suggesting intrinsic barriers to gene flow are important in driving their diversification.&#xD;
&#xD;
The northern gannet (Morus bassanus), a piscivorous, colonial seabird, is widely distributed across the North Atlantic Ocean. Despite strong dispersal abilities, decades of banding studies indicate that the North Atlantic Ocean acts as an effective barrier for migration in northern gannets. However, recent telemetry revealed that some northern gannets migrate across the ocean each year, suggesting trans-Atlantic gene flow is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
To investigate population differentiation in northern gannets, I analyzed genomic patterns of diversity among eight North American and European colonies. Genetic structure was characterized using indices of genetic differentiation, principal component analysis, a Bayesian clustering method, and discriminant analysis of principal components. I found significant population genetic structure across the breeding range, corresponding primarily to the division between North American and European gannet populations. My analyses did not find significant differentiation among colonies on either side of the Atlantic. &#xD;
&#xD;
I employed Bayesian approaches to estimate contemporary gene flow and divergence between North American and European gannet populations. I found low but significant rates of migration from Europe into North America, but no migration from North America into Europe. My analyses suggest that North American and European populations diverged recently, potentially occupying separate refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum. Finally, I used outlier analysis and random forest feature selection to investigate fine-scale genetic structure, and identified loci that allowed population assignment of 85% of sampled northern gannets. &#xD;
&#xD;
Low genetic differentiation in northern gannets may be due to shared variation following recent range expansion or to admixture resulting from overlap in nonbreeding distribution. My results suggest that the North Atlantic Ocean acts as a semi-permeable barrier to gene flow in northern gannets. The informative genetic markers I identified may allow colony-specific impact assessment and the development of targeted management strategies in northern gannets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Why Organizations Fight: Wars of Choice in an Age of Instability examines the participation of three international organizations, the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the European Union, across three wars: The War in Afghanistan, the War in Libya, and the War in Iraq. Each of these organizations have, as their mandate, crisis management and crisis response. As such, states have a number of organizational frameworks that they can select from. However, given the overlap in mandates, the organization that is chosen to lead is not necessarily a given. When an organization is selected by a state, or group of states, for a mission, that organization may find itself in a conflict zone that falls far beyond its initial scope and mandate. How did it come to be, for example, that NATO, a regional collective defence organization, would find itself fighting an insurgency in Afghanistan? Why, in spite of strong member-state preferences for an EU-led response in Libya, was NATO given the lead? And why did the United States, the preeminent military power, go to such lengths to try and secure a United Nations Security Council mandate for actions against Iraq? In asking these three questions, this dissertation is based on a much broader question: How are the roles of international organizations negotiated in large-scale international conflict? This dissertation argues that international organizations play an active role in shaping policy and outcomes on the battlefield. Although one may expect organizations to represent the interests of their membership, this is not always the case. Driven by their interest in survival, organizations must continuously demonstrate both material and political relevance. But demonstrating relevance is not always a straightforward process. Ensuring the survival of an organization requires navigating a complex security environment with a multiplicity of competing, and sometimes contradictory, interests.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study provides an analysis of Western amateur crafting as a social practice that is informed by a complex matrix of historical, social, cultural, ideological, and economic influences. A historical overview of amateur craft culture establishes how it became a practice that was axiomatic with middle-class femininity and domesticity beginning in the late-eighteenth century. A case study expands on this assessment, and situates the handicrafted material culture of the O’Keefe women – members of one of the first Anglo-Canadian families that settled in the interior of British Columbia in the 1870s – as an example of how amateur crafting, through imperial and colonial processes, became a racializing directive that marked and imposed social boundaries within Canadian settler-colonial society. The historical overview and the case study outlines amateur craft’s genealogy, which provides an understanding of how its ideological and symbolic associations with femininity, middle-class status, and whiteness frame contemporary amateur craft culture and practices. The thesis interrogates these symbolic associations which remain at the heart of contemporary craft culture and discourse through an examination of the white moralism of craftivism, a form of lifestyle activism popular among white, middle-class women where domestic crafts are utilized in service of a public expression of protest and dissent. &#xD;
&#xD;
The thesis employs a queer feminist methodology to support the investigation of amateur craft as a social practice that is inherited as a direction that keeps or places the maker in line. This methodology draws the various contexts of a person’s existence into direct consideration – how they inhabit their body and negotiate social constructs such as race and gender; the straight or queer orientation of their desire; and the meanings ascribed to the body’s size, and shape, and ability. These aspects play an integral part in determining if craft is in line with that person’s direction. This project presents an analysis of how some people are oriented toward certain forms of amateur domestic crafting based on their positionality as feminine, white, and middle-class, and how amateur domestic crafting as a practice imbued with symbolic and ideological associations with whiteness, femininity, and gentility, receives and returns this direction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stat3 is activated by cytokine receptors and non-receptor kinases and plays an etiological role in neoplasia. Stat3 activation entails phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 residue (Y705), dimerization through a reciprocal SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions, and nuclear translocation. This cascade triggers transcription of genes involved primarily in survival. Our lab recently demonstrated that engagement of cadherins, cell-cell adhesion molecules, triggers a dramatic increase in Stat3 activity, through Rac/Cdc42, IL6 and Jak.&#xD;
Full-length Stat3, termed Stat3α, has an SH2 domain, Y705 residue, and a COOH terminus containing the transcription activation domain (TAD). Stat3β is a naturally-occurring splice variant lacking the TAD. Therefore, Stat3β is defective in transcriptional activation, and competitively inhibits Stat3α signaling.&#xD;
Given the sequence identity around the critical Y705 in Stat3α and Stat3β, we initially set out to examine the phosphorylation pattern of the two isoforms in cells expressing two representative oncogenes, Simian Virus 40 Large Tumor antigen (SVLT) or activated Src (vSrc). My results demonstrate that extensive cell-cell adhesion brought about by cultured cell confluence results in phosphorylation of Stat3α preferentially. On the other hand, SVLT and vSrc expression result in a preferential phosphorylation of Stat3β, although to a much lesser extent by vSrc. The increase in Stat3β phosphorylation by SVLT could be attributed, in part, to an increase in total Stat3β protein levels, brought about through an increase in the levels of the adenine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1). In addition, β-pY705-Stat3 turnover is much slower than that of α-pY705- Stat3, leading to accumulation and increased detection.&#xD;
In any event, this increase β-pY705-Stat3 that reduces the activity of Stat3α inhibits transformation by SVLT and triggers apoptosis in transformed cells. Therefore, Stat3β is a naturally occurring variant which is able to curb transformation by oncogenes that require Stat3 function as part of their mechanism of action, a finding which could have important implications in cancer therapy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Programs, institutions, and governments are increasingly looking at data about student learning for both accountability and program improvement activities. Faculties at post-secondary institutions have employed systems to gather vast amounts of assessment data in recent years with the ultimate goal of using the data to improve the student learning experience. Unfortunately, faculty members responsible for this data are unfamiliar with analyzing data sets of this magnitude or complexity and therefore cannot extract actionable insight from the data to inform their program improvement decisions. Approaches to support this process are still developing, referred to largely as Educational Data Mining. Information Visualization is one technique that has shown promise in facilitating the extraction of meaningful information, though there has been little research conducted into where and how visualizations are utilised at a post-secondary level. The ultimate goal of this research is to build a support that encourages the usage of educational data through visualizations. To build one that is effective, a research study was conducted to discover the factors surrounding how educational data was used in this setting.&#xD;
The research was a three-phase qualitative study aimed at determining the attitudes around data usage as well as what aspects of assessment data usage are currently challenging education staff and faculty members in achieving their program improvement goals. The study included interviews, a focus group, and an open-response survey created using an emergent design methodology. Participants were from institutions in Canada, focused largely at Queen’s University. The outcome of the research findings was a model of four major stakeholders in the process of educational data usage and some of the important factors that surround the usage and the interaction between stakeholders. The resulting support tool built from this research aims to support those interactions and specifically identified challenges by bringing the principles from the broader field of information visualization into an accessible form for staff and faculty at post-secondary institutions trying to work with educational data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sympatric speciation, the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations without physical barriers to dispersal, is less likely than allopatric speciation due to the need to overcome potentially homogenizing gene flow. Cryptic species - two or more species mistakenly classified as one usually due to morphological similarity - can form in allopatry or sympatry. One potential mechanism of cryptic speciation in sympatry is allochronic speciation, i.e. divergence driven by differences in breeding time. In this thesis, I first collated examples where allochrony caused divergence between populations to glean new insights into drivers of shifts in breeding time across taxonomic groups and the genetic underpinnings involved, and to create a framework for future investigations. Using both genetic and genome-wide sequencing techniques, I then investigated drivers of cryptic divergence and the evolution of allochronic populations across the global breeding ranges of two cryptic seabird species complexes, Leach’s and band-rumped storm-petrels (Hydrobates spp.). In Leach’s storm-petrels, I found non-physical barriers to be stronger drivers of divergence than physical ones, with some genetic differentiation between ocean basins but higher differentiation among colonies in the Pacific Ocean. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that Guadalupe seasonal populations likely speciated allochronically. In band-rumped storm-petrels, colonies in different ocean basins were genetically differentiated, however phylogenomic reconstruction placed South Atlantic colonies as sister to Pacific colonies, and revealed strong genetic structuring within ocean basins, again suggesting non-physical barriers as drivers of divergence. Band-rumped storm-petrels consist of seven reciprocally monophyletic groups, and thus likely represent up to seven different species. I then investigated whether allochronic populations of band-rumped storm-petrel formed due to a mutation shifting breeding time in a founder event, standing genetic variation at the population level, or plasticity in breeding time. My findings indicate breeding season changes are unlikely to have involved a mutation and founder event, however further work is needed to tease apart the potential roles of standing variation and plasticity. Altogether, this thesis reveals the importance of non-physical barriers to gene flow in Leach’s and band-rumped storm-petrels, uncovers cryptic species needing taxonomic and conservation consideration, and furthers our knowledge of allochronic divergence, an underappreciated mechanism of cryptic diversification.</dcterms:abstract>

Uraninite co-precipitated with common Pb-bearing arsenides, sulpharsenides and sulphides. Molybdenum was mobile during primary mineralization, crystallizing within Stage 1 uraninite. Relatively high and consistent δ34S values up to 14.6‰ indicate a significant basinal and marine SO42- contribution and an open-system with a well-mixed source. Low 207Pb/206Pb values (0.56–0.86) is imprinted on co-precipitated chalcopyrite, spatially and texturally associated with Stage 1 uraninite, suggesting that the U and Cu were sourced from Archean minerals. Syn-ore calcite equilibrated with a fluid having high δ18O values between +1.8 to +7.2‰, typical of diagenetic basinal brine in the Athabasca Basin, and low δ13C values ranging from -22.4 to -21.8‰, consistent with a source from underlying graphite. &#xD;
	Stage 2 fluid incursion, constrained by U/Pb dates at 1270-1163 Ma resulted in crystallization, recrystallization and Pb absorption forming radiogenic (206Pb/204Pb ~1000) and selenite-bearing sulphides and sulpharsenides concurrent with enhanced clay alteration. Stage 3 alteration, with U/Pb and Pb/Pb dates between 947-755 Ma was responsible for extensive hematization and crystallization of anomalously radiogenic (206Pb/204Pb ~3000–20,000) bornite, chalcocite and galena. The most recent deposit alteration event, stage 4 (242-0 Ma), manifests as extensive coffinitization and re-mobilization of U as perched mineralization. The paragenetic stages coincide with major, far-field tectonic and regional geological events: (1) Stage 2 with the Grenville Orogeny, the Mackenzie dyke swarm and the Moore Lake olivine diabase, (2) Stage 3 with the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, and (3) Stage 4 with recent meteoric and glacial meltwaters.&#xD;
The paragenesis, geochronology and stable isotopes reveal a protracted history, with ongoing episodic fluid incursion, driven by far-field tectonics that resulted in alteration and re-mobilization of selected elements. Using the geometallurgical paradigm presented here, the geology at Cigar Lake can be used to optimize and reduce risk during long-term mine and mill planning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays important roles in normal development of the kidney, spermatogonia, and neuroendocrine tissues. RET is also implicated in various diseases, including tumors of the breast, prostate and thyroid. Normally, RET is activated through the formation of a tri-molecular complex involving its co-receptor, GFRα1, and its ligand, GDNF. The formation of this tri-molecular complex leads to the activation of many signaling pathways that induce cellular processes such as cell survival, differentiation and proliferation. RET is expressed in approximately 30-70% breast cancer cases. While initial work suggested that RET was associated with luminal forms of breast cancer, more recent data suggest that this receptor tyrosine kinase may be more broadly implicated with multiple subtypes of breast cancer.  Here, we  used in vitro cell-based models to further investigate the role of RET in breast cancer. Through our analysis, we found five RET-positive breast cancer cell lines, and confirmed the suitability of these models to explore the role of RET in breast cancer. Further, our data suggest that RET activation through GDNF treatment increases proliferation of most of these breast cancer cells. In a high throughput screen using a protein domain microarray dataset, a potential interaction between RET and the BCAR3 adaptor protein was previously identified. To gain a more mechanistic understanding of RET’s contribution to cancer, we characterized and explored the functional implications of RET’s interaction with the adaptor protein, BCAR3. Here, we confirm that RET and BCAR3 interact, and that it is a direct interaction between the SH2 domain of BCAR3 and RET. As we were not able to identify in our studies a suitable breast cancer cell model in which RET and BCAR3 were co-expressed, we used SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, a cell line that co-expresses RET and BCAR3, for our functional analyses. Our data suggest that BCAR3 knockdown in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells has a broad role in proliferation and adhesion, independent of RET.  Further research is required to fully elucidate the functional relevance of the RET-BCAR3 association.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Deep Geological Repository (DGR) concept is the proposed solution for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in Canada. While site selection processes are currently underway for high-level waste storage, a low and intermediate waste storage DGR is planned for development at depth in Kincardine, Ontario. The DGR site is to be hosted in the Cobourg limestone, a rock formation which presents varying heterogeneity at different scales. The successful design of long-term nuclear waste storage requires engineered barriers and geology designed to safely and securely contain contaminants. The excavation of hard rocks at depth can induce damage to the surrounding rock mass. This damage corresponds to the initiation and propagation of fractures and is related to in situ stress conditions and excavation processes. Heterogeneous rock masses can further complicate the initiation and propagation of fractures, causing inconsistent behaviour related to the variability of the rock. The changing in situ conditions of DGR host rocks can also influence fracture behaviour, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the effect of rock conditions on the damage behaviour of brittle rocks. &#xD;
	This research examines the influences of various testing conditions on the geomechanical properties of Cobourg limestone, to address the changing in situ conditions that may be present during long-term storage of nuclear waste. The effects of specimen saturation, scale, loading rate, and confinement have been investigated through the laboratory strength testing of specimens representative of Cobourg limestone found at depth for the proposed low and intermediate level DGR site. Using standardized laboratory testing practices and newly developed experimental methodologies, this thesis describes the influences of testing condition on the elastic and strength properties of the rock. The testing methodology is presented and examined to evaluate the effectiveness of the different testing conditions in properly characterizing the Cobourg limestone. The observations and results from this work provide details regarding the physical properties and failure behaviour of the rock, as well as non-standard testing techniques for investigating heterogeneous rock masses. This research provides insight into the characterization of brittle rock failure under different testing conditions, which is important for future DGR site selection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Photoswitchable surfaces can be used to reversibly control surface wettability, adsorptivity, and protein adhesion to influence cell interactions at the surface. Control over protein adsorption and cell adhesion is useful in many applications, from cell culture scaffolds to drug delivery devices and improving the cell response to materials in vivo. Switchable properties can be attained by polymerizing light-responsive monomers or by modifying existing materials. This project investigates surface modification as a method of developing light-responsive poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces and coatings of a copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate (AEM) (termed MMAcoAEM).&#xD;
&#xD;
In this work, PMMA surfaces were functionalized with amine or carboxyl groups for azobenzene modification and cell-material interaction studies. PMMA was functionalized with hexamethylenediamine (HMD) or O,O'-bis(2-aminopropyl) propylene glycol-block-polyethylene glycol-block-polypropylene glycol (PPG-PEG-PPG) groups via aminolysis or functionalized with carboxyl groups via hydrolysis. Aminated PMMA was then modified with 4-(phenylazo)benzoic acid using a carbodiimide reaction. Surfaces were characterized using ninhydrin assays, titration, contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
The aminolysis reaction conditions from literature1 were revised to improve the graft density, with up to 36.4 ± 7.0 nmol/cm2 of HMD or 20.3 ± 2.9 nmol/cm2 of PPG-PEG-PPG groups functionalized to PMMA. The copolymer MMAcoAEM contained 44.0 ± 2.2 nmol/cm2 of amine groups as a surface coating. Amine-functionalized PMMA or MMAcoAEM surfaces were modified with 20.5 ± 0.4 nmol/cm2 (HMD), 11.2 ± 2.6 nmol/cm2 (PPG-PEG-PPG), or 24.8 ± 4.4 nmol/cm2 (MMAcoAEM) of 4-(phenylazo)benzoic acid. UV-VIS spectroscopy was used to confirm that azobenzene grafted to materials retained the ability to photoisomerize and interact with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD).  &#xD;
&#xD;
Functionalized PMMA was also used to study cell-material interactions with neutrophil-like HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce cell adhesion. AlamarBlue® assays and live/dead deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) staining indicated that amine-modified surfaces contained the highest amount of extracellular DNA after incubation with HL-60s, believed to be extracellular traps (ETs). Future research aims to study the cell-material interactions with azobenzene-modified surfaces and further modify the surface using biomolecules conjugated to β-CD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Graphene is an ideal material for high quality nanoelectromechanical resonators due to its high Young's modulus, low mass to surface ratio, ability to sustain high in-plane strain, and unique electrical properties like high carrier mobility, ballistic transport and nonlinear modulation of conductance under the electric field effect. In this work, atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is employed to obtain monolayer graphene on copper. The effect of growth parameters such as gas concentration, growth temperature and growth time are studied and optimized such that predominantly monolayer graphene is obtained. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman analysis reveal the presence of high quality, monolayer graphene. The graphene is transferred to Si/SiO_{2} wafers and multiple step electron beam lithography, metal deposition, substrate etching, and critical point drying are used to fabricate suspended graphene doubly-clamped resonators. The present fabrication technique, thus combines top-down and bottom-up fabrication method and presents an important work in the development of batch-processing of large area graphene towards future industrial applications. Modeling the suspended devices as Duffing resonators near their fundamental flexural mode shows the presence of mechanical nonlinearity in response to an applied force even at moderate bias voltages. We discuss the implications of this nonlinearity for parametric amplification. Interesting parametric responses such as gain saturation and presence of multistability are obtained as a result of the complex interplay between the mechanical nonlinearities in graphene suspended resonators. As a final step, a measurement system is developed to electrostatically actuate the suspended devices and read out the motion using nonlinear mixing of graphene's electrical conductivity. The electromechanical data for one such device is analyzed to quantify the resonant frequency and quality factors of three detectable modes. Experimental data for resonance and frequency tunability of the fundamental mode illustrates the presence of mass loading and initial strain in the suspended device. The present work combining the fabrication, modeling and electromechanical measurements are important steps for the prospects of developing measurement techniques for future sensors and quantum-limited mechanical measurements of CVD-grown graphene.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, a finding that might be mechanistically linked to systemic vascular abnormalities. In fact, coexistent cardiovascular disease is a major cause of disability and death in COPD patients with only mild airflow obstruction. It remains unknown however whether these patients may present with systemic vascular dysfunction. Moreover, it remains unclear whether specific lung structural abnormalities (i.e., emphysema versus airway disease) would be associated with greater systemic vascular dysfunction. We hypothesized that patients with mild COPD, particularly those with larger emphysema burden, would present with abnormalities in systemic vascular function compared to controls. &#xD;
Methods: In an observational and prospective study, we measured central and peripheral pulse wave velocity (PWV), flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, systemic levels of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in 16 COPD patients (FEV1=8613 % predicted) and 16 age- and gender-matched sedentary controls. Emphysema and airway disease burden were quantified by chest computed tomography in patients.&#xD;
Results: Patients and controls were well-matched by comorbidities burden, including cardiovascular disease. Patients presented with greater central aortic stiffness (aPWV=9.571.39m/s versus 7.741.30m/s; p=0.002) but preserved peripheral arterial compliance (p =0.43) compared to controls. Patients had impaired shear rate-corrected FMD (- 1.86-fold; p=0.03) and delayed maximum vasodilatory response (-16.5 s; p&lt;0.01). Emphysema extent (but not airway disease) and lung transfer factor for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were significantly related to higher central arterial stiffness and both impaired and slowed flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (r values ranging from 0.50 to 0.66; p&lt;0.05). &#xD;
Conclusion: Systemic vascular dysfunction is present in patients with mild COPD, particularly in patients with greater emphysema burden and low DLCO. These patients might be at higher risk of negative cardiovascular events thereby deserving more detailed screening and closer longitudinal follow-up.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spectators routinely ascribe intention, personality, even an inner life to inanimate, contingently moving objects like puppets. Why do spectators do so? The prevailing semiotic approach is unable to bring light into this fundamental perceptual issue of puppetry. On the other hand, phenomenology and cognitive psychology are shown to be productive when it comes to tackling questions of the perceptual processes involved in contemporary puppetry. A bird’s eye view on the research areas that involve puppetry is proposed and a modified Tinbergian framework, which originates in ethology, is suggested. The research question is then situated within this framework. An overview of the scholarly works relating to puppets and the apparent missed connections between them underscores the need for a unifying framework. Detailed descriptions acquaint the reader with current works in puppetry. The works emphasize the need for tools that go beyond traditional semiotics for analyses of today’s puppetry arts. By applying a perceptual analysis, a cognitive poetics of puppetry is outlined. The assumptions of this cognitive poetics are tested against a first-hand experiential/experimental foray into the practice of puppetry. This thesis thus contributes to the emerging field of studies in puppetry arts in a threefold way: outlining the need for going beyond semiotics, suggesting a productive framework for the organization of the field, and developing a cognitive poetics approach within this newly defined framework to answer the question “How does it work?”</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>China is facing serious population aging issues because of unintended consequences of the economic reforms and social policies which began in the 1980s. Despite the remarkable progress in health status (e.g., the increasing life expectancy) in China, there remain large inequalities not only across the country, but also at a micro geographic scale. Health inequalities can be attributed to biological variations but also other variables including demographic socioeconomic and environmental indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
Research on health inequalities in western countries is robust. However, there are few comprehensive studies of health inequalities in China. This research analyses the patterns of health inequalities and the associated social determinants of health with a specific focus on Chinese older people. Mixed methods are employed to garner a nuanced perspective on health inequalities and the social determinants of health. Data are extracted from both statistical surveys and semi-structure interviews. Quantitative methods are used to analyse the relationships between health inequalities and social determinants of health at various geographic scales. An analysis of semi-structured interviews is used to inform the quantitative finding providing further depth to an understanding of health inequalities among older people living in China. &#xD;
&#xD;
Several major findings result from this research. The population aging process has a significant influence on health inequalities for older people. China exhibits a significant rural-urban developmental divide with a noticeable impact on health inequalities. Socio-economic changes have significant impacts on health inequalities in China. The relationship between better socio-economic status and better health status is similar to but different than what is found in research in developed countries because of the various types of pensions. Compared to traditional environmental factors, the built environment in which older people live plays a significant role in determining health inequalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
To sum up, a comprehensive health care system is required in order to meet sustainable development and to narrow health inequalities in China. Socio-economic, environmental and other factors make significant contributions to determine older people’s health outcomes. As China is undergoing top-down social reform, health inequalities are widening. Promoting balance among different groups of older people is a principal challenge for Chinese society.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents a novel minimalist descriptor for 3D object recognition and registration problems called 3DLD (3D line descriptors). Building off of previous work on multiple point descriptors, this thesis introduces the first descriptor to apply lines to both of these problems. Each 3DLD is based on the depth information obtained between two 3D points. An efficient indexing scheme using multiple hash maps is introduced to efficiently retrieve the descriptors. From experimentation, 3DLD are very effective in both registration and recognition problems - achieving near perfect true positive rates in many of the tests. Particularly, on complex data, with cluttered and occluded scenes, 3DLD can provide superior efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many populations are locally adapted to their environment, but across an environmental gradient, trade-offs among phenotypic traits may result in a failure to adapt. Species exist across a seasonal gradient, which can create selection for phenology, the timing of key life history events. Flowering phenology is important because flowering late exposes the plants to abiotic risks, like frost damage, whereas flowering early can lower fecundity if there is a trade-off between time to and size at flowering. This trade-off should result in different patterns of selection across a seasonal gradient, with stabilizing selection favouring intermediate flowering in long growing seasons, and selection favouring early flowering in short growing seasons. While this theory is well established, few studies have measured selection on flowering phenology across a seasonal gradient in natural populations.&#xD;
	In 2015 and 2016, I measured selection on the time to and size at flowering from 12 populations (24 site × year combinations) of the annual herb Rhinanthus minor (yellow rattle), across an elevational gradient of 900m, in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. For each site × year I quantified the growing season length measured using cumulative growing degree days (CGDD). &#xD;
&#xD;
	I predicted that 1) CGDD would vary linearly with elevation, 2) There would be selection favouring early flowering in sites with low CGDD, 3) There would be stabilizing selection for intermediate flowering in sites with moderate and high CGDD, 4) There would be a trade-off between time to and size at flowering. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Contrary to my predictions I found that 1) CGDD varied quadratically with elevation, as low and mid elevational sites had similar CGDD, 2) Selection favoured early flowering plants across the gradient in season length, 3) There was no stabilizing selection for flowering time, 4) There was no evidence of a trade-off between time to and size at flowering.&#xD;
&#xD;
	There was no evidence for a trade-off, therefore earlier flowering plants were able to flower both early and at a larger size, resulting in higher fitness. My results challenge commonly held life history assumptions and demonstrate the importance of foundational research in natural systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between movement behaviours that make up a day and self-rated health (SRH) in adults aged 60-79, while adjusting for time spent in all other behaviours. This required the application of a compositional data framework to the analysis, which is an emerging method in physical activity epidemiology.&#xD;
Methods: This study was conducted using cycles 1-3 of the Canadian Health Measures Survey. SRH, sleep duration, and covariates were self-reported, and sedentary time (ST), light-intensity physical activity (LIPA), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) were measured using an Actical accelerometer. Traditional descriptive statistics were computed for the outcome and covariates, while compositional descriptive statistics were displayed for the movement behaviours. Logistic regression analyses were run to determine the association between the overall composition of movement behaviours and SRH, as well as the association between each movement behaviour and SRH. The odds of reporting ‘poor’ or ‘fair’ SRH were modeled.&#xD;
Results: The distribution of time spent in sleep, ST, LIPA, and MVPA is associated with SRH (p&lt;0.001). Relative to the other movement behaviours, both sleep duration (OR= 0.17) and MVPA (OR=0.81) were associated with better SRH. ST was associated with poorer SRH (OR=12.4). No statistically significant association was found for LIPA.&#xD;
Conclusion: SRH in older adults was positively associated with sleep duration and MVPA, and negatively associated with ST. Future research on physical activity should consider the effects of each movement behaviour on health outcomes, while taking into account the other behaviours.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Subsidence can be produced by multiple types of subsurface ground behavior, and is a potential concern in a mining environment due to the impacts this behavior can have on underground excavations. Subsidence was detected by InSAR methods in the region of the Leeville underground mining complex between 2004 and 2015. The Leeville operations are located on the Carlin Trend in northern Nevada, include extraction of multiple tabular orebodies, and primarily utilize longhole stoping methods with backfill. The measured subsidence forms an irregular shaped pattern that is much broader than the underground footprint of mining, with a trough that experiences higher displacements located over a mined-out area. &#xD;
The subsidence mechanism was investigated because it was unclear whether the subsidence was caused by mine dewatering or underground mining. Geologic, groundwater, and extraction data were reviewed to form hypotheses of the causes and controls of subsidence, which were then tested in a 3-D geomechanical model. A method to numerically simulate subsidence due to the coupled effects of underground mining and dewatering was developed, which involved starting with very simple elastic models, testing each mechanism or control incrementally, and eventually building in the appropriate mechanisms and controls into the model. The InSAR data was used as the main calibration dataset.&#xD;
The main findings of this thesis include: subsidence in the Leeville area is likely the result of two mechanisms, mining-induced deformations and compaction in the deep carbonate aquifer; geologic factors, such as low permeability features and hydrothermally altered/fractured zones, form controls on the subsidence pattern; and that yielding of the rock mass is likely producing higher strain magnitudes over stoping. This thesis has implications for understanding ground behavior and mine design at the Leeville operations and other underground Carlin Trend mines.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Vascular inflammation and immune activation play important roles in intracranial aneurysm (IA) pathology. From mycotic aneurysms it is apparent that fulminant microbial infection can drive aneurysm formation and rupture. Recently microbial DNA has also been discovered in aneurysm domes with no clinical signs of infection. This suggests that low level microbial infections may also influence aneurysm pathology. However, more comprehensive analyses are required to test this hypothesis. To this end, we explored the possibility that IA progression is related to indolent, subclinical infection of the aneurysm dome by microorganisms originating from commensal or pathogenic populations existing elsewhere in the host.&#xD;
Methods: IA dome samples originating from one of three patient populations (stable, growing or ruptured IAs) were collected along with controls from patients undergoing IA clipping surgeries. DNA was extracted from each sample for 16S rRNA analysis using Illumina MySeq. Microbial populations in each sample were identified and analyzed to determine differences microbial populations between IA pathologies.  &#xD;
Results and Discussion: 84 different operational taxonomic units were identified in patient samples, with 19 found only in IA tissues. No differences were seen between IA patient populations. However, IA tissues contained higher bacterial load, species number, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Desulovibrio count when compared to controls. In addition, a number of opportunistic pathogens were also found in IA tissues. Based on our findings it is unclear whether microorganisms pay a role in IA progression, but they may suggest a possible microbial influence in aneurysmal disease as a whole.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The birth of crusading and the religious reform movements of the late eleventh century left deep impressions on how some clerical and lay authors thought about, described, and discursively represented the masculine ideals of laymen in Christian terms. These complex social and religious campaigns created a climate of penitentialism and lived religiosity that reshaped how clerics and laymen conceptualized performative aspects of masculinity and manhood. In texts written or mediated by clergy, laymen expressed sincere anxieties about gendered behaviour such as military violence and sexual intimacy, and critically examined their involvement in morally complex activities in charters, wills, chronicles, poetry and other surviving texts. This thesis investigates how laymen navigated and responded to these popular religious movements in documentary sources produced by clergy, and also by laymen themselves. It considers how lay conceptions of masculinity and manhood developed into the first decades of the twelfth century and were informed by these ideological currents.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Decision-making process involves sequential stages of sensory processing, perceptual selection of a target for the behavior, preparation of an action, and execution of that action. Superior colliculus is at the center of a network which integrates the sensory information into evidence towards decisions about whether, to where and when a saccade should be made, and is therefore a suitable model to explore different aspects of these stages. This work explores the dynamics of interactions of SC populations during a decision that involves selection of a particular stimulus among the alternative options as the target for a future saccade. I show that these interactions evolve in time along with the requirements of the task, and the patterns of this evolution are different among neurons from the same or different SC populations. I further explore the impact of correlations within the activity rates of these neurons on the efficiency of coding this decision variable. I show that while the variability in pairs of neurons seems to increase the available information about the encoded target for the saccade, they decrease the performance of two biologically plausible decoders over simulated large populations. Finally, I explore the role of neuros in intermediate layers of SC in saccade production in a task where the subjects anticipate the possibility of withholding a programmed saccade. I show that while an accumulation of evidence towards a decision to execute a saccade appears to happen in SC, this activity pattern cannot fully account for the behavior of the subject. SC should be mainly considered as the threshold unit that transfers this decision variable from an accumulation unit elsewhere in the brain, such as the frontal eye fields, to the execution unit in the brainstem. This work confirms previous findings on the role of SC in two perceptual and executive stages of a decision process and provides additional insights on the details of how these roles are implemented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The magnesium-based aluminum-zinc alloys have excellent stiffness to weight ratios, and may be combined by friction stir welding to expand the possible applications.  The high aluminum alloy AZ80 in particular has the advantage of being relatively stiff but still extrudable.  However limited friction stir welding research is available for this alloy and extrapolation from the extensive work in aluminum alloys is impractical due differences in precipitation behaviour, and magnesium's high plastic anisotropy and tendency to form strong textures during friction stir welding. &#xD;
&#xD;
This work investigates the correlations between local friction stir welded microstructures, textures, residual strains, and the local deformation behaviour based on strain mapping during tensile tests. Covering bead-on-plate and butt configurations, joining of similar and dissimilar materials, and a range of processing conditions, many findings of interest for deformation modelling and industrial applications are presented. &#xD;
&#xD;
Synchrotron x-ray diffraction study of an entire friction stir weld was used to determine texture, residual strain and dislocation density data from a single experiment.  A number of unique findings were made, mainly related to the asymmetric distribution of properties both between sides of the weld and through the depth.  Particularly in the case of strain measurements, features not detectable at coarser measurement spacing or by line scan are presented and compared for multiple processing conditions. &#xD;
&#xD;
Investigation of the longitudinal material flow during welding showed that even when periodicity in grain size, precipitate distribution, or texture was not observed, periodic changes in texture intensity resulting from compaction of material behind the tool were present, providing evidence that movement of nugget material remained periodic.&#xD;
&#xD;
Strain localisation and fracture behaviour were found to be completely different between good quality similar and dissimilar friction stir welds. For similar magnesium friction stir welds, higher heat input was shown to improve mechanical performance by reducing the residual strain, while for dissimilar friction stir welds, deformation behaviour was found to be more sensitive to the final material distribution in the friction stir weld nugget.  For dissimilar welds, even minor changes to the material flow were shown to have a major impact on the tensile performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Designing smart materials with green chemistry in mind is a common theme throughout this thesis.  Smart surfaces, i.e. a surface that can perform multiple tasks as a function of an external stimulus, have the potential to reduce waste by simplifying processes, reducing solvent use, and extending the lifetime of materials through simple regenerative procedures.  The work presented in this thesis focuses on the development of CO2-responsive smart surfaces for green applications.  CO2-responsive smart surfaces have been used as desiccants for the removal of water from organic solvents.  For the first time, CO2-responsive smart desiccants were able to remove more water and were regenerated at a lower energy cost than traditional recyclable desiccants such as molecular sieves.  Additionally, CO2-responsive smart surfaces were demonstrated to be smart supports for heterogeneous catalysis with ruthenium nanoparticles by allowing reversible changes in catalyst selectivity for the hydrogenation of furfural.  In both applications, the CO2-responsive smart materials were recycled multiple times with little to no loss in performance.  CO2-responsive smart materials were demonstrated to selectively capture and release hydrophobic liquids and dyes without loss of performance over time.  A variety of substrates were evaluated as CO2-switchable surfaces using both single-unit and polymeric modifiers.  A robust and user-friendly method for “surface-initiated activators generated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization” (SI-AGET-ATRP) is described.  The SI-AGET-ATRP technique is compatible with various CO2-responsive polymers and will allow future work to study topics of interest such as the relationships between grafting density, molecular weight, and material performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Hippo pathway is a signaling cascade that plays essential roles in organisms such as development, organ size control, stem cell differentiation and renewal, as well as important processes necessary for cancer development and progression. Within the core cassette of the pathway are LATS1 and LATS2, serine/threonine kinases with a continually expanding repertoire of functions and effectors that relay upstream tumor suppressive signals. Despite the plethora of studies investigating Hippo pathway signaling, few LATS1/2 interacting proteins have been identified.&#xD;
In this thesis, the regulatory networks surrounding LATS1/2 are explored. By screening the Nedd4-like family E3 ubiquitin ligases, WWP1 was identified as a novel negative regulator of LATS1 by ubiquitinating and promoting its degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway. Importantly, loss of LATS1 stability was shown to be critical for WWP1-induced increases in cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, a novel signaling axis involving Cdk1, LATS2 and Pin1 was identified. After anti-tubulin drug treatment, activated Cdk1 kinase can directly phosphorylate LATS2 at five sites which subsequently binds Pin1 and inactivates its anti-apoptotic function. Lastly using CRISPR/Cas9 functional genomics screening, novel genes that promoted LATS2-induced S-phase cell cycle accumulation in lung cancer cells were identified and validated.&#xD;
Collectively these findings uncover novel upstream regulators and downstream mediators of LATS1/2 in functions related to tumorigenesis and drug response. The novel interacting proteins identified in this work may serve as potential new biomarkers for breast and lung cancer progression as well as anti-tubulin drug sensitivity. Thus mapping the molecular network of the Hippo pathway, with emphasis on the bona fide tumor suppressors LATS1/2, may have significant implications for the prognosis and treatment of breast and lung cancers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chemical warfare agents (CWA) are defined by the Chemical Weapons Convention as "any chemical which, through its chemical effect on living processes, may cause death, temporary loss of performance, or permanent injury to people and animals." Chemical warfare agents, such as the nerve agents and vesicants still pose a threat to global security and western interests. State and non-state actors continue to develop, stockpile, and weaponize these agents due to their mass effect on life, their ability to deny territory, and the ability to cause social and psychological distress. Since World War 1, CWA detection methodologies have been researched and implemented. They permit security forces and first responders to obtain early warning and adopt force protective measures. Briefly summarized is the chemistry of past and in-service chromogenic CWA detection systems, followed by a literature review of chromogenic and fluorogenic chemical-based detection methodologies currently being researched for nerve agents and vesicants. It is concluded that presently there is no suitable universal disclosure system or approach which can undergo an immediate, sensitive, and practical chromogenic response in the presence of CW nerve agents; phosphonofluoridates, phosphonocyanidates, and phosphonothioates. As a result, a novel and practical strategy is proposed and developed which combine La(III) metal-ion catalyzed alcoholysis (MICA) and chromogenic sensors. Since the strategy utilizes alcohol at neutral conditions, it can be employed to disclose CWA on sensitive materials. Three novel strategies are investigated for the detection of the phosphonofluoridates, two of which detect for F- produced via MICA. First, the cleavage of silylated ethers with a chromophoric core, and second, a displacement mechanism where F- interacts with La(III) resulting in the displacement of a metal-associated chromophoric sensor into solution. The third strategy focuses on the production and detection of H+, another product of MICA. The detection of phosphonocyanidates is adapted to this H+ strategy by the addition of a borderline M(II) that associates with the –CN product. Furthermore, a compatible sensor, 83, based on thiol-disulfide interchange, is developed and investigated for the detection of phosphonothioates. Finally, the sensors and methodologies are integrated into a stable universal solution, and its effectiveness demonstrated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Strategies to increase crop yields and drought stress tolerance are urgently needed to meet future global food demands in a changing climate. Although the effects of fertilizer application and drought stress in agriculture have each been researched extensively, the combined impacts of these two factors on crop yield, soil microbes, and nutrient availability are not well understood. High soil nitrogen availability promotes rapid plant growth, and increases leaf sap nitrate concentrations, but reduces carbon-based solute concentrations. By contrast, plants accumulate carbon-based solutes in response to drought. This project evaluates changes in leaf sap composition in response to fertilizer and water availability, to determine whether a trade-off exists between reduced leaf sap carbon concentrations associated with rapid plant growth, and subsequent tolerance to water-limitation. My thesis research centred on a greenhouse experiment to investigate the effects of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer (NK) additions at three levels on soil microbes, shoot growth, and leaf sap composition of replicate (n=9) Collard greens (Brassica oleracea) before and after a moderate water-limitation treatment. Increasing levels of NK addition progressively enhanced shoot biomass, and the medium and high levels doubled leaf sap total nitrogen and halved leaf sap carbon concentrations after 63 days of growth (i.e. at the end of the ‘normal’ trial). However, after three-weeks of subsequent water-stressed conditions (i.e. at the end of the normal plus water-limitation phases – the ‘water limitation’ trial), shoot biomass increases maintained a similar growth pattern to the normal trial, indicating that low leaf sap carbon concentrations did not reduce the subsequent shoot growth rate under water-limited conditions. Soil microbial N accumulation was equivalent across all fertilizer addition levels at the end of the normal trial, but increased progressively with NK addition after the water-limitation trial. Finally, leaf sap nitrate correlated closely with soluble soil nitrate, indicating that the former may provide an effective low-cost in-field test to determine the status of soluble nitrogen in agricultural soils. Overall, I found new and important relationships among leaf sap, soil microbial biomass, and bulk soil nutrient pools that will contribute to the improvement of soil management practices to meet the agricultural challenges of the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, GPUs have been adopted in many High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters due to their massive computational power and energy efficiency. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the de-facto standard for parallel programming. Many HPC applications, written in MPI, use parallel processes and multiple GPUs to achieve higher performance and GPU memory capacity. In such applications, efficiently performing GPU inter-process communication is the key in the application performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this dissertation, we present proposals to improve the GPU inter-process communication in HPC clusters using novel GPU-aware designs, efficient and scalable algorithms, topology-aware designs, and hardware features. Specifically, we propose various approaches to improve the efficiency of MPI communication routines in GPU clusters. We also propose designs that evaluate the total application inter-process communication and provide solutions to improve its efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, we propose efficient GPU-aware algorithms to improve MPI collective performance. We show the importance of minimizing CPU intervention on GPU collective performance. We also utilize GPU features to enhance both collective communication and computation. As inter-process communications scale to across multi-GPU nodes and clusters, efficient inter-process communication routines must consider the physical structure of the underlying system. Given the hierarchical nature of the GPU clusters with multi-GPU nodes, we propose hierarchy-aware designs for GPU collectives and show that different algorithms are favored at different hierarchy levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
With the presence of multiple data copy mechanisms in modern GPU clusters, it is crucial to make an informed decision on how to use them for efficient inter-process communications. In this regard, we propose designs that intelligently decide which data copy mechanisms to use in GPU collectives. Using these designs, we reveal the importance of using multiple data copy mechanisms in performing multiple inter-process communications.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we provide topology-aware solutions to improve the application inter-process communication efficiency, both within multi-GPU nodes and across GPU clusters. First, we study the performance of different communication channels used for GPU inter-process communications. Next, we propose topology-aware designs that consider both the system physical topology and application communication pattern. These designs improve the communication performance by performing more intensive inter-process communication on stronger communication channels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this research is to develop tools and methodologies to achieve more reliable information about the stress field in deep mines, especially around mining excavations by using the method of seismic stress inversion. &#xD;
After investigating several stress inversion algorithms, one method, MOTSI, has been applied to the seismic data collected from Nickel Rim South Mine (NRS) located in Sudbury, Canada. Although NRS hosts relatively massive rock mass with high strength, it is structurally complicated. There are many faults located in the mine, which can both influence the stress field and be the source of seismic events. The seismic array has good coverage over the active volume of the mine and consists of a number of sensors with different types (uniaxial and triaxial geophones and accelerometers). This combination of sensors covers the seismic events with a range of moment magnitudes between -3 and 3. Extensive filtering has been applied to the seismic data and finally, for mapping the stress field, more than 1000 seismic events were manually processed and after removing noise and applying different filters, it was possible to determine the orientation of the principal stresses through seismic stress inversion from the middle level of the mine. The aggregate of the inversions inferred a north–south, northeast/southwest orientation of the maximum principal stress and near vertical minimum principal stress.  In each inversion processed, several events were tagged as outliers according to the MOTSI software criteria. Several statistical analyses including mean, standard deviation, variance, t-test, box plot, Kruskal–Wallis test, and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted over 10 seismic source parameters (i.e. source radius, seismic moment, etc.) to determine the relation between outliers and used data. Finally, a relation between principal stresses and relative stress ratio has been described and the application of this relation and the overcoring stress measurements for determining the far-field stresses are explained.  &#xD;
Based on the results of this research, guidelines are prepared outlining how the stress inversion technique can be applied to mining seismicity to extract information about the stress field.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent scholars of Pre-Raphaelite art have focused on the history of women, material culture, and social context. An area that has received little attention is the concept of nationalism and national identity. This thesis closely examines the influence of such ideas through paintings created by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais, and William Holman Hunt, between 1848 and 1865. To outline these directions, artist biography, correspondence, and the nineteenth-century British press were considered critically. What this study reveals is that Pre-Raphaelite art was heavily influenced by socio-political, national and international events. Previously, Rossetti, Millais, and Hunt were understood to be rebellious, anti-establishment artists; this study shows that these artists were aware of their shifting political and cultural atmosphere, and consciously catered to national sentiment in order to gain financial success. Early paintings of Rossetti, Millais, and Hunt coincide with the religious, evangelical fervour of the mid-nineteenth century. I argue that Rossetti continued to appeal to religious buyers through a Cycle of Mary images in the 1850s and was influenced by the Morant Bay Rebellion (1865) in his creation of The Beloved (1865, Tate). In the early 1850s, Millais appealed to popular opinion in his works through commentary on the Protestant-Catholic debates, and the Crimean War (1853-56). Through their correspondence, we now know that Millais and Rossetti did not share the views represented in their art, which further highlights the financial motivations behind the paintings. Furthermore, I argue that the early reviews of Pre-Raphaelite paintings were affected by the national religious mood, and coincidentally by the Irish Potato Famine (1845-52). A study of the press reveals stark similarities in language between these reviews and the debates on national and international events. Unlike Rossetti and Millais, Hunt relied on his personal beliefs to create his early religious paintings. However, I argue that to attract specific buyers such as Thomas Combe and Ernest Gambart, Hunt modelled his paintings after popular evangelical sermons. Through the lens of nationalism, this study offers a new perspective which can help unify the often-fragmented study of Pre-Raphaelite art, and make it relevant across multiple disciplines.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hippocampal theta activity is an oscillatory, highly rhythmic (4-14 Hz) activity pattern generated by the hippocampal formation of mammals. Theta activity has been linked to anxiety states in rodent, based on a number of studies showing that anxiety-reducing pharmacological agents (anxiolytics) consistently decrease the frequency of theta activity in rats, leading to the influential “theta suppression model of anxiolysis.” To this date, very few studies have systemically compared anxiety-related defensive behaviour and hippocampal theta activity in males and females. The primary objectives of this thesis were to examine a possible association of theta frequency and behavioural levels of “anxiety” in individual rats, and to examine&#xD;
potential sex differences in anxiety, theta activity, and the anxiety-theta association. Female and male rats were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM), a common paradigm to assess anxiety in rodents. Interestingly, the findings reveal that females exhibited higher amounts of open arm activity (number of open arm entries and open arm time) compared to males, indicative of reduced “anxiety” in females. Following the behavioral assessment, the same rats were anesthetized using urethane and underwent electrophysiological procedures to characterize hippocampal theta frequencies activity. Theta activity was recorded in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and was elicited by electrical stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation (consisting of 5-s trains of 0.1 ms duration pulses delivered at 100 Hz). Systemic administration of the clinically used anxiolytic drug buspirone, which acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, was shown to decrease the frequency of theta activity, a finding that is in agreement with prior work. These experiments showed that there was no sex difference in theta frequency, and that theta frequency in individual rats did not correlate with behavioral measures of anxiety in the EPM. Together, the results of this work show that theta frequency does not predict levels of anxiety-like behavior in the EPM and challenge the predictive validity of hippocampal theta frequency as an index of anxiety levels.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis develops three theoretical frameworks to investigate questions relating to authority within both firms and governments as well as discrimination in the labor market. The first chapter develops a theoretical framework that incorporates the deleterious effects of tournaments on cooperation in order to generate a more complete theory of the optimal organizational structure. I study how well information will be generated by the agents and utilized by the decision maker(s) in either a centralized or a decentralized setting. I show that tournaments can achieve what I refer to as the Constrained First Best outcome and will negatively impact cooperation only in a decentralized setting. This chapter also suggests that a limited liability constraint will increase the complementarity between decentralization  and the agents' productivity. Furthermore, I argue that periods of economic contraction will favor a centralized setting and I uncover a trade-off between communication noise, which depresses centralized profits, and production noise, which depresses decentralized profits. &#xD;
	&#xD;
	Using a model with an overall population consisting of two different groups, the second chapter shows that imposing optimal constraints on the set of implementable policies based on demographics and misalignment of preferences increases social welfare. I also argue that the more misaligned the preferences of two groups are, the more restrictive these optimal constraints should be. When using these optimal constraints or no constraints at all, allocating power based on the plurality rule is optimal. However, if restrictive suboptimal constraints are utilized, then allocating power to a minority group becomes potentially optimal. Finally, I show that while overly-lax suboptimal constraints still increase welfare, overly-burdensome suboptimal constraints do so if the two groups' preferences are sufficiently misaligned.&#xD;
	&#xD;
	The third chapter provides a theoretical framework to compare two different hiring practices: an unpaid competitive internship which is followed by a potential job offer versus a standard series of interviews. After fully characterizing the optimal hiring process, I show that labor regulations that ban the use of unpaid internships or that prevent employers from giving truthful references can exacerbate the obstacles to employment of a community traditionally facing discrimination.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Aarf domain-containing kinase 3, ADCK3, is a human atypical protein kinase located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria that is required for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ). Stable supply of CoQ is essential to human health as it plays a critical role as an electron transporter in the electron transport chain which is required for proper ATP production. Although the exact role of ADCK3 is unknown, patients possessing mutations within this gene are often diagnosed with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 2, which results from CoQ deficiency. To better understand the involvement of ADCK3 and other proteins in CoQ biosynthesis, their structure, function, and their interactions with each other were investigated. ADCK3 is hypothesized to regulate the CoQ biosynthesis using its kinase activity to activate several proteins found in the CoQ biosynthetic complex; however, previous work has failed to show direct evidence of its kinase activity and its functional interaction with the other Coq proteins.&#xD;
In this work, using a soluble construct of ADCK3, we solved its structure by X-ray crystallography. Various constructs of ADCK3 were transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney cells in an attempt to extract and identify its substrates. Further, the genes of the potential substrates, Coq3, Coq5, and Coq7 were cloned into various expression vectors and transformed into Escherichia coli expression cell lines. After the extensive expression trials, the combination of N-terminal fusions with maltose-binding proteins and the RIPL E. coli cell expression line was found to facilitate the expression of Coq5 and Coq7. However, using radiometric kinase assays, we show that ADCK3 exhibited no kinase activity towards Coq5 and Coq7. Finally, this work also shows the methyltransferase activity of Coq5 using its substrate analog. It is anticipated that our results will serve as a foundation for further characterization of the proteins involved in the human CoQ10 biosynthesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Samuel Richardson developed a narrative technique that recreates the epistemological and ontological conditions of selfhood theorized by empiricist philosophy; these conditions are the complex interplay between interior and exterior states that creates interiority and the dynamics of limited perspective. This technique I call formal irony. Locke, Hume, and Smith all theorize selves that exist as ontologically separate minds with epistemologically limited perceptions; by developing a narrative technique that recreates these conditions, Richardson represents characters as separated from others (what I call social irony) and separated from their own hearts (internal irony). Richardson considered these conditions problems, however, and each of his novels is an attempt to solve them, though these solutions are often made provisional by the very conditions they attempt to escape. &#xD;
	In chapter 1, I theorize my major terms and begin my investigation of interiority and perspective by examining Locke’s theory of language in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. In chapter 2 I read Pamela alongside Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature and examine the way Richardson represents character as a function of limited perspective, the way he uses disclosure to solve the separations created by interiority, but also the way disclosure is a naïve solution, one that does not fully account for the distortions of self. In chapter 3 I read Clarissa and examine the way Richardson, now more aware of the complications of interiority and perspective, further explores separation by including multiple narrators who use competing hermeneutics. Richardson uses typology as a solution to these problems; his typological solution, however, though it appears to resolve the separation of self and heart, fails to resolve the separation of self and other. In chapter 4 I read Grandison alongside Smith’s A Theory of Moral Sentiment and examine the way Richardson uses deliberate acts of imaginative transposition to transcend the limitations of self and solve the separation of self and other; this solution is only possible, however, because Richardson re-fashions the self to be less of an individual. Richardson, I argue throughout, is an innovator, someone constantly re-examining the problems of the self and constantly proposing new solutions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During the development of deep underground excavations spalling and rockbursting have been recognized as significant mechanisms of violent brittle failure. In order to predict whether violent brittle failure will occur, it is important to identify the location of stiffness transitions that are associated with geologic structure. One approach to identify the effect of geologic structures is to apply borehole geophysical tools ahead of the tunnel advance. Stiffness transitions can be identified using mechanical property analysis surveys that combine acoustic velocity and density data to calculate acoustic estimates of elastic moduli. However, logistical concerns arise since the approach must be conducted at the advancing tunnel face. As a result, borehole mechanical property analyses are rarely used. Within this context, laboratory ultrasonic pulse velocity testing has been proposed as a potential alternative to borehole mechanical property analysis since moving the analysis to the laboratory would remove logistical constraints and improve safety for the evaluators. In addition to the traditional method of conducting velocity testing along the core axis, two new methodologies for point-focused testing were developed across the core diameter, and indirectly along intact lengths of drill core. The indirect test procedure was implemented in a continuous ultrasonic velocity test program along 573m of drill core to identify key geologic structures that generated transitions in ultrasonic elastic moduli. The test program was successful at identifying the location of geologic contacts, igneous intrusions, faults and shear structures. Ultrasonic values of Young’s modulus and bulk modulus were determined at locations of significant velocity transitions to examine the potential for energy storage and energy release. Comparison of results from different ultrasonic velocity test configurations determined that the indirect test configuration provided underestimates for values of Young’s modulus. This indicated that the test procedure will require modifications to improve coupling of the transducers to the core surface. In order to assess whether laboratory testing can be an alternative to borehole surveys, laboratory velocity testing must be directly assessed with results from acoustic borehole logging. There is also potential for the laboratory velocity program to be used to assess small scale stiffness changes, differences in mineral composition and the degree of fracturing of drill core.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this dissertation, I undertake an in-depth examination of the stakeholder networks and narratives that are driving and shaping drone technologies and corresponding policy within Canada. It examines how and why some stakeholder groups have been excluded from various regulatory processes for drones, and how the inclusion and exclusion of certain groups in regulatory processes impacts the deployment of these technologies, and thus impacts on privacy and civil liberties. The adoption and use of drone technologies represents and perpetuates a politics of verticality that allows particular stakeholder groups to control Canada’s sociotechnical space through policy, and this contributes to a privileged vertical gaze where only particular groups and technologies can operate drones. This dissertation theorizes Canadian drone space as being shaped by the logics of dominant stakeholder groups, and addresses the ways in which civil liberties and privacy implications as well as surveillance-sensitive aspects of drones are not adequately addressed because of who is excluded from these spaces. 		&#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation argues how the seemingly benign relationships between particular stakeholder groups in Canadian drone space are the product of a ‘revolving door’ in the surveillance-industrial complex. The relationships that have developed around drones between certain stakeholder groups (primarily government, industry, and military) show how other stakeholder groups (such as civil liberties advocates, lawyers, and privacy experts) have long been excluded from the development of drone regulation processes in Canada. I put these politics of exclusion into dialogue with Andrew Barry’s theory of technological zones and Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory. These theories help to explain how the field of power within which stakeholders operate contributes to them a) only associating with specific stakeholder groups, b) upholding particular logics and predispositions about drone technologies, and c) perpetuating discourses and narratives about the technological zone of drones that impacts the technologies themselves, the regulation of drones, and Canada’s sociotechnical space more broadly. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with stakeholders as well as extensive analyses of primary documents obtained through Access to Information and Privacy requests, these data are parsed through thematically to demonstrate the contrasting positions of stakeholder groups in the regulatory process, in assessing risk and the market, and in media portrayals of drone technologies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to improve the melt and solid-state properties of poly (propylene) (PP) and poly(lactide) (PLA) by reactive extrusion. Peroxide-mediated melt-state reactive extrusion in the presence of mesate and acrylate-based coagents was implemented to introduce branching and enhance the strain hardening, crystallization kinetics and solid state properties of these commodity polymers, to make them conducive to more high-value applications. The coagent modified PP possessed bimodal molecular weight and branching distributions, whose population varied with coagent structure. Besides changing polymer chain architecture, chemical modification generated a small amount of well-dispersed, coagent-derived nanoparticles. When compared with the parent material and PP samples treated with peroxide alone, coagent-modified materials demonstrated significantly higher crystallization temperatures and crystallization rates, as well as a finer spherulitic structure. Crystallization studies showed that whereas branching had a moderate effect on crystallization kinetics, heterogeneous nucleation effects dominated the crystallization of coagent-modified PP materials. Coagent modified PP specimens prepared by injection molding retained the modulus and tensile strength of the parent PP, in spite of their lower molar mass and viscosities, whereas their elongation at break and the impact strength were improved. This was attributed to the finer spherulitic structure of these materials, and to the disappearance of the skin-core layer that typically forms during the injection molding process.&#xD;
In the second part of this thesis, structure-property relations of PLA, branched by peroxide-mediated reactive extrusion in the presence various coagents was carried out.  The coagent modified PLA, consisted of mixtures of linear, and long chain branched (LCB) PLA chains. A trifunctional coagent (triallyl trimesate, TAM) was extremely effective in producing LCB structures, which promoted substantial increases in viscosity, elasticity, as well as strain hardening characteristics. The reactively-modified injection molded branched PLA formulations had improved Izod impact strength, while maintaining their capacity to degrade hydrolytically were maintained. Furthermore, these materials developed high amounts of crystallinity, when cooled under controlled conditions, revealing a nucleating effect. The improvements in strain hardening resulted in microcellular foams with very high cell densities and sub-micron sized cell size, when these formulations were foamed at temperatures close to the crystallization temperature of the polymer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Several lines of astronomical evidence indicate that most of the matter in our universe is made of non-luminous material known as dark matter, the nature of which remains a mystery. DEAP-3600 is a liquid-argon-based scintillation detector located 2 km underground outside Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, purposed towards directly detecting dark matter particles as they pass through the target material. Since the acrylic vessel containing the 3600-kg liquid argon target is not transparent to the 128-nm scintillation light produced during these interactions, a thin layer of 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (TPB) was deposited onto the inner surface of the acrylic vessel to shift the wavelength of the scintillation light to the visible range, where is can pass through the transparent acrylic vessel and is more easily detected by the surrounding array of photomultiplier tubes.&#xD;
The dark matter signal in DEAP-3600 is accompanied by a host of other background signals, which must either be suppressed, or identified as background signals and subsequently cut from the analysis. A major anticipated source of background events is alpha decays of radioactive isotopes on the inner surface of the acrylic vessel, near the TPB layer. The potential for these events to generate a background signal depends sensitively on the choice of thickness of the TPB layer. A study of the effects of TPB layer thickness on the background rate of these surface alpha events is presented, and a model for the dominant contributor to these background events is developed to generate estimates of the probability that an event of this type would mimic a dark matter signal. Other effects considered in the choice of TPB layer thickness are presented, and the final decision of a 2.99 +- 0.02 micron TPB layer thickness, along with the TPB deposition campaign, is briefly described.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There seems to be a consensus today that representative democracy is facing a period of severe crisis. Contemporary scholars and popular commentators from the most diverse backgrounds and political leanings seem to agree with this diagnosis. Voting, party membership, trust in politicians, and interest in mainstream politics, the most celebrated indicators of political scientists to measure representative democracy’s “health,” are all under great stress in several countries. However, a closer look at the history of what we today call “representative democracy” would reveal that the current crisis (although perhaps one of the most severe) is not really original. On the contrary, representative politics has been time and again plagued by the explosion of crisis. To address this vexing question, this dissertation adopts the following strategy. Initially, it situates its analysis within the context of the American Revolution. Since the American Revolution represents one of the most important events for the emergence of the project of “representative democracy,” the examination of aspects of this episode can provide insight for understanding the frequent crises of representative politics more generally. In addition, this dissertation examines the dispute over the concept of constituent power (and democracy) that erupted throughout the American Revolution between the Federalists and the dissident strands of the Revolution. The investigation of this dispute has two main goals. The first is to present an alternative path for the dominant view on constituent power (and democracy). The second is to provide insights for the reflections on the limits of representative democracy. On this latter point, I argue that the alternative perspective of constituent power can function as a potent tool to address the recurrent crisis of democracy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Racecourse prospect is a possibly economic alkalic Cu-Au porphyry system, situated within the Macquarie Arc, NSW, Australia. Similar in age to both the Ordovician Cadia and Northparks districts of NSW, a volcano-sedimentary host sequence was intruded by two monzonitic porphyry complexes through fluid conduits created by the cross arc architecture of the Lachlan Transverse Zone. Prior industry workers have intersected two intrusive suites at Racecourse; the feldspar porphyry remains mineralized, fertile, and postulated to be the main mineralizing suite. Pearce Element Ratio diagrams for the three main lithologies intersected at Racecourse were created to perform a lithogeochemical prospectivity analysis. Two hundred eight whole rock samples representing the three lithologies were selected from data supplied by Anglo American Exploration Australia. There is a lack of hydrolytic alteration, and minimal alteration experienced by the system as a whole as illustrated by the PERs. Instead, the feldspar porphyry carries a relatively unaltered geochemical signature. Economic metals have no apparent relation to type of alteration. Mineralization is hosted by specific rock types, with Cu mineralization related to the feldspar porphyry, and Au occurring at low concentrations throughout all units.&#xD;
Soils and Pinus radiata tree cores were collected above and distal to mineralization in order to outline the covered prospect’s signature. Soil samples were sieved with the &lt;250 m size analyzed, and show distinct anomalous populations of Au, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn above prior drilling. Rings of Pinus radiata were counted, with the age interval of 2003 – 2008 chosen to sample. Samples show elevated Cu, Mo, and Zn above the previously drilled soil anomaly, whereas the southwest of the survey area reveals a Cu anomaly corresponding to localized faulting. 206Pb/204Pb values from the Pinus radiata identify distinct anomalous groups spatially associated with discrete metal anomalies. At the Racecourse target, anomalous Pinus radiata samples yield a similar isotopic signature to the faulted southwestern anomaly, potentially linking the source of these two metal anomalies as the feldspar porphyry. When integrated with subsurface geology and the current understanding of the mineralized body, geochemical media suggest that mineralization may continue down plunge at depth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This essay examines the history of urban planning and governance, urban- suburban infrastructure development, and city-community negotiation in post-war Toronto. A specific emphasis is placed on the downtown community’s push-back against a centrally planned highway grid during the late 1960s. The role of the automobile is a central element to the study, as it was the primary impetus for Toronto planners who sought to deliberately model post-war infrastructure after auto-centric U.S. cities. The history engages with the expansion of an expressway-tethered stretch of urban and suburban space now known as the “Golden Horseshoe”: surveying the location of automobile plants in cities along the rail lines; capital flight from Quebec; and suburban developer’s encroachment upon agricultural space in their search for cheaper land to build middle-class subdivisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The paper reviews the existing literature on Canadian and North American urban transportation and economic history, whilst also drawing on a primary research base of municipal and provincial master planning documents, policy deliberations, newspaper accounts, activist materials and interpretations from key actors throughout the period of the study. Toronto is placed in a broader transnational theoretical framework through an exploration of two key concepts; “high modernism” and “negotiation”. These two ideas are used to demonstrate how a centralized bureaucratic urban vision was challenged by organized residents of Toronto’s core who were determined to preserve the human scale, architectural distinctiveness and civic involvement in urban life.&#xD;
&#xD;
The thesis’ vital case study is the protest against the proposed Spadina Expressway, the success of which led to the cancellation of not just that highway, but the abandonment of other municipal highway plans across the city. This political shift is an important chapter in Toronto’s urban governance as a formerly top-down, provincially controlled process was democratized into a new municipal authority that valued greater community engagement. The logic animating the city’s greater built environment is discussed to make sense of the sprawling suburban form that was manifest and became dominant in the post-war period.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“Memoration” is an integrative and adaptable artistic methodology that has emerged from my practice as an artist and scholar.  I characterize it as an evolving set of theoretical and aesthetic provocations directed at destabilizing white settler dominance as it is entrenched in the landscape of everyday Canadian life.  This dissertation traces the formation and enactment of memoration by examining pivotal artworks from a ten year period of my inter-media art practice, and contextualizing them in relation to historical and contemporary facets of Canadian nation-building, and movements of Indigenous and non-Indigenous resistance.  In order to construct a coherent story of memoration’s development—one that highlights its salient features—this text includes the artwork I created as part of my PhD research, oh-oh Canada, as well as artworks that were undertaken outside of my doctoral studies, Imprint, (official denial) trade value in progress and memoration #2: constituent parts.  Carrying out this retrospective analysis also situates memoration’s development in relation to the changing discourses with which it intersects and positions it as operating in parallel and conversation with projects of Indigenous sovereignty, resurgence and decolonization. The discussions within this dissertation highlight the imperative and potential of the white settler being activated in this manner, while also attending to the challenges and limitations of such endeavours. As a research-creation project comprised of artistic and textual components, this dissertation acts as a vehicle for enacting, scrutinizing, and theorizing strategies through which the white settler artist, and by extension the white settler citizen, might engage in unsettling the settler colonial status quo in ways that exercise responsibility, accountability, and an ethic of being-in-relation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates the fundamentals of modification of polylactic acid (PLA) and                                poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs), focusing on improving the understanding of the reactivity of these polymers in the presence of peroxide and multifunctional coagents.  The first objective was to examine the effects these modifications had on PLA and to compare them to a well understood polyolefin system, ethylene octene copolymer (EOC).  The linear viscoelastic (LVE) properties and molecular weight distributions showed that in the presence of peroxide and coagent these systems were able to produce     long-chain branched structures, with allylic coagents being more effective at altering the chain architecture.  These reactions were found to proceed through a radical mechanism as oppose to other forms of ionic chemistry.  Evaluation of the abstraction efficiencies (AE) and graft propagation of monofunctional coagents showed that PLA is a poor hydrogen donor and the effectiveness of the allylic coagents is likely a result of solubility between the polymer and coagent in the melt. &#xD;
The second objective was to investigate the chemical modification of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs), with different lengths of side chains.  Medium-chain-length PHAs (MCL-PHAs) showed an affinity for both allylic and acrylic coagents with increases in viscosity, the appearance of shear thinning, and bimodal molecular weight distributions.  On the other hand, the short-chain-length PHAs (SCL-PHAs),              poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) PHB, preformed very similar to what was observed with PLA, where allylic coagents out preformed the acrylate coagents.  The AE of these materials gave significant insight into the reactivity.  As the alkane side chain length was increased from SCL-PHAs to MCL-PHAs, the number of methylene group increased and as a result more hydrogen abstraction sites became available, thus resulting in higher AE.  This implies there is a greater probability for coagents to graft onto the polymer backbone and therefore the promotion of branched structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is an investigation of pathogen removal in wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs). WSPs are sustainable alternatives to conventional wastewater treatment, requiring minimal energy input and low costs. They have the capability to effectively attenuate nutrients as well as pathogenic microorganisms. Disinfection in WSPs is a complex process, which can be influenced by a number of mechanisms and environmental factors, such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature. Due to long retention time in these systems, algal activities are often expected during warm seasons. Their presence may have effects on the complex interaction between biological communities and water chemistry. This thesis aimed to assess the role of algae in disinfection in WSP systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
Two algae (Mougeotia sp. and Hydrodicty sp.) that were collected from the Amherstview WSP were noted to increase both pH and DO when cultivated under laboratory conditions. This finding was corroborated by the multivariate statistical analysis where the correlation relationships between a wide range of water quality parameters (pH, DO, temperature, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, Escherichia coli (E. coli), total coliforms (TC), Enterococci, Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens), ammonium, nitrate, total nitrogen, phosphate total phosphorus and COD) were investigated. As such, the presence of algae is believed to contribute to the high pH and DO levels in the WSP system. &#xD;
&#xD;
The inactivation of E. coli and total coliforms were found to increase with increasing pH. Intermediate DO level (8.6 mg/L) appeared to support the survival of both E. coli and total coliforms, while both high and low DO levels (20 mg/L and 1 mg/L, respectively) could facilitate their removal and inactivation. This would suggest that the presence of algae leading to high pH and DO could potentially promote the removal of E. coli, total coliforms and Enterococci. Two additional indicator organisms (Enterococci and C. perfringens) showed different inactivation trends compared to traditional indicator organisms (E. coli, fecal coliforms or TC). C. perfringens were tolerant to the pH, DO and temperature ranges investigated. They exhibited weaker correlations with both E. coli and TC. This finding suggested that Enterococci and C. perfringens can be proposed as potential indicator organisms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) are European freshwater molluscs that have invaded&#xD;
most major inland water systems across North America, resulting in billions of dollars in damages and&#xD;
losses to fisheries, recreational water use, infrastructure, and industry each year. Zequanox®, a&#xD;
biopesticide made from soil bacteria, has been advertised as dreissenid-selective and environmentally&#xD;
safe. Health Canada has approved the use of Zequanox® in hydroelectric facilities, which may indicate&#xD;
movement toward open-water use in Canada, as has occurred in the USA and Ireland. Data from singlespecies&#xD;
assays indicate that exposure to Zequanox® concentrations near or below those recommended for&#xD;
open-water applications can cause mortality (often ≥50%) in fish and invertebrates. However, little is&#xD;
known about the non-target impacts of applying Zequanox® in an open-water setting, given that toxicants&#xD;
can behave differently in natural versus laboratory environments and because single-species tests are&#xD;
unable to characterize indirect effects such as pesticide-mediated changes to inter-species interactions like&#xD;
competition and predation.&#xD;
Using a six-week-long replicated aquatic mesocosm experiment, I simulated open-water&#xD;
applications of Zequanox® (100 mg/L of the active ingredient) to determine the responses of primary&#xD;
producers, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates to Zequanox® exposure in a complex aquatic&#xD;
environment. Short-term increases occurred in phytoplankton and periphyton biomass (250–350% of&#xD;
controls), abundance of large cladoceran grazers (700% of controls), and insect emergence (490% of&#xD;
controls). Large declines initially occurred among small cladoceran zooplankton (88–94% reductions in&#xD;
Chydorus sphaericus, Ceriodaphnia lacustris, and Scapheloberis mucronata), but abundances generally&#xD;
rebounded within three weeks. Declines also occurred in amphipods Hyalella azteca (mean abundance&#xD;
77% less than controls) and gastropods Viviparus georgianus (survival 73 ±16%), which did not recover&#xD;
during the experiment. Short-term impacts to water quality included a decrease in dissolved oxygen&#xD;
(minimum 1.2 mg/L), despite aeration of the mesocosms.&#xD;
This research may assist regulators and managers in assessing the ecological risks of using&#xD;
Zequanox® in open-water systems and support informed decision-making about dreissenid control,&#xD;
including for established infestations, rapid response to new invasions, and efforts under the Species at&#xD;
Risk Act to protect and restore native mussel habitats that have been threatened and damaged by&#xD;
dreissenid invasion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The aquatic larvae of chironomids (Diptera, Chironomidae) were historically classified according to lake trophic status, and taxa classified as “eutrophic” were labeled as such because of adaptations for surviving hypoxic or anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion of stratified eutrophic lakes. As such, sedimentary chironomid assemblages have been used to reconstruct production-related variables (nutrients, chlorophyll-a), though this has been problematic, especially in shallow systems, because the response of chironomids to eutrophication is mediated through secondary environmental gradients including oxygen concentration, habitat, and food quality/quantity. In this thesis, eutrophic sewage ponds in the Canadian High Arctic were used to demonstrate that oxygen, not nutrients, is the primary control of chironomid species assemblages. The ability to explicitly test the influence of oxygen versus nutrients on chironomid distributions was made possible by the 24-hr daylight (continuous photosynthesis) and shallow, wind-mixed water column that resulted in oxygen concentrations that were decoupled from the effects of elevated nutrients and production. The subfossil chironomid assemblages were complacent during historical eutrophication, in contrast to marked changes in diatom assemblages, which have a direct physiological relationship with nutrients. Similarly, in shallow eutrophic ponds on islands in Lake Ontario, chironomid assemblages did not appear to be governed by the large gradient in total phosphorus due to the presence or absence of waterbird nesting colonies, but rather by habitat and possible bird-mediated heavy metal pollution. In a subarctic lake that was formerly used for sewage disposal, chironomid assemblages were relatively unresponsive to eutrophication in comparison with the larger turnover in diatom species. However, periods of low oxygen observed in the temperate and subarctic sites may explain the higher (but still low) relative abundances of hypoxia-tolerant Chironomus species at these sites compared to the High Arctic ponds. Together, this research demonstrates the problems associated with classifying chironomids based on nutrient levels. Since it is uncommon to examine chironomid responses to eutrophication across latitude, this thesis offers a relatively unstudied perspective of chironomid ecology, emphasizing that some of the assumptions of temperate chironomid ecology (with regards to eutrophication) may not necessarily hold true when applied at higher latitudes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation considers the relationship between art and nature in Florence under Grand Duke Francesco I de’ Medici (1541-87) through an investigation of four materials: coral, rock crystal, lapis lazuli, and shells. The use and representation of these natural materials in spaces and objects associated with Francesco reveals the complexity of the art/nature duality at the time and place in which art was taking shape as an academic practice in the form of the Accademia del Disegno and the writing of art history by Giorgio Vasari (1511-74) and others. Further, attitudes towards the natural world were shifting as a result of the work of naturalists such as Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605), a long-time correspondent of Francesco, and European explorations into the wider world. These case studies have broader implications for such issues as Medici heritage, the legacy of Michelangelo, the style sometimes called “Mannerism,” natural history, and global expansion. Under Francesco, the generative forces of art and nature were united, as suggested in his Studiolo, the gardens of Pratolino, in objects such as mounted branches of coral, rock crystal vessels, sculptures encrusted with shells, and paintings filled with ultramarine, and, most explicitly, in the operation of artists’ workshops next to alchemical and other “scientific” laboratories within the Casino di San Marco, the activities of which Francesco actively participated, satisfying his own intellectual curiosity into the workings of nature and its transformations at the hands of skilled artists. This dissertation will demonstrate that the relationship between art and nature not only played out in realm of style, as espoused in art theoretical texts, but in the materiality of the arts, placing those irregular natural substances of Mother Nature as central to the culture of Francesco’s Florence.</dcterms:abstract>
