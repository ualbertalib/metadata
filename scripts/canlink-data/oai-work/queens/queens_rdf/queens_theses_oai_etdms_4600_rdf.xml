      <dcterms:abstract>Navigation devices used to be bulky and expensive and were not widely commercialized for personal use. Nowadays, all useful electronic devices are turning into being handheld so that they can be conveniently used anytime and anywhere. One can claim that almost any mobile phone, used today, has quite strong navigational capabilities that can efficiently work anywhere in the globe. No matter where you are, you can easily know your exact location and make your way smoothly to wherever you would like to go. This couldn’t have been made possible without the existence of efficient and small microwave circuits responsible for the transmission and reception of high quality navigation signals.&#xD;
This thesis is mainly concerned with the design of novel highly miniaturized and efficient filtering components working in the Global Navigational Satellite Systems (GNSS) frequency band to be integrated within an efficient Radio Frequency (RF) front-end module (FEM). A System-on-Package (SoP) integration technique is adopted for the design of all the components in this thesis. Two novel miniaturized filters are designed, where one of them is a wideband filter targeting the complete GNSS band with a fractional bandwidth of almost 50% at a center frequency of 1.385 GHz. This filter utilizes a direct inductive coupling topology to achieve the required wide band performance. It also has very good out-of-band rejection and low IL. Whereas the other dual band filter will only cover the lower and upper GNSS bands with a rejection notch in between the two bands. It has very good inter band rejection. The well-known “divide and conquer” design methodology was applied for the design of this filter to help save valuable design and optimization time. Moreover, the performance of two commercially available ultra-Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) is studied. The complete RF FEM showed promising preliminary performance in terms of noise figure, gain and bandwidth, where it out performed other commercial front-ends in these three aspects. All the designed circuits are fabricated and tested. The measured results are found to be in good agreements with the simulations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In an attempt to improve the current understanding of the adaptive response to exercise in humans,&#xD;
this dissertation performed a series of studies designed to examine the impact of training intensity and&#xD;
mode on aerobic capacity and performance, fibre-type specific adaptations to training, and individual&#xD;
patterns of response across molecular, morphological and genetic factors. Project #1 determined that training intensity, session dose, baseline VO2max and total training volume do not influence the magnitude of change in VO2max by performing a meta-regression, and meta-analysis of 28 different studies. The intensity of training had no effect on the magnitude of increase in maximal oxygen uptake in young healthy participants, but similar adaptations were achieved with lower training doses following high intensity training. Project # 2 determined the acute molecular response, and training-induced adaptations in aerobic performance, aerobic capacity and muscle phenotype following high-intensity interval training (HIT) or endurance exercise (END). The acute molecular response (fibre recruitment and signal activation) and training-induced adaptations in aerobic capacity, aerobic performance, and muscle phenotype were&#xD;
similar following HIT and END. Project # 3 examined the impact of baseline muscle morphology and molecular characteristics on the training response, and if muscle adaptations are coordinated. The muscle phenotype of individuals who experience the largest improvements (high responders) were lower before training for some muscle characteristics and molecular adaptations were coordinated within individual participants. Project # 4 examined the impact of 2 different intensities of HIT on the expression of nuclear and  mitochondrial encoded genes targeted by PGC-1α. A systematic upregulation of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded genes was not present in the early recovery period following acute HIT, but the expression of mitochondrial genes were coordinated at an individual level. Collectively, results from the current dissertation contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing skeletal muscle and whole-body adaptive responses to acute exercise and training in humans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have shown wide applicability to many fields including monitoring of environmental, civil, and industrial settings. WSNs however are resource constrained by many competing factors that span their hardware, software, and networking. One of the central resource constrains is the charge consumption of WSN nodes. With finite energy supplies, low charge consumption is needed to ensure long lifetimes and success of WSNs.&#xD;
This thesis details the design of a power system to support long-term operation of WSNs. The power system’s development occurs in parallel with a custom WSN from the Queen’s MEMS Lab (QML-WSN), with the goal of supporting a 1+ year lifetime without sacrificing functionality. The final power system design utilizes a TPS62740 DC-DC converter with AA alkaline batteries to efficiently supply the nodes while providing battery monitoring functionality and an expansion slot for future development. &#xD;
  Testing tools for measuring current draw and charge consumption were created along with analysis and processing software. Through their use charge consumption of the power system was drastically lowered and issues in QML-WSN were identified and resolved including the proper shutdown of accelerometers, and incorrect microcontroller unit (MCU) power pin connection. Controlled current profiling revealed unexpected behaviour of nodes and detailed current-voltage relationships. These relationships were utilized with a lifetime projection model to estimate a lifetime between 521-551 days, depending on the mode of operation.&#xD;
The power system and QML-WSN were tested over a long term trial lasting 272+ days in an industrial testbed to monitor an air compressor pump. Environmental factors were found to influence the behaviour of nodes leading to increased charge consumption, while a node in an office setting was still operating at the conclusion of the trail. This agrees with the lifetime projection and gives a strong indication that a 1+ year lifetime is achievable. Additionally, a light-weight charge consumption model was developed which allows charge consumption information of nodes in a distributed WSN to be monitored. This model was tested in a laboratory setting demonstrating +95% accuracy for high packet reception rate WSNs across varying data rates, battery supply capacities, and runtimes up to full battery depletion.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Various sources have sought to consider the educational interventions that foster changes in perception of and attitudes toward nature, with the ultimate intent of understanding how education can be used to encourage environmentally responsible behaviours. With these in mind, the current study identified an outdoor environmental education program incorporating these empirically supported interventions, and assessed its ability to influence environmental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. Specifically, this study considered the following research questions:&#xD;
1) To what degree can participation in this outdoor education program foster environmental knowledge and encourage pro-environmental attitudes and self-reported pro-environmental behaviours? &#xD;
2) How is this effect different among students of different genders, and those who have different prior experiences in nature?&#xD;
	Two motivational frameworks guided inquiry in the current study: the Value-Belief-Norm Model of Environmentalism (VBN) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The study employed a quantitative survey methodology, combining contemporary data measuring knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours with archived data collected by program staff, reflecting frequency of environmentally responsible behaviour. Further, a single qualitative item was included for which students provided “the first three words that [came] to mind when [they] think of the word nature.” Terms provided before and after the program were compared for differences in theme to detect subtle or underlying changes.&#xD;
Quantitative results indicated no significant change in student knowledge or attitudes through the outdoor environmental education program.  However, a significant change in self-reported behaviour was identified from both the contemporary and archived data. This agreement in positive findings across the two data sets, collected using different measures and different participants, lends evidence of the program’s ability to encourage self-reported pro-environmental behaviour. Further, qualitative results showed some change in students’ perceptions of nature through the program, providing direction for future research. &#xD;
These findings suggest that this particular outdoor education program was successful in encouraging students’ self-reported environmentally responsible behaviour.  This change was achieved without significant change in knowledge or environmental attitudes, suggesting that external factors not measured in this study might have played a role in affecting behaviour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cette thèse analyse la manifestation de la tradition dans certains textes des écrivains migrants au Québec, nommément La Québécoite et L’Immense fatigue des pierres de Régine Robin, Comment faire l’amour avec un nègre sans se fatiguer, Cette grenade dans la main du jeune nègre est-elle une arme ou un fruit ?, Pays sans chapeau et L’Énigme du retour de Dany Laferrière et, enfin L’Ingratitude et Immobile de Ying Chen.  Les références à des récits, à des croyances et à des pratiques collectives qui se trouvent dans ces textes signalent une transformation de la transmission de l’héritage culturel d’une génération à l’autre.  Afin de parvenir à une meilleure compréhension des liens entre la mémoire collective et la communauté culturelle se définissant dans le présent, je me sers du travail de folkloristes comme Alan Dundes, Simon Bronner et Richard Handler de même que des théories sur la faculté de la tradition proposées par Paul Ricœur, Walter Benjamin et Pierre Nora.  Dans la première partie de la thèse, j’étudie l’imaginaire populaire du XIXe siècle et son incorporation dans la littérature canadienne-française de l’époque.  Ensuite, j’analyse la remise en question de la tradition – de même que le rôle sous-jacent qu’elle continue de jouer, lors de la Révolution tranquille.  Par rapport à ces deux périodes précédentes, l’usage du folklore chez les auteurs migrants laisse présager une nouvelle opération de la tradition dans un contexte où plusieurs groupes culturels se rencontrent.  Dans un contexte pluraliste, l’idée de la communauté culturelle est fabriquée en fonction de notre appartenance à plusieurs groupes.  Je m’intéresse à comment les gens qui habitent ensemble formulent des liens au passé même dans une situation dans laquelle ils ne partagent pas les mêmes rapports à la mémoire collective.  Explorant le renouvellement, qui peut sembler paradoxal, de la tradition, je forme l’hypothèse qu’il est possible pour un groupe de se définir en fonction de valeurs culturelles puisées dans un passé collectif qui s’adaptent constamment à la réalité actuelle.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) plays an essential role in reward-related incentive learning, whereby neutral stimuli gain the ability to elicit approach and other responses. In an incentive learning paradigm called conditioned activity, animals receive a stimulant drug in a specific environment over the course of several days. When then placed in that environment drug-free, they generally display a conditioned hyperactive response. Modulating DA transmission at different time points during the paradigm has been shown to disrupt or enhance conditioning effects. For instance, blocking DA D2 receptors before sessions generally impedes the acquisition of conditioned activity. To date, no studies have examined the role of D2 receptors in the consolidation phase of conditioned activity; this phase occurs immediately after acquisition and involves the stabilization of memories for long-term storage. To investigate this possible role, I trained Wistar rats (N = 108) in the conditioned activity paradigm produced by amphetamine (2.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) to examine the effects of the D2 antagonist haloperidol (doses 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, &amp; 2.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) administered 5 min after conditioning sessions. Two positive control groups received haloperidol 1 h before conditioning sessions (doses 1.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg). The results revealed that post-session haloperidol at all doses tested did not disrupt the consolidation of conditioned activity, while pre-session haloperidol at 2.0 mg/kg prevented acquisition, with the 1.0 mg/kg group trending toward a block. Additionally, post-session haloperidol did not diminish activity during conditioning days, unlike pre-session haloperidol. One possible reason for these findings is that the consolidation phase may have begun earlier than when haloperidol was administered, since the conditioned activity paradigm uses longer learning sessions than those generally used in consolidation studies. Future studies may test if conditioned activity can be achieved with shorter sessions; if so, haloperidol would then be re-tested at an earlier time point. D2 receptor second messenger systems may also be investigated in consolidation. Since drug-related incentive stimuli can evoke cravings in those with drug addiction, a better understanding of the mechanisms of incentive learning may lead to the development of solutions for these individuals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the corpse as an object in and of American hardboiled detective fiction written between 1920 and 1950.  I deploy several theoretical frames, including narratology, body-as-text theory, object relations theory, and genre theory, in order to demonstrate the significance of objects, symbols, and things primarily in the clever and crafty work of Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) and Raymond Chandler (1888-1959), but also touching on the writings of their lesser known accomplices. I construct a literary genealogy of American hardboiled detective fiction originating in the writings of Edgar Allan Poe, compare the contributions of classic or Golden Age detective fiction in England, and describe the socio-economic contexts, particularly the predominance of the “pulps,” that gave birth to the realism of the Hardboiled School. Taking seriously Chandler’s obsession with the art of murder, I engage with how authors pre-empt their readers’ knowledge of the tricks of the trade and manipulate their expectations, as well as discuss the characteristics and effect of the inimitable hardboiled style, its sharpshooting language and deadpan humour. Critical scholarship has rarely addressed the body and figure of the corpse, preferring to focus instead on the machinations of the femme fatale, the performance of masculinity, or the prevalence of violence. I cast new light on the world of hardboiled detective fiction by dissecting the corpse as the object that both motivates and de-composes (or rots away from) the narrative that makes it signify.  I treat the corpse as an inanimate object, indifferent to representation, that destabilizes the integrity and self-possession, as well as the ratiocination, of the detective who authors the narrative of how the corpse came to be.  The corpse is all deceptive and dangerous surface rather than the container of hidden depths of life and meaning that the detective hopes to uncover and reconstruct. I conclude with a chapter that is both critical denouement and creative writing experiment to reveal the self-reflexive (and at times metafictional) dimensions of hardboiled fiction.  My dissertation, too, in the manner of hardboiled fiction, hopes to incriminate my readers as much as enlighten them.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Feminist movements have allowed many female authors to become decisive and influential figures in literary history by studying their experiences, voices and forms of resistance. This thesis, however, focuses specifically on religious women, those seeking divine comfort outside the confines of institutional laws, or those who, out of protest, are caught in the middle. Founded on historical and feminist perspectives, this study examines the heterodox resistance of six French women living within or outside of Church boundaries during the 17th and 18th centuries: two eras that are particularly significant for women’s progress and modernity. This work strives to demonstrate how these women, doubly subjected to Church discourse and that of society, managed to live out their vocation (female and Christian) and make social, cultural and religious statements that contributed to changing the place of women in society. It aims to grasp the similarities and differences between the actions and ideas of women belonging to both the religious and secular spheres. Regardless of the century, the space and their background, women resist to masculine, patriarchal, ecclesial, political and social mediation and institutions. In locating examples of how they oppose the practices, rules and constraints that are imposed upon them, as well as of their exclusion from the socio-political space, this thesis also seeks to identify epistemological changes that mark the transition from the 17th to the 18th century. &#xD;
This thesis firstly outlines the necessary feminist theory upon which the project is based before identifying the evolution of women’s positions within the socio-ideological and political framework in which they lived. The questions of confession and spiritual direction are of particular interest since they serve as prime examples of masculine mediation and its issues and consequences – most notably the control of the female body and mind. The illustration of bodily metamorphoses bear testament to ideological changes, cultural awareness and female subjectivity, just as the scriptural inscriptions of unorthodox ideas and writing. The female body, both object and subject of the quest for individual and collective liberties, attests, in this way, to the movement towards Enlightenment values of freedom and justice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Global air surface temperatures and precipitation have increased over the last several decades resulting in a trend of greening across the Circumpolar Arctic. The spatial variability of warming and the inherent effects on plant communities has not proven to be uniform or homogeneous on global or local scales. We can apply remote sensing vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map and monitor vegetation change (e.g., phenology, greening, percent cover, and biomass) over time. It is important to document how Arctic vegetation is changing, as it will have large implications related to global carbon and surface energy budgets.&#xD;
The research reported here examined vegetation greening across different spatial and temporal scales at two disparate Arctic sites: Apex River Watershed (ARW), Baffin Island, and Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, NU. To characterize the vegetation in the ARW, high spatial resolution WorldView-2 data were processed to create a supervised land-cover classification and model percent vegetation cover (PVC) (a similar process had been completed in a previous study for the CBAWO). Meanwhile, NDVI data spanning the past 30 years were derived from intermediate resolution Landsat data at the two Arctic sites. The land-cover classifications at both sites were used to examine the Landsat NDVI time series by vegetation class. Climate variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation and growing season length (GSL) were examined to explore the potential relationships of NDVI to climate warming. &#xD;
PVC was successfully modeled using high resolution data in the ARW. PVC and plant communities appear to reside along a moisture and altitudinal gradient. The NDVI time series demonstrated an overall significant increase in greening at the CBAWO (High Arctic site), specifically in the dry and mesic vegetation type. However, similar overall greening was not observed for the ARW (Low Arctic site). The overall increase in NDVI at the CBAWO was attributed to a significant increase in July temperatures, precipitation and GSL.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Traditionally, ice-binding proteins (IBPs), also known as antifreeze proteins (AFPs), have been defined by two universal activities: ice recrystallization inhibition and thermal hysteresis. However, there remains the possibility IBPs have other complementary functions given the diversity found within this protein group. This thesis explores some of these in both natural and applied settings, in the hopes of furthering our understanding of this remarkable group of proteins.&#xD;
	Plant IBPs could function as part of a defensive strategy against ice nucleators produced by certain pathogens. To assess this hypothesis, recombinant IBPs from perennial ryegrass and purple false brome were combined with the ice nucleation protein (INP) from the plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae.  Strikingly, the plant proteins depressed the freezing point of the bacterial INP, while a fish AFP could not, nor did the INPs have any effect on IBP activity. Thus, the interaction between these two different proteins suggests a role in plant defensive strategies against pathogenic bacteria as another IBP function.&#xD;
	In addition, the potential use of hyperactive insect IBPs in organ preservation was investigated. Current kidney preservation techniques involve storing the organ at 4 °C for a maximum of 24 h prior to transplantation. Extending this “safe” time would have profound effects on renal transplants, however, ischemic injury is prevalent when storage periods are prolonged. Experiments described here allowed subzero preservation for 72 h with the addition of a beetle IBP to CryoStasis® solution. Kidneys stored using the traditional technique for 24 h and the method developed here for 72 h showed similar levels of biomarker enzymes, underscoring the potential utility of insect IBPs for future transplant purposes.&#xD;
	Finally, IBP function in the freeze-tolerant gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis, was examined. Larvae representing the mid-autumn stage displayed ice-binding activity, suggesting an IBP is being expressed, possibly as a protective measure against freezing damage when fall temperatures can unpredictably drop. IBP activity was also observed in the larvae’s host plant, Solidago spp. Mass spectrometry analysis of ice-affinity purified plant extracts provided three candidate pathogenesis-related proteins that could be responsible for the detected activity, further demonstrating additional functions of IBPs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines two ongoing development projects that received financial support from international development organizations, and an alternative mining tax proposed by the academia. &#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 2 explores the impact of commoditization of coffee on its export price in Ethiopia. The first part of the chapter traces how the Ethiopian’s current coffee trade system and commoditization come to be. Using regression analysis, the second part tests and confirms the hypothesis that commoditization has led to a reduction in coffee export price.   &#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 3 conducts a cost-benefit analysis on a controversial, liquefied natural gas export project in Peru that sought to export one-third of the country’s proven natural gas reserves. While the country can receive royalty and corporate income tax in the short and medium term, these benefits are dwarfed by the future costs of paying for alternative energy after gas depletion. The conclusion is robust for a variety of future energy-price and energy-demand scenarios.     &#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 4 quantifies through simulation the economic distortions of two common mining taxes, the royalty and ad-valorem tax, vis-à-vis the resource rent tax. The latter is put forward as a better mining tax instrument on account of its non-distortionary nature. The rent tax, however, necessitates additional administrative burdens and induces tax-avoidance behavior, both leading to a net loss of tax revenue. By quantifying the distortions of royalty and the ad-valorem tax, one can establish the maximum loss that can be incurred by the rent tax. Simulation results indicate that the distortion of the ad-valorem tax is quite modest. If implemented, the rent tax is likely to result in a greater loss.  &#xD;
 &#xD;
While the subject matters may appear diverse, they are united by one theme. These initiatives were endorsed and supported by authorities and development agencies in the aim of furthering economic development and efficiency, but they are unlikely to fulfill the goal. Lessons for international development can be learnt from successful stories as well as from unsuccessful ones.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>At the Merrick Landfill, located outside of North Bay (Ontario, CA), an investigation into the potential for an environmental impact to the Little Sturgeon River as a result of landfill leachate discharge was undertaken using toxicity testing using 96 hour acute lethality on Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout). Landfill leachate may present a risk to receiving environments as it is comprised of an array of chemicals including organics, ammonia, and metals. Testing was conducted in three phases, firstly testing was completed on site throughout an existing natural attenuation zone where the presence of several groundwater seeps down gradient of the site had been identified to determine the effectiveness of the existing leachate control features at reducing the environmental risks.  These tests indicated that the existing capture strategies were largely effective at reducing toxicity risks to the receiving environment. Testing was also completed on two pilot-scale hybrid-passive treatment systems to determine their effectiveness for leachate treatment.  Summer performance of a constructed gravel wetland system was also shown to be effective at reducing the toxicity of the landfill leachate at the site. Lastly in order to support  evaluation of leachate treatment requirements, a toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) was performed to determine the principle cause of toxicity within the leachate.  Based on water chemistry analyses of samples collected at various locations at the site, the TIE identified ammonia toxicity as the primary source of toxicity in the leachate, with a secondary focus on metal toxicity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Measurement of joint kinematics can provide knowledge to help improve joint prosthesis&#xD;
design, as well as identify joint motion patterns that may lead to joint degeneration&#xD;
or injury. More investigation into how the hip translates in live human subjects during&#xD;
high amplitude motions is needed. This work presents a design of a non-invasive&#xD;
method using the registration between images from conventional Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
Imaging (MRI) and open MRI to calculate three dimensional hip joint kinematics.&#xD;
The method was tested on a single healthy subject in three different poses. MRI&#xD;
protocols for the conventional gantry, high-resolution MRI and the open gantry, lowresolution&#xD;
MRI were developed. The scan time for the low-resolution protocol was&#xD;
just under 6 minutes. High-resolution meshes and low resolution contours were derived&#xD;
from segmentation of the high-resolution and low-resolution images, respectively.&#xD;
Low-resolution contours described the poses as scanned, whereas the meshes&#xD;
described the bones’ geometries. The meshes and contours were registered to each&#xD;
other, and joint kinematics were calculated. The segmentation and registration were&#xD;
performed for both cortical and sub-cortical bone surfaces. A repeatability study was&#xD;
performed by comparing the kinematic results derived from three users’ segmentations&#xD;
of the sub-cortical bone surfaces from a low-resolution scan. The root mean&#xD;
squared error of all registrations was below 1.92mm. The maximum range between segmenters in translation magnitude was 0.95mm, and the maximum deviation from the average of all orientations was 1.27◦.&#xD;
This work demonstrated that this method for non-invasive measurement of hip&#xD;
kinematics is promising for measuring high-range-of-motion hip motions in vivo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The use of nanoparticle technology in consumer products has been increasing due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. Specifically, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can demonstrate distinct physiochemical properties compared to bulk silver, including a large surface area to volume ratio that allows for higher reactivity with bacterial cell surfaces.  AgNPs are being released into the environment, including soil ecosystems through various pathways such as points of production or during disposal of silver-containing products.  This raises the concern about the potential impact on beneficial soil bacteria and their surrounding ecosystems.  Members of the Rhizobiaceae family play important roles in nutrient cycling and contribute to overall soil fertility and the experiments in this thesis address the potential for AgNP-mediated toxicity on these plant-associating bacteria.  Respiration analysis of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Azospirillum brasilense, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens has revealed that AgNPs can negatively impact the growth and survival of these bacterial species, with B. japonicum being the most susceptible.  Additionally, swimming motility assays using B. japonicum showed a significant decrease in colony diameter when treated with AgNPs (50 ppm). A significant decrease in root colonization of Triticum aestivum roots by A. brasilense was observed as AgNP treatment concentrations increased. Although some of the experiments could not be completed, taken together, these experiments and the research reported herein highlights the potential toxicological effects of AgNPs on bacterial species vital to the growth and health of agriculturally important crops.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Locomotor recovery from anoxia is complicated and little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating anoxic recovery in Drosophila. For this thesis I established a protocol for large-scale analysis of locomotor activity in adult flies with exposure to a transient anoxia. Using this protocol I observed that wild-type Canton-S flies recovered faster and more consistently from anoxia than the white-eyed mutant w1118, which carries a null allele of w1118 in an isogenic genetic background. Both Canton-S and w1118 are commonly used controls in the Drosophila community. Genetic analysis including serial backcrossing, RNAi knockdown, w+ duplication to Y chromosome as well as gene mutation revealed a strong association between the white gene and the timing of locomotor recovery. I also found that the locomotor recovery phenotype is independent of white-associated eye pigmentation, that heterozygous w+ allele was haplo-insufficient to induce fast and consistent locomotor recovery from anoxia in female flies, and that mini-white is insufficient to promote fast and consistent locomotor recovery. Moreover, locomotor recovery was delayed in flies with RNAi knockdown of white in subsets of serotonin neurons in the central nervous system. I further demonstrated that mutations of phosphodiesterase genes (PDE) displayed wild-type-like fast and consistent locomotor recovery, and that locomotor recovery was light-sensitive in the night in w1118. The delayed locomotor recovery and the light sensitivity were eliminated in PDE mutants that were dual-specific or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific. Up-regulation of cGMP using multiple approaches including PDE mutation, sildenafil feeding or specific expression of an atypical soluble guanylyl cyclase (Gyc88E) was sufficient to suppress w-RNAi induced delay of locomotor recovery. Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that White transports cGMP and promotes fast and consistent locomotor recovery from anoxia.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Far-field stresses are those present in a volume of rock prior to excavations being created. Estimates of the orientation and magnitude of far-field stresses, often used in mine design, are generally obtained by single-point measurements of stress, or large-scale, regional trends. Point measurements can be a poor representation of far-field stresses as a result of excavation-induced stresses and geological structures. For these reasons, far-field stress estimates can be associated with high levels of uncertainty.&#xD;
The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the practical feasibility, applications, and limitations of calibrating far-field stress estimates through tunnel deformation measurements captured using LiDAR imaging. A method that estimates the orientation and magnitude of excavation-induced principal stress changes through back-analysis of deformation measurements from LiDAR imaged tunnels was developed and tested using synthetic data. If excavation-induced stress change orientations and magnitudes can be accurately estimated, they can be used in the calibration of far-field stress input to numerical models. LiDAR point clouds have been proven to have a number of underground applications, thus it is desired to explore their use in numerical model calibration.&#xD;
The back-analysis method is founded on the superposition of stresses and requires a two-dimensional numerical model of the deforming tunnel. Principal stress changes of known orientation and magnitude are applied to the model to create calibration curves. Estimation can then be performed by minimizing squared differences between the measured tunnel and sets of calibration curve deformations. In addition to the back-analysis estimation method, a procedure consisting of previously existing techniques to measure tunnel deformation using LiDAR imaging was documented.&#xD;
Under ideal conditions, the back-analysis method estimated principal stress change orientations within ±5° and magnitudes within ±2 MPa. Results were comparable for four different tunnel profile shapes. Preliminary testing using plastic deformation, a rough tunnel profile, and profile occlusions suggests that the method can work under more realistic conditions. The results from this thesis set the groundwork for the continued development of a new, inexpensive, and efficient far-field stress estimate calibration method.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goals of this program of research were to examine the link between self-reported vulvar pain and clinical diagnoses, and to create a user-friendly assessment tool to aid in that process. These goals were undertaken through a series of four empirical studies (Chapters 2-6): one archival study, two online studies, and one study conducted in a Women’s Health clinic. In Chapter 2, the link between self-report and clinical diagnosis was confirmed by extracting data from multiple studies conducted in the Sexual Health Research Laboratory over the course of several years. We demonstrated the accuracy of diagnosis based on multiple factors, and explored the varied gynecological presentation of different diagnostic groups. Chapter 3 was based on an online study designed to create the Vulvar Pain Assessment Questionnaire (VPAQ) inventory. Following the construct validation approach, a large pool of potential items was created to capture a broad selection of vulvar pain symptoms. Nearly 300 participants completed the entire item pool, and a series of factor analyses were utilized to narrow down the items and create scales/subscales. Relationships were computed among subscales and validated scales to establish convergent and discriminant validity. Chapters 4 and 5 were conducted in the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. The brief screening version of the VPAQ was employed with patients of the Program in Vulvar Health at the Center for Women’s Health. The accuracy and usefulness of the VPAQscreen was determined from the perspective of patients as well as their health care providers, and the treatment-seeking experiences of patients was explored. Finally, a second online study was conducted to confirm the factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the VPAQ inventory. The results presented in these chapters confirm the link between targeted questions and accurate diagnoses, and provide a guideline that is useful and accessible for providers and patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We investigated whether children’s inhibitory control is associated with their ability to produce irregular verb forms as well as learn from corrective feedback following their use of an over-regularized form. Forty-eight 3.5 to 4.5 year old children were tested on the irregular past tense and provided with adult corrective input via models of correct use or recasts of errors following ungrammatical responses. Inhibitory control was assessed with a three-item battery of tasks that required suppressing a prepotent response in favor of a non-canonical one. Results showed that inhibitory control was predictive of children’s initial production of irregular forms and not associated with their post-feedback production of irregulars. These findings show that children’s executive functioning skills may be a rate-limiting factor on their ability to produce correct forms, but might not interact with their ability to learn from input in this domain. Findings are discussed in terms of current theories of past-tense acquisition and learning from input more broadly.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The electric vehicle (EV) market has seen a rapid growth in the recent past. With an increase in the number of electric vehicles on road, there is an increase in the number of high capacity battery banks interfacing the grid. The battery bank of an EV, besides being the fuel tank, is also a huge energy storage unit. Presently, it is used only when the vehicle is being driven and remains idle for rest of the time, rendering it underutilized. Whereas on the other hand, there is a need of large energy storage units in the grid to filter out the fluctuations of supply and demand during a day. EVs can help bridge this gap. The EV battery bank can be used to store the excess energy from the grid to vehicle (G2V) or supply stored energy from the vehicle to grid (V2G ), when required. To let power flow happen, in both directions, a bidirectional AC-DC converter is required. This thesis concentrates on the bidirectional AC-DC converters which have a control on power flow in all four quadrants for the application of EV battery interfacing with the grid.&#xD;
This thesis presents a bidirectional interleaved full bridge converter topology. This helps in increasing the power processing and current handling capability of the converter which makes it suitable for the purpose of EVs. Further, the benefit of using the interleaved topology is that it increases the power density of the converter. This ensures optimization of space usage with the same power handling capacity. The proposed interleaved converter consists of two full bridges. The corresponding gate pulses of each switch, in one cell, are phase shifted by 180 degrees from those of the other cell.&#xD;
The proposed converter control is based on the one-cycle controller. To meet the challenge of new requirements of reactive power handling capabilities for grid connected converters, posed by the utilities, the controller is modified to make it suitable to process the reactive power. A fictitious current derived from the grid voltage is introduced in the controller, which controls the converter performance. The current references are generated using the second order generalized integrators (SOGI) and phase locked loop (PLL). A digital implementation of the proposed control ii&#xD;
scheme is developed and implemented using DSP hardware. The simulated and experimental results, based on the converter topology and control technique discussed here, are presented to show the performance of the proposed theory.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is well-documented that social networking sites such as Facebook set the stage for social comparison. Such comparison has been linked to a number of negative outcomes including envy, negative moods, and lower self-esteem. The present research aims to extend current understanding of online social comparison by investigating how it pertains to romantic relationships. I hypothesized that for individuals high in attachment anxiety (compared to those low in this construct), online romantic social comparison might be related to negative consequences—which, in the current project, was operationalized as lower mood/affect and state self-esteem. Further, I hypothesized that there would be an interaction between attachment anxiety and relationship insecurities on these negative outcomes, such that the expected difference of attachment anxiety would be more pronounced under conditions priming relationship insecurities, relative to a control condition. Two experiments were conducted, one of which focused on single individuals, and the second focusing on individuals who were themselves in dating relationships. The paradigms of each entailed experimental manipulation of a key relationship-related variable (for single individuals, pessimism for future relationships; for dating individuals, the presence or absence of rejection threat), subsequent exposure to romantic content from Facebook, and finally, measures of affect and state self-esteem. I discovered partial support for the hypothesis that some single individuals—particularly those with higher, rather than lower, attachment anxiety—do indeed report feeling more negative moods and lower state self-esteem following exposure to romantic online content, in contrast to single individuals who had instead viewed neutral online content. The association between attachment anxiety and negative outcome was especially pertinent if individuals had been primed to believe that their own future romantic prospects were grim, or if attention had been drawn to their singleness. Among dating individuals, less support for hypotheses was found; however, exploratory post-hoc analyses revealed a promising (albeit weak) trend indicating that reinvestigation of the current hypotheses would be prudent.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Mycenaean Greeks are often assumed to have been in contact with the civilizations of the Mediterranean throughout the Late Bronze Age. The extent of this contact however is not as clearly understood, and the archaeological evidence that has survived provides a sample of what must have exchanged hands. This thesis will examine the archaeological, textual and iconographic evidence from a number of sites and sources, from the Anatolian plains to the Kingdom of Egypt and major settlements in-between during the Late Bronze Age to examine what trade may have looked like for the Mycenaeans. Due to the extensive finds in some regions and a lack of evidence in others, this paper will also try to understand the relationship between the Mycenaeans and other cultures to determine whether a trade embargo was enacted on the Mycenaeans by the Central Anatolian Hittites during this period, or whether other factors contributed to the paucity of objects in Central Anatolia.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation relates job desires and outcomes to the Dark Personality (Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Low Agreeableness, Low Honesty-Humility) in the United States Army.  It purports that individuals high on the Dark Personality desire more power, money, and status, and that they obtain jobs that afford them these luxuries by using manipulation at work.  Two pilot studies used samples of United States Army members to create and test index variables: Dark Personality, Total Manipulation in the workplace, Desire for Job Success, and Total Job Success in the Army.  Individual personality traits, manipulation tactics, and job desires were examined in secondary analyses.&#xD;
Using a sample of 468 United States Army Members, central analyses indicated that Army members high on the Dark Personality desired Job Success.  Likewise, army members higher on the Dark Personality used more Manipulation tactics at work, including the egregious tactics.  Yet, using more Manipulation tactics at work predicted lower levels of Job Success in the Army.  Most manipulation tactics had a negative impact on Job Success, with the exception of soft tactics like Reason and Responsibility Invocation.  Together, these results indicate that selective use of soft manipulation predicted Job Success, but use of more manipulation tactics predicted less Job Success in the Army.  Curvilinear results indicated that being either very low or very high on the Dark Personality predicted more Job Success in the Army, whereas having intermediate levels of the Dark Personality predicted less Job Success.  Finally, possessing the Dark Personality and using more Manipulation tactics at work, together, predicted less Job Success in the Army.  &#xD;
Collectively, the results indicate that army members with intermediate levels of the Dark Personality want more powerful and high paying jobs, yet their strategy of manipulating their coworkers to move up the job ladder does not result in higher ranking, higher paying Army positions.  However, Army members highest on the Dark Personality achieved job success, defying the maladaptive influence that antisocial personality traits and manipulative behaviour had on job success for most Army members. Therefore, this dissertation indicates that successful corporate scoundrels exist in the Army, but there are few of them.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) is a promising biomaterial for soft tissue regeneration, and it provides a highly conducive microenvironment for human adipose-derived stem/stromal cell (ASC) attachment, proliferation, and adipogenesis. This thesis focused on developing techniques to fabricate 3-D bioscaffolds from enzymatically-digested DAT as platforms for ASC culture and delivery in adipose tissue engineering and large-scale ASC expansion. Initial work investigated chemically crosslinked microcarriers fabricated from pepsin-digested DAT as injectable adipo-inductive substrates for ASCs. DAT microcarriers highly supported ASC adipogenesis compared to gelatin microcarriers in a CELLSPIN system, as confirmed by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity, lipid accumulation, and endpoint RT-PCR. ASCs cultured on DAT microcarriers in proliferation medium also had elevated PPARγ, C/EBPα, and LPL expression which suggested adipo-inductive properties. In vivo testing of the DAT microcarriers exhibited stable volume retention and enhanced cellular infiltration, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. Building from this work, non-chemically crosslinked porous foams and bead foams were fabricated from α-amylase-digested DAT for soft tissue regeneration. Foams were stable and strongly supported ASC adipogenesis based on GPDH activity and endpoint RT-PCR. PPARγ, C/EBPα, and LPL expression in ASCs cultured on the foams in proliferation media indicated adipo-inductive properties. Foams with Young’s moduli similar to human fat also influenced ASC adipogenesis by enhanced GPDH activity. In vivo adipogenesis accompanied by a potent angiogenic response and rapid resorption showed their potential use in wound healing applications. Finally, non-chemically crosslinked porous microcarriers synthesized from α-amylase-digested DAT were investigated for ASC expansion. DAT microcarriers remained stable in culture and supported significantly higher ASC proliferation compared to Cultispher-S microcarriers in a CELLSPIN system. ASC immunophenotype was preserved for all expanded groups, with reduced adhesion marker expression under dynamic conditions. DAT microcarrier expansion upregulated ASC expression of early adipogenic (PPARγ, LPL) and chondrogenic (COMP) markers without inducing a mature phenotype. DAT microcarrier expanded ASCs also showed similar levels of adipogenesis and osteogenesis compared to Cultispher-S despite a significantly higher population fold-change, and had the highest level of chondrogenesis among all groups. This study demonstrates the promising use of DAT microcarriers as a clinically relevant strategy for ASC expansion while maintaining multilineage differentiation capacity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background&#xD;
Many breast cancer survivors continue to have a broad range of physical and psychosocial problems after breast cancer treatment. As cancer centres move forward with earlier discharge of stable breast cancer survivors to primary care follow-up it is important that comprehensive evidence-based breast cancer survivorship care is implemented to effectively address these needs. Research suggests primary care providers are willing to provide breast cancer survivorship care but many lack the knowledge and confidence to provide evidence-based care. &#xD;
Purpose&#xD;
	The overall purpose of this thesis was to determine the challenges, strengths and opportunities related to implementing comprehensive evidence-based breast cancer survivorship guidelines by primary care physicians and nurse practitioners in southeastern Ontario. &#xD;
Methods&#xD;
This mixed-methods research was conducted in three phases: (1) synthesis and appraisal of clinical practice guidelines relevant to provision of breast cancer survivorship care within the primary care practice setting; (2) a brief quantitative survey of primary care providers to determine actual practices related to provision of evidence-based breast cancer survivorship care; and (3) individual interviews with primary care providers about the challenges, strengths and opportunities related to provision of comprehensive evidence-based breast cancer survivorship care. &#xD;
Results and Conclusions&#xD;
In the first phase, a comprehensive clinical practice framework was created to guide provision of breast cancer survivorship care and consisted of a one-page checklist outlining breast cancer survivorship issues relevant to primary care, a three-page summary of key recommendations, and a one-page list of guideline sources. The second phase identified several knowledge and practice gaps, and it was determined that guideline implementation rates were higher for recommendations related to prevention and surveillance aspects of survivorship care and lowest related to screening for and management of long-term effects. The third phase identified three major challenges to providing breast cancer survivorship care: inconsistent educational preparation, provider anxieties, and primary care burden; and three major strengths or opportunities to facilitate implementation of survivorship care guidelines: tools and technology, empowering survivors, and optimizing nursing roles. A better understanding of these challenges, strengths and opportunities will inform development of targeted knowledge translation interventions to provide support and education to primary care providers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Studying abroad is generally viewed as an opportunity for personal and educational transformation for students. In recent years, various studies have been conducted in the area of study abroad. Most of these studies primarily involve quantitative analyses, and do not fully explore the lived experience of this opportunity. Recently, researchers have started exploring the qualitative aspects and impact of studying abroad, but from an external perspective. This study attends to the phenomenon of a foreign curricular experience from an insider’s perspective and explicates the experience through a personal narrative. &#xD;
Countries usually have educational curricula that serve their particular needs. The rise of the number of students studying abroad has made study abroad a lucrative industry but it has also increasingly exposed foreign students to curricula that are different than those of their countries of origin. Subjecting students to dissimilar, and sometimes competing, curricula interrupts their habitual ways of knowing and being. My study is a qualitative study that explores the foreign curricular experience of one Pakhtun student. &#xD;
Specifically, through an autobiography, this study aims to explore how a foreign curricular experience acts as a ‘transitional space’ for a student and how it deeply affects her learning self and identity. This study contributes to the body of literature on the effects of a foreign curriculum on study abroad students by adding narrative to explain the lived experience of studying abroad.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Participation in organized activities is associated with many markers of positive youth development (PYD) such as improved self-esteem, social competence, and academic achievement (Mahoney et al., 2009). Sport is an extra-curricular activity that is particularly popular among youth, as nearly three quarters of Canadian children and adolescents are engaged in organized sport or physical activity (CFLRI, 2012). Much of the research in this area has examined sport programs which are explicitly structured to promote life skills or PYD outcomes; however, the sustainability of such programs has recently been called into question (Turnnidge, Hancock, &amp; Côté, 2014).  The purpose of this program of research was to conduct an in-depth case study of a successful, sustainable community youth basketball league.&#xD;
Study 1 was a qualitative descriptive exploration of coaches’ perceptions of the basketball league. This study provided a general overview of the structure and perceived benefits of the league, from the perspective of current coaches. Coaches highlighted the unique emphasis that the league places on fun and positive immediate sport experiences. &#xD;
Study 2 expanded on selected themes from Study 1, namely, the salience of the league’s culture and tendency for former players to return to the league as volunteers. This study used an ethnographic approach wherein the first author volunteered as an assistant coach on a basketball team over the course of a six-month season. This approach enabled him to gain considerable first hand insight into the organizational culture of the basketball league. &#xD;
The third and final study adopted a quantitative approach using both systematic observation and questionnaires to investigate the relationship between PYD outcomes and observed athlete behaviour during basketball games. A cluster analysis revealed the presence of two distinct groups of athletes characterized by relatively high and low perceptions of PYD outcomes, which were also associated with varying behavioural characteristics during competition. &#xD;
The results of these three studies provide a detailed blueprint of a successful youth sport program that has been sustained over 60 years. While not without limitations, many characteristics of the league should prove useful in structuring youth sport programs in other contexts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sex workers are members of our communities, whether they are local or national communities. In law, mainstream media representations, and research sex workers are positioned as outside of or in opposition to communities. Even within marginalized communities sex workers are excluded when appeals to respectability politics are made. In this thesis I analyze three analytic sites from three areas of social life. The first chapter performs a textual analysis of The Bedford Decision (2013) and the resulting Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act (2014) as an examination of law. The second chapter is an analysis of filmic discourse on community, sex workers, and violence in the mainstream film London Road (2015) as an examination of mainstream media. The third chapter draws upon empirical research, i.e. in-depth interviews with three current and former sex workers in Ottawa, Canada and analyzes the transcripts using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to center how sex workers’ understanding of their work, community, and the laws and policies that are supposed govern and protect them. In my preface and conclusion I discuss some of the ethical dilemmas I encountered while conducting this research. My findings suggest that sex workers are being positioned and understood as outside of communities in ways that contribute to violence against sex workers. The implications of this research suggest that people who speak in the name of communities—communities in the sense of local neighborhood communities, activist communities, and national communities—need to recognize that sex workers are part of their communities and be accountable to ensuring they are treated as members. Researchers who conduct research on sex work and sex workers need to be accountable to their participants and the impacts their research may have on laws and policies. Sex workers are an over-researched population yet their voices are largely misappropriated or silenced in popular research and policy debates.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Climate warming is predicted to increase summer air temperatures in the Arctic, warming soils and enhancing microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. Given the size of the soil carbon stores in the Arctic, even a fraction of its release as CO2 to the atmosphere could result in a positive feedback to climate warming. Fertilizers have been used in the past to quickly increase soil solution nutrients pools to mimic predicted concentrations under climate warming. However, because it may have inadvertent affects on the soil microbial community, fertilizer-induced patterns in microbial decomposition may be unrealistic. This study aimed to better understand the proposed mechanism of enhanced microbial decomposition under nutrient addition and warming treatments to discern whether warming alone is enough to stimulate enhanced microbial decomposition, or if nutrients in excess (i.e. chronic high nutrient additions) are necessary to yield such a response. I investigated the impacts of 10 years of greenhouse summer warming, chronic low nutrient factorial addition (5 g N and 1g P m-2 year-1, respectively), and chronic high nutrient factorial addition (10 g N and 5g P m-2 year-1, respectively) treatments on a mesic birch hummock tundra ecosystem near Daring Lake, NWT, Canada. Soil microbial nutrient pools, soil solution nutrient pools, and microbial community structure were measured in the upper organic, lower organic, and uppermost mineral soil depth intervals of all treatment plots in Spring 2014. Interestingly, the low nutrient additions did not yield any significant trends, yet the warming treatment increased soil bacterial richness suggesting a legacy effect of warming from the previous summers. Enhanced microbial nutrient uptake occurred only in the high nutrient addition treatments, and did not significantly alter soil carbon at least within the ten year period of this experiment. Together, these results and the absence of significant impacts of the low nutrient and greenhouse warming treatments suggests that nutrient and carbon cycling in these low arctic soils may be resilient against climate warming, at least over the initial decades.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most prevalent epithelial ovarian cancer characterized by late detection, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Previous studies on the tumour immune microenvironment in HGSC identified STAT1 and CXCL10 as the most differentially expressed genes between treatment naïve chemotherapy resistant and sensitive tumours. Interferon-induced STAT1 is a transcription factor, which induces many genes including tumour suppressor genes and those involved in recruitment of immune cells to the tumour immune microenvironment (TME), including CXCL10. CXCL10 is a chemokine that recruits tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and exhibits angiostatic function. The current study was performed to determine the effects of differential STAT1 and CXCL10 expression on HGSC disease progression and TME. STAT1 expression and intratumoural CD8+ T cells were evaluated as prognostic and predictive biomarkers via immunohistochemistry on 734 HGSC tumours accrued from the Terry Fox Research Institute-Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource. The combined effect of STAT1 expression and CD8+ TIL density was confirmed as prognostic and predictive companion biomarkers in the second independent biomarker validation study. Significant positive correlation between STAT1 expression and intratumoral CD8+ TIL density was observed. The effects of enforced CXCL10 expression on HGSC tumour growth, vasculature and immune tumour microenvironment were studied in the ID8 mouse ovarian cancer cell engraftment in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Significant decrease in tumour progression in mice injected with ID8 CXCL10 overexpressing cells compared to mice injected with ID8 vector control cells was observed. Multiplexed cytokine analysis of ascites showed differential expression of IL-6, VEGF and CXCL9 between the two groups. Endothelial cell marker staining showed differences in tumour vasculature between the two groups. Immune transcriptomic profiling identified distinct expression profiles in genes associated with cytokines, chemokines, interferons, T cell function and apoptosis between the two groups. These findings provide evidence that STAT1 is an independent biomarker and in combination with CD8+ TIL density could be applied as novel immune-based biomarkers in HGSC. These results provide the basis for future studies aimed at understanding mechanisms underlying differential tumour STAT1 and CXCL10 expression and its role in pre-existing tumour immunologic diversity, thus potentially contributing to biomarker guided immune modulatory therapies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Images of domestic textiles (items made at home for consumption within the household) and textile making form an important subtext to women’s writing, both during and after industrialization. Through a close reading of five novels from the period 1811-1925, this thesis will assert that a detailed understanding of textile work and its place in women’s daily lives is critical to a deeper understanding of social, sexual and political issues from a woman’s perspective. The first chapter will explore the history of the relationship between women and domestic textile making, and the changes wrought to the latter by the Industrial Revolution. The second chapter will examine the role of embroidery in the construction of “appropriate” feminine gentility in Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park (1814). The third chapter, on Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford (1853), will explore how the older female body became a repository for anxieties about class mobility and female power at the beginning of the Victorian era. The fourth chapter will compare Sara Jeannette Duncan’s A Social Departure (1890) and Kate Chopin’s The Awakening (1899) to consider how later Victorian women both internalized and refuted public narratives of domestic textile making in a quest for “self-ownership.” The last chapter, on Martha Ostenso’s Wild Geese (1925), examines the corrosive, yet ultimately redemptive, relationships of a family of women trapped by abuse and degradation. For all five authors, images of textiles and textile making allow them to speak to issues that were usually only discussed within a community of women: sexuality, desire, aging, marriage, and motherhood. In all five works, textile making “talks back” to the power structures that marginalize women, and lends insight into the material and emotional circumstances of women’s lives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bullying, frequent drunkenness, and frequent cannabis use are significant health-risk behaviours among youth. While many studies have demonstrated that bullying involvement may initiate a developmental pathway to both types of frequent substance use, there is a limited understanding of the connection between these behaviours. The presence of risk and protective factors within youths’ relationships and within their neighbourhoods may alter the associations between bullying involvement and both types of frequent substance use. A systemic approach is needed to assess the complex, social environments in which youth are embedded. The current thesis consists of two studies that examined the associations between bullying and both types of frequent substance use within the context of youths’ social environments. In Study 1, multilevel modeling was used to examine the associations between bullying and frequent substance use within the context of individual and neighbourhood risk factors. Our results indicated that the risk factors associated with both frequent drunkenness and frequent cannabis use exist at both levels, with neighbourhoods altering the association of individual risk factors. Moreover, bullying was a unique risk factor associated with both types of frequent substance use, whereas indirect associations were observed for victimization. Study 2 used a similar methodology to examine the association between bullying and both types of frequent substance use within the context of individual and neighbourhood protective factors. Once again, our results indicated that the protective factors associated with both types of frequent substance use exist at multiple levels, and that neighbourhoods altered the association of individual protective factors. Additionally, positive relationship characteristics interacted with the link between bullying and both types of frequent substance use. Together, these findings clarify the nature of the bullying-substance use link and emphasize the need to study adolescent development in context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Currently there is no consensus as to the specific cognitive impairments that characterize mathematical disabilities (MD) or specific subtypes such as an arithmetic disability (AD). The present study sought to address this concern by examining cognitive processes that might undergird AD in children. The present study utilized archival data to conduct two investigations. The first investigation examined the executive functioning and working memory of children with AD. An age-matched achievement-matched design was employed to explore whether children with AD exhibit developmental lags or deficits in these cognitive domains. While children with AD did not exhibit impairments in verbal working memory or colour word inhibition, they did demonstrate impairments in shifting attention, visual-spatial working memory, and quantity inhibition. As children with AD did not perform more poorly than their younger achievement-matched peers on any of these tasks, impairments in specific areas of executive functioning and working memory appeared to reflect a developmental lag rather than a cognitive deficit. The second study examined the phonological processing performance of children with AD compared to children with comorbid disabilities in arithmetic and word recognition (AD/WRD) and to typically achieving (TA) children. Results indicated that, while children with AD did demonstrate impairments on all isolated naming speed tasks, trail making digits, and memory for digits, they did not demonstrate impairments on measures of phonological awareness, nonword repetition, serial processing speed, or serial naming speed. In contrast, children with AD/WRD demonstrated impairments on measures of phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory, isolated naming speed, serial processing speed, and the alphabet a-z task. Overall, results suggested that phonological processing impairments are more prominent in children with a WRD than children with an AD. Together, these studies further our understanding of the nature of the cognitive processes that underlie AD by focusing upon rarely used methods (i.e., age-matched achievement-matched design) and under-examined cognitive domains (i.e., phonological processing).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is an important determinant of children’s physical health, and is commonly measured using accelerometers. &#xD;
A major limitation of accelerometers is non-wear time, which is the time the participant did not wear their device. Given that non-wear time is traditionally discarded from the dataset prior to estimating MVPA, final estimates of MVPA may be biased. Therefore, alternate approaches should be explored.&#xD;
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this thesis were to 1) develop and describe an imputation approach that uses the socio-demographic, time, health, and behavioural data from participants to replace non-wear time accelerometer data, 2) determine the extent to which imputation of non-wear time data influences estimates of MVPA, and 3) determine if imputation of non-wear time data influences the associations between MVPA, body mass index (BMI), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). &#xD;
METHODS: Seven days of accelerometer data were collected using Actical accelerometers from 332 children aged 10-13. Three methods for handling missing accelerometer data were compared: 1) the “non-imputed” method wherein non-wear time was deleted from the dataset, 2) imputation dataset I, wherein the imputation of MVPA during non-wear time was based upon socio-demographic factors of the participant (e.g., age), health information (e.g., BMI), and time characteristics of the non-wear period (e.g., season), and 3) imputation dataset II wherein the imputation of MVPA was based upon the same variables as imputation dataset I, plus organized sport information. Associations between MVPA and health outcomes in each method were assessed using linear regression.&#xD;
RESULTS: Non-wear time accounted for 7.5% of epochs during waking hours. The average minutes/day of MVPA was 56.8 (95% CI: 54.2, 59.5) in the non-imputed dataset, 58.4 (95% CI: 55.8, 61.0) in imputed dataset I, and 59.0 (95% CI: 56.3, 61.5) in imputed dataset II. Estimates between datasets were not significantly different. The strength of the relationship between MVPA with BMI and SBP were comparable between all three datasets.&#xD;
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that studies that achieve high accelerometer compliance with unsystematic patterns of missing data can use the traditional approach of deleting non-wear time from the dataset to obtain MVPA measures without substantial bias.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Scientific reading research has produced substantial evidence linking specific reading components to a range of constructs including phonological awareness (PA), morphological awareness, orthographic processing (OP), rapid automatized naming, working memory and vocabulary. There is a paucity of research on Arabic, although 420 million people around the world (Gordon, 2005) speak Arabic. As a Semitic language, Arabic differs in many ways from Indo-European languages. &#xD;
Over the past three decades, literacy research has begun to elucidate the importance of morphological awareness (MA) in reading. Morphology is a salient aspect of Arabic word structure. This study was designed to (a) examine the dimensions underlying MA in Arabic; (b) determine how well MA predicts reading; (c) investigate the role of the standard predictors in different reading outcomes; and (d) investigate the construct of reading in Arabic. This study was undertaken in two phases. &#xD;
In Phase I, 10 MA measures and two reading measures were developed, and tested in a sample of 102 Grade 3 Arabic-speaking children. Factor analysis of the 10 MA tasks yielded one predominant factor supporting the construct validity of MA in Arabic. Hierarchical regression analyses, controlling for age and gender, indicated that the MA factor solution accounted for 41– 43% of the variance in reading. &#xD;
In Phase II, the widely studied predictor measures were developed for PA and OP in addition to one additional measure of MA (root awareness), and three reading measures In Phase II, all measures were administered to another sample of 201 Grade 3 Arabic-speaking children. The construct of reading in Arabic was examined using factor analysis. The joint and unique effects of all standard predictors were examined using different sets of hierarchical regression analyses. Results of Phase II showed that: (a) all five reading measures loaded on one factor; (b) MA consistently accounted for unique variance in reading, particularly in comprehension, above and beyond the standard predictors; and (c) the standard predictors had differential contributions. These findings underscore the contribution of MA to all components of Arabic reading. The need for more emphasis on including morphology in Arabic reading instruction and assessment is discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>How do the magnetic fields of massive stars evolve over time? Are their gyrochronological ages consistent with ages inferred from evolutionary tracks? Why do most stars predicted to host Centrifugal Magnetospheres (CMs) display no H$\alpha$ emission? Does plasma escape from CMs via centrifugal breakout events, or by a steady-state leakage mechanism? This thesis investigates these questions via a population study with a sample of 51 magnetic early B-type stars. The longitudinal magnetic field \bz~was measured from Least Squares Deconvolution profiles extracted from high-resolution spectropolarimetric data. New rotational periods $P_{\rm rot}$ were determined for 15 stars from \bz, leaving only 3 stars for which $P_{\rm rot}$ is unknown. Projected rotational velocities \vsini~were measured from multiple spectral lines. Effective temperatures and surface gravities were measured via ionization balances and line profile fitting of H Balmer lines. Fundamental physical parameters, \bz, \vsini, and $P_{\rm rot}$ were then used to determine radii, masses, ages, dipole oblique rotator model, stellar wind, magnetospheric, and spindown parameters using a Monte Carlo approach that self-consistently calculates all parameters while accounting for all available constraints on stellar properties. Dipole magnetic field strengths $B_{\rm d}$ follow a log-normal distribution similar to that of Ap stars, and decline over time in a fashion consistent with the expected conservation of fossil magnetic flux. $P_{\rm rot}$ increases with fractional main sequence age, mass, and $B_{\rm d}$, as expected from magnetospheric braking. However, comparison of evolutionary track ages to maximum spindown ages $t_{\rm S,max}$ shows that initial rotation fractions may be far below critical for stars with $M_*&gt;10 M_\odot$. Computing $t_{\rm S,max}$ with different mass-loss prescriptions indicates that the mass-loss rates of B-type stars are likely much lower than expected from extrapolation from O-type stars. Stars with H$\alpha$ in emission and absorption occupy distinct regions in the updated rotation-magnetic confinement diagram: H$\alpha$-bright stars are found to be younger, more rapidly rotating, and more strongly magnetized than the general population. Emission strength is sensitive both to the volume of the CM and to the mass-loss rate, favouring leakage over centrifugal breakout.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability to capture human motion allows researchers to evaluate an individual’s gait. Gait can be measured in different ways, from camera-based systems to Magnetic and Inertial Measurement Units (MIMU). The former uses cameras to track positional information of photo-reflective markers, while the latter uses accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to measure segment orientation. Both systems can be used to measure joint kinematics, but the results vary because of their differences in anatomical calibrations. The objective of this thesis was to study potential solutions for reducing joint angle discrepancies between MIMU and camera-based systems. The first study worked to correct the anatomical frame differences between MIMU and camera-based systems via the joint angles of both systems. This study looked at full lower body correction versus correcting a single joint. Single joint correction showed slightly better alignment of both systems, but does not take into account that body segments are generally affected by more than one joint. The second study explores the possibility of anatomical landmarking using a single camera and a pointer apparatus. Results showed anatomical landmark position could be determined using a single camera, as the anatomical landmarks found from this study and a camera-based system showed similar results. This thesis worked on providing a novel way for obtaining anatomical landmarks with a single point-and-shoot camera, as well aligning anatomical frames between MIMUs and camera-based systems using joint angles.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A new glass-forming organic semiconductor material was synthesized using a known electron transport material, perylene diimide, and attaching it to a molecular glass in order to allow the material to be solution processed. Devices were made using a simple metal-semiconductor-metal structure and electrodes were selected to produce Schottky diodes. Experiments were carried out to characterize this new molecular glass perylene diimide. The new material shows evidence of traps, hysteresis, and other behaviours that are explored in this thesis. The material shows some potential as an electron transport layer with possibilities of memory storage behaviour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Canadian young people are increasingly more connected through technological devices. This computer-mediated communication (CMC) can result in heightened connection and social support but can also lead to inadequate personal and physical connections. As technology evolves, its influence on health and well-being is important to investigate, especially among youth. This study aims to investigate the potential influences of computer-mediated communication (CMC) on the health of Canadian youth, using both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. This mixed-methods study utilized data from the 2013-2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey for Canada (n=30,117) and focus group data involving Ontario youth (7 groups involving 40 youth). In the quantitative component, a random-effects multilevel Poisson regression was employed to identify the effects of CMC on loneliness, stratified to explore interaction with family communication quality. A qualitative, inductive content analysis was applied to the focus group transcripts using a grounded theory inspired methodology. Through open line-by-line coding followed by axial coding, main categories and themes were identified. The quality of family communication modified the association between CMC use and loneliness. Among youth experiencing the highest quartile of family communication, daily use of verbal and social media CMC was significantly associated with reports of loneliness. The qualitative analysis revealed two overarching concepts that: (1) the health impacts of CMC are multidimensional and (2) there exists a duality of both positive and negative influences of CMC on health. Four themes were identified within this framework: (1) physical activity, (2) mental and emotional disturbance, (3) mindfulness, and (4) relationships. Overall, there is a high proportion of loneliness among Canadian youth, but this is not uniform for all. The associations between CMC and health are influenced by external and contextual factors, including family communication quality. Further, the technologically rich world in which young people live has a diverse impact on their health. For youth, their relationships with others and the context of CMC use shape overall influences on their health.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous research on power has predominantly focused on power as an intrapersonal process. Relatively little research, however, has investigated the interpersonal transference of power.  In the present research, I documented the vicarious power effect – people vicariously feel more powerful when their psychological connections with powerful figures were made salient. Compared to participants in the control conditions, who wrote about either a non-powerful figure with whom they felt psychologically connected or a powerful figure with whom they did not feel connected, participants writing about a powerful figure with whom they felt psychologically connected reported a higher level of power. This effect was true for both a real-life powerful figure (Study 1) and a powerful fictional character (Study 2). In Study 3, I found that, compared to participants in the control conditions (non-powerful but close, powerful but not close), participants writing about their experience of taking a picture together with a close and powerful person (close and powerful condition) made a lower counteroffer in a seller-buyer negotiation task.  Furthermore, in Study 4, I found that, compared to participants in the control conditions (non-powerful but close, powerful but not close), participants writing about a close and powerful person (close and powerful condition) were more likely to engage in self-beneficial lying behaviors and less likely to engage in other-beneficial lying behaviors. The research sheds light on vicarious psychological processes in general. Remaining issues and directions for future research are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis reports the synthesis and/or applications of three types of block copolymers that each bear a low-surface-energy block.&#xD;
First, poly(dimethylsiloxane)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl acrylate) (PDMS-b-PCEA) was synthesized and characterized. Cotton coating using a micellar solution of this block copolymer yielded superhydrophobic cotton fabrics. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface property analyses indicated that the PDMS block topped the polymer coating. Photocuring the cotton swatches crosslinked the underlying PCEA layer and yielded permanent coatings. More interestingly, hydrophilically patterned superhydrophobic cotton fabrics were produced using photolithography that allowed the crosslinking of the coating around irradiated fibers but the removal, by solvent extraction, of the coating on fibers that were not irradiated. Since water-based ink only permeated the uncoated regions, such patterned fabric was further used to print ink patterns onto substrates such as fabrics, cardboard, paper, wood, and aluminum foil.&#xD;
Then, another PDMS-based diblock copolymer poly(dimethylsiloxane)-block-poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PDMS-b-PGMA) was prepared. Different from PCEA that photocrosslinked around cotton fibers, PGMA reacted with hydroxyl groups on cotton fiber surfaces to get covalently attached. Further, different PGMA chains crosslinked with each other. PDMS-b-PGMA-coated cotton fabrics have been used for oil-water separations. In addition, polymeric nanoparticles were grafted onto cotton fiber surface before PDMS-b-PGMA was used to cover the surfaces of the grafted spheres and the residual surfaces of the cotton fibers. These two types of fabrics, coated by the block copolymer alone or by the polymer nanospheres and then the copolymer, were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and water repellency analyses. A comprehensive comparative study was made of their performances in oil-water separation.&#xD;
Finally, a fluorinated ABC triblock copolymer poly(acrylic acid)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-perfluorooctylethyl methacrylate) (PAA-b-PCEMA-b-PFOEMA) was used to&#xD;
iii&#xD;
encapsulate air nanobubbles. The produced air nanobubbles were thermodynamically stable in water and were some 100 times more stable than commercially available perfluorocarbon-filled microbubbles under ultrasound. These nanobubbles, due to their small sizes and thus ability to permeate the capillary networks of organs and to reach tumors, may expand the applications of microbubbles in diagnostic ultrasonography and find new applications in ultrasound-regulated drug delivery.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is an important public health problem in Canada, especially among adolescents. Estimates show that rates of SSB consumption are particularly high in the northern territories, especially in Nunavut. This is concerning given&#xD;
that regular SSB consumption is associated with obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, among other health concerns.&#xD;
Objectives: This thesis has two objectives. The first is to describe SSB consumption patterns among adolescents from Nunavut specifically, all three territories combined and the provinces.The second is to determine the association between individual and cumulative school food programs and SSB consumption.&#xD;
Methods: Data were obtained from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study (HBSC); a cross-sectional survey of Canadian youth in grades 6-10. All frequencies for food and beverage consumption were obtained from a 7-day food frequency questionnaire. SSB consumption consisted of a composite measure including soft drinks, sports drinks and energy drinks. The types of school food programs were obtained from an administrative questionnaire filled out by each school’s Principal or delegate. Multilevel multivariate Poisson regression models were used to examine the associations between school food programs and SSB consumption.&#xD;
Results: Youth from Nunavut consumed the most SSBs (53.1% in 2010 and 55.0% in 2014 were daily consumers), followed by youth from the territories (31.1% in 2010 and 27.0% in 2014), then youth from the provinces (24.3% in 2010 and 19.1% in 2014). No significant relationships were&#xD;
found between school food programs and daily SSB consumption. Two school food programs were weakly associated with weekly SSB consumption: nutrition month activities (RR=0.93,CI=0.89, 0.98) and healthy options in the snack bar (RR=1.07, CI=1.01, 1.14).&#xD;
Conclusions:Rates of SSB consumption were highest among Nunavummiut youth followed by youth from all three territories combined and then the provinces. Little association was found between school&#xD;
food programs and SSB consumption among Canadian youth in grades 6-10. These findings point to the need for examining other determinants and potential areas for intervention, for reducing SSB consumption among Canadian youth, particularly in high consumer sub-populations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>INTRODUCTION: Low levels of methylation within repetitive DNA elements, such as long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and Alu repeats, are believed to epigenetically predispose an individual to cancer and other diseases. The extent to which lifestyle factors affect the degree of DNA methylation within these genomic regions has yet to be fully understood. Adiposity and sex hormones are established risk factors for certain types of cancer and other illnesses, particularly amongst postmenopausal women.  The aim of the current investigation is to assess the impact of adiposity and sex hormones on LINE-1 and Alu methylation in healthy postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using baseline data from an ancillary study of the Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention (ALPHA) Trial. Current adiposity was measured using a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, computed tomography (CT) scan, and balance beam scale. Historical weights were self-reported in a questionnaire. Current endogenous sex hormone concentrations were measured in fasting blood serum. Estimated lifetime number of menstrual cycles was used as a proxy for cumulative exposure to ovarian sex hormones. Repetitive element methylation was quantified in white blood cells using a pyrosequencing assay. Linear regression was used to model the relations of interest while adjusting for important confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
RESULTS: Adiposity and serum estrogen concentrations were positively related to LINE-1 methylation but were not associated with Alu methylation. Cumulative ovarian sex hormone exposure had a “U-shaped” relation with LINE-1 regardless of folate intake and a negative relation with Alu methylation amongst low folate consumers. Androgens were not associated with repetitive element DNA methylation in this population. &#xD;
&#xD;
CONCLUSION: Adiposity and estrogens appear to play a role in maintaining high levels of repetitive element DNA methylation in healthy postmenopausal women. LINE-1 methylation may be a mechanism whereby estrogen exposure protects against cardiovascular and neurodegenerative illnesses. These results add to the growing body of literature showing how the epigenome is shaped by our lifestyle choices. Future prospective studies assessing the relation between levels of repetitive element DNA methylation in healthy individuals and subsequent disease risk are needed to better understand the clinical significance of these results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Unidirectional hybridization between bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus) sunfish enables researchers to explore the relative expression of paternal and maternal alleles in hybrids. Past studies have found that the metabolic dysfunction in bluegill-pumpkinseed hybrids may be due to incompatibilities between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. However, the consequences of hybridization on body size and muscle growth have not been examined. This topic is particularly interesting because hybrids grow larger than parentals despite the fact that they are often sired by smaller, precociously mature bluegills. In order to improve our understanding of growth dynamics in hybrid sunfish, I conducted real-time quantitative PCR using species-specific primers on the white muscle tissue of bluegills, pumpkinseeds, and hybrids collected from Lake Opinicon, ON. Five growth factors that have been linked to muscle growth and body size demonstrated similar expression for maternal and paternal alleles. While about half of the hybrids showed the same pattern with myogenin, about half showed very low levels of mRNA for the paternal (bluegill) gene. While this did not explain the heterosis seen in hybrids, it may explain the small body phenotype of the cuckholding bluegill males. I explored the upstream genetic structure of bluegill myogenin and established that four alleles exist within the population. Furthermore, I uncovered a relationship in hybrids between the proximal promoter/ 5’ UTR of myogenin and its transcript level. I found that the hybrids demonstrating low paternal myogenin expression unfailingly possessed A3 or A4 alleles, but future studies will be needed to reveal the molecular links between the genotype and the growth phenotype. A similar genotype-phenotype association was not obvious in parentals, even those that were homozygous for these alleles. Whether this relationship can provide insight into the genetic determinants of bluegill alternative mating strategies has yet to be determined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Flame retardants (FRs) are added to materials to enhance the fire safety level of readily combustible polymers. Although they have been purported to aid in preventing fires in some cases, they have also become a significant cause for concern given the vast data on environmental persistence and human and animal adverse health effects. Evidence since the 1980s has shown that Canadian, American and Europeans have detectable levels of FRs in their bodies. North Americans in particular have high levels of these chemicals due to stringent flammability standards and the higher use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in North America as opposed to Europe. FRs have been detected in household dust and some evidence suggests that TVs could be a significant source of exposure to FRs. It is imperative to re-visit the flammability standard (UL94V) that allows for FR use in TVs plastic materials by providing a risk versus benefit analysis to determine if this standard provides a fire safety benefit and if it plays a major role in FR exposure. This report first examined the history of televisions and the progression to the UL94V flammability test standard to understand why FRs were first added to polymers used in the manufacturing of TVs. It has been demonstrated to be due to fire hazards resulting from the use of plastic materials in cathode-ray tube (CRT) TVs that had an “instant-on” feature and high voltage and operating temperatures. In providing a risk versus benefit analysis, this paper presents the argument that 1) by providing a market survey the current flammability test standard (UL94V) is outdated and lacks relevance to current technology as flat, thin, energy efficient Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) dominate over traditionally used heavy, bulky and energy-intensive CRTs; 2) FRs do not impart fire safety benefits considering that there is a lack of valid fire safety concern, such as reduced internal and external ignition and fire hazard, and a lack of valid fire data and hazard for television fires in general and finally; 3) the standard is overly stringent as it does not consider the risk due to exposure to FRs in household dust due to the proliferation and greater use of  televisions in households. Therefore, this report argues that the UL94V standard has become trapped in history and needs to be updated as it may play a major role in FR exposure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The main goal of this thesis is to show the versatility of glancing angle deposition&#xD;
(GLAD) thin films in applications. This research is first focused on studying the&#xD;
effect of select deposition variables in GLAD thin films and secondly, to demonstrate&#xD;
the flexibility of GLAD films to be incorporated in two different applications: (1) as&#xD;
a reflective coating in low-level concentration photovoltaic systems, and (2) as an&#xD;
anode structure in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).&#xD;
A particular type of microstructure composed of tilted micro-columns of titanium&#xD;
is fabricated by GLAD. The microstructures form elongated and fan-like tilted&#xD;
micro-columns that demonstrate anisotropic scattering.&#xD;
The thin films texture changes from fiber texture to tilted fiber texture by increasing&#xD;
the vapor incidence angle. At very large deposition angles, biaxial texture forms.&#xD;
The morphology of the thin films deposited under extreme shadowing condition&#xD;
and at high temperature (below recrystallization zone) shows a porous and inclined&#xD;
micro-columnar morphology, resulting from the dominance of shadowing over&#xD;
adatom surface diffusion.&#xD;
The anisotropic scattering behavior of the tilted Ti thin film coatings is quantified&#xD;
by bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) measurements and is&#xD;
found to be consistent with reflectance from the microstructure acting as an array&#xD;
of inclined micro-mirrors that redirect the incident light in a non-specular reflection.&#xD;
A silver-coating of the surface of the tilted-Ti micro-columns is performed to enhance the total reflectance of the Ti-thin films while keeping the anisotropic scattering&#xD;
behavior. By using such coating is as a booster reflector in a laboratory-scale low-level&#xD;
concentration photovoltaic system, the short-circuit current of the reference silicon&#xD;
solar cell by 25%.&#xD;
Finally, based on the scattering properties of the tilted microcolumnar&#xD;
microstructure, its scattering effect is studied as a part of titanium dioxide&#xD;
microstructure for the anode in DSSCs. GLAD-fabricated TiO2 microstructures&#xD;
for the anode in a DSSC, consisting of vertical micro-columns, and combined&#xD;
vertical topped with tilted micro-columns are compared. The solar cell with the&#xD;
two-part microstructure shows the highest monochromatic incident photon to&#xD;
current efficiency with 20% improvement compared to the vertical microstructure,&#xD;
and the efficiency of the cell increases from 1.5% to 2% due to employing the&#xD;
scattering layer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the increasing attention towards the role of information systems (IS) as a vehicle to address environmental issues, IS researchers and practitioners have strived to leverage advanced Green IS innovations to persuade people to engage in environmentally responsible practices and support pro-environmental initiatives. Yet, existing research&#xD;
reveals that the persuasion effects of Green IS designs remain equivocal. In particular, many design characteristics advocated in Green IS research can produce bi-directional changes in IS users’ attitudes and behaviours. To address this issue, this thesis drew upon the circumplex model of social values (S.H. Schwartz, 1992) to explain when and how&#xD;
online persuasion designs come to affect people’s judgements on resource conservation&#xD;
and environmental protection. Three sets of working propositions and specific hypotheses&#xD;
were developed. Specifically, this research suggests that the use of an IS application can&#xD;
elicit different value primes and draw IS users’ attentions to different motivational functions of engaging in suggested behavioural changes. It is expected that matching online persuasion appeals with IS users’ personal value priorities can increase users’ acceptance of online behavioural suggestions. Second, it is hypothesized that the persuasion effect tends to be weakened, as the system users become aware of the valuematching design in a given IS application. Third, it is proposed that different value primes presented in an IS application can result in different unintended effects on IS users’ global pro-environmental attitudes and motivations. The hypotheses were tested in the two pilot studies and two full-scale online experiments. The study findings generally support the main predictions of the hypotheses. On the one hand, this thesis providesiii empirical evidence that IS design for online persuasion can be instrumental in influencing IS users’ judgements on a range of resource conservation practices. On the other hand,&#xD;
this work explains why the effectiveness of IS-enabled online persuasion attempts needs&#xD;
to be measured not only in terms of the intended changes in a target behavioural domain but also in terms of unintended changes in people’s general environmental orientations. Findings in this research may bring a different perspective on understanding and assessing the influence of Green IS applications on IS users’ judgements and behaviou</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work outlines the theoretical advantages of multivariate methods in biomechanical data, validates the proposed methods and outlines new clinical findings relating to knee osteoarthritis that were made possible by this approach. &#xD;
&#xD;
New techniques were based on existing multivariate approaches, Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and validated using existing data sets.  The new techniques developed, PCA-PLS-LDA (Principal Component Analysis – Partial Least Squares – Linear Discriminant Analysis), PCA-PLS-MLR (Principal Component Analysis – Partial Least Squares –Multiple Linear Regression) and Waveform Similarity (based on NMF) were developed to address the challenging characteristics of biomechanical data, variability and correlation.  As a result, these new structure-seeking technique revealed new clinical findings. &#xD;
&#xD;
The first new clinical finding relates to the relationship between pain, radiographic severity and mechanics.  Simultaneous analysis of pain and radiographic severity outcomes, a first in biomechanics, revealed that the knee adduction moment’s relationship to radiographic features is mediated by pain in subjects with moderate osteoarthritis.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The second clinical finding was quantifying the importance of neuromuscular patterns in brace effectiveness for patients with knee osteoarthritis.  I found that brace effectiveness was more related to the patient’s unbraced neuromuscular patterns than it was to mechanics, and that these neuromuscular patterns were more complicated than simply increased overall muscle activity, as previously thought.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bridges are a critical part of North America’s transportation network that need to be assessed frequently to inform bridge management decision making. Visual inspections are usually implemented for this purpose, during which inspectors must observe and report any excess displacements or vibrations. Unfortunately, these visual inspections are subjective and often highly variable and so a monitoring technology that can provide quantitative measurements to supplement inspections is needed. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a novel monitoring technology that uses digital images to measure displacement fields without any contact with the bridge. &#xD;
	In this research, DIC and accelerometers were used to investigate the dynamic response of a railway bridge reported to experience large lateral displacements. Displacements were estimated using accelerometer measurements and were compared to DIC measurements. It was shown that accelerometers can provide reasonable estimates of displacement for zero-mean lateral displacements. By comparing measurements in the girder and in the piers, it was shown that for the bridge monitored, the large lateral displacements originated in the steel casting bearings positioned above the piers, and not in the piers themselves.&#xD;
	The use of DIC for evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation of the LaSalle Causeway lift bridge in Kingston, Ontario was also investigated. Vertical displacements were measured at midspan and at the lifting end of the bridge during a static test and under dynamic live loading. The bridge displacements were well within the operating limits, however a gap at the lifting end of the bridge was identified. Rehabilitation of the bridge was conducted and by comparing measurements before and after rehabilitation, it was shown that the gap was successfully closed.&#xD;
	Finally, DIC was used to monitor the midspan vertical and lateral displacements in a monitoring campaign of five steel rail bridges. DIC was also used to evaluate the effectiveness of structural rehabilitation of the lateral bracing of a bridge. Simple finite element models are developed using DIC measurements of displacement. Several lessons learned throughout this monitoring campaign are discussed in the hope of aiding future researchers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Laser micromachining is an important material processing technique used in industry and medicine to produce parts with high precision. Control of the material removal process is imperative to obtain the desired part with minimal thermal damage to the surrounding material. Longer pulsed lasers, with pulse durations of milli- and microseconds, are used primarily for laser through-cutting and welding. In this work, a two-pulse sequence using microsecond pulse durations is demonstrated to achieve consistent material removal during percussion drilling when the delay between the pulses is properly defined. The light-matter interaction moves from a regime of surface morphology changes to melt and vapour ejection. Inline coherent imaging (ICI), a broadband, spatially-coherent imaging technique, is used to monitor the ablation process. The pulse parameter space is explored and the key regimes are determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
Material removal is observed when the pulse delay is on the order of the pulse duration. ICI is also used to directly observe the ablation process. Melt dynamics are characterized by monitoring surface changes during and after laser processing at several positions in and around the interaction region. Ablation is enhanced when the melt has time to flow back into the hole before the interaction with the second pulse begins. A phenomenological model is developed to understand the relationship between material removal and pulse delay. Based on melt refilling the interaction region, described by logistic growth, and heat loss, described by exponential decay, the model is fit to several datasets. The fit parameters reflect the pulse energies and durations used in the ablation experiments. For pulse durations of 50 us with pulse energies of 7.32 mJ +/- 0.09 mJ, the logisitic growth component of the model reaches half maximum after 8.3 us +/- 1.1 us and the exponential decays with a rate of 64 us +/- 15 us. The phenomenological model offers an interpretation of the material removal process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>All teachers participate in self-directed professional development (PD) at some point in their careers; however, the degree to which this participation takes place varies greatly from teacher to teacher and is influenced by the leadership of the school principal. The motivation behind why teachers choose to engage in PD is an important construct. Therefore, there is a need for better understanding of the leader’s role with respect to how and why teachers engage in self-directed professional development. The purpose of the research was to explore the elementary teachers’ motivation for and the school principal’s influence on their engagement in self-directed professional development.  Three research questions guided this study:&#xD;
1.	What motivates teachers to engage in self-directed professional development?&#xD;
2.	What are the conditions necessary for promoting teachers’ engagement in self-directed professional development?&#xD;
3.	What are teachers’ perceptions of the principal’s role in supporting, fostering, encouraging, and sustaining the professional development of teachers?&#xD;
A qualitative research approach was adopted for this study. Six elementary teachers from one south-eastern Ontario school board, consisting of three novice and three more experienced teachers, provided their responses to a consistent complement of 14 questions. Their responses were documented via individual interviews, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. &#xD;
The findings suggested that, coupled with the individual motivating influences, the culture of the school was found to be a conditional dynamic that either stimulated or dissuaded participation in self-directed PD. The school principal provided an additional catalyst or deterrence via relational disposition. When teachers felt their needs for competency, relatedness, and autonomy were satisfied, the conditions necessary to motivate teachers to engage in PD were fulfilled. A principal who personified the tenets of transformational leadership served to facilitate teachers’ inclinations to take on PD. A leadership style that was collaborative and trustful and allowed for personal autonomy was a dominant foundational piece that was critical for participant participation in self-directed PD. Finally, the principals were found to positively impact school climate by partaking in PD alongside teachers and ensuring there was a shared vision of the school so that teachers could tailor PD to parallel school interests.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Halo white dwarfs remain one of the least studied stellar populations in the Milky Way because of their faint luminosities. Recent work has uncovered a population of hot white dwarfs which are thought to be remnants of low-mass Population II stars. This thesis uses optical data from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and ultravoilet data from the GALEX Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS) to select candidates which may belong to this population of recently formed halo white dwarfs. A colour selection was used to separate white dwarfs from QSOs and main-sequence stars. Photometric distances are calculated using model colour-absolute magnitude relations. Proper motions are calculated by using the difference in positions between objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the NGVS. The proper motions are combined with the calculated photometric distances to calculate tangential velocities, as well as approximate Galactic space velocities. White dwarf candidates are characterized as belonging to either the disk or the halo using a variety of methods, including calculated scale heights (z&gt; 1 kpc), tangential velocities (vt &gt;200 km/s), and their location in (V,U) space. The 20 halo white dwarf candidates which were selected using Galactic space velocities are analyzed, and their colours and temperatures suggest that these objects represent some of the youngest white dwarfs in the Galactic halo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Over the past decade, annual heath exams have been de-emphasized for the general population but emphasized for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).  The purpose of this project was to determine if there has been an increase in the uptake of the health exam among adults with IDD in Ontario, to what extent, and the effect on the quality of preventive care provided.  &#xD;
Methods: Using administrative health data, the proportion of adults (18-64 years old) with IDD who received a health exam (long appointment, general assessment, and “true” health exam), a high value on the primary care quality composite score (PCQS), and a health exam or high PCQS each year was compared to the proportion in a propensity score matched sample of the general population.  Negative binomial and segmented negative binomial regression controlling for age and sex were used to determine the relative risk of having a health exam/high PCQS/health exam or PCQS over time.&#xD;
Results: Pre joinpoint, the long appointment and general assessment health exam definitions saw a decrease and the “true” health exam saw an increase in the likelihood of adults having a health exam.  Post joinpoint, all health exam definitions saw a decrease in the likelihood of adults having a health exam.  Pre joinpoint, all PCQS measures (high PCQS, long appointment or high PCQS, “true” health exam or high PCQS) saw an increase in the likelihood for adults to achieve a high PCQS or high PCQS/have a health exam.  Post joinpoint, all PCQS measures saw a decrease in the likelihood for adults to achieve a high PCQS or high PCQS/have a health exam.  Achieving a high PCQS was strongly associated with having a health exam regardless of health exam definition or IDD status.&#xD;
Conclusions: Despite the publication of guidelines, only a small proportion of adults with IDD are receiving health exams.  This indicates that the publication of guidelines alone was not sufficient to change practice.  More targeted measures, such as the implementation of an IDD-specific health exam fee code, should be considered to increase the uptake of the health exam among adults with IDD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  Academic integrity (AI) has been defined as the commitment to the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility with courage in all academic endeavours. The senior years of nursing studies provide an intersection for students to transition to professional roles through student clinical practice. It is essential to understand what predicts senior nursing students’ intention to behave with AI so that efforts can be directed to initiatives focused on strengthening their commitment to behaving with AI.&#xD;
Research Questions: To what extent do students differ on Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) variables? What predicts intention to behave with academic integrity among senior nursing students in clinical practice across three different Canadian Schools of Nursing?&#xD;
Method: The TPB framework, an elicitation (n=30) and two pilot studies (n=59, n=29) resulted &#xD;
&#xD;
in the development of a 38 question (41-item) self-report survey (Miron Academic Integrity &#xD;
&#xD;
Nursing Survey—MAINS: α&gt;0.70) that was administered to Year 3 and 4 students (N=339).   &#xD;
&#xD;
Three predictor variables (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control) were &#xD;
&#xD;
measured with students’ intention to behave with AI in clinical. Age, sex, year of study, program &#xD;
&#xD;
stream, students’ understanding of AI policies, and locations where students accessed AI &#xD;
&#xD;
information were also measured. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results:  Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that background, site, and TPB variables explained 32.6% of the variance in intention to behave with academic integrity. The TPB variables explained 26.8% of the variance in intention after controlling for background and site variables. In the final model, only the TPB predictor variables were statistically significant with Attitude having the highest beta value (beta=0.35, p&lt;0.001), followed by Subjective Norm (beta=0.21, p&lt;0.001) and Perceived Behavioural Control (beta=0.12, p&lt;0.02).&#xD;
Conclusion:  Student attitude is the strongest predictor to intention to behave with AI in clinical practice and efforts to positively influence students’ attitudes need to be a focus for schools, curricula, and clinical educators.  Opportunities for future research should include replicating the current study with students enrolled in other professional programs and intervention studies that examine the effectiveness of specific endeavours to promote AI in practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents details of the design and development of novel tools and instruments for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and may be considered as a repository for several years' worth of development work. The author presents design goals and implementations for two microscopes. First, a novel Pan-type STM&#xD;
was built that could be operated in an ambient environment as a liquid-phase STM.&#xD;
Unique features of this microscope include a unibody frame, for increased microscope&#xD;
rigidity, a novel slider component with large Z-range, a unique wiring scheme and&#xD;
damping mechanism, and a removable liquid cell. The microscope exhibits a high&#xD;
level of mechanical isolation at the tunnel junction, and operates excellently as an ambient tool. Experiments in liquid are on-going. Simultaneously, the author worked on designs for a novel low temperature, ultra-high vacuum (LT-UHV) instrument, and these are presented as well. A novel stick-slip vertical coarse approach motor was designed and built. To gauge the performance of the motor, an in situ motion sensing apparatus was implemented, which could measure the step size of the motor to high precision. A new driving circuit for stick-slip inertial motors is also presented, that o ffers improved performance over our previous driving circuit, at a fraction of&#xD;
the cost. The circuit was shown to increase step size performance by 25%. Finally, a horizontal sample stage was implemented in this microscope. The build of this UHV instrument is currently being fi nalized. In conjunction with the above design projects, the author was involved in a collaborative project characterizing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au(111) films. STM was used to characterize Au substrate quality, for both commercial substrates and those manufactured via a unique atomic layer deposition (ALD) process by collaborators. Ambient and UHV STM was then also used to characterize the NHC/Au(111) films themselves, and several key properties of these films are discussed. During this study, the author discovered an unexpected surface contaminant, and details of this are also presented. Finally, two models are presented for the nature of the NHC-Au(111) surface interaction based on the observed film properties, and some preliminary theoretical work by collaborators is presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a study of fifteenth- to mid sixteenth-century Netherlandish triptych exteriors, focusing on the so-called ‘grisaille’ technique. During this period, altarpieces produced in the Low Countries were typically constructed in a tripartite format with folding wings. This arrangement created the opportunity for pictorial representations on both sides of the hinged panels. Painters emphasized the distinction between the triptych’s two faces by executing the exteriors in a strikingly more subdued palette than the interiors. Particular iconographic subject matter was favoured for grisailles, which often depict the Annunciation or saints that reflect the triptych’s patronage or intended location.  Jan van Eyck was notable for his emphasis on imitating stone statuary and created three important grisailles, one of which would influence triptych exteriors for years to come. Hieronymus Bosch, an artist working at the turn of the sixteenth century, also brought innovation to his grisailles, further expanding the potential of these reduced-palette paintings. This thesis examines the creative process involved in the production of grisailles and compares the underdrawings of triptych exteriors to those of the corresponding polychromatic interiors. In this study, grisailles are situated in their context as part of multifaceted artworks as well as within the broader church environment.   &#xD;
&#xD;
New infrared reflectograms were generated using Queen’s OSIRIS infrared camera to document works in Belgium and the Netherlands. While some aspects of underdrawings could indicate that the figure was meant to imitate statuary, this distinction was not directly linked to triptych exteriors and was related instead to efforts at a trompe-l’oeil effect. Such attempts at mimicry can also be found on triptych interiors. Through a close examination of the underdrawing stage of these paintings it appears that this part of the creative process was not distinguished in any significant way from the underdrawings of triptych interiors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The roasting of gold-bearing arsenopyrite at Giant mine (Northwest Territories) between 1949 and 1999 released approximately 20,000 tonnes of toxic arsenic-bearing aerosols in the local aerial environment. Detailed examination of lake sediments, sediment porewaters, surface waters and lake hydrology sampled from three lakes of differing limnological characteristics was conducted in summer and winter conditions. Samples were analyzed for solid and dissolved elemental concentrations, speciation and mineralogy. The three lakes are located less than 5km from the mine roaster, and downwind, based on predominant wind direction. The objective of the study was to assess the controls on the mobility and fate of arsenic in these roaster-impacted subarctic lacustrine environments.&#xD;
Results show that the occurrence of arsenic trioxide in lake sediments coincides with the regional onset of industrial activities. The bulk of arsenic in sediments is contained in the form of secondary sulphide precipitates, with iron oxides hosting a minimal amount of arsenic near the surface-water interface. The presence of geogenic arsenic is likely contained as dilute impurities in common rock-forming minerals, and is not believed to be a significant source of arsenic to sediments, porewaters or lake waters. Furthermore, the well correlated depth-profiles of arsenic, antimony and gold in sediments may help reveal roaster impact.&#xD;
The soluble arsenic trioxide particles contained in sediments act as the primary source of arsenic into porewaters. Dissolved arsenic in reducing porewaters both precipitate as secondary sulphides in situ, and diffuse upwards into the overlying lake waters. Arsenic diffusion out of porewaters, combined with watercourse-driven residence time, are estimated to be the predominant mechanisms controlling arsenic concentrations in overlying lake waters. The sequestration of arsenic from porewaters as sulphide precipitates, in the study lakes, is not an effective process in keeping lake-water arsenic concentrations below guidelines for the protection of the freshwater environment and drinking water.&#xD;
Seasonal impacts on lake geochemistry derive from ice covering lake waters, cutting them off from of atmospheric oxygen, along with the exclusion of solutes from the ice. Such effects are limited in deep lakes but are can be an important factor controlling arsenic precipitation and mobility in ponds.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is multifactorial and is likely the result of complex interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Recently, it has been suggested that each symptom cluster of the disorder, such as poor social communication, may be mediated by different genetic influences. Genes in the oxytocin pathway, which mediates social behaviours in humans, have been studied with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) being implicated in ASD. This thesis examines the presence of different oxytocin receptor genotypes, and their associations with ASD and resulting social communication deficits. &#xD;
Methods: The relationship between four OXTR variants and ASD was evaluated in 607 ASD simplex (SPX) families. Cases were compared to their unaffected siblings using a conditional logistic approach. Odds ratios and associated 95 percent confidence intervals were obtained. A second sample of 235 individuals with a diagnosis of ASD was examined to evaluate whether these four OXTR variants were associated with social communication scores on the Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R). Parameter estimates and associated 95 percent confidence intervals were generated using a linear regression approach. Multiple testing issues were addressed using false discovery adjustments. &#xD;
Results: The rs53576 AG genotype was significantly associated with a lower risk of ASD (OR = 0.707, 95% CI: 0.512-0.975). A single genotype (AG) provided by the rs2254298 marker was found to be significantly associated with higher social communication scores (Parameter estimate = 1.833, SE = 0.762, p = 0.0171). This association was also seen in a Caucasian only and mothers as the respondent samples. No association was significant following false discovery rate adjustments. &#xD;
Conclusion: The findings from these studies provide limited support for the role of OXTR SNPs in ASD, especially in social communication skills. The clinical significance of these associations remains unknown, however, it is likely that these associations do not play a role in the severity of symptoms associated with ASD. Rather, they may be important in the appearance of social deficits due to the rs2254298 markers association with enlarged amygdalas.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Drawing upon critical, communications, and educational theories, this thesis develops a novel framing of the problem of social risk in the extractive sector, as it relates to the building of respectful relationships with indigenous peoples.  Building upon Bakhtin’s dialogism, the thesis demonstrates the linkage of this aspect of social risk to professional education, and specifically, to the undergraduate mining engineering curriculum, and develops a framework for the development of skills related to intercultural competence in the education of mining engineers.  &#xD;
The knowledge of social risk, as well as the level of intercultural competence, of students in the mining engineering program, is investigated through a mixture of surveys and focus groups – as is the impact of specific learning interventions.  One aspect of this investigation is whether development of these attributes alters graduates’ conception of their identity as mining engineers, i.e. the range and scope of responsibilities, and understanding of to whom responsibilities are owed, and their role in building trusting relationships with communities. &#xD;
Survey results demonstrate that student openness to the perspectives of other cultures increases with exposure to the second year curriculum.  Students became more knowledgeable about social dimensions of responsible mining, but not about cultural dimensions.  Analysis of focus group data shows that students are highly motivated to improve community perspectives and acceptance.  It is observed that students want to show respect for diverse peoples and communities where they will work, but they are hampered by their inability to appreciate the viewpoints of people who do not share their values.  They embrace benefit sharing and environmental protection as norms, but they mistakenly conclude that opposition to mining is rooted in a lack of education rather than in cultural values.&#xD;
Three, sequential, threshold concepts are identified as impeding development of intercultural competence: Awareness and Acknowledgement of Different Forms of Knowledge; Recognition that Value Systems are a Function of Culture; Respect for varied perceptions of Social Wellbeing and Quality of Life.  Future curriculum development in the undergraduate mining engineering program, as well as in other educational programs relevant to the extractive sector, can be effectively targeted by focusing on these threshold concepts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines three important issues. The first issue is about the human capital investment and entrepreneurship as a career choice. The standard human capital theory shows that firms (employees) never invest in general (firm-specific) human capital of the employee as they do not extract any return from it. However, when entrepreneurship is introduced as a career option for an innovative employee, both firm’s and employee’s human capital investments change. Employee starts investing in his firm-specific human capital to increase the probability to innovate (and to become an entrepreneur). However, the firm uses general human capital investment to reduce the risk of employee’s departure. The second issue is regarding the factors motivating entry regulations reforms and the possible nonlinear effects of entry regulation reforms. The current literature and the policy recommendations assume that these reforms have linear effects on entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the anecdotal evidence shows that the outcomes of such reforms vary greatly from country to country. To investigate this issue, I collect a sample data on entry regulations and firm creation from World Bank. The empirical analysis indicates that the effect of entry regulation reforms depends on the pre-reform level of bureaucracy in the country. More specifically, while low-bureaucracy countries benefit from entry regulation reforms, high-bureaucracy countries do not benefit. Moreover, the probability of making a reform increases if the country has reformist neighbors, cumbersome entry regulations, high unemployment rate, or low corruption level. The last issue is related to the individual and joint effects of bureaucracy and corruption on different types of entrepreneurs. The current literature investigates these effects only on unified measures of entrepreneurship. However, entrepreneurs are very different in many senses. To address this issue, I collect the necessity-based and opportunity-based entrepreneurship data from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. The empirical analysis yield two important results: First, bureaucracy has a direct negative (positive) effect on necessity-based (opportunity-based) entrepreneurs. Second, corruption mitigates the effect of bureaucracy for both groups of entrepreneurs. All three chapters offer useful insights and important implications to academics and policymakers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An all fiber-optical method to monitor densities and viscosities of liquids utilizing a steel cantilever (4 x 0.3 x 0.08 cm3) is presented. The actuation is performed by photothermally heating the cantilever at its base with an intensity-modulated 808 nm diode laser. The cantilever vibrations are picked up by an in-fiber Fabry Perot cavity sensor attached along the length of the cantilever. The fluid properties can be related to the resonance characteristics of the cantilever, e.g. a shift in the resonance frequency corresponds to a change in fluid density, and the width of the resonance peak gives information on the dynamic viscosity after calibration of the system.&#xD;
Aqueous glycerol, sucrose and ethanol samples in the range of 0.79–1.32 gcm−3 (density) and 0.89–702 mPas (viscosity) were used to investigate the limits of the sensor. A good agreement with literature values could be found with an average deviation of around 10 % for the dynamic viscosities, and 5–16 % for the mass densities. A variety of clear and opaque commercial spirits and an unknown viscous sample, e.g. home-made maple syrup, were analyzed and compared to literature values.&#xD;
The unique detection mechanism allows for the characterization of opaque samples and is superior to conventional microcantilever sensors. The method is expected to be beneficial in various industrial sectors such as quality control of food samples.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Consumers are constantly making consumption decisions and engaging in marketplace activities that require some level of competence. In other words, consumers possess and require some knowledge, skills, and abilities to engage in the marketplace and obtain what they want. But what causes consumers to infer they are or are not competent? And, what are the consequences of these competence inferences on consumer behaviour? This dissertation examines the role consumption plays in consumers’ inferences of their own competence to enhance our understanding of these issues. By integrating the literature on competence and attributions of blame, this dissertation develops a theory for when and how consumption influences self-perceptions of competence and how these self-perceptions of competence impact future consumer behaviours. Evidence from five studies suggests that consumers infer their own competence from their consumption outcomes, despite who is actually responsible for causing these outcomes. This means consumers potentially see themselves as incompetent for negative outcomes that are entirely firm-caused. This dissertation argues that people infer their own competence from firm-caused outcomes because they conflate their decisions made prior to an outcome with the cause of that outcome. This dissertation also examines how these variations in self-perceptions of competence can influence future consumer behaviours.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The understudied capital sculpture of Wells Cathedral in Somerset, England (c. 1184-1210) provides ample opportunity of expanding the current scholarship and understanding of interior ecclesiastical sculpture in a West Country cathedral. While the Gothic style of architecture is typically understood as, according to Paul Binski (2014), rational in execution and reception, the capital sculpture at Wells Cathedral has been considered illogical in terms of both its iconography and location within the nave, transepts, and north porch. Utilizing Michael Camille’s post/anti-iconographical approach, this project examines the Wells figural capitals in five case studies: labour, Old and New Testament Scenes, animals and beast fables, busts, and monsters and hybrids. Each group of capitals will be approached with an understanding that this type of art was viewed by people of different classes and professions, with each viewer bringing their own personal experiences and abilities into how they could have read and understood these types of images. Therefore, the capitals at Wells must be read through layers of meaning and interpretation while also considering their locations within the cathedral and how they react and respond to surrounding figural capitals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The main goal of this thesis was to prepare medium-chain-length poly-3-hydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) nanoparticle suspensions at high solids content (≥ 10 % w/v). A two-stage emulsification-solvent evaporation process was employed to produce poly-3-hydroxydecanoate (PHD) suspensions. The formulation and processing conditions including ultrasonication time and amplitude, selection of solvent, and selection of surfactants and their concentrations were investigated to make concentrated suspensions (10 and 30 % (w/v)) of PHD with particles less than 300 nm. Among the ionic surfactants tested to stabilize the suspension, the anionic, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), and the cationic, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) surfactants produced the smallest particle sizes (~100 nm). However, more stabilized nanoparticles were obtained when the ionic surfactant, SDS, was combined with any of the non-ionic surfactants tested, with polyoxyethylene octyl phenyl ether (Triton X-100) or polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) resulting in a slight increase in zeta potential over 30 days while the zeta potential with other non-ionic surfactants decreased. &#xD;
&#xD;
Mcl-PHA containing 11 and 18 % of carboxyl groups was synthesized via free radical addition reaction of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid to the pendant double bonds of unsaturated poly-3-hydroxynonanoate (PHNU). Colloidal suspensions prepared by ultrasonication needed a surfactant to maintain stability, even at 0.4 % solids of mcl-PHA containing 11 % carboxylation (PHNC-1) unlike the stable suspensions prepared without surfactants by the titration method. Similar particle sizes (155.6 ± 8.4 to 163.4 ± 11.3 nm) and polydispersity indices (0.42 ± 0.03 to 0.49 ± 0.04) were obtained when several non-ionic surfactants were tested to minimize particle agglomeration, with the smallest particles obtained with Triton X-100. When Triton X-100 was combined with a variety of ionic surfactants, smaller nanoparticles (97.1 ± 1.1 to 121.7 ± 5.7 nm) with a narrower particle size distribution (0.21 ± 0.001 to 0.25 ± 0.003) were produced. The SDS and Triton X-100 combination was chosen to evaluate other mcl-PHAs at 10 % (w/v) solids content. Slightly smaller nanoparticles were formed with carboxylated mcl-PHAs compared to mcl-PHAs having aliphatic pendant side chains. Mcl-PHA consisting of 18 % carboxylation (PHNC-2) formed a much smaller nanoparticles and higher zeta potential.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Clinical optical motion capture allows us to obtain kinematic and kinetic outcome measures that aid clinicians in diagnosing and treating different pathologies affecting healthy gait. The long term aim for gait centres is for subject-specific analyses that can predict, prevent, or reverse the effects of pathologies through gait retraining. To track the body, anatomical segment coordinate systems are commonly created by applying markers to the surface of the skin over specific, bony anatomy that is manually palpated. The location and placement of these markers is subjective and precision errors of up to 25mm have been reported [1].  Additionally, the selection of which anatomical landmarks to use in segment models can result in large angular differences; for example angular differences in the trunk can range up to 53o for the same motion depending on marker placement [2].&#xD;
	These errors can result in erroneous kinematic outcomes that either diminish or increase the apparent effects of a treatment or pathology compared to healthy data.  Our goal was to improve the accuracy and precision of optical motion capture outcome measures.  This thesis describes two separate studies. In the first study we aimed to establish an approach that would allow us to independently quantify the error among trunk models.  Using this approach we determined if there was a best model to accurately track trunk motion. In the second study we designed a device to improve precision for test, re-test protocols that would also reduce the set-up time for motion capture experiments.&#xD;
	Our method to compare a kinematically derived centre of mass velocity to one that was derived kinetically was successful in quantifying error among trunk models.  Our findings indicate that models that use lateral shoulder markers as well as limit the translational degrees of freedom of the trunk through shared pelvic markers result in the least amount of error for the tasks we studied.  We also successfully reduced intra- and inter-operator anatomical marker placement errors using a marker alignment device.&#xD;
	The improved accuracy and precision resulting from the methods established in this thesis may lead to increased sensitivity to changes in kinematics, and ultimately result in more consistent treatment outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this research is to investigate the various social, political and economic factors that contributed to Canada’s failure to implement a universal school lunch program during the 1940s. Although Canada developed several other social welfare programs in the post-war period, it remains one of the only industrialized nations that does not provide hot meals to children in elementary or secondary schools. Data from the province of Ontario, a major site of postwar reconstruction and policy-making, has been taken up to inform the broader national discourse on school lunches from the 1940s. National, Ontario provincial and City of Toronto archival records were collected and analyzed according to common themes, in order to identify key barriers that constrained government support of a hot meal program. Archival records were identified using key words, and were limited to materials created between 1930-1952. Analysis suggests that sufficient need for a hot meal program had not been established during the 1940s. Despite misleading nutrition messages, rates of malnutrition and nutrient-related disease were at an all-time low, and many Ontario school boards did not appear to have the necessary infrastructure required to supply all pupils with hot meals. The Canadian government had already employed significant resources to improve existing social security programs by coupling them with health education. This strategy reflected a shift in understanding malnutrition as a knowledge-based problem, as opposed to income-based. This understanding was further reinforced through the moralized dissemination of nutrition information, which placed blame on women for improperly raising their children. Ultimately, the strong uptake of nutrition as a public health issue in Ontario may have limited prospective responses to solutions already utilized in the public health domain, and directed favour away from a universal school lunch program for Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Youth sport coaches shape the developmental sporting experience for their athletes (Camiré, Trudel, &amp; Forneris, 2014). Specifically, coaches who form individualized, supportive relationships with their athletes can increase the development of personal and social skills (Fraser-Thomas, Côté, &amp; Deakin, 2005). In light of the value of these relationships, increasing evidence is prompting the application of leadership theories, such as Transformational Leadership (TFL), in youth sport (Vella et al., 2013). The aim of this study was to explore coach perceptions of how and why leadership behaviours are applied in the youth sport context. Eleven coaches (Mage= 42.3, SD= 15.2) were recruited from competitive youth soccer and volleyball clubs (athletes’ Mage= 15.8, SD= 1.9) in Eastern Ontario and participated in a stimulated recall interview. During the interviews, coaches reflected upon their own coaching behaviours and provided insight into the application of leadership behaviours in youth sport. Responses were prompted by relevant video sequences from recorded practice and game sessions. A thematic content analysis revealed that; i) coaches use a variety of leadership behaviours in youth sport, ii) the use of leadership behaviours vary across sport contexts or settings, and iii) contrasting leadership styles (e.g., transactional vs. transformational) are associated with distinctive coach objectives (e.g., promoting confidence vs. establishing respect). These findings have helped identify gaps within coach education, and provide theoretical insight for applying leadership theories, and more specifically TFL, to help improve the sport experiences of young athletes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Numerous leukocyte populations are essential for pregnancy success. Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are chief amongst these leukocytes and represent a unique lineage with limited cytotoxicity but abundant angiokine production. They possess a distinct phenotype of activating and inhibitory receptors that recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, such as the killer immunoglobulin like receptors (KIRs; mouse Ly49), and MHC-independent activating receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 (NCR1). While the roles of MHC-dependent receptors are widely addressed in pregnancy, MHC-independent receptors are relatively unstudied. This thesis investigated the roles of MHC-independent receptors in promotion of mouse pregnancy and characterized early leukocyte interactions in the presence and absence of NCR1. It was hypothesized that loss of MHC-independent receptors impairs uNK cell development resulting in aberrations in leukocyte function and decidual vasculature. &#xD;
Implantation sites from Ahr-/- and Ncr1Gfp/Gfp mice were assessed using whole mount in situ immunohistochemistry (WM-IHC) and histochemical techniques. Leukocyte interactions identified during preliminary WM-IHC studies were confirmed as immune synapses. The novel identification of immune synapses in early mouse pregnancy compelled further examination of leukocyte conjugates in wildtype C57BL/6 and Ncr1Gfp/Gfp mice. &#xD;
In Ahr-/- and Ncr1Gfp/Gfp mice, receptor loss resulted in reduced uNK cell diameters, impaired decidual vasculature, and failures in spiral artery remodeling. Ahr-/- mice had severe fertility deficits whereas Ncr1Gfp/Gfp mice had increased fetal resorption indicating differing receptor requirements in pregnancy success. NCR1 loss primarily affected uNK cell maturation and function as identified by alterations in granule ultrastructure, lytic protein expression, and angiokine production. Leukocyte conjugates were frequent in early C57BL/6 decidua basalis and included uNK cells conjugating first with antigen presenting cells and then with T cells. Overall conjugate formation was reduced in the absence of NCR1, but specific uNK cell conjugations were unaffected by receptor loss. &#xD;
While KIR-MHC interactions are associated with numerous pregnancy complications in humans, the role of other uNK cell receptors are not well characterized. These results illustrate the importance of MHC-independent receptors in uNK cell activation during early pregnancy in mice and encourage further studies of pregnancy complications that may occur independently of maternal KIR-MHC contributions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) protein passes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr), and malfunction of hERG protein/IKr is the primary cause of acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS). Autoimmune diseases are significantly correlated with prolonged QT intervals, for which autoantibodies have been implicated. The anti-Ro52 autoantibody is the most frequently evaluated, and importantly has been correlated with prolonged QT intervals. Pathological anti-Ro52-hERG interactions have been discussed as a mechanism for autoimmune disease-related LQTS. However, the mechanism is unclear, and it does not explain LQTS in autoimmune diseases which do not commonly express anti-Ro52. In this thesis, I investigated the effects of anti-Ro52 on hERG/IKr function. Through Western blot analysis, whole-cell patch-clamp, and immunofluorescence, I show that anti-Ro52 chronically (12 h) reduced hERG protein expression and hERG current by over 50%, but did not acutely block the channel. My work revealed a novel mechanism in which the Fc portion of anti-Ro52 interacts with the extracellular S5-pore linker of the channel to induce internalization through a tyrosine phosphorylation dependent pathway. This phenomenon extends beyond anti-Ro52 IgG, as other IgG, regardless of their antigen binding specificity, have the potential to reduce hERG expression/current. Rather, the ability of IgG to reduce hERG expression and current is dependent on the IgG subclass, as we show mouse IgG2A was the only mouse IgG subclass which reduced hERG expression. These results provide a novel explanation for autoimmune disease associated LQTS. It also has implications in the development of safe monoclonal antibody drugs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Metacognition is the understanding and control of cognitive processes. Students with high levels of metacognition achieve greater academic success. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to examine elementary teachers’ beliefs about metacognition and integration of metacognitive practices in science. Forty-four teachers were recruited through professional networks to complete a questionnaire containing open-ended questions (n = 44) and Likert-type items (n = 41). Five respondents were selected to complete semi-structured interviews informed by the questionnaire. The selected interview participants had a minimum of three years teaching experience and demonstrated a conceptual understanding of metacognition.&#xD;
Statistical tests (Pearson correlation, t-tests, and multiple regression) on quantitative data and thematic analysis of qualitative data indicated that teachers largely understood metacognition but had some gaps in their understanding. Participants’ reported actions (teaching practices) and beliefs differed according to their years of experience but not gender. Hierarchical multiple regression demonstrated that the first block of gender and experience was not a significant predictor of teachers' metacognitive actions, although experience was a significant predictor by itself. Experience was not a significant predictor once teachers' beliefs were added.&#xD;
The majority of participants indicated that metacognition was indeed appropriate for elementary students. Participants consistently reiterated that students’ metacognition developed with practice, but required explicit instruction. A lack of consensus remained around the domain specificity of metacognition. More specifically, the majority of&#xD;
questionnaire respondents indicated that metacognitive strategies could not be used across subject domains, whereas all interviewees indicated that they used strategies across subjects. Metacognition was integrated frequently into Ontario elementary classrooms; however, metacognition was integrated less frequently in science lessons. Lastly, participants used a variety of techniques to integrate metacognition into their classrooms. Implications for practice include the need for more professional development aimed at integrating metacognition into science lessons at both the Primary and Junior levels. Further, teachers could benefit from additional clarification on the three main components of metacognition and the need to integrate all three to successfully develop students’ metacognition.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is an increased need for 3D recording of archaeological sites and digital preservation of their artifacts. Digital photogrammetry with prosumer DSLR cameras is a suitable tool for recording epigraphy in particular, as it allows for the recording of inscribed surfaces with very high accuracy, often better than 2 mm and with only a short time spent in the field. When photogrammetry is fused with other computational photography techniques like panoramic tours and Reflectance Transformation Imaging, a workflow exists to rival traditional LiDAR­based methods. The difficulty however, arises in the presentation of 3D data. It requires an enormous amount of storage and end­user sophistication. The proposed solution is to use game­engine technology and high definition virtual tours to provide not only scholars, but also the general public with an uncomplicated interface to interact with the detailed 3D epigraphic data. The site of Stobi, located near Gradsko, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) was used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of RTI, photogrammetry and virtual tour imaging working in combination. A selection of nine sets of inscriptions from the archaeological site were chosen to demonstrate the range of application for the techniques. The chosen marble, sandstone and breccia inscriptions are representative of the varying levels of deterioration and degradation of the epigraphy at Stobi, in which both their rates of decay and resulting legibility is varied. This selection includes those which are treated and untreated stones as well as those in situ and those in storage. The selection consists of both Latin and Greek inscriptions with content ranging from temple dedication inscriptions to statue dedications. This combination of 3D modeling techniques presents a cost and time efficient solution to both increase the legibility of severely damaged stones and to digitally preserve the current state of the inscriptions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Valproic acid (VPA), a commonly-used anticonvulsant drug, is associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, including neural tube defects (NTDs). Previous in vivo studies determined that VPA-exposed embryos with a NTD had altered expression of several proteins regulated by p300, a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) protein. p300 is capable of acetylating histones and non-histone proteins through its HAT activity, allowing it to transcriptionally regulate genes as well as modulate the stability and activity of specific proteins. NFκB, Stat3 and Egr1, all of which function as transcription factors, are regulated by p300 through its HAT activity. Together, these proteins all play an important role in maintaining the balance of apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation, the regulation of which is extremely important for proper embryonic development. The studies in this thesis utilized P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells in order to determine the effects of VPA exposure on the expression of p300 and the aforementioned transcription factors, as well as apoptosis and proliferation, in vitro. P19 EC cells were exposed to C646, a selective p300 inhibitor, in order to assess whether the effects observed as a result of VPA exposure were due to p300 protein degradation. It was found that VPA exposure for 24 hours in P19 EC cells in vitro resulted in a significant decrease in p300 protein expression. VPA exposure also significantly decreased NFκB protein expression, while resulting in increased Stat3 protein expression. However, Stat3 acetylation and phosphorylation, which both contribute to Stat3 activation, were significantly decreased as a result of VPA exposure. p300 inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in NFκB, similar to what was observed as a result of VPA exposure, which suggests that VPA-mediated degradation of p300 may play a role in reduced NFκB protein expression following VPA exposure. Conversely, Stat3 protein expression, acetylation and phosphorylation were not significantly changed as a result of p300 inhibition, suggesting that p300 degradation does not play a role in VPA’s effects on Stat3 protein expression and activation. VPA exposure also resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, while p300 inhibition did not significantly increase apoptosis. These data suggest that p300 degradation plays a role in VPA-mediated teratogenicity, and that VPA may target other cellular mechanisms in order to exert its teratogenic effects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Adolescence is a period of life associated with self-perceptions of negative body image. Physical activity levels are low and screen time levels are also high during this stage. These perceptions and behaviours are associated with poor health outcomes, making research on their determinants important. With adolescent populations, certain groups may be at higher risk of body dissatisfaction than others, and body dissatisfaction may influence individual physical activity and screen time levels. &#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: The objectives of this thesis were to: 1) describe body image among young Canadians, examining possible health inequalities 2) estimate the strength and significance of associations between body satisfaction, physical activity and screen time, and 3) examine the potential etiological role of biological sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Objective 1: The 2013/2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study was employed. Sex-stratified Rao-Scott chi-square analyses were conducted to examine associations between socio-demographic factors and body satisfaction. Objective 2: The 2005/2006 and 2013/2014 cross-sectional and 2006 longitudinal HBSC data sets were used. Sex-stratified modified Poisson regressions were conducted and risk estimates and associated confidence intervals obtained. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Objective 1: Among males, being older, of East and Southeast Asian ethnicity, and reporting low SES all were associated with body dissatisfaction. Among females, being older, of Arab and West Asian or African ethnicity, being born in Canada, and reporting low SES were all associated with being body dissatisfied. Objective 2: Cross-sectionally, males who reported ‘too fat’ body dissatisfaction were more likely to be physically inactive. Adolescents of both sexes who reported ‘too fat’ body dissatisfaction were more likely to engage in high levels of screen time. Data from the longitudinal component supported the idea that male ‘too fat’ body dissatisfaction temporally leads to physical inactivity, but showed an inverse relationship between body dissatisfaction and screen time. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Objective 1: Future prevention efforts in Canada should target subgroups to effectively help those at greatest risk of body dissatisfaction, and ameliorate potential inequalities at the population level. Objective 2: The presence of these relationships may inform future interventions as part of a multi-factorial etiology, in order to increase physical activity and decrease screen time among youth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Due to the growing concerns associated with fossil fuels, emphasis has been placed on clean and sustainable energy generation. This has resulted in the increase in Photovoltaics (PV) units being integrated into the utility system. The integration of PV units has raised some concerns for utility power systems, including the consequences of failing to detect islanding. Numerous methods for islanding detection have been introduced in literature. They can be categorized into local methods and remote methods. The local methods are categorically divided into passive and active methods. Active methods generally have smaller Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) but the injecting disturbances will slightly degrade the power quality and reliability of the power system. Slip Mode Frequency Shift Islanding Detection Method (SMS IDM) is an active method that uses positive feedback for islanding detection. In this method, the phase angle of the converter is controlled to have a sinusoidal function of the deviation of the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) voltage frequency from the nominal grid frequency. This method has a non-detection zone which means it fails to detect islanding for specific local load conditions. If the SMS IDM employs a different function other than the sinusoidal function for drifting the phase angle of the inverter, its non-detection zone could be smaller. In addition, Advanced Slip Mode Frequency Shift Islanding Detection Method (Advanced SMS IDM), which has been introduced in this thesis, eliminates the non-detection zone of the SMS IDM. In this method the parameters of SMS IDM change based on the local load impedance value. Moreover, the stability of the system is investigated by developing the dynamical equations of the system for two operation modes; grid connected and islanded mode. It is mathematically proven that for some loading conditions the nominal frequency is an unstable point and the operation frequency slides to another stable point, while for other loading conditions the nominal frequency is the only stable point of the system upon islanding occurring. Simulation and experimental results show the accuracy of the proposed methods in detection of islanding and verify the validity of the mathematical analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

Finally, we validate our results using three models we create and trace.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have higher than normal ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) during exercise. There is growing evidence that emphysema on thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans is associated with poor exercise capacity in COPD patients with only mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction. We hypothesized that emphysema is an underlying cause of microvascular dysfunction and ventilatory inefficiency, which in turn contributes to reduced exercise capacity. We expected ventilatory inefficiency to be associated with a) the extent of emphysema; b) lower diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide; c) a reduced pulmonary blood flow response to exercise; and d) reduced exercise capacity.   &#xD;
Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 19 subjects with mild-to-moderate COPD (mean ± SD FEV1= 82 ± 13% predicted, 12 GOLD grade 1) and 26 age-, sex-, and activity-matched controls underwent a ramp-incremental symptom-limited exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Ventilatory inefficiency was assessed by the minimum VE/VCO2 value (nadir). A subset of subjects also completed repeated constant work rate exercise bouts with non-invasive measurements of pulmonary blood flow. Emphysema was quantified as the percentage of attenuation areas below -950 Housefield Units on CT scans. An electronic scoresheet was used to keep track of emphysema sub-types. &#xD;
Results: COPD subjects typically had centrilobular emphysema (76.8 ± 10.1% of total emphysema) in the upper lobes (upper/lower lobe ratio= 0.82 ± 0.04). They had lower peak oxygen uptake (VO2), higher VE/VCO2 nadir and greater dyspnea scores than controls (p&lt;0.05). Lower peak  O2 and worse dyspnea were found in COPD subjects with VE/VCO2 nadirs ≥ 30. COPD subjects had blunted increases in pulmonary blood flow from rest to iso-VO2 exercise (p&lt;0.05). Higher VE/VCO2 nadir in COPD subjects correlated with emphysema severity (r= 0.63), which in turn correlated with reduced lung diffusing capacity (r= -0.72) and blunted changes in pulmonary blood flow from rest to exercise (r= -0.69) (p&lt;0.01). &#xD;
Conclusions: Ventilation “wasted” in emphysematous areas is associated with reduced exercise ventilatory efficiency in mild-to-moderate COPD. Exercise ventilatory inefficiency links structure (emphysema) and function (gas transfer) to a key clinical outcome (reduced exercise capacity) in COPD patients with modest spirometric abnormalities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Depression is the largest contributing factor to years lost to disability, and symptom remission does not always result in functional improvement. Comprehensive analysis of functioning requires investigation both of the competence to perform behaviours, as well as actual performance in the real world. Further, two independent domains of functioning have been proposed: adaptive (behaviours conducive to daily living skills and independent functioning) and interpersonal (behaviours conducive to the successful initiation and maintenance of social relationships). To date, very little is known about the relationship between these constructs in depression, and the factors that may play a key role in the disparity between competence and real-world performance in adaptive and interpersonal functioning. &#xD;
Purpose: This study used a multidimensional (adaptive and interpersonal functioning), multi-level (competence and performance) approach to explore the potential discrepancy between competence and real-world performance in depression, specifically investigating whether self-efficacy (one’s beliefs of their capability to perform particular actions) predicts depressed individuals’ underperformance in the real world relative to their ability. A comparison sample of healthy participants was included to investigate the level of depressed individuals’ impairment, across variables, relative to healthy individuals. &#xD;
Method: Forty-two participants with depression and twenty healthy participants without history of, or current, psychiatric illness were recruited in the Kingston, Ontario community. Competence, self-efficacy, and real-world functioning all in both adaptive and interpersonal domains, and symptoms were assessed during a single-visit assessment.&#xD;
Results: Relative to healthy individuals, depressed individuals showed significantly poorer adaptive and interpersonal competence, adaptive and interpersonal functioning, and significantly lower self-efficacy for adaptive and interpersonal behaviours. Self-efficacy significantly predicted functional disability both in the domain of adaptive and interpersonal functioning. Interpersonal self-efficacy accounted for significant variance in the discrepancy between interpersonal competence and functioning.&#xD;
Conclusions: The current study provides the first data regarding relationships among competence, functioning, and self-efficacy in depression. Self-efficacy may play an important role in the deployment of functional skills in everyday life. This has implications for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing depressed individuals’ engagement in functional activities. There may be additional intrinsic or extrinsic factors that influence the relationships among competence and functioning in depression.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL31 gene encodes a conserved member of the herpesvirus nuclear egress complex that not only functions in the egress of DNA-containing capsids from the nucleus, but is also required for optimal viral genome expression, replication and packaging into capsids.  Here, we report that the UL31 protein from HSV-2 and the orthologous protein, ORF69, from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are recruited to sites of DNA damage.  Recruitment of UL31 to sites of DNA damage occurred in HSV-2 infected cells, but did not require other viral proteins. The N-terminus of UL31 contains sequences resembling a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) binding motif. As protein poly-ADP ribosylation (PARylation) is a hallmark of the DNA damage response we examined the relationship between PARylation and UL31 recruitment to DNA damage. While the PAR polymerase (PARP)1/2 inhibitor, olaparib, prevented UL31 recruitment to damaged DNA, KU55933 inhibition of signaling through the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) DNA damage response pathway had no effect. These findings were further supported by experiments demonstrating direct and specific interaction between HSV-2 UL31 and PAR using purified components. Co-transfection with the viral kinase Us3, known to phosphorylate UL31, inhibited UL31 recruitment to DNA damage but also prevented the recruitment of other proteins recruited to DNA damage sites. The viral E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 was observed to co-localize with UL31 in transfected cells in a manner that is independent of the PAR-binding ability of UL31.  However, inhibition of PARP1/2/3 did not reduce the ability of HSV-2 to replicate and we observed reduced PAR levels in the nuclei of infected cells. This study reveals a previously unrecognized function for UL31 orthologs and may suggest that the recognition of PAR by UL31 is coupled to the nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids, influences viral DNA replication and packaging, or possibly modulates the DNA damage response mounted by virally infected cells.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We study the Dirichlet to Neumann operator for the Riemannian wave equation on a compact Riemannian manifold. If the Riemannian manifold is modelled as an elastic medium, this operator represents the data available to an observer on the boundary of the manifold when the manifold is set into motion through boundary vibrations. We study the Dirichlet to Neumann operator when vibrations are imposed and data recorded on disjoint sets, a useful setting for applications. We prove that this operator determines the Dirichlet to Neumann operator where sources and observations are on the same set, provided a spectral condition on the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the manifold is satisfied. We prove this by providing an implementable procedure for determining a portion of the Riemannian manifold near the area where sources are applied. Drawing on established results, an immediate corollary is that a compact Riemannian manifold can be reconstructed from the Dirichlet to Neumann operator where sources and observations are on disjoint sets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent studies suggest that lung cancer stem cells (CSCs) may play major roles in lung cancer development, metastasis and drug resistance. Therefore, identification of lung CSC drivers may provide promising targets for lung cancer. TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) is a transcriptional co-activator and key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, which plays critical roles in various biological processes. TAZ has been shown to be overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and involved in tumorigenicity of lung epithelial cells. However, whether TAZ is a driver for lung CSCs and tumor formation in vivo is unknown. In addition, the molecular mechanism underlying TAZ-induced lung tumorigenesis remains to be determined. In this study, we provided evidence that constitutively active TAZ (TAZ-S89A) is a driver for lung tumorigenesis in vivo in mice and formation of lung CSC. Oncogenes upregulated in TAZ-overexpressing cells were identified with further validation. The most dramatically activated gene, Aldh1a1 (Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member a1), a well-established CSC marker, showed that TAZ induces Aldh1a1 transcription by activating its promoter activity through interaction with the transcription factor TEA domain (TEAD) family member. Most significantly, inhibition of ALDH1A1 with its inhibitor A37 or CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) gene knockout in lung cancer cells suppressed lung tumorigenic and CSC phenotypes in vitro, and tumor formation in mice in vivo. In conclusion, this study identified TAZ as a novel inducer of lung CSCs and the first transcriptional activator of the stem cell marker ALDH1A1. Most significantly, we identified ALDH1A1 as a critical meditator of TAZ-induced tumorigenic and CSC phenotypes in lung cancer. Our studies provided preclinical data for targeting of TAZ-TEAD-ALDH1A1 signaling to inhibit CSC-induced lung tumorigenesis and drug resistance in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Previous research has examined young children’s ability to detect who would be most likely to provide help to others in a given situation, but little is known about their ability to intervene based on this knowledge in a real-life setting. In the current study, 48 three-year-old children chose between two actors to retrieve an out-of-reach object for the Experimenter; one actor was physically incapable of providing the object (blocked by a tall barrier), and one was capable. Participants’ looking behaviour between the two actors during the study was also recorded and analyzed as an additional, nonverbal measure of their prediction about who would help. Approximately half of the participants in the sample actively intervened on behalf of the Experimenter, but only after a direct request for help was made.  Though the other participants did not engage in this helping behaviour, they chose the unblocked actor to help the Experimenter in a subsequent interview.  Children also spent more time looking at the unblocked actor. Secondary analyses indicated that shyness prevented many children in the study from asking for help on behalf of the Experimenter from one of the actors.

      <dcterms:abstract>As the concept of renewable energy becomes increasingly important in the modern society, a considerable amount of research has been conducted in the field of organic photovoltaics in recent years. Although organic solar cells generally have had lower efficiencies compared to silicon solar cells, they have the potential to be mass produced via solution processing. A common polymer solar cell architecture relies on the usage of P3HT (electron donor) and PCBM (electron acceptor) bulk heterojunction. One of the main issues with this configuration is that in order to compensate for the high exciton recombination rate, the photoactive layer is often made very thin (on the order of 100 $%). This results in low solar cell photocurrents due to low absorption. This thesis investigates a novel method of light trapping by coupling surface plasmons at the electrode interface via surface relief gratings, leading to EM field enhancements and increased photo absorption. Experimental work was first conducted on developing and optimizing a transparent electrode of the form &amp;'()/+,/&amp;'() to replace the traditional ITO electrode since the azopolymer gratings cannot withstand the high temperature processing of ITO films. It was determined that given the right thickness profiles and deposition conditions, the MAM stack can achieve transmittance and conductivity similar to ITO films. Experimental work was also conducted on the fabrication and characterization of surface relief gratings, as well as verification of the surface plasmon generation. Surface relief gratings were fabricated easily and accurately via laser interference lithography on photosensitive azopolymer films. Laser diffraction studies confirmed the grating pitch, which is dependent on the incident angle and wavelength of the writing beam. AFM experiments were conducted to determine the surface morphology of the gratings, before and after metallic film deposition. It was concluded that metallic film deposition does not significantly alter the grating morphologies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Shiftwork is associated with increased sleep disturbance and cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk. This thesis will focus on shiftwork-related sleep disturbance and the potential mediating role of reduced sleep duration in the relationship between a current rotational shiftwork schedule and the metabolic syndrome among female hospital employees. &#xD;
Objectives: 1) To describe sleep patterns in relation to different shiftwork exposure metrics (current status, cumulative exposure, number of consecutive night shifts); 2) To assess the association between shiftwork metrics and sleep duration; 3) To determine whether sleep duration on work shifts mediates the relationship between a current rotational shiftwork pattern and the metabolic syndrome; and 4) To assess whether cumulative shiftwork exposure and the number of consecutive night shifts are associated with the metabolic syndrome. &#xD;
Methods: 294 female hospital employees (142 rotating shiftworkers, 152 dayworkers) participated in a cross-sectional study. Shiftwork parameters were determined through self-report. Sleep was measured for one week with the ActiGraph GT3X+, a tri-axial accelerometer. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Joint Interim Studies Consensus Statement. Sleep was described by shiftwork exposure parameters, and multivariable linear regression was used to determine associations between shiftwork variables and sleep duration. Regression path analysis was used to assess whether sleep duration was a mediator between a current shiftwork schedule and the metabolic syndrome, and the significance of the indirect (mediating) effect was tested with bootstrap confidence intervals. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between cumulative shiftwork exposure, number of consecutive night shifts, and the metabolic syndrome. &#xD;
Results: Current shiftworkers slept less on work shifts, more on free days, and were more likely to nap compared to dayworkers. Sleep duration on work shifts was a strong intermediate in the relationship between a current shiftwork pattern and the metabolic syndrome. Cumulative shiftwork exposure and the number of consecutive night shifts did not affect sleep or the metabolic syndrome. &#xD;
Conclusions: A current shiftwork pattern disrupts sleep, and reduced sleep duration is an important intermediate between shiftwork and the metabolic syndrome among female hospital employees.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation focuses on industrial policy in two developing countries: Peru and Ecuador. Informed by comparative historical analysis, it explains how the Import-Substitution Industrialization policies promoted during the 1970s by military administration unravelled in the following 30 years under the guidance of Washington Consensus policies. Positioning political economy in time, the research objectives were two-fold: understanding long-term policy reform patterns, including the variables that conditioned cyclical versus path-dependent dynamics of change and; secondly, investigating the direction and leverage of state institutions supporting the manufacturing sector at the dawn, peak and consolidation of neoliberal discourse in both countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
Three interconnected causal mechanisms explain the divergence of trajectories: institutional legacies, coordination among actors and economic distribution of power. Peru’s long tradition of a minimal state contrasts with the embedded character of Ecuador long tradition of legal protectionism dating back to the Liberal Revolution. Peru’s close policy coordination among stakeholders –state technocrats and business elites- differs from Ecuador’s “winners-take-all” approach for policy-making. Peru’s economic dynamism concentrated in Lima sharply departs from Ecuador’s competitive regional economic leaderships. &#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation paid particular attention to methodology to understand the intersection between structure and agency in policy change. Tracing primary and secondary sources, as well as key pieces of legislation, became critical to understand key turning points and long-term patterns of change. Open-ended interviews (N=58) with two stakeholder groups (business elites and bureaucrats) compounded the effort to knit motives, discourses, and interests behind this long transition. In order to understand this amount of data, this research build an index of policy intervention as a methodological contribution to assess long patterns of policy change. These findings contribute to the current literature on State-market relations and varieties of capitalism, institutional change, and policy reform.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates the effect of foam core density and skin type on the behaviour of sandwich panels as structural beams tested in four-point bending and axially compressed columns of varying slenderness and skin thickness. Bio-composite unidirectional flax fibre-reinforced polymer (FFRP) is compared to conventional glass-FRP (GFRP) as the skin material used in conjunction with three polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam cores with densities of 32, 64 and 96 kg/m3. Eighteen 1000 mm long flexural specimens were fabricated and tested to failure comparing the effects of foam core density between three-layer FFRP skinned and single-layer GFRP skinned panels. A total of 132 columns with slenderness ratios (kLe/r) ranging from 22 to 62 were fabricated with single-layer GFRP skins, and one-, three-, and five-layer FFRP skins for each of the three foam core densities.  The columns were tested to failure in concentric axial compression using pinned-end conditions to compare the effects of each material type and panel height. All specimens had a foam core cross-section of 100x50 mm with 100 mm wide skins of equal thickness. &#xD;
&#xD;
In both flexural and axial loading, panels with skins comprised of three FFRP layers showed equivalent strength to those with a single GFRP layer for all slenderness ratios and core densities examined. Doubling the core density from 32 to 64 kg/m3 and tripling the density to 96 kg/m3 led to flexural strength increases of 82 and 213%, respectively. Both FFRP and GFRP columns showed a similar variety of failure modes related to slenderness. Low slenderness of 22-25 failed largely due to localized single skin buckling, while those with high slenderness of 51-61 failed primarily by global buckling followed by secondary skin buckling. Columns with intermediate slenderness experienced both localized and global failure modes. High density foam cores more commonly exhibited core shear failure. Doubling the core density of the columns resulted in peak axial load increases, across all slenderness ratios, of 73, 56, 72 and 71% for skins with one, three and five FFRP layers, and one GFRP layer, respectively. Tripling the core density resulted in respective peak load increases of 116, 130, 176 and 170%.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Canadian economy is largely dependent on the distribution of large volumes of oil to domestic and&#xD;
international markets by a long network of pipelines. Unfortunately, accidents occur, and oil can leak or&#xD;
spill from these pipelines before it reaches its destination. Of particular concern are the long-term&#xD;
consequences of oil spills in freshwater, which include sinking of oil in water and the contamination of&#xD;
sensitive areas, such as where fish (e.g., salmon) deposit their eggs in gravel-dominated river sediments.&#xD;
There is a knowledge gap regarding the fate and behaviour of oil in river sediment.&#xD;
To this end, this study aimed at finding the potential for diluted bitumen (dilbit) oil to become trapped in&#xD;
gravel and to transfer hydrocarbons into water by dissolution, which are harmful to aquatic life. Two sets&#xD;
of laboratory experiments were conducted to simulate conditions of an oil spill on an exposed bank or in&#xD;
shallow water. In the first set, by conducting capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-Sw) experiments it was found&#xD;
that dilbit can enter gravel pores without much resistance and approximately 14% of the pore volume can&#xD;
be occupied by discontinuous single or multipore blobs of dilbit following imbibition of water. Air-water&#xD;
Pc-Sw experiments done in laboratory 1-D columns required gravity correction and could be successfully&#xD;
scaled to predict dilbit-water Pc-Sw curves, except for the trapped amount of dilbit.&#xD;
Trapped dilbit constituents can be dissolved into the water flowing through gravel pores (hyporheic flow)&#xD;
at different velocities. In the second set, dissolution experiments suggested that for the duration of the test,&#xD;
hydrocarbons that cause acute toxicity dissolve rapidly, likely resulting in a decrease in their effective&#xD;
solubility. However, dilbit saturation changed only &lt;2% within that time. Chronically toxic PAH&#xD;
compounds were also detected in the effluent water. The total concentration of all detected PAHs and alkylPAHs exceeded the threshold literature value to protect early-life stage fish. Observations of decreased&#xD;
concentrations with increased aqueous velocities as well as less than equilibrium concentrations indicated&#xD;
that the mass transfer was rate-limited. A correlation was developed for the mass transfer rate coefficient&#xD;
to understand the mass transfer behaviour beyond the conditions used in the experiments, which had a&#xD;
Reynolds number exponent similar to the studies of NAPL dissolution in groundwater.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Attachment anxiety, or a fear of abandonment by those close to you, is an important predictor of many individual and interpersonal outcomes. Individuals high in attachment anxiety are more likely to experience physical illness due to disrupted immune functioning and deregulated stress responses. I was interested in examining potential mechanisms accounting for why individuals high in attachment anxiety are more likely to become ill. One variable that has been demonstrated to mediate the relationship between stress and health is sleep quality. As attachment anxiety is characterized by the experience of stress and worry over abandonment by romantic partners, I predicted sleep quality would mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and health. Further, I predicted attachment anxiety would interact with romantic threat, in that individuals high in attachment anxiety who perceive threat to their relationships would have poor sleep quality (compared with individuals low in attachment anxiety and individuals high in anxiety who do not perceive threat) which would mediate the most unhealthy outcomes. I tested these hypotheses using three online diary studies. In the first two studies, participants completed a seven-night diary describing their sleep quality, health, and interaction with their partner. In Study 3, I surveyed participants once a week for eight weeks to examine longer-term health outcomes. Sleep quality did indeed mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and various health outcomes over one week (Study 2), and showed a trend towards mediating effects over two months (Study 3). Interestingly, however, attachment anxiety did not interact with perceived romantic threat to predict health in the mediation analyses. Implications for sleep as a mediating variable are discussed, as well as the lack of attachment anxiety by romantic threat interaction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The drag on a nacelle model was investigated experimentally and computationally to provide guidance and insight into the capabilities of RANS-based CFD. The research goal was to determine whether industry constrained CFD could participate in the aerodynamic design of nacelle bodies. Grid refinement level, turbulence model and near wall treatment settings, to predict drag to the highest accuracy, were key deliverables.  &#xD;
Cold flow low-speed wind tunnel experiments were conducted at a Reynolds number of 6∙〖10〗^5, 293 K and a Mach number of 0.1. Total drag force was measured by a six-component force balance. Detailed wake analysis, using a seven-hole pressure probe traverse, allowed for drag decomposition via the far-field method. Drag decomposition was performed through a range of angles of attack between 0o and 45o. Both methods agreed on total drag within their respective uncertainties. Reversed flow at the measurement plane and saturation of the load cell caused discrepancies at high angles of attack. &#xD;
A parallel CFD study was conducted using commercial software, ICEM 15.0 and FLUENT 15.0. Simulating a similar nacelle geometry operating under inlet boundary conditions obtained through wind tunnel characterization allowed for direct comparisons with experiment. It was determined that the Realizable k-ϵ was best suited for drag prediction of this geometry. This model predicted the axial momentum loss and secondary flow in the wake, as well as the integrated surface forces, within experimental error up to 20o angle of attack. SST k-ω  required additional surface grid resolution on the nacelle suction side, resulting in 15% more elements, due to separation point prediction sensitivity.&#xD;
 It was further recommended to apply enhanced wall treatment to more accurately capture the viscous drag and separated flow structures. Overall, total drag was predicted within 5% at 0o angle of attack and 10% at 20o, each within experimental uncertainty. What is more, the form and induced drag predicted by CFD and measured by the wake traverse shared good agreement. Which indicated CFD captured the key flow features accurately despite simplification of the nacelle interior geometry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introspection is the process by which individuals question their attitudes; either questioning why&#xD;
they hold their attitudes (Why introspection), or how they feel about a particular attitude object&#xD;
(How introspection). Previous research has suggested that Why-introspection induces attitude change, and that Why and How introspection influence attitude-behaviour consistency,persuasion, and other effects. Generally, psychologists have assumed that affective and cognitive attitude bases are the mechanism by which introspection leads to these effects. Leading perspectives originating from these findings suggest that either Why introspection changes the&#xD;
content of cognitive attitude bases (the skewness hypothesis), or increases the salience of cognitive attitude bases (the dominance hypothesis); whereas How introspection may increase the salience of affective attitude bases (another part of the dominance hypothesis). However,&#xD;
direct evidence for these mechanisms is lacking, and the distinction between structural and meta bases has not been considered. Two studies investigated this gap in the existing literature. Both studies measured undergraduate students’ attitudes and attitude bases (both structural and meta, affective and cognitive) before and after engaging in an introspection manipulation (Why introspection / How introspection / control), and after reading a (affective / cognitive) persuasive passage about the attitude object. No evidence was found supporting either the skewness or&#xD;
dominance hypotheses. Furthermore, previous introspection effects were not replicated in the&#xD;
present data. Possible reasons for these null findings are proposed, and several unexpected&#xD;
effects are examined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: There is growing evidence that individual EEG differences may aid in classifying patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and also help predict clinical response to antidepressant treatment.  This study aims to compare the effectiveness of EEG frequency band power, alpha asymmetry and prefrontal theta cordance towards escitalopram response prediction and MDD diagnosis, in a multi-site initiative.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Resting EEG (eyes open and closed) was recorded from 64 electrodes in 44 depressed patients and 20 healthy controls at baseline, 2 weeks post-treatment and 8 weeks post-treatment. Clinical response was measured as change from baseline MADRS of 50% or more.  EEG measures were analyzed (1) at baseline (2) at 2 weeks post-treatment and (3) as an ‘‘early change” variable defined as change in EEG from baseline to 2 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results:  At baseline, responders exhibited greater absolute alpha power in the left hemisphere versus the right while non-responders showed the opposite.  Responders further exhibited a cortical asymmetry of greater right relative to left activity in parietal areas.  Groups also differed in baseline relative delta power with responders showing greater power in the right hemisphere versus the left while non-responders showed the opposite.  At 2 weeks post-treatment, responders exhibited greater absolute beta power in the left hemisphere relative to right and the opposite was noted for non-responders.    The opposite pattern was noted for absolute and relative delta power at 2 weeks post-treatment.  Responders exhibited early reduction in relative alpha power and early increments in relative theta power.  Non-responders showed a significant early increase in prefrontal theta cordance.  Absolute delta power helped distinguish MDD patients from healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Hemispheric asymmetries in the alpha and delta bands at pre-treatment baseline and at 2 weeks post-treatment have moderate to moderately strong predictive utility towards antidepressant treatment response.  These findings have significant potential for improving clinical practice in psychiatry by eventually guiding clinical choice of treatments. This would greatly benefit patients awaiting relief from depressive symptoms as treatment optimization would help overcome problems associated with delayed recovery.  Our results also indicate that resting EEG activity may have clinical utility in predicting MDD diagnosis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For the SNO+ neutrinoless double beta decay search, various backgrounds, ranging from impurities present naturally to those produced cosmogenically, must be understood and reduced. Cosmogenic backgrounds are particularly difficult to reduce as they are continually regenerated while exposed to high energy cosmic rays. To reduce these cosmogenics as much as possible the tellurium used for the neutrinoless double beta decay search will be purified underground. An analysis of the purification factors achievable for insoluble cosmogenic impurities found a reduction factor of $&gt;$20.4 at 50\% C.L.. During the purification process the tellurium will come into contact with ultra pure water and nitric acid. These liquids both carry some cosmogenic impurities with them that could be potentially transferred to the tellurium. A conservative limit is set at $&lt;$18 events in the SNO+ region of interest (ROI) per year as a result of contaminants from these liquids. In addition to cosmogenics brought underground, muons can produce radioactive isotopes while the tellurium is stored underground. A study on the rate at which muons produce these backgrounds finds an additional 1 event per year. In order to load the tellurium into the detector, it will be combined with 1,2-butanediol to form an organometallic complex. The complex was found to have minimal effect on the SNO+ acrylic vessel for 154 years.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In my thesis I argue for the use of system designs that: a) open access to a variety of users and allow for collaboration and idea exchange, while at the same time, b) are designed to motivate and engage users. To exemplify my proposed systems design, I created an interactive and open digital history project focused on Romanian culture and identity during Communism, from 1947, when the Communist Party took power by forcing the King to abdicate, until the revolution in 1989, which marked the end of Communism in Romania (Gilberg, 1990, Boia, 2014). &#xD;
In my project, I present the possibility to recreate Habermas’ notion of public sphere and “the unforced force of the better argument” (Habermas, 1989) and Dewey’s (2004) understanding of democracy as a mode of associated living imbued of the spirit of inquiry within contemporary digital history projects. Second, I outline system designs that motivate and engage users, by satisfying the basic psychological needs outlined in Ryan and Deci’s (2000) self-determination theory: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Two more concepts are included to complete the proposed digital history project design: presence (Ryan, Rigby, &amp; Przybylski, 2006) and learner hero (Rigby &amp; Przybylski, 2009).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multi-frequency eddy current measurements are employed in estimating pressure tube (PT) to calandria tube (CT) gap in CANDU fuel channels, a critical inspection activity required to ensure fitness for service of fuel channels. In this thesis, a comprehensive characterization of eddy current gap data is laid out, in order to extract further information on fuel channel condition, and to identify generalized applications for multi-frequency eddy current data. A surface profiling technique, generalizable to multiple probe and conductive material configurations has been developed. This technique has allowed for identification of various pressure tube artefacts, has been independently validated (using ultrasonic measurements), and has been deployed and commissioned at Ontario Power Generation. Dodd and Deeds solutions to the electromagnetic boundary value problem associated with the PT to CT gap probe configuration were experimentally validated for amplitude response to changes in gap. Using the validated Dodd and Deeds solutions, principal components analysis (PCA) has been employed to identify independence and redundancies in multi-frequency eddy current data. This has allowed for an enhanced visualization of factors affecting gap measurement. Results of the PCA of simulation data are consistent with the skin depth equation, and are validated against PCA of physical experiments. Finally, compressed data acquisition has been realized, allowing faster data acquisition for multi-frequency eddy current systems with hardware limitations, and is generalizable to other applications where real time acquisition of large data sets is prohibitive.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations including heart, skeletal and most frequently neural tube defects. Although the mechanisms contributing to its teratogenesis are not well understood, VPA was previously shown to increase homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair and decrease protein expression of the transcription factor NF-κB/p65. The studies in this thesis utilized in vivo and in vitro models to evaluate the expression of HR mediators, investigate the implications of decreased p65 including DNA binding and transcriptional activation, and the expression and histone acetyltransferase activity of Cbp/p300 with an aim to provide mechanistic insight into VPA-mediated alterations. The first study demonstrated that following maternal administration of VPA, mouse embryonic mRNA expression of HR mediators Rad51, Brca1 and Brca2 exhibited temporal and tissue-specific alterations. Protein expression of Rad51 was similarly altered and preceded increased cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP; indicative of apoptosis. The second study confirms previous findings of decreased total cellular p65 protein using P19 cells, but is the first to demonstrate that nuclear p65 protein is unchanged. NF-κB DNA binding was decreased following VPA exposure and maybe mediated by decreased p50 protein, which dimerizes with p65 prior to DNA binding. Transcriptional activity of NF-κB was also increased with VPA exposure which was not due to increased p65 phosphorylation at Ser276. Furthermore, the transcriptional activation capacity was unaffected by VPA exposure as combined exposure to VPA and TNFα additively increased NF-κB activity. The third study demonstrated that VPA exposure in P19 cells decreased Cbp/p300 total cellular and nuclear protein attributed primarily to ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300 was decreased proportionately to nuclear protein following VPA exposure. Inhibition of Cbp/p300 HAT activity decreased p65 total cellular protein, increased caspase-3 cleavage and ROS similar to VPA exposures. Furthermore, pre-treatment with the antioxidant enzyme catalase attenuated the increase in caspase-3 cleavage, but not p65 protein. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that VPA exposure impacts the expression and activity of the transcription factor NF-κB and transcriptional co-activators/HATs Cbp/p300, which has implications for downstream VPA targets including Rad51, Brca1 and Brca2.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The real-time optimization of large-scale systems is a difficult problem due to the need for complex models involving uncertain parameters and the high computational cost of solving such problems by a decentralized approach. Extremum-seeking control (ESC) is a model-free real-time optimization technique which can estimate unknown parameters and can optimize nonlinear time-varying systems using only a measurement of the cost function to be minimized. In this thesis, we develop a distributed version of extremum-seeking control which allows large-scale systems to be optimized without models and with minimal computing power.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, we develop a continuous-time distributed extremum-seeking controller. It has three main components: consensus, parameter estimation, and optimization. The consensus provides each local controller with an estimate of the cost to be minimized, allowing them to coordinate their actions. Using this cost estimate, parameters for a local input-output model are estimated, and the cost is minimized by following a gradient descent based on the estimate of the gradient. Next, a similar distributed extremum-seeking controller is developed in discrete-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we consider an interesting application of distributed ESC: formation control of high-altitude balloons for high-speed wireless internet. These balloons must be steered into a favourable formation where they are spread out over the Earth and provide coverage to the entire planet. Distributed ESC is applied to this problem, and is shown to be effective for a system of 1200 ballons subjected to realistic wind currents. The approach does not require a wind model and uses a cost function based on a Voronoi partition of the sphere. Distributed ESC is able to steer balloons from a few initial launch sites into a formation which provides coverage to the entire Earth and can maintain a similar formation as the balloons move with the wind around the Earth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent form of psychopathology among children and adolescents. Because demand for treatment far exceeds availability, there is a need for alternative approaches that are engaging, accessible, cost-effective, and incorporate practice to reach as many youth as possible. One novel approach is a video game intervention called MindLight that uses two evidence-based strategies to target childhood anxiety problems. Using neurofeedback mechanics to train players to: (1) attend to positive rather than threatening stimuli and (2) down-regulate arousal during stressful situations, MindLight teaches children how to practice overcoming anxious thoughts and arousal in a fun and engaging context. The present study examined the effectiveness of MindLight versus online cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) based psychoeducation sessions as a comparison in reducing anxiety in a sample of 144 anxious children, which was measured in three ways: (1) anxiety symptoms, (2) state anxiety in response to stress, and (3) psychophysiological arousal in response to stress. Children between the ages of 8.05–17.78 years (M=13.61, SD=1.79) were randomly assigned to play MindLight or complete psychoeducation for five hours over three weeks. State anxiety and psychophysiological arousal were assessed in response to two stress tasks before and after exposure to MindLight or psychoeducation. Anxiety symptoms were also measured via a questionnaire. Overall, participants showed significant reductions in anxiety symptoms and state anxiety in response to stress, but not psychophysiological arousal in response to stress. Moreover, the magnitude of reductions in anxiety did not differ between interventions but by age and sex. Specifically, older participants showed a greater decrease in severity of state anxiety in response to a social stressor than younger participants and girls showed a greater decrease in severity of state anxiety in response to a cognitive stressor than boys. The present study suggests that playing MindLight results in similar reductions in anxiety as one of the more common means of delivering CBT principles to youth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this research is to investigate potential methods to produce an ion-exchange membrane that can be integrated directly into a polydimethylsiloxane Lab-on-a-Chip or Micro-Total-Analysis-System. The majority of microfluidic membranes are based on creating microporous structures, because it allows flexibility in the choice of material such that it can match the material of the microfluidic chip. This cohesion between the material of the microfluidic chip and membrane is an important feature to prevent bonding difficulties which can lead to leaking and other practical problems. However, of the materials commonly used to manufacture microfluidic chips, there are none that provide the ion-exchange capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
The DuPont product Nafion{TM} is chosen as the ion-exchange membrane, a copolymer with high conductivity and selectivity to cations and suitable for many applications such as electrolysis of water and the chlor-alkali process.  The use of such an ion-exchange membrane in microfluidics could have multiple advantages, but there is no reversible/irreversible bonding that occurs between PDMS and  Nafion{TM}. In this project multiple methods of physical entrapment of the ion-exchange material inside a film of PDMS are attempted. Through the use of the inherent properties of PDMS, very inexpensive sugar granulate can be used to make an inexpensive membrane mould which does not interfere with the PDMS crosslinking process. After dissolving away this sacrificial mould material, Nafion{TM} is solidified in the irregular granulate holes. Nafion{TM} in this membrane is confined in the irregular shape of the PDMS openings. The outer structure of the membrane is all PDMS and can be attached easily and securely to any PDMS-based microfluidic device through reversible or irreversible PDMS/PDMS bonding. Through impedance measurement, the effectiveness of these integrated membranes are compared against plain Nafion{TM} films in simple sodium chloride solutions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The heat transfer from a hot primary flow stream passing over the outside of an airfoil shaped strut to a cool secondary flow stream passing through the inside of that strut was studied experimentally and numerically.  The results showed that the heat transfer on the inside of the strut could be reliably modeled as a developing flow and described using a power law model.&#xD;
The heat transfer on the outside of the strut was complicated by flow separation and stall on the suction side of the strut at high angles of attack.  This separation was quite sensitive to the condition of the turbulence in the flow passing over the strut, with the size of the separated wake changing significantly as the mean magnitude and levels of anisotropy were varied.  The point of first stall moved by as much as 15% of the chord, while average heat transfer levels changed by 2-5% as the inlet condition was varied.  This dependence on inlet conditions meant that comparisons between experiment and steady RANS based CFD were quite poor.  Differences between the CFD and experiment were attributed to anisotropic and unsteady effects.&#xD;
The coupling between the two flows was shown to be quite low - that is to say, heat transfer coefficients on both the inner and outer surfaces of the strut were relatively unaffected by the temperature of the strut, and it was possible to predict the temperature on the strut surface quite reliably using heat transfer data from decoupled tests, especially for CFD simulations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>GM2 gangliosidoses is a family of severe, neurodegenerative disorders resulting from a deficiency in the β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) enzyme. This disorder is typically caused by a mutation to either the HEXA gene, causing Tay Sachs disease, or a mutation to the HEXB gene, causing Sandhoff disease. The HEXA and HEXB genes are required to produce the α and β subunits of the Hex A enzyme respectively. Using a Sandhoff disease (SD) mouse model (Hexb-/-) we tested the potential of a low dose of systemically delivered single stranded adeno-associated virus 9 (ssAAV9) expressing human HEXB and human HEXA cDNA under the control of a single promoter through the use of a bicistronic vector design with a P2A linker to correct the neurological phenotype. Neonatal mice were injected with either this ssAAV9-HexB-P2A-HexA vector (HexB-HexA) or a vehicle solution via the superficial temporal vein. HexB-HexA treatment alone conferred an increase in survival of 56% compared to vehicle-injected controls and biochemical analysis of the brain tissue and serum revealed an increase in HexA activity and a decrease in brain GM2 ganglioside buildup. Additionally, treatments with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin (Indo), the histone deactylase inhibitor ITF2357 (ITF) and the pharmacological chaperone pyrimethamine (Pyr) were tested. The anti-inflammatory treatments of Indo and ITF conferred an increase in survival of 12% and 8% respectively while causing no alteration in the HexA activity or GM2 ganglioside buildup. Pyr had no observable effect on disease progression. Lastly HexB-HexA treatment was tested in conjunction with Indo, ITF and Pyr individually. Additive increases in survival and behavioural testing results were observed with Indo and ITF treatments while no additional benefit to HexA activity or GM2 ganglioside levels in the brain tissue was observed. This indicates the two treatments slowed the progression of the disease through a different mechanism than the reduction of the GM2 ganglioside substrate. Pyr treatment was shown to have no effect when combined with HexB-HexA treatment. This study demonstrates the potential amelioration of SD with a novel AAV9 gene therapy approach as well as helped to identify the additive potential of anti-inflammatory treatments in gene therapy of GM2 gangliosidoses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, accounting for over 25% of cancer diagnoses and 13% of cancer-related deaths in Canadian women.  There are many types of therapies for treatment or management of breast cancer, with chemotherapy being one of the most widely used.  Taxol (paclitaxel) is one of the most extensively used chemotherapeutic agents for treating cancers of the breast and numerous other sites.  Taxol stabilizes microtubules during mitosis, causing the cell cycle to arrest until eventually the cell undergoes apoptosis.  Although Taxol has had significant benefits in many patients, response rates range from only 25-69%, and over half of Taxol-treated patients eventually acquire resistance to the drug.  Drug resistance remains one of the greatest barriers to effective cancer treatment, yet little has been discerned regarding resistance to Taxol, despite its widespread clinical use.   &#xD;
	Kinases are known to be heavily involved in cancer development and progression, and several kinases have been linked to resistance of Taxol and other chemotherapeutic agents.    However, a systematic screen for kinases regulating Taxol resistance is lacking.  Thus, in this study, a set of kinome-wide screens was conducted to interrogate the involvement of kinases in the Taxol response.   Positive-selection and negative-selection CRISPR-Cas9 screens were conducted, whereby a pooled library of 5070 sgRNAs targeted 507 kinase-encoding genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were Taxol-sensitive (WT) or Taxol-resistant (TxR) which were then treated with Taxol.  Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on cells that survived Taxol treatment, allowing identification and quantitation of sgRNAs.&#xD;
	STK38, Blk, FASTK and Nek3 stand out as potentially critical kinases for Taxol-induced apoptosis to occur.  Furthermore, kinases CDKL1 and FRK may have a role in Taxol resistance.  Further validation of these candidate kinases will provide novel pre-clinical data about potential predictive biomarkers or therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients in the future.</dcterms:abstract>
