      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to understand how organizations manage decline, focusing on the role of management accounting. In the first study, I investigate the role of management accounting in organizations that experience decline. Through a field study in five private sector organizations and one public sector organization, I offer a theory-based explanation for why some organizations use management accounting, while others do not. I find that, when decline arises from discontinuous and unpredictable environmental change, the shock drives organizational members to first convince themselves that their accounting systems and reports can be relied upon and to then use this accounting information to manage decline. In contrast, without any significant discontinuity at the onset of decline, organizational members question the “truth and value” of accounting and, as a result, are not driven to mobilize it to manage decline. In the second study, I conduct additional field work in the public sector organization from the first study to more closely examine how management accounting is used to manage decline and pursue a performance turnaround. I find that leaders actively use management accounting practices to construct an understanding of their organization’s decline through sensemaking and persuade employees to become involved in turnaround efforts through sensegiving. Further, I highlight accountability as an important adjunct to these sensemaking and sensegiving activities. Varied accountability relationships and mechanisms were instituted to discipline the meanings that were constructed and to ensure these meanings were incorporated into organizational decision making and action. In the third study, I empirically test a typology of environmental decline by examining organizations’ behaviours and response strategies during decline. Leveraging the same set of interviews as the first study, I find that leaders’ behaviours and, in particular, their strategic responses and emphasis on efficiency or effectiveness align with the typology. Thus, I highlight that specific details of the environmental change leading to organizational decline have implications for its management. Together, these studies explain the management response to decline and, in particular, show that management accounting is a critical resource for some organizations as their members manoeuvre decline.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Blasting fumes are an important safety topic for the mining industry because toxic fumes are generated by the detonation of explosives.  Prediction of the amount and concentration of blasting fumes is important for underground mines to provide enough ventilation to ensure worker safety.  The production of toxic fumes in open pit mines is a significant hazard to workers and surrounding communities because fumes are easily able to travel from the blast zone with wind.  An important hazard often overlooked is the potential for blasting fumes to remain trapped in the blasted material until it is handled or for the fumes to slowly escape to the atmosphere.&#xD;
The present investigation into blasting fumes examines the real time concentrations of the fumes produced after detonation using a continual gas analyzer.  The fumes analyzed were nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The first set of experiments studied the effect of accepted factors affecting fume production, mainly product formulation and confinement. The second set of experiments simulated fumes travelling through blasted material in an attempt to measure the portion of fumes that remain trapped after detonation and to observe the fume output over a long amount of time.  This improves on previous studies by analyzing the sample continuously throughout the period of concern, instead of obtaining few discrete samples that require offsite analysis. &#xD;
The results show product formulation and type are major factors of toxic fume production.  Emulsion explosives produced very little toxic fumes and ANFO, no matter the composition, would always produce some amount of toxic fume.  On average, ANFO produced 4.5 times the amount of CO and 7.5 times the amount of NO2 as compared to the emulsion explosive. In the case of ANFO, confinement has a significant effect on toxic fume production. The set of experiments on fume entrapment indicated significant amounts, up to 70%, of blasting fumes are trapped in the muckpile and are released when the muckpile is disturbed, presenting potential health hazards to workers in the area.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chapter one of this thesis describes preliminary efforts towards the development of the rhodium-catalyzed allylic arylation reaction employing nucleophiles containing ortho-DMGs (directed metalation groups). Unfortunately, a variety of rhodium(I) catalysts and carbonate-based leaving groups screened during the optimization studies were not successful within this reaction, with poor regioselectivity being observed in all cases.&#xD;
Chapter two describes the optimization and scope of the copper-catalyzed SN2´ allylic arylation reaction using DoM (Directed ortho Metalation)-derived nucleophiles. An air stable and environmentally benign copper(I)-NHC catalyst has been found to facilitate this SN2´ allylic arylation process, forming C−C bonds in a highly regioselective manner. A variety of DMGs and acyclic allylic bromides were tolerated within this reaction, with a single example showcasing its application on the analogous cyclohexene derivative. Preliminary efforts towards the enantioselective variant of this reaction are also described.&#xD;
Chapter three describes the development and optimization of the DMG dance reaction on the 7-azaindole heterocycle, thus allowing its highly regioselective functionalization via sequential DoM reactions. Excellent C-6 anion formation of 7-azaindole was achieved, with a variety of carbon-based and heteroatom-based electrophiles being well tolerated. Preliminary application of the DoM reaction on L-745870, an antipsychotic agent containing the 7-azaindole skeleton, was successful. Studies towards the synthesis of other potentially bioactive analogues of L-745870 via this methodology are currently ongoing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation contributes to the growing body of geographic, gerontological, health, and social science research on community support for persons with dementia and their partners in care with a particular focus on rural and small town settings. Focusing on rural and small town settings as well as the range of sites and services involved in caring for dementia is increasingly important. The bulk of care for dementia is taking place in home and community settings, raising questions about the quality and kind of support available, particularly in rural areas that generally have fewer formal health services and a higher proportion of older people than urban areas. Within the current literature on dementia care in the community, there is evidence of distinct challenges to service provision in rural settings, differences in service use, and unmet care needs. However, both academic researchers and policy makers have generally failed to consider the experiences of the voluntary sector, partners in care, and persons with dementia in rural and small-town settings. &#xD;
	To address this gap, I examine the continuum of care settings and the suitability of support for those living with dementia and their partners in care in rural and small-town Ontario. I ask: what services are available across the province of Ontario; how do those living with and caring for someone with dementia in rural Ontario experience places of care; and what are their specific needs and challenges over the course of the disease? To answer these questions, I conducted a survey of service-providers (N=20) in the province and carried out semi-structured interviews with persons with dementia and partners in care (N=73). The findings revealed regional variation in service availability and delivery as well as challenges related to service delivery in rural and small town settings. In fact, community support for persons with dementia in rural and small town setting is generally underdeveloped. I analyze the consequences of this underdevelopment for persons with dementia and their partners in care. I conclude with a set of suggestions for improving community care for persons with dementia and their partners in care.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies financial market stability by exploring asset bubbles and contagions over financial markets. First I construct a model where bubbles arise from a lack of common knowledge about the asset value among traders with private information, and I evaluate the effects of capital gain tax and transaction costs on bubbles. I find that capital gains tax has no effect on the size of the bubble when there is a perfect tax credit for capital losses, and the size of the bubble decreases in the tax when there is no tax credit. Therefore dealing with bubbles with capital gains tax not only requires imposing the tax, but also tightening the policies on tax credits. In a simplified bubble model, it can be shown that the model is equivalent to an auction, and bubbles arise for the same reason that bidding prices fail to reveal the true value in that auction. Several experiments on taxes and subsidies are devised to reduce or eliminate bubbles. Then I study the contagion of bankruptcy through downward price pressure among investors with overlapping portfolios. I calculate the probability of an extensive contagion and the expected bankruptcy rate during such a contagion. System-wide contagion happens only when the diversification of portfolios is in a certain range and, in the upper area of that range, the probability of a crisis may be small, but the spread of contagion can be extremely extensive.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) encoded the pore forming subunit of a K+ channel that conducts an important current for the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Dysfunction of the hERG channel leads to abnormal cardiac activities characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, clinically known as long QT syndrome (LQTS), which can cause lethal tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. We have previously shown that hypokalemia induces a conformational change that leads to degradation of hERG channels from the plasma membrane (Guo et al., 2009). However, the molecular mechanisms for low K+ effect on hERG channels are not known and it is also unknown whether low K+-induced internalization of hERG channels can be prevented. Using various compounds that interact with hERG channels by binding to different regions of channels has been a field of interest to investigate the channel structure-function relationships. Moreover, certain high affinity hERG channel blockers such as E-4031 can rescue trafficking-detective hERG mutants (Gong et al., 2006). The hERG channel has an unusually long extracellular S5-pore linker to which the scorpion toxin BeKm-1 selectively binds. I hypothesized that the S5-pore linker contributes to the unique sensitivity of hERG channels to extracellular K+, and that BeKm-1 prevents the internalization of hERG channels induced by 0 mM [K+]o through binding to S5-pore linker. In the present study, I investigated the protective effects of the scorpion toxin, BeKm-1, on low K+-induced hERG internalization using whole-cell patch-clamp, and Western blot analysis. Our data demonstrate that BeKm-1 effectively prevents low K+-induced hERG current loss and protein degradation. Since BeKm-1 blocks hERG channels, its protective effect on low K+-induced hERG internalization has limited clinical potential. Thus, we designed ten BeKm-1 mutants to screen for peptides that can prevent hERG from low K+-induced internalization without blocking hERG conductance. Our data show that two mutants were able to rescue hERG channels in 0 mM [K+]o but do not block hERG conductance. This study extends our understanding of the structure-function relationship of hERG channels and revealed a potential novel way to protect hERG channels from low K+-induced internalization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) developed in Madagascar by French Jesuit and agricultural scientist Fr. Henri de Laulanie in the 1980s has since been propagated to over 50 countries worldwide. By transplanting younger seedlings, increasing the spacing between individual plants, irrigating intermittently and consistently aerating the soil, SRI promises to increase global rice production to twice the 3.7 t/ha currently experienced (Uphoff, 2003). Notwithstanding regional variance (Uphoff, 2003) and contestation of the results (Sheehy et al., 2005), SRI advocates in various countries posit SRI as an agro-ecological innovation that is an alternative to top-down, input-intensive agriculture, yet can greatly expand yields and farm incomes. These properties are argued to be particularly important in a world of rising temperatures and increased demand for foodstuffs. In projecting SRI as a singular solution to current and future constraints upon rice production, however, little attention has been given to its translation and embedding within diverse socio-ecological settings. Given that socio-ecological and political climates vary greatly from region to region, my broad research question uses political agronomy as a theoretical framework to ask:  what social realities are silenced in order to craft a narrative in which SRI can become a universal driver of agricultural development?  Through ten weeks of participatory observation and interviews with farmers, NGO representatives, researchers and extension officers directly involved in SRI in two districts in Nepal’s Terai, (Chitwan and Morang), I was able to observe how SRI is enacted in unique settings. The aim of this project was to understand how SRI practices are institutionalized on the ground and whether broad characteristics lead specific types of farmers to gravitate towards, or be selected for, the adoption of SRI (such as land holdings or access to water and institutional channels such as bank credit and agricultural extension). In asking these questions, this research aims to more adequately assess SRI's suitability as a global agricultural innovation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent human cardiac arrhythmia, is characterized by rapid and disorderly electrical activity in the atria of the heart. Kv1.5 channel mediated ultra-rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKur) is critical for timely and adequate atrial repolarization. Since cardiac IKur is specific to the atria, biomedical research surrounding Kv1.5 poses significant promise for developing clinical strategies to treat AF. In fact, loss-of-function mutations in KCNA5 (encoding Kv1.5) have been identified in patients with AF. Importantly, common pathologies, such as selective atrial ischemia, are capable of stimulating the onset of AF. A well-documented consequence of ischemia is a substantial increase in proteolytic enzyme activities. In this regard, it has been reported that cell-surface Kv1.5 channels are sensitive to cleavage by extracellular proteases, such as proteinase K (PK). In this study, we further examined the effects of extracellular proteases on the function and expression profile of Kv1.5 channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Our results demonstrate that PK cleaves membrane-bound mature (75-kDa) Kv1.5 channels at a single locus in the external S1-S2 linker, yielding 42-kDa N-terminal and 33-kDa C-terminal fragments. Contrary to our expectations, whole-cell voltage clamp analysis showed that PK treatment did not affect Kv1.5 current (IKv1.5). Examination of plasma membrane proteins isolated via biotinylation indicated that the N- and C-terminal Kv1.5 fragments were both present and stable on the cell-surface. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies following PK cleavage suggest that the two Kv1.5 fragments do not associate. Moreover, the PK-generated N- and C-terminal fragments degraded at different rates. These findings indicate that the C-terminal fragment of Kv1.5 (S2-S6, pore-containing) may be sufficient for current conduction. Our data raises the possibility that cleavage of cell-surface ion channels, assessed by Western blot analysis, does not necessarily result in a loss of channel activities. This novel insight into the Kv1.5 structure-function relationship may be indicative of an inherent protective mechanism for Kv1.5 channel function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There have been few weighing officials in history more important than the zygostatēs was to the monetary economy of the Later Roman Empire. The creation of this office dates to 363 CE, when the emperor Julian decreed their appointment as formal intermediaries in disputes over the gold currency in circulation, the solidus. This meant that they were responsible for weighing and assaying coins in order to verify that they complied with the strict minting standards of the period. In fact, the establishment of the zygostatēs came at a critical time in the history of the solidus. The fourth century CE witnessed a massive growth in both the supply and use of gold coinage. This brought with it the broad stabilization of price levels expressed in gold as well as complications due to the properties of the solidus as a form of commodity money. In this respect, the Egyptian papyri are especially important because they illustrate how some of the functional problems of the solidus were mitigated by the presence of the zygostatēs. It is consequently vital to investigate the activities of these individuals as they relate specifically to the history of the solidus. This will show that the office of the zygostatēs was a necessary part of the success of the solidus and offer greater insight into the general nature of Late Roman fiscalism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the operating room, feedback, such as instrument positioning guidance provided by surgical navigation systems is typically displayed on an external computer monitor. The surgeon’s attention is usually focused on the surgical tool and the surgical site, so the display is typically out of the direct line of sight. A simple visual feedback mechanism was developed to be mounted on the surgical tool. This feedback is within the surgeon’s direct line of sight and alerts the surgeon when it is necessary to look at the monitor for detailed navigation information. The combination of visual feedback with the surgical navigation system is designed to aid the surgeon in cutting around a tumor, maintaining negative margins, while reducing the amount of healthy tissue contained within the cut. The tool-mounted visual feedback device was designed to be light-weight, compatible with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, and pose no risk of galvanic connection to the patient. The device was tested through the resection of multiple tumor contour models using computer navigation screen only, and computer navigation screen with visual feedback mounted on the surgical tool. Use of the device was shown to decrease the amount of healthy tissue contained within the surgical cut, and to increase the subjects’ confidence in their ability to follow acceptable margins. &#xD;
The second objective of this work is to develop a system to both spatially and temporally track electrosurgical instruments, within the surgical navigation system. In order to temporally track the tools, it is important to know when the electrosurgical unit is powered on. However, electrosurgical instruments are FDA and Health Canada approved and therefore cannot be interfered with. Thus, a non-invasive method of sensing when the tool is powered on is required. Two AC current sensors, two peak detector circuits, and one voltage comparator circuit were used to detect when an electromagnetically tracked electrosurgical cauterizer is being powered on and differentiate between the cut and coagulation modes when cauterizing different substances. This can be integrated into the existing surgical navigation system through the use of an Arduino Uno microcontroller.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) are plasma membrane efflux transporters that transport a diverse array of compounds. MRP1, MRP2, MRP3 and MRP4 are considered the most pharmacologically relevant drug-transporting MRPs and have broad substrate specificities that include many xenobiotics (e.g. pharmacological agents, environmental toxins), endobiotics, and their metabolites. Although MRP1-4 have distinct substrate profiles, they can all transport glucuronide conjugated estradiol (E217βG). MK-571 was originally designed as a type 1 cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLT1R) antagonist to treat asthma; it is also the most popular MRP1 inhibitor. However, MK-571 is non-selective and inhibits all MRP homologues as well as at least one solute carrier transporter, limiting its usefulness as an experimental tool. Additional leukotriene modifiers (LTMs) selective for either CysLT1R or the type 2 cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLT2R) have been developed but little is known of their ability to modulate MRP1 and its homologues. In this study, seven LTMs selective for either CysLT1R or CysLT2R were examined for their ability to modulate E217βG uptake into MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, or MRP4-enriched membrane vesicles. Their effect on the uptake of a second physiological organic anion was also measured for MRP1 (leukotriene C¬4; LTC¬4) and MRP4 (prostaglandin E2; PGE2). For E217βG, the IC50 values of the 7 LTMs tested ranged from 1.2 to 26.9 μM and the IC50 values for MRP1 and MRP4 were the most similar. In contrast, some LTMs stimulated MRP2 and MRP3 activity. Thus, LY171883 stimulated MRP2 and MRP3-mediated E217βG uptake by 2 to 4-fold while montelukast and pranlukast modulated MRP2 activity in a biphasic manner. CysLT1R-selective LTMs were generally less potent as modulators of MRP2 and MRP3 activity although CysLTR selectivity did not correlate with LTM potency for MRP1 and MRP4. The rank order of LTM inhibitory potencies for E217βG versus LTC4 uptake by MRP1 and E217βG versus PGE2 uptake by MRP4 were similar. These data suggest that, like MK-571, LTMs are generally non-selective modulators of MRP transport activity despite their CysLTR selectivity, and should therefore be used with caution in MRP-related research because of their potential to confound data interpretation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis reports on a phenomenological study designed to examine the traditional winter camping experience from the perspective of the participant. The specific research questions that guided this study were: (a) What are the personal meanings that traditional winter campers attach to their experiences? (b) What factors led to their decision to take up the activity of traditional winter camping? (c) How has participation in traditional winter camping affected changes in their own attitudes towards nature, wilderness travel, personal identity and feelings of self-reliance? and (d) What are the unique learning outcomes that could be achieved by including traditional winter camping activities as part of outdoor education experiences? The participants in this study were eight people who regularly participate in traditional winter camping activities. I conducted semi-structured interviews with them in order to discover the attachments, significant aspects and personal meanings that they see in relation to their traditional winter camping experiences. Analysis of the data revealed three core themes that were central to the experiences of traditional winter campers. These are: connection to the land, sense of community, and personal empowerment. The findings suggest that participation in traditional winter camping activities may have an impact on physical, mental and social well-being, and may help to foster pro-environmental attitudes. The thesis research also illuminated unique aspects of this activity and participants’ experiences. Suggestions for continued research are described, which may provide further insight into this phenomenon.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents one of the first unbiased investigations of the first- and second-generation gas-rich dwarf galaxy populations of nearby interacting groups.  Individually, these low-mass objects offer information about the evolutionary history of their respective groups.  Collectively, the multi-wavelength dataset presented here enables direct comparison of the properties and prevalence of gas-rich dwarfs to those predicted by numerical simulations, particularly the tidal objects.  Starting with HI maps from the blind Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA), three nearby groups: NGC 3166/9, NGC 871/6/7 and NGC 4725/47 were selected for high-resolution HI follow-up and deep optical imaging.  Observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) are able to identify and resolve the HI belonging to the low-mass group members, thereby enabling gas and dynamical mass measurements.  Deep g'r'i'-band optical photometry, from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam, is used to infer the stellar masses, ages and metallicities of putative optical counterparts to these gas-rich detections.  The combination of HI and optical data allows for dynamical to baryonic mass calculations and stellar population estimates that facilitate the distinction between and classification of dwarf irregulars (dIrrs), short-lived tidal knots and tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs).  Overall, the three groups in this study contain a total of eight spiral galaxies, at least eight dIrrs, four tidal knots (with M_HI ~ 10^7 M_sol) that are likely short-lived, and four tidal knots containing sufficient gas to survive and evolve into long-lived TDGs.  This result implies that there are ~1.3 long-lived galaxy-like tidal features per interacting spiral galaxy pair, which is consistent with standard cosmological galaxy interaction simulations.  The tidal objects examined in this survey also appear to have a wider variety of properties than the TDGs formed in current simulations, which could be the result of pre- or post-formation environmental influences.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this program of research I examined the influence of multiple-showup procedures on the reliability of eyewitness identification.  If an eyewitness rejects a suspect from a showup, law enforcement personnel may search for new suspects, and if a new suspect is found, they may run another showup with the same eyewitness.  Law enforcement personnel may go through several iterations of finding suspects and running showups with the same eyewitness for single-perpetrator crimes (Chapter 3, Study 1).  The use of multiple-showup procedures with the same eyewitness increased innocence risk (Clark &amp; Godfrey, 2009), the probability that a suspect was innocent given identification (Chapter 3, Studies 2 and 3).  The increase in innocence risk was primarily attributable to the fact that innocent suspect identifications cumulate when law enforcement personnel use multiple showups in single-perpetrator crimes.  Although pre-showup instructions decreased innocent suspect identifications, innocence risk remained unacceptably high (Chapter 3, Study 4; Chapter 4).  On a more positive note, pre-showup instructions intended to reduce eyewitness’ perceptions of scarcity (belief that they may not have another opportunity to identify the perpetrator) decreased innocent suspect identifications over and above a may-or-may-not be present admonition (Chapter 4).  Scarcity instructions may prove useful in identification procedures, more broadly.  I argue that an identification from a multiple-showup procedure is not reasonable evidence of guilt; however, practical constraints may require that law enforcement personnel sometimes show eyewitnesses more than a single showup.  A stronger partition between investigative and evidentiary procedures is recommended (Chapter 5).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
In the introduction, chapter one, I seek to give a brief oversight of the thesis&#xD;
chapter by chapter.&#xD;
Chapter two is a brief biography of Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb, the still&#xD;
internationally recognized Sophoclean authority, and his much less well-known life&#xD;
as a humanitarian and a compassionate, human rights–committed person.&#xD;
In chapter three I look at δεινός, one of the most ambiguous words in the&#xD;
ancient Greek language, and especially at its presence and interpretation in the first&#xD;
line of the “Ode to Man”: 332–375 in Sophocles’ Antigone, and how it is used&#xD;
elsewhere in Sophocles and in a few other fifth-century writers.&#xD;
In chapter 4 I examine the “Ode To Man” itself, which has caused&#xD;
considerable academic discussion: Does it belong here? What role does it play in&#xD;
Antigone? Is it essential to the play?&#xD;
In chapter five I seek to discover the character of Antigone as Sophocles has&#xD;
drawn her. She is a fascinating woman, not only in her commitment to burying her&#xD;
brother Polyneices, but also in the subtleties in her that Sophocles has portrayed.&#xD;
When it comes to Sophocles, conclusions are most difficult, but I needs but try.&#xD;
Finally, the two appendices examine first Eglantyne Jebb, Sir Richard’s&#xD;
i&#xD;
niece who, with her sister Dorothy, founded “Save The Children,” and last of all,&#xD;
the “Apostles,” a secret society of Cambridge University of which Jebb was a&#xD;
member.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The main purpose of this thesis is to explore the synergies that exist between multi-platform geodetic data. Focus is placed on gravity and topography datasets which are obtained from satellite, airborne and terrestrial platforms. The assessment of uncertainties in these datasets is of prime importance in order to identify useful fusion algorithms and models. Today, geodetic satellite and airborne missions are often incorporated as part of observational survey campaigns and produce spatially homogeneous coverage of the Earth’s gravity field and topography. However, the accuracy of the data and the spatial resolution are often inferior compared to data acquired through conventional terrestrial survey methods. Thus, terrestrially-based measurements remain a valuable source of information. In this thesis, fusion of gravity data involves combination schemes, in the measurement domain, of gravity data acquired from satellite, airborne and terrestrial means. The resulting fused gravity-field models are of importance in the fields of geodesy and geophysics, as they enable centimeter-level geoid modeling (essential for accurate GPS-leveling) and improved modeling of the Earth’s crust and lithosphere (important for better understanding geodynamic processes), and aid geological interpretation (important for exploration geophysics). &#xD;
Uncertainty estimation is twofold and focused on estimating elevation errors in satellite-based digital elevation models (DEMs) and system measurement errors in airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys. The quality of topographic information is useful for reliable quantitative analyses in applications such as hydrology, flood and inundation modeling and multi-temporal topographic elevation comparisons (e.g., erosion monitoring, rockslides and landslides).&#xD;
The main results of this research include (i) the determination of the relevance of airborne gravity data to fused multi-platform gravity-field models, (ii) the investigation of the role of ground control points for the quality assessment of DEMs, and (iii) the impact of a refined stochastic model for airborne LiDAR measurements in practical applications. &#xD;
Overall, this research provides a much needed guide on the challenges of working with multi-platform geodetic data measurements and the benefit of identifying the synergies between satellite, airborne and terrestrial platforms, leading to improved fused gravity field models and improved uncertainty estimations of topographic data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dysfunction of the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)-encoded rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel is a major cause of long QT syndrome (LQTS) due to its critical role in the repolarization of cardiac action potentials. The density of hERG channels on the cell surface, as a key determinant of its regular function, is balanced by channel trafficking to and internalization from the plasma membrane. We have shown that the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, Nedd4-2 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2), regulates hERG channel degradation by targeting the PY motif in the C-terminus of hERG channels. Interestingly, although a PY motif exists in both the immature (intracellular) and mature (cell-surface) channels, Nedd4-2 selectively degrades the mature hERG proteins. Moreover, Nedd4-2 is modulated by various proteins, such as protein kinase C (PKC). In this work, I investigated the hypotheses that the selective degradation of the 155-kDa hERG channel by Nedd4-2 is achieved by additional Nedd4 family interacting proteins (Ndfips) and that PKC signalling regulates hERG expression and function through Nedd4-2. &#xD;
Using whole-cell patch-clamp, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry, I demonstrated that Nedd4-2 is directed to specific cellular compartments by Ndfip1 and Ndfip2. Ndfip1 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus where it recruits Nedd4-2 to target mature hERG proteins for degradation during channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. Ndfip2 mainly recruits Nedd4-2 to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which may impair MVBs function and impede the degradation of internalized hERG proteins. On the other hand, PKA and PKC activations increase hERG proteins on the plasma membrane by distinct mechanisms. While it is possible that PKA enhances hERG protein synthesis, PKC attenuates hERG channel degradation by inactivating Nedd4-2 via phosphorylation. &#xD;
These findings extend our understanding of hERG channel regulation by Nedd4-2 and provide information useful for rescuing impaired hERG function in LQTS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Children are selective social learners who resist learning from informants who are either not able or not willing to provide correct information (see Koenig &amp; Sabbagh, 2013; Mills, 2013 for reviews). To date, however, we have a very limited understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms by which children’s selective social learning manifests. The few proposals that I know of have been focused on the processes underlying children’s selective word learning. These studies, however, have been restricted to using modified comprehension test questions and word training paradigms to examine the kinds of representations children create for trained novel words. Although informative, findings from these studies do not provide evidence about how, specifically, the word learning process is altered when information about word meanings is provided by knowledgeable versus ignorant sources. To better understand the mechanisms by which children show selective word learning, I recorded children’s event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in response to the presentation of trained novel words. My goal was to assess whether children created semantic representations for novel words that were trained by an ignorant source. To this end, I investigated the N400 component of the ERP, a centro-parietally distributed negative waveform peaking around 400 ms that indexes how meaning-related information is stored in semantic memory. I found that children who were trained novel words by an ignorant source did not integrate the meaning of the novel words into lexical-semantic memory, as evidenced by a tenuous N400 effect, but demonstrated ERP evidence for recognizing the trained novel words. These findings suggest that, when children encounter a word-object link from an ignorant source, they engage a mechanism that specifically disrupts the semantic processes involved in word learning. Furthermore, children who were trained by an ignorant speaker subsequently showed ERP evidence of attenuated attention to novel words relative to children who were trained by knowledgeable speakers. These findings support the idea that children formed a stable attribution of the speaker’s knowledge state and used this information to block their attention to subsequent information by that speaker.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dense deployment of wireless local area network (WLAN) access points (APs) is an important part of the next generation Wi-Fi and standardization (802.11ax) efforts are underway. Increasing demand for WLAN connectivity motivates such dense deployments, especially in geographical areas with large numbers of users, such as stadiums, large enterprises, multi-tenant buildings, and urban cities. Although densification of WLAN APs guarantees coverage, it is susceptible to increased interference and uncoordinated association of stations (STAs) to APs, which degrade network throughput. Therefore, to improve network throughput, algorithms are proposed in this thesis to optimally coordinate AP associations in the presence of interference. &#xD;
In essence, coordination of APs in dense WLANs (DWLANs) is achieved through coordination of STAs' associations with APs. While existing approaches suggest tuning of APs' beacon powers or using transmit power control (TPC) for association control, here, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio  (SINRs) of STAs and the clear channel assessment (CCA) threshold of the 802.11 MAC protocol are employed. The proposed algorithms in this thesis enhance throughput and minimize coverage holes inherent in cell breathing and TPC techniques by not altering the transmit powers of APs, which determine cell coverage. Besides uncoordinated AP associations, unnecessary frequent transmission deferment is envisaged as another problem in DWLANs due to the clear channel assessment aspect of the carrier sensing multiple access collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme in 802.11 standards and the short spatial reuse distance between co-channel APs.  To address this problem in addition to AP association coordination, an algorithm is proposed for CCA threshold adjustment in each AP cell, such that CCA threshold used in one cell mitigates transmission deferment in neighboring cells.&#xD;
Performance evaluation reveals that the proposed association optimization algorithms achieve significant gain in throughput when compared with the default strongest signal first (SSF) association scheme in the current 802.11 standard. Also, further gain in throughput is observed when the CCA threshold adjustment is combined with the optimized association. Results show that when STA-AP association is optimized and CCA threshold is adjusted in each cell, throughput improves. Finally, transmission delay and the number of packet re-transmissions due to collision and contention significantly decrease.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cut-off grade is a concept used in the mining industry to decide whether to consider the material from the mine as ore or waste. The decision of the specific cut-off grade used in a mine should be periodically evaluated because this concept involves variables such as commodity prices, mining costs, processing costs, metallurgical and mining recoveries, and it is also necessary to take into account the grade distribution of the deposit.&#xD;
The Dominga project, an IOCG deposit located in Chile, is studied to evaluate the differences of applying different methodologies to select the cut-off grade that maximizes the discounted value of the project. To work with the Dominga project it was necessary to build a recovery model to meet the requirements of the software involved in this study (Whittle Software, version 4.5.3). After this, three different case studies were developed using different strategies to define an iron cut-off grade that maximizes the NPV. These different strategies are identified as using the marginal cut-off grade, a defined cut-off grade and a cut-off grade optimization.&#xD;
As a result, from the three different case studies, the improvement in the discounted cash flow generated by applying a strategy of cut-off grade optimization rather than a marginal strategy is 3%. If capital expenditure is considered, an improvement of 8% in the NPV is achieved. If this strategy is compared with using a defined cut-off grade, the results are similar.&#xD;
As a conclusion, for this particular deposit, where the iron ore grade displays homogenous distribution, the effect of applying cut-off grade optimization and the use of a defined iron cut-off grade is very similar.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation applies Rob Nixon’s argument that “arresting stories, images, and symbols” are required to draw attention to the slow violence of environmental degradation (Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor 3) to an extended case study of the way in which narratives in various forms, media, and genres have disseminated and legitimated one Indigenous community’s claims about the violence wrought by uranium mining on their land. The case study on which the project centers is the fifty-year campaign undertaken by members of the community of Déline, Northwest Territories to obtain recognition of and remediation for the environmental, cultural, and psychological risks and damages of federally-mandated uranium mining on Great Bear Lake. &#xD;
Like previous scholarship on risk definition, environmental justice, and the environmentalism of the poor, this study draws out the ways in which conflicts over risk definition give rise to environmental injustice. Like some of this scholarship, it highlights the importance of narrative to legitimating officially discounted risk definitions. The study builds on existing scholarship by adding the variable of cross-cultural, multiple-media adaptation into the equation, arguing that adaptations can alter dominant perceptions of risk even as they alter the discounted risk perceptions they support. Re/mediation, the term the project coins to convey this process of restoring legitimacy to marginalized narratives through mediation, is thus offered as a problematic but ultimately effective riposte to slow violence and its attendant environmental injustices. This project is only the second book-length work on the case study at hand, and the first to analyze textual representations of it across multiple media.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Location-Based Services (LBS) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand&#xD;
positioning accuracy and availability requirements. In urban canyons, Global Navi-&#xD;
gation Satellite Systems (GNSS) su er from signal blockage, severe multipath, and&#xD;
low Carrier-to-Noise (C/No) ratio which degrade positioning accuracy and availabil-&#xD;
ity. Therefore, applications solely relying on GNSS have limited performance. In this&#xD;
thesis, we present a novel uni ed Cooperative Positioning (CP) solution which en-&#xD;
hances positioning accuracy and availability in urban canyons. The proposed system&#xD;
exploits the fact that vehicles have di erent positioning resources and is based on&#xD;
Angle Approximation (AA). AA requires no infrastructure or other aiding sensors,&#xD;
AA is distributed and addresses two core challenges (limited positioning accuracy and&#xD;
availability) in a uni ed solution. AA arti cially generates the hindered pseudorange&#xD;
by sharing pseudoranges between vehicles using Dedicated Short Range Communi-&#xD;
cation (DSRC). To enhance the performance of the AA technique, we propose the&#xD;
Absolute Sum of Double Di erencing (ASODD) method which increases the probabil-&#xD;
ity of selecting the most accurate generated pseudorange. We also propose a vehicle&#xD;
selection method called Absolute Sum of Single Di erencing (ASOSD). As the dis-&#xD;
tance between vehicles decrease, the accuracy of the proposed system increases and&#xD;
hence ASOSD is utilized to increase the probability of selecting the nearest assistingvehicle to the target vehicle. We have developed an Orbit Simulator to evaluate the&#xD;
performance of our system.&#xD;
In addition, we employ the proposed cooperative system to assist the loose integration&#xD;
between the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and the GPS system (using Extended&#xD;
Kalman Filter) during partial GPS outages. Using raw data from inertial sensors&#xD;
and GPS receivers in real road trajectories, we implement the cooperative INS/GPS&#xD;
loose integration and show that our cooperative integrated system outperforms the&#xD;
non-cooperative integrated system. The performance metrics used are the 2D posi-&#xD;
tioning Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error, the maximum 2D positioning error and the&#xD;
Positioning Accuracy Gain (PAG). Speci cally, the PAG gain is around 88%, 80%&#xD;
and 60% when the number of blocked satellites is one, two and three respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, Hirschsprung’s disease or diabetic gastropareisis result in the loss of enteric neurons. The replacement of these lost neurons could potentially normalize the functional disturbances associated with these diseases. Within the adult enteric nervous system (ENS) there is a population of neural stem cells (NSCs) that appear to proliferate in vitro following dissociation. Until recently enteric neurogenesis in vivo has proven challenging due to the presence of a brake on proliferation. However dissociation of enteric ganglia appears to release this brake.  We hypothesized that dissociation induces enteric neurogenesis by disrupting synaptic connections between enteric neurons. Our primary aim was to test this hypothesis and identify which enteric neurotransmitters might be responsible for the suppression of neurogenesis in vivo. &#xD;
Whole-mount preparations of intact longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus (LMMP) from mouse colon were grown in a 7-day culture protocol.  Proliferating cells were visualized by uptake of ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) while manipulating neurotransmission. Immunohistochemical analysis of the overlap between EdU-labeled cells and Human D (HuD)-immunoreactive neurons were used as a marker for neurogenesis. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed to compare population data.&#xD;
Incubation of the LMMP in tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM), which blocks action potential discharge, caused a significant 3-fold increase in myenteric neurogenesis. The muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (1 μM) also significantly enhanced neurogenesis, an effect that was mimicked by inhibiting phospholipase C with U73122 (1 μM).  Interestingly, nicotinic receptor antagonists had no effect on neurogenesis.  A significant increase in neurogenesis was also observed following inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase by 7-Nitroindazole (30 μM).  This nitrergic brake on neurogenesis may be dependent on activation of soluble-guanylyl cyclase as indicated by increased neurogenesis following incubation in oxadiazole quinoxalin (ODQ; 10 μM).  Additionally, treatment of LMMP with purinergic receptor antagonist, suramin (100 μM) resulted in increased neurogenesis per ganglia compared to controls.  In contrast to nitrergic, purinergic and cholinergic pathways, serotoninergic neurotransmission appears to play no role in modulating neurogenesis. Furthermore, inclusion of the following growth factors, glial derived neurotrophic factor, fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor, in the media for the duration of the culture period prevented excessive death of myenteric neurons in both control and drug-treated cultures. &#xD;
These data suggest that selective enteric neurotransmission suppresses neurogenesis in the adult ENS. Pharmacological manipulation of neurotransmitter pathways regulating neurogenesis may be a viable means of replacing damaged neurons and restoring normal function following GI injury.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates the production of knowledge through the archives of artist-run centres in Canada in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Archival scholars recognize that the ways materials are collected, presented, and controlled in an archive can impact the types of narratives that may be created from them. But how do such operations occur in artist-run centres, and what challenges might they pose to the construction of historical narratives? What can the ways in which centres define, organize, and provide access to their archival materials reveal about artist-run culture? More specifically, how do systems of ordering, acts of donation, archival architecture, and virtual archives of artist-run centres affect the potential use of these materials in future histories?&#xD;
&#xD;
This contemporary art history thesis borrows literature and questions from cultural studies and archival science. I explore the multiple and fluid forms of archives claimed by each of these overlapping disciplines, and by artist-run centres themselves. To generate new information about artist-run centre archives, I employ a sociological-ethnographical approach, undertaking a broad survey of arts-related self-organized entities, and conducting interviews with selected representatives of artist-run centres. The assumption that informs these methods of investigation is that information about artistic, archival, and administrative practices can best be gathered from the practitioners themselves. Such an approach respects the knowledge and autonomy of the individual and organizational participants, and is in line with a general artist-run ethos, which calls for the recognition of the experience and expertise of artists and cultural producers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A common assumption underlying many biological studies is that the data we collect from a subset of individuals are representative of the broad population of interest. However, in studies of free-ranging animals, different capture methods might skew samples towards individuals with specific morphological, physiological, and/or behavioral traits. For example, in studies of free-ranging birds, bolder individuals might be more likely to enter certain traps commonly used in capture. Many studies require the capture of individuals for sampling, for instance for measurement of morphological or physiological traits, or for marking individuals. Because the capture methods that are employed often differ both within and between studies, there is potential for capture methods to introduce bias into these studies. We sought to explore this possible bias by comparing individual birds sampled using two very different, and commonly used capture techniques. We caught free-ranging black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) using Potter traps baited with seed and mist nets paired with an audio stimulus (chickadee mobbing calls) and determined sex, body condition, baseline and stress-induced glucocorticoid levels, behavioral response to a novel object, and behavioral response to a predator. We found no significant differences in any of these traits between individuals captured in these two methods. We also found no effect of capture method on the relationship between glucocorticoid levels and risk-taking behavior. We found similar variation of traits within both methods and conclude that selection of either of these two commonly used capture methods can similarly sample the population of interest.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An industrial-scale model was developed for production of anhydrite (CaSO4) via oxidation of elemental sulfur (S) with calcite (CaCO3), and potential electrical generation. In the proposed system, sulfur is first oxidized in a combustion chamber to form sulfur dioxide (SO2) at high temperature and pressure, and expanded in a turbine to produce electrical power. Then, the SO2 is converted to CaSO4 through a Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) boiler. Further energy is recovered from the flue gas through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG). In this study, three cases were elaborated, with the best resulting in a predicted power production of 531 MW from a flow of sulfur at 72 kg/s.  The corresponding CO2 emissions are 0.675 kg/kWh, less than a new coal-fired plant’s emissions of 0.762 kg/kWh. &#xD;
Experimental studies were undertaken to test for the sulfur conversion to anhydrite in two different lab-scale reactor systems.  In the first, sulfur was gasified in an evaporator, and the resulting gas was flowed to a reactor containing calcite, similarly to a FGD system. In the second, sulfur and calcite were inserted in the same vessel to test for direct reaction. Using thermogravimetric and x-ray diffraction tests, it was found that the sulfation percentage increased as a function of temperature from 600 to 800 ⁰C, and was close in value at 800 and 900 ⁰C. The increase of temperature resulted in calcination of calcite to lime (CaO), which reacts better with sulfur; however, when reaching 900 ⁰C, sintering may have occurred, resulting in obstruction of further conversion. Molar ratios of S-CaCO3 of 0.5 showed a better conversion of sulfur (at 700, 800 and 900 ⁰C) than when the reactants were equimolar. Using pure oxygen instead of air almost always showed a higher conversion for all temperatures and reactant ratios.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most commonly inherited bleeding disorder in humans resulting from quantitative deficiencies or qualitative defects of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWD can be caused by a variety of mutations throughout the VWF gene, the majority of which are missense changes. Approximately 10% of pathologic VWF mutations are thought to disrupt the process of VWF splicing leading to VWD; however, this primarily acknowledges canonical splice site mutations, where the nucleotides are most integral and highly conserved to accomplish proper splicing. We hypothesized that pathologic splicing of VWF is likely an under-recognized mechanism of VWD, caused by variation outside of canonical splice sites. &#xD;
This thesis characterized three VWF mutations acting through pathologic splicing defects using plasma and patient-derived blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC). In Family 1 it was found that the c.3538G&gt;A mutation in exon 26 induces transcription of three in-frame aberrant splice forms (1) skipping exon 23, (2) skipping exon 26, (3) skipping exons 23 &amp; 26 together, leading to Type 1 VWD. In Family 2, the canonical c.5842+1G&gt;C mutation causes VWD through production of intracellularly retained in-frame VWF, skipping exons 33-34. The affected family also produces a transcript skipping exon 33 which was found in three normal BOEC lines at 13±0.2%. Family 3 has an intronic branch site c.6599-20A&gt;T mutation which causes Type 1 VWD through nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of the premature termination codon (PTC) containing VWF transcript skipping exon 38. In-frame aberrant transcripts were found to be decreased under high shear stress, whereas PTC-inducing transcripts were increased.&#xD;
The aberrant splice forms identified in these families were further characterized in a heterologous cell expression model using human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells for VWF expression, secretion, functionality and intracellular trafficking. All mutants except for skipping exon 33 showed reduced expression and secretion and most colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. In-frame skipping of exons 33-34 was the only mutant that was able to multimerize and retain functional platelet, collagen, and Factor VIII (FVIII) binding without co-expression of wildtype (WT) VWF.&#xD;
Alternative splicing is known to occur in approximately 95% of mammalian multi-exon genes; however, no alternative splice variants have been described for VWF thus far. We hypothesized that given the large size of the VWF gene alternative splice variants likely exist. This thesis investigated the possibility of alternative VWF splicing in normal endothelial cells (EC)s using mRNA from BOEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) grown in unstimulated static conditions or after stimulation by estrogen, histamine, plasma, DDAVP, and 15 dynes/cm2 laminar flow. The expression profiles of these EC varied by cell line; however, shear stress appeared to consistently modulate the expression of both in-frame and PTC-inducing alternative splicing transcripts.&#xD;
The results presented in this thesis provide insight into VWF biology and biosynthesis, through the removal of skipped exons and VWF trafficking, and gleans insight into potential alternative VWF splice forms which may be regulated by shear stress and act to control VWF expression or serve other functions in vivo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As over 40,000 Canadian service-personnel returned from the war in Afghanistan, more than one third believe they did not make a successful transition. This study inquiries into the lived-experience of Canadian Veterans who have made this transition and demonstrates how difficult transition experiences can contribute to suicidal ideation among Veterans. The vast majority of research on suicide among Veterans focuses on the impact of mental disorders such as Post-traumatic Stress and Major Depressive Disorders, resulting from traumas incurred on deployment. Discussions of difficult social transitions run parallel to this research on suicide. Research on Canadian Veterans in transition to civilian life highlights the negative effect of losing one’s tightly formed communal bonds when leaving the military (Black and Papile, 2010). In addition, Veteran Affairs Canada’s Life After Service Studies (2014) have found that compared to the general Canadian population, Regular Force Veterans are less likely to have a sense of community belonging and are less often satisfied with life. The purpose of this dissertation is to connect the literature on suicide with research on issues related to social belonging during transition. A concept of transitional injury is developed to bridge this gap and build on current understandings of suicidal ideation among Veterans. This research employs semi-structured qualitative in-depth interviews with 35 Canadian male Veterans who deployed to Afghanistan. Following the interviews, a thematic analysis was conducted to understand the major social barriers individuals face as they transition into civilian occupations and family life. Durkheim’s theory of suicide is applied to this contemporary social phenomenon to demonstrate the relevance of his sociology of morality in light of recent developments in the field of suicidology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A new type of liquid crystal display using surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystals (SSFLCs) has faster switching times than conventional nematic displays. The application of SSFLCs in large LCD devices such as TVs has been hindered due to a layer contraction at the smectic A-smectic C transition. The layer contraction leads to buckling of the smectic layers and results in zigzag defects. These zigzag defects degrade optical quality of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) films. So-called ‘de Vries-like’ liquid crystals with a smectic A-smectic C layer contraction of less than 1% have been sought to address the problem.&#xD;
In the first section of this thesis, we show that one can tune mesomorphic properties in 2-phenylpyrimidine liquid crystals by addition of a nanosegregating phenoxy end group. In this study, it was shown that nanosegregation can be used to exaggerate the difference in mesophase properties in sterically equivalent isomers. The study also showed that the effect of nanosegregration is not always Smectic C promoting and that, although it may decrease orientational order, it is not the only prerequisite to ‘de Vries-like’ properties in calamitic mesogens. Next, we investigated the phenoxy end group through substituent effects. In this study, it was discovered that the SmC phase can be promoted through increased intermolecular interactions that decrease out of layer fluctuations.&#xD;
We also showed that phenoxy-terminated mesogens exhibit extremely low optical tilt angles for the SmC phase, on the order of ~10 degrees, which were not consistent with the observed layer spacing obtained from X-ray diffraction experiments. In attempts to determine their true optical tilt angle, these mesogens were doped with chiral dopants and electro-optical switching experiments showed higher optical tilt angles.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dendritic cells (DCs) secrete cytokines such as interleukin-23 (IL-23) when stimulated with certain Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and infected with pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. IL-23 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in the proliferation and differentiation of the IL-17 producing Th17- CD4 T helper cells. The lack of efficient cytokine production from antigen-presenting cells, such as DCs, can impact CD4 differentiation and thus impair the immune responses against pathogens. Clearance of some bacterial infections, such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Listeria monocytogenes has been shown to be dependent on the induction of IL-23 and therefore, deregulation of these cytokines as a direct result of virus infection may impede immune responses to secondary infections. Here, an inhibition of TLR ligand or P. aeruginosa-induced IL-23 expression in Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV)-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) has been demonstrated, indicating that an important function of these cells is disrupted during virus/bacterial coinfection. While production of TNF-α was unaffected in LPS stimulated cells, TNF-α was significantly inhibited in bacterium infected cells by LCMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
Type I IFN in LPS or LCMV infected cell was not detected and therefore, ruling out the possibility of cytokine suppression by Type I IFN. The production of IL-10 was high in BMDCs infected with LCMV and stimulated with LPS or bacteria. Analysis of multiple cytokines produced in this coinfection model demonstrated that LCMV infection impacts specific cytokine production upon LPS or bacterium infection, which may be important for bacterial clearance. This data is important for future immunotherapy use in viral/bacterial coinfection scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: Research is ongoing on how best to integrate simulation-based surgical training and the associated quantitative metrics into competency-based medical education. In a review of the literature, study data management tools and methods were lacking.  Specifically, we were not able to find any open-source tools for managing data associated with simulation-based education. Our objective was to develop a practical data management workflow and architecture for simulation studies and implement the workflow as a free and open-source software tool.  Methods: We designed the required data management to be compatible with the Perk Tutor (www.perktutor.org ) free open-source medical simulation platform, developed primarily for image-guided intervention training. In order to determine key requirements, we consulted medical training experts who routinely use the Perk Tutor for trainee evaluation. With this information, we documented the current workflow and identified its limitations.  Software design methods were followed to design the required data management module. In the analysis phase of the project, possible storage options were compared in order to choose one that would fulfill the requirements. Options included: XML, comma-separated values, e-learning platforms and database tools.&#xD;
Results: A prototype module was implemented as designed within the Perk Tutor platform. The module downloads, and parses data in CSV format from a learning management system (Moodle). Then, the simulation data generated and session metadata is saved together to the local file directory. The local directory is synchronized with a remote password-protected file server and trainee results are uploaded to Moodle. This system of data storage was found to be secure and user-friendly. The implemented module facilitates acquiring metadata and ensuring simulation results are securely stored and accessible for analysis. Conclusion: The new workflow design allowed us to implement a prototype module within the open-source Perk Tutor image-guided intervention training platform. Future work includes surveying users to evaluate the usefulness and performance of our data management solution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Crosslinking monomers or a polymer around template molecules and the subsequent removal of the templates yield a polymer matrix containing cavities that resemble the shape of the templates and bear binding groups that complement those on the template molecules.  However, a key challenge facing those molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) is the infidelity of the pores generated to the original templates and thus non-specific binding of the pores to analytes other than the template.  I report in this thesis a method to improve the selectivity of MIP particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
I prepared an MIP for a chiral analyte relying not only on the traditional H-bonding interactions between the polymer matrix and the template but also on the - stacking interactions. Specifically, I synthesized a novel diblock copolymer poly(ethylene oxide)226-block-poly[(2-pentafluorocinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)75%-ran-[2-(2’-carboxybenzoyloxy)ethyl methacrylate]25%]100 or PEO226-b-P(FEMA75%-r-CA25%)100.  While the CA groups were introduced because of their H-bond interactions with carbonyl oxygen and amino group of the chiral template D-phenylalanine anilide, the FEMA units were introduced for their ability to crosslink under the UV irradiation and also for the π-π stacking interactions of the fluorinated FEMA phenyl rings with the phenyl rings of D-phenylalanine anilide. To prepare MIP nanoparticles, I first dispersed the diblock copolymer and D-phenylalanine anilide in chloroform/methanol at 95 vol% of methanol to prepare micelles that bore PEO coronal chains and a P(FEMA-r-CA) core that complexed with D-phenylalanine anilide.  I then photocrosslinked the micellar core and locked the FEMA and CA units around the template molecules.  In a third step, I extracted out D-phenylalanine anilide using a solvent.  I discovered that these crosslinked MIP nanoparticles had a selectivity of 6.3 towards the binding of D-phenylalanine anilide over L-phenylalanine anilide.  This represented a 70% increase in selectivity of MIP nanoparticles prepared from an analogous approach by replacing PEO226-b-P(FEMA75%-r-CA25%)100 with PEO226-b-P(CEMA75%-r-CA25%)100, where CEMA is the hydrogenated version of FEMA.  I believe that my work pinpoints the opportunity for using π-π stacking interactions between fluorinated and hydrogenated aromatic rings for improving the selectivity of MIPs and the potential of using this interaction in future for developing highly selective MIPs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD), originally defined by Dr. David Barker, recognizes that in addition to adverse exposures in adulthood, influences during early stages of development contribute significantly to disease risk later in life. This suggests additional target periods for intervention across the course of life that will assist in reducing the global burden of disease. The development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) or other pregnancy-related syndromes, negatively affects both the maternal and fetal physiological systems predisposing mothers and infants to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesize that gestational hypertension, a mild form of HDP, impacts maternal cardiac remodeling during pregnancy and the response of offspring to a cardiovascular disease stress, such as acute ischemic stroke in adulthood. &#xD;
	The established atrial natriuretic peptide gene-disrupted (ANP−/−) mouse model was utilized in this thesis to investigate the influence of chronic and gestational hypertension on pregnancy-induced cardiac alterations in addition to cerebrovascular response to stroke. Objectively, we sought to characterize novel methods to investigate the effects of fetal-programming on ischemic stroke and provide experimental evidence to correspond with currently published epidemiological observations. Collectively, our data are the first to experimentally describe the long-term consequences of gestational hypertension and lack of maternal ANP on stroke outcome and cardiac remodeling over the course of pregnancy. During pregnancy, we have demonstrated the onset and regression of pregnancy-induced cardiac hypertrophy as well as the local cardiac mRNA expression of the renin-angiotensin and natriuretic peptide systems (RAS and NPS, respectively).  We have additionally shown up regulation of the RAS late in pregnancy while the NPS was up regulated post partum.  Herein, we have also demonstrated that although gestational hypertension did not adversely affect maternal cardiac remodeling over the course of pregnancy, gestational hypertension did significantly impact the cerebral response of offspring to focal ischemia by up regulating cerebral vasoactive systems implicated in ischemic stroke; namely the endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
	This thesis offers an ectypal as well as an archetypal analysis of six characters from Miguel de Cervantes’ posthumous novel The Trials of Persiles and Sigismunda (1617). It examines these characters both as citizens of a specific historical place and time, as well as individuals undergoing the process Carl Jung called individuation, a process experienced by all human beings as they move towards a greater masculine-feminine psychic balance.&#xD;
	After an introduction to Jungian literary theory, the character of Antonio Villaseñor is examined ectypally by focusing on his argument with a fellow nobleman and how it reflects the sometimes subtle differences that distinguished an hidalgo from a caballero in the social hierarchy of early modern Spain. The voyage that leads him to the Barbarous Isle is then considered from an archetypal perspective, with the Spaniard progressing from a one-sided, all-male worldview, towards a more balanced masculine-feminine psyche that is symbolized by his union with a barbarian woman named Ricla, the anima figure who represents the missing feminine in Antonio. &#xD;
	Transila Fitzmaurice and the ius primae noctis custom that is practised in her homeland introduce the theme of rape, which pervades the Persiles, and its social and legal implications in early modern Spain. Archetypally, her journey is considered as a taking-on of the contrasexual characteristics that have heretofore been lacking in her psyche.&#xD;
	The implications of refusing a father’s choice of marriage partner are studied in the stories of Feliciana de la Voz and Isabela Castrucha, as are the subterfuges that real women devised in order to take control of their lives in a patriarchal world that allowed them so little autonomy. Archetypally, each of these women is able to assimilate their masculine side, or animus, thus moving closer to the psychic androgyny that Jung believed was the natural state of the human psyche. &#xD;
	The title characters, Persiles and Sigismunda, are considered only from an archetypal perspective. The focus in this work is on the repressed sexuality of these two characters, as it manifests itself in Persiles’ dream and in the jealousy that dominates Sigismunda’s character throughout the novel.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation undertakes a critical consideration of the productive and beneficent potential of shame. By examining texts in which characters or individuals depart from more traditional narratives, experiences, and/or manifestations of shame, this project aims to deconstruct the historically-entrenched definition of shame as a negative affect and provide a more inclusive and potentially liberating formulation. The introductory chapter charts the dominant trends in shame theory since Freud and articulates some of the main questions that propel the arguments of this dissertation: how do attachments to shame form? What is it that attracts individuals to shame? How do we begin to conceive of a form of shame that does not operate as shame “should?” Via close-readings of Rick Moody’s The Ice Storm, Chapter Two begins to answer some of these questions, examining the relation between shame and desire in order to demonstrate not only the necessity of desire to shame’s instantiation, but the ways in which shame alters our understanding of discourses of desire. Chapter Three investigates the life, writing, and art of Bob Flanagan, performance artist and “supermasochist,” to reveal the sometimes erotic nature of shame. Chapter Four’s analysis of NBC’s The Biggest Loser focuses on the more familiar narrative of shame as an enforcer of social norms, suggesting that the ostensibly passive desire to see others humiliated (schadenfreude) is actually a form of active participation in the modes of governmentality embedded in reality television and thus reveals the ubiquity of attachments to shame in contemporary culture. Chapter Five engages with two Steve McQueen films—Shame (2011) and Twelve Years a Slave (2013)—in order to suggest that the existence of so many different (and differently productive) relations to shame, when widely visible, produces uncertainty about the relation between, and about what constitutes, shame and/or shamelessness. Chapter Five’s discussion of the (un)reliability of affective markers leads me, in the Conclusion, to provide a new lens through which we might be able to envision the current affective economy of the United States, one paradoxically characterized by both shame and shamelessness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chapter one of this thesis describes the iridium-catalyzed ortho-selective C–H borylation reaction of tertiary benzamides. An iridium(I) complex paired with an electron-deficient phosphine ligand allows for efficient C–H activation and borylation using B2pin2. N,N-diethylbenzamides are challenging substrates for the reaction, however a variety of N,N-diisopropylbenzamides are well tolerated, affording the borylated products in generally high yields and good to excellent regioselectivities. This methodology acts as a complementary method to both Directed ortho Metalation (DoM) and a previously developed meta-selective borylation. We have demonstrated the utility of these boron-containing products by further cross-coupling reactions and DoM chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter two of this thesis describes our efforts towards a transition metal-catalyzed 3-component reaction, combining C–H activation and allylic substitution chemistry. Preliminary results were fraught with issues of compatibility of the required conditions for these two powerful reactions, and therefore a metal-catalyzed 3-component reaction using an aryl halide, diene, and nucleophile was explored as an alternative. Results indicate that this reaction is feasible using cyclic amine nucleophiles, generating aminated proucts containing a new stereogenic center. Attempts to use additional nucleophiles, as well as initial efforts to make the reaction proceed in an enantioselective fashion, will be described.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation describes methods and practices that help define the making of a “community-centred art.” My thesis is guided by my primary concern with three overlapping theoretical areas: art as activism, listening studies and ethical research. This thesis asks the following questions: What models of ethical research and collective cultural production are possible and suitable in that they make sense, and make change, for those people and communities involved in-situ?; What practices of teaching and learning can generate and encourage practices of “co-creativity”? &#xD;
	My study locates contemporary praxes from the mid-1990s to the present within a historical continuum in relation to particular discourses and sites of practice in Canada, the United States, Ireland and the United Kingdom. It documents how what we consider “contemporary” extends back into the period I will bracket as the community arts movement in Britain (c. 1960s-1992) with deeper historical roots in much earlier examples of popular arts. &#xD;
	My move to situate “the contemporary” within a historical continuum diverges from recent writings by those visual arts critics and theorists who reformulated “public art” (Lacy 1995; Jacob 1995) through concepts of “connective aesthetics” (Gablik 1991, 1995a) and “dialogical” forms of practice (Kester 2000, 2004). Most known are the now popularised forms of “relational” practice, accelerated by the writing of the French Conceptual Art critic Nicolas Bourriaud (1998).	&#xD;
	Within this study, the practice of attentiveness to one another is described through modes of listening, where listening is an oral and auditory practice, as much as it is linguistic and multi-sensorial. I argue that observations on listening – because listening must necessarily be situated within sociality – require an ethical framework. What I am calling an ethics of listening therefore seeks to understand listening in a first instance as a disposition that is ideologically bound by ethics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate in D2O was studied using Cu(0) wire and Me6TREN, with different target chain lengths (TCL), amount of initial Cu(II)Br2, and the addition sequence of ligand. Gel formation occurred under most conditions, with the amount of gel formation reduced with short target chain lengths, increased concentration of initial Cu(II)Br2, and when ligand was added with the Cu(II)Br2. This result was explained by the reduced concentration of adsorbed active polymer species on the Cu(0) wire surface through increased desorption rate and deactivation rate on the Cu(0) wire surface, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
Gel formation was eliminated using a two-step Cu(0) in situ mediation process, with experiments focusing on the effects of chain length, initial Cu(I)Br, excess NaBr, temperature and residual O2 (brought by syringe for monomer and initiator transferring) on the kinetics and molecular weight (MW) control of the system. There is no visible gel formation with the TCL range from 20 to 800 using this procedure, a result mainly attributed to the lowered number of adsorbed active species per Cu(0) particle, which are highly dispersed, greatly reducing the probability of crosslinking. The concentration of adsorbed active species on Cu(0) particle surface is the key factor controlling polymerization control and the formation of a high molecular weight (MW) shoulder seen under many conditions. Thus, physical processes such as adsorption and desorption combine with kinetic processes such as activation, propagation and deactivation on the Cu(0) surface and in the solution to influence the ability to control chain growth. Shorter target chain lengths, low activator concentration, high deactivator concentration and higher temperature (22 ℃ rather than 0 ℃) all reduce the concentration of adsorbed active species on the Cu(0) surface during the polymerization, and thus improve control. The study indicates that lower concentration of adsorbed active species is the requirement for synthesizing well defined P(HEA) in the aqueous solution, with low Đ and without high MW shoulder and insoluble gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
Based on this insight, well defined P(HEA) with low Đ (~1.2) and no high MW shoulder was synthesized when DPn was less than 160 in pure aqueous solvent (D2O and H2O). Higher MW P(HEA) (TCL=400, 87% conversion) with  Đ value of 1.16 was synthesized within 75 min using ca. 250 ppm copper in D2O at 22 ℃, however with a high MW shoulder observed, the first time that high MW P(HEA) with low Đ has been synthesized using such low copper levels in the purely aqueous environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Paramedics commonly suffer back injuries as a result of lifting. Improving lifting technique is often cited as an injury prevention approach; however traditional postural-based technique classifications have yet to identify an optimal technique. Instead, this thesis explored the hypothesis that an increased contribution of work done by the lower body relative to the trunk will be associated with lower peak sagittal plane trunk angles and moments experienced by paramedics while performing common paramedic lifting – a spine sparing strategy. Additionally this thesis explored whether higher peak lower body power capacity (calculated using vertical jump scores) was associated with reduced trunk angles and moments during lifting. &#xD;
Methods: Thirty-three healthy paramedics performed three lifting tasks and completed a vertical jump test. A 3D linked-segment model computed sagittal plane trunk moments and angles, as well as joint power and the corresponding work done by the ankle, knee, hip, and trunk during lifting. Peak lower body power capacity was computed using vertical jump height. A correlational analysis determined the associations between lower body work contribution, lower body power capacity (calculated from the vertical jump score), and peak sagittal trunk angles and moments.&#xD;
Results: Paramedics that completed the lifting tasks with an increased contribution of work from the lower body also experienced lower peak spine angles and moments in the sagittal plane. Peak lower body power capacity was not associated with any variable. &#xD;
Conclusion: These results provide partial support for the overarching thesis, where an increased contribution of work from the lower body provided a spine sparing lifting strategy. This finding supports the need to continue coaching and training paramedics to generate more work from the lower body while lifting, as a spine sparing tactic. However, future work should try to identify relevant screening tools that can quickly determine if a paramedic is likely to adopt this strategy, or if they should be re-directed for more coaching and training.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to identify others’ mental states, and use this information to explain or predict others’ behaviours. Typically developing adolescents use this ability with varying degree of efficiency and accuracy to navigate social interactions. The current study explored how individual differences in ToM skills impacts the direct relation between victimization and depressive symptoms, and the indirect relation through perceived social support. Individuals who have difficulty identifying and reasoning about others’ mental states may have more difficulty accurately identifying a perpetrators intentions or beliefs. As such, it was hypothesized that the relation between victimization and depressive symptoms would become stronger as an individual performed better on ToM decoding and reasoning tasks. Previous literature suggests that adolescents who are victimized believe they have less support available to them, which in turn is associated with more depressive symptoms. As such, it was also hypothesized that this relation among victimization, perceived social support and depressive symptoms would be stronger as individuals performed better on ToM decoding and reasoning tasks. Results partially supported both of these hypotheses. The current study provides evidence that performance on a ToM reasoning task – but not decoding tasks – moderates the relation between victimization and depressive symptoms. The results also provide modest evidence that the relation among victimization, perceived social support and depressive symptoms becomes stronger as individuals perform better on the Faux Pas task. The implications for future research and treatment considerations are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis introduces two classes of discrete-time distributed online optimization algorithms, with a group of agents which communicate over a network.  At each time, a private convex objective function is revealed to each agent. In the next time step, each agent updates its state using its own objective function and the information gathered from its immediate in-neighbours at that time. We design algorithms distributed over the network topologies, which guarantee that the individual regret, the diﬀerence between the network cost incurred by the agent’s states estimation and the cost incurred by the best ﬁxed choice, grows only sublinearly. One algorithm is based on gradient-ﬂow, which provably works for a sequence of time-varying uniformly strongly connected graphs. The other one is based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which works on ﬁxed undirected graphs and gives an explicit&#xD;
regret bound in terms of the size of the network. We implement the proposed algorithms on a sensor network and the results demonstrate the good performance for both algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The gold standard treatment for Parkinson’s disease (PD), L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa), results in involuntary movements referred to as l-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The mechanisms of LIDs are poorly known and there is no current strategy to efficiently prevent or control LIDs. Recent evidence has found that the expression of several immediate early genes positively correlates with LID severity in a basal forebrain structure, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Furthermore, evidence shows that dopamine D1-like receptor (D1R)-dependent overexpression of IEGs in the oval (ov) and juxtacapsular (jx) subregions of the BNST may contribute to this phenomenon. Therefore this study aimed to examine how a D1R agonist modulates synaptic transmission in the ov and jxBNST of rats with and without LIDs using in vitro electrophysiology. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n=34) surgically received unilateral 6-OHDA lesions (2.5 µl at 3µg/µl) in the medial forebrain bundle. Three weeks after lesioning and upon occurrence of  PD symptoms as measured by a stepping test, rats received daily injections of saline, or l-dopa (6mg/kg, i.p.) in benserazide (15mg/kg, i.p.), or benserazide alone. Benserazide is a peripheral inhibitor of DOPA-decarboxylase used to increase the central availability of dopamine (DA) and is generally administered with l-dopa, and thus was used as our vehicle control. On the 10th injection day, rats were assessed for the severity of three subtypes of dyskinesia: forelimb (jerks of the contralateral forelimb), orolingual (twitches of the jaw and tongue) and axial (contralateral twisted posturing). Rats were then euthanized one hour post injection and whole cell patch clamping was done in both the jx and ov areas of the BNST. Chronic l-dopa treatment did not alter strength at excitatory synapses in the ovBNST or jxBNST as measured by AMPA/NMDA ratios. Likewise, L-dopa treatment had no significant effect also D1-mediated modulation of GABAA or AMPA synaptic transmission in either the ov or jx BNST. Together, the data suggest that neither change in strength at excitatory synapses or D1R-modulation of synaptic transmission in the ov or jxBNST are LID neurophysiological traces in this area of the rat brain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The following entails a “historico-critical” (Foucault [1984] 2010:46) analysis of the connection between teaching and love encapsulated in public, political and media discourses during the 2012-13 education labour disputes in Ontario, Canada. Examining the history of teaching as a ‘feminized’ profession within a capitalist, patriarchal, settler-colonial state, I suggest that discourses constituting teachers as selfless carers are intimately linked to visions of motherhood and white supremacy. Furthermore, I suggest that the concept of selfless love operates as a tool for depoliticization, used primarily against women and others within a society subsumed by neoliberal rhetoric. Ultimately, thinking outside of and working against this conception of love as something inherently selfless can help us elaborate a more egalitarian vision of love which values both autonomy and collectivity through an acknowledgement of Levinasian selfhood.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Photonic crystal slabs coupled with quantum dipole emitters allow one to control quantum light-matter interactions and are a promising platform for quantum information science technologies; however their development has been hindered by inherent fabrication issues. Inspired by recent nanowire growth techniques and opportunities in fundamental quantum nanophotonics, in this thesis we theoretically investigate light-matter interactions in nanowire photonic crystal structures with embedded quantum dots, a novel engineered quantum system, for applications in quantum optics. We develop designs for currently fabricable structures, including finite-size effects and radiative loss, and investigate their fundamental properties using photonic band structure calculations, finite-difference time-domain computations, and a rigorous photonic Green function technique. We study and engineer realistic nanowire photonic crystal waveguides for single photon applications whose performance can exceed that of state-of-the-art slab photonic crystals, and design a directed single photon source. We then develop a powerful quantum optical formalism using master equation techniques and the photonic Green function to understand the quantum dynamics of these exotic structures in open and lossy photonic environments. This is used to explore the coupling of a pair of quantum dots in a nanowire photonic crystal waveguide, demonstrating long-lived entangled states and a system with a completely controllable Hamiltonian capable of simulating a wide variety of quantum systems and entering a unique regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics characterized by strong exchange-splitting. Lastly, we propose and study a "metamaterial" polariton waveguide comprised of a nanowire photonic crystal waveguide with an embedded quantum dot in each unit cell, and explain the properties of both infinite and finite-sized structures using a Green function approach. We show that an external quantum dot can be strongly coupled to these novel waveguides, an achievement which has never been demonstrated in a solid-state platform.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Neurons enter states of heightened excitability and secretory capacity to initiate fundamental behaviours. This is exemplified by the bag cell neurons of the marine mollusc, Aplysia californica. These neuroendocrine cells undergo an afterdischarge to secrete egg-laying hormone (ELH) and initiate reproduction. I examined the role of two cellular signaling pathways that contribute to the afterdischarge: Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC). Investigating these systems provides insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying fundamental behaviours.&#xD;
Intracellular Ca2+ modulates excitability and initiates secretion in the bag cell neurons. I determined how Ca2+ sources and removal systems control intracellular Ca2+. My data revealed that the mitochondria strongly influence Ca2+ signaling in cultured bag cell neurons, as they first buffer voltage-gated Ca2+ influx and subsequently release Ca2+ to the cytosol, in a form of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Moreover, the degree of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release was shown to be dictated by the function of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase. In addition to voltage-gated Ca2+ influx, I characterized the involvement of Ca2+ handling systems with other distinct Ca2+ sources, including CICR and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger as well as store-operated Ca2+ influx and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA).&#xD;
PKC is implicated in facilitating secretion during the afterdischarge. I tested the impact of PKC on secretion using capacitance tracking under whole-cell voltage-clamp. This technique assays the changes in plasma membrane area that occur during vesicle exocytosis. I demonstrated that PKC activation enhanced Ca2+ influx and potentiated stimulus-evoked secretion. This occurred as a result of the plasma membrane insertion of a covert voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, Apl Cav2, alongside the basal voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, Apl Cav1.&#xD;
iii&#xD;
I provided mechanistic detail of how the interplay between Ca2+ sources and removal systems governs the patterns of free cytosolic Ca2+. These properties have implications for the Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways which mediate long lasting changes in neuronal excitability and secretion. Furthermore, my work demonstrates that protein kinases can dynamically amplify secretory output by rapidly recruiting additional voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to the membrane. This form of facilitation likely enhances secretion during the afterdischarge, and ensures the initiation of reproductive behaviour in Aplysia.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Software is developed at a rapid pace. Software development techniques like continuous delivery have shortened the time between official releases of a software system from months or years to a matter of minutes. At the heart of this rapid release cycle of continuously delivered software is the build system, i.e., the system that specifies how source code is translated into deliverables. An efficient build system that quickly produces updated versions of a software system is required to keep up with market competitors. However, the benefits of an efficient build system come at a cost --- build systems introduce overhead on the software development process.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we use historical data from a large collection of software projects to perform four empirical studies. The focus of these empirical studies is on two types of software development overhead that are introduced by the build system.&#xD;
&#xD;
We first present three empirical studies that focus on the maintenance overhead introduced by the need to keep the build system in sync with the source code that it builds. We observe that: (1) although modern build technologies like Maven provide additional features, they tend to be prone to additional build maintenance activity and more prone to cloning, i.e., duplication of build logic, than older technologies like make are; (2) although typical cloning rates are higher in build systems than in other software artifacts (e.g., source code), there are commonly-adopted patterns of creative build system abstraction that can keep build cloning rates low; and (3) properties of source and test code changes can be used to train accurate classifiers that indicate whether a co-change to the build system is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
We then present an empirical study that focuses on the execution overhead introduced by the slow nature of (re)generating system deliverables using a build system. We find that build optimization effort: (1) will yield more build performance improvement by focusing on build hotspots, i.e., files that are not only slow to rebuild, but also tend to change frequently; and (2) should be aligned with architectural refinement in order to yield the most benefit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the relationship between video games and players regarding lived experience. It revisits the classical debate of the idea of immersion and similar concepts in video games, challenging the concept of immersion by taking a phenomenological stance that sees a direct connection between the player and the game as opposed to their ontological separation. Using a blended phenomenological approach that draws from Alfred Schutz, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Pierre Bourdieu, and following the phenomenological method as outlined by Schutz (1932), the paper looks at four games from the Animal Crossing (2004, 2013) and Fallout (2008, 2010) series. The analysis examines Being and consciousness, meaning and meaning structures, projects of action, and the structuration of the social worlds of the game. The analysis will demonstrate that the ways in which people approach their everyday social world is very similar to the way that they approach the social world presented by the game, revealing a connection between worlds of experience through lived experience.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the rhetoric and practice of voluntary welfare work by British women within the twentieth-century British Empire. Voluntarism was an important component of the attention to colonial welfare and development that was a dominant theme of the ideology and practice of the last decades of the British Empire. Debated and defined during the 1930s, programs to enact welfare and development were implemented after the Second World War as part of a revived empire during the 1950s. These programs remained integral to post-colonial relationships after the rapid dismantling of empire in the 1960s. Examining the welfare component of twentieth-century imperial aspirations, this study follows the informal practitioners of colonial welfare—the British women residing in empire who through voluntary work contributed to both defining and delivering colonial welfare—considering the intersection of individual lives and imperial responsibilities. &#xD;
This study offers a comparative and trans-imperial account of individual women engaged in voluntary efforts alongside a closer analysis of the rhetoric and reality of voluntarism in colonial Kenya. White women residing in the colonies contributed voluntarily to the provision of colonial health, education, and social services after the First World War: their efforts were both part of everyday life and entwined in the imperial politics of welfare, gender, and race. The phenomenon of imperial voluntarism represented continuity in the ideas and activities of white women on the colonial frontier, yet imperial voluntarism also represented change within the context of the particular conditions of twentieth-century empire. Chapters engage with themes of voluntary work and daily life, the politics of voluntary work, the relevance of voluntarism within an emerging post-war colonial welfare state, and the entanglement of imperial volunteers within the violence and political processes of decolonization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Osteoarthritis is one of the leading causes of disability in adults over the age of 40 years, and there is currently no curative measure for the disease. As a result, there is a critical need for a strategy that can promote cartilage regeneration. Of particular interest is an injectable, in situ gelling hydrogel for cell encapsulation that can be delivered with low cytotoxicity to native chondrocytes and encapsulated cells. Adipose-derived stem cells are an attractive cell population for delivery because they secrete a wide array of soluble factors and they have the ability to differentiate down the chondrogenic lineage.&#xD;
	Chemotaxis of passage 0 and passage 2 bovine chondrocytes toward bovine ASCs was measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Passage 0 chondrocyte migration was less than 3% of seeded cells for all conditions investigated with no significant differences between groups. Passage 2 chondrocytes exhibited significantly higher migration than P0 chondrocytes, but migration towards bASCs was actually lower than media controls. PDGF-BB and IGF-I promoted chemotaxis of passage 2 chondrocytes at 5 ng/mL and up to 100 ng/mL.&#xD;
Acrylate-poly(trimethylene carbonate)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block- poly(trimethylene carbonate)-acrylate (A-PTMC-PEG-PTMC-A) tri-block copolymers were synthesized from 3.4 and 20 kg/mol PEG-diol initiators. Methacrylate chondroitin sulphate (MCS) modified with collagen integrin peptides RGD, GLOGEN, and GVOGEA was blended with A-PTMC-PEG-PTMC-A to form hydrogels for ASC encapsulation. Conjugation of peptides onto MCS resulted in higher ASC viability in A-PTMC-PEG-PTMC-A/MCS hydrogels as assessed by LIVE/DEAD stain. The 20k/MCS hydrogels exhibited higher equilibrium water content, ultimate strain, and toughness, but lower equilibrium moduli than MCS and 3.4k/MCS hydrogels. In addition, 3.4k/MCS hydrogels were tougher than MCS hydrogels but had a comparable equilibrium modulus.&#xD;
The present work showed that ASCs do not encourage chemotaxis of bovine chondrocytes in 2-D culture. This finding provides early evidence that ASCs may be unsuitable for promoting chondrocyte migration in a cartilage defect model. The viability and mechanical measurements demonstrate that A-PTMC-PEG-PTMC-A/MCS hydrogels modified with integrin peptides can maintain ASC viability following encapsulation. However, further experiments are necessary to assess the suitability of peptide-modified A-PTMC-PEG-PTMC-A/MCS hydrogels as a viable cartilage regeneration strategy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project identifies the rapidly increasing pressure to employ social media in medical education and yet a review of the literature demonstrated that its value and role are uncertain.  Given the evidence that application of learning theory is fundamental to sound pedagogy, the aim of the project was to examine whether medical educators have a conceptual framework that informs their use of social media and if this framework can be mapped to learning theory.   A workshop was planned and conducted as part of a Social Media Summit in Health Professional Education to explore this issue. Thirty-six participants engaged in an iterative, consensus building process that identified their conceptual framework and determined if it aligned with one or more learning theories.  The results of the workshop suggested that the use of social media by the participants could be traced to two dominant theories, Connectivism and Constructivism.  Results also suggest that many medical educators may not be fully aware of the theories underpinning their decision making and that future research and faculty development in this area is greatly needed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In my view, the central disagreement in contemporary discussion of promissory obligation stems from two contrasting conceptions of the function of the obligation of promise keeping. Simply put, the disagreement is over whether to view promissory obligation as arising from the need to protect something of value or to view it as arising from the need to make attainable something of value. The main thesis for which I shall argue is that the Attainment View is problematic. To this end, I offer two lines of argument against the view, one negative and one positive. Negatively, I shall show that the perceived advantages of the Attainment View over the Protection View are more apparent than real. Positively, I shall argue that the Attainment View faces an irresolvable dilemma when it comes to a range of pertinent cases, cases that involve promises which are morally impermissible for the promisor to carry out.&#xD;
My thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces the Practice View and the Expectation View of promissory obligation, supported respectively by Hume and Rawls on the one hand and Scanlon on the other. The views are unified by their conception of promissory obligation as serving a protection function. In Chapter 3, I discuss three variants of the Normative Power View of promissory obligation, advocated separately by Raz, Shiffrin and Owens. Common to all three is the idea that promissory obligation serves an attainment function. In the fourth and final Chapter, I spell out in more detail the contrast between the Protection View and the Attainment View, and I raise two lines of the argument against the latter position.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are prevalent in the population, highly comorbid, and have similar clinical features that complicate diagnoses despite rather distinct diagnostic criteria. Executive functioning deficits in ADHD are similar to those reported in BD but lack the specificity to distinguish between these groups. Emotion processing similarly affects both ADHD and BD and, by combining these processes on a single task, we may increase sensitivity to differences between these populations in a way that may better categorize each disorder. Therefore, we compared performance on a cognitively demanding, affective oculomotor task. Adults, aged 18-62, with ADHD (n=22), BD (n=20), and healthy Controls (n=21) performed an interleaved pro- and antisaccade task (look toward versus looking away from a visual target, respectively). Task irrelevant emotional faces (fear, happy, sad, neutral) were presented on a subset of trials either before or with the target. We observed a group by task interaction (F(2,58)=3.849,p=.027,ηp2=.117) where the ADHD group made more direction errors (looked in the wrong direction) than Controls in the antisaccade condition (p=.027). A three way interaction between image, task, and group (Fig.6; F(8, 58)=2.607,p=.013,ηp2=.082) revealed that presentation of negatively valenced, fear (p=.044) and sad (p=.053), and ambiguous, neutral (p=.003), emotional faces increased saccadic reaction time in BD. In summary, the antisaccade task in general differentiated ADHD from Controls and simultaneous emotion processing further impaired processing speed in BD only. These findings suggest that response inhibition-emotion processing interactions differ between BD and ADHD and reinforce that emotion processing deficits are fundamental in BD and may be attention-driven in ADHD. We propose that response inhibition is critical in both processing systems, but this inhibitory signal is selectively slowed down by concurrent emotion processing dysfunction in BD. We refer to a hypothetical framework integrating these systems and suggest potential loci of dysfunction, the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, that may result in the emotional modulation of oculomotor behaviour we have observed here. The differences in how these processing systems interact in ADHD and BD may better characterize each disorder and suggests that refinement of an emotional antisaccade task may be clinically useful.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the first point of patient care, Family physicians are known to experience greater levels of uncertainty in decision-making. Little is known about how Family Medicine residents perceive and experience uncertainty in their dual roles as learners and healthcare providers. While there is research to suggest that uncertainty can be productive for learning medical practice, no study has examined the role of uncertainty in resident learning. The purpose of this study was to explore how Family Medicine residents view, experience, and manage uncertainty while learning through practice.&#xD;
A qualitative design was used to explore residents’ emotions, thoughts, opinions, and attitudes regarding their lived experiences of uncertainty. Over a two-week period, nine Family Medicine residents from one academic institution participated in individual, semi-structured interviews. Following verbatim transcription and member checking of interview summaries, the data was thematically analyzed to identify patterns in participants’ views and experiences of uncertainty. &#xD;
Results showed that uncertainty was a common and potentially uncomfortable experience for participating residents. Over time, the residents recalled their uncertainty subsiding and changing in character as they gained confidence and comfort with uncertainty in their decision-making. Despite viewing uncertainty as integral to lifelong professional learning, the residents in this study recalled censoring their expressions of uncertainty based on their perceptions of how they thought their patients and supervisors would react.&#xD;
In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest a need for medical education culture to be more accepting of residents’ uncertainty. A culture of acceptance towards uncertainty, in which residents and supervisors could speak freely about their professional limitations, has the potential to enhance patient safety as well as the quality and scope of clinical teaching and learning. Teaching medical learners to reflect in practice, by noticing uncertainty and suspending judgment, may help develop their ability to recognize professional weaknesses, self-limit practice in areas of limited competence, identify what must be learned, and locate external resources to resolve gaps in competence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many researchers have typically treated subjective and objective measures of working knowledge as alternative operationalizations of working knowledge. Some researchers have argued that these measures should not treated interchangeably and that one measure is better than the other. However, See, Petty, and Fabrigar (2014) have recently proposed a dual-construct perspective, where they argued that subjective and objective measures of attitudinal properties, including working knowledge, reflect distinct but equally important processes that influence attitude strength. If these two measures reflect different processes, then they should have unique effects related to attitudinal consequences (e.g., message elaboration). Following this logic, we hypothesized that these two measures of working knowledge are not alternative operationalizations of the same construct and that both types of working knowledge have unique effects associated with message elaboration. We conducted two experiments to test these two hypotheses, where we measured participants’ subjective knowledge, objective knowledge, and initial attitudes towards an attitude object and presented participants with a persuasive message about the object. In the first study, we used an anti-nuclear power message as the persuasive message. In the second study, we used a pro-legalization of marijuana message as the persuasive message. Subsequently, we used argument quality effects on post-message attitudes to gauge message elaboration. In both studies, the correlations between subjective and objective were modest, which suggested that subjective and objective measures of working knowledge were not redundant of each other. In addition, both types of knowledge produced significant effects associated with message elaboration, even when controlling for each other. Overall, the two studies supported the dual-construct perspective.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent reports suggest that the number of students receiving special education services in Ontario has risen from 14% to 23% in a ten-year span (People for Education, 2015). Thus, there is a growing need to study which teaching practices are being used with exceptional learners in regular classrooms and whether they are consistent with professional documents and research advising teachers on how to create the best inclusive learning environment (Kretlow, Cooke, &amp; Wood, 2012; Swanson, 2001). In Ontario, Learning for All (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2013a), the professional document designed to advise secondary school teachers on inclusive teaching practices, is notably lacking in research conducted within secondary schools. This could be due to the lack of research on inclusive education being conducted in secondary schools.&#xD;
The current study described in this thesis was designed as a starting point to fill in this gap. Specifically, this multiple perspective case study describes the cases of four diverse secondary school teachers in Ontario and how they facilitated the inclusion of exceptional students in regular classrooms. In talking to secondary teachers about inclusion, I hoped to gain an understanding of how teachers create an inclusionary space using the tools provided to them by the Ministry of Education, as well as those provided by their individual schools and school boards.&#xD;
The findings of the study suggest that the four secondary teachers in this study facilitate inclusion of exceptional students in regular classrooms by considering how the students’ functional needs impact their learning of the curriculum; in fact, three of the four consider functional learning and assessment needs of all students, not just exceptional students, when planning and teaching their classes. This study provides useful information for Ministries of Education, school boards, and schools in tailoring professional development days and professional documents to guide teachers in including students with exceptionalities in secondary schools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The Mammary Prevention.3 (MAP.3) randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating exemestane for breast cancer prevention demonstrated a 65% relative reduction in invasive breast cancer incidence. Up to 50% of participants in both trial arms reported a clinically meaningful worsening in their menopause-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL). The incidence of both worsening HRQL and treatment discontinuation was highest within the first year post-randomization.&#xD;
Objectives: The objectives of the two manuscripts comprising this thesis were to 1) identify factors associated with worsening menopause-specific HRQL, and, 2) evaluate the association between clinically meaningful worsening in menopause-specific HRQL and early discontinuation of study treatment.&#xD;
Methods: The study sample was derived from the MAP.3 chemoprevention trial conducted by the NCIC Clinical Trials Group and consisted of 4,560 postmenopausal women at elevated risk for breast cancer. Menopause-specific HRQL was assessed prior to randomization, 6 months and annually thereafter using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL). In Manuscript 1, Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify factors associated with a clinically meaningful worsening in domain-specific and overall menopause-specific HRQL. In Manuscript 2, multivariable log-binomial regression was used to assess the associations between a clinically meaningful worsening in menopause- specific HRQL, baseline participant characteristics and early treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
Results: Manuscript 1: Risk factors of worsening in overall menopause-specific HRQL included younger age, diagnoses of depression or anxiety, increasing medication burden and assignment to exemestane. Manuscript 2: The risk of early discontinuation was 77% higher among those experiencing a worsening in their overall menopause-specific HRQL (RR=1.77 95% CI: 1.51-2.08). Those who were current or past&#xD;
smokers, employed at baseline and were assigned to exemestane were also at increased risk for treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
Conclusions: Both treatment assignment and individual characteristics contributed to the worsening HRQL experiences observed in MAP.3, which may help inform the dialogue between clinicians and patients considering chemoprevention. A negative change in menopause-specific HRQL is an important risk factor of discontinuing chemoprevention therapy. The identification of individual-level factors associated with aromatase inhibitor discontinuation may assist physicians in appropriately monitoring and counseling their patients.</dcterms:abstract>

We prove under the Bombieri-Lang Conjecture that there are finitely many non-trivial sequences of integers of length 11 whose squares have constant second differences, and we prove unconditionally the analogous result for function fields of characteristic zero. &#xD;

We prove under the Bombieri-Lang Conjecture that there are finitely many integer sequences of length 8 whose k-th powers have second differences equal to 2, we give an unconditional result for function fields of characteristic zero. Moreover, this gives new examples of surfaces having no curves of genus 0 or 1. &#xD;

The third application is related to the surface parametrizing perfect cuboids. We give some new properties about their curves of genus 0 or 1 and we give new bounds for the degree of curves in this surface, in terms of their genus.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study re-imagines the relationship between music and poetry in the Long Romantic period. It centres on a selection of lyrics by male canonical poets before moving into an analysis of texts by women who were prolific in their own time, with the aim of establishing a contextual canon of musical responsiveness that is characterized by a form of musical declamation in poetry. Beginning with an exploration of the cultural intersections of words, music, texts, and songs, I present a British Romantic poetic soundscape in which acts of reading, speaking, and writing are animated as live speech and performed as music. I engage with a number of thematic elements that assist me in identifying, categorizing, and analyzing often overlooked references to music in the lyrics of Charlotte Smith, Joanna Baillie, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, Felicia Hemans, Letitia Landon, and John Clare. Each chapter unfolds around a dominant metaphor that describes a different facet of the musical experience of poetry. As a testing ground for my approach, I apply the argument, that musical language is interwoven with Romantic culture, to two national song collections: Lord Byron’s and Isaac Nathan’s Hebrew Melodies (1815, 1816) and Felicia Hemans’s and John Parry’s Welsh Melodies (1822). The overarching message of this study is that we should read texts in ways that are sensitive to the dynamics between authors, readers, speakers, and performers who contributed to shaping the Romantic creative act. My approach is rooted in the theory of new formalism, which anchors itself in historical evidence while maintaining its focus on the text. The interdisciplinary terminology that I employ is drawn from literary studies, musicology, elocution, rhetoric, sound studies, and word and music studies. This study was motivated by a proliferation of musical references within Romantic lyric poems, and actively counters claims that these are superficial and supplementary rather than integral and essential to our understanding of the culture and ethos of the Romanticism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular calcification (VC) is the most prevalent form of cardiovascular disease in this population and the attributable cardiovascular mortality is 10-100 times greater than healthy individuals. Mineral imbalance is a hallmark of progressing CKD, which greatly increases the propensity for VC. Specifically, pathogenic VC has been consistently linked to altered phosphate metabolism in CKD patients. Despite the critical role of phosphate in cell biology, there are significant gaps in knowledge regarding the in vivo kinetics of circulating phosphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
A modified adenine model of CKD was used to characterize the disposition of circulating phosphate and calcium from the circulation to tissues. Studies used radiolabeled phosphate and calcium infusions to demonstrate that acute, non-renal phosphate handling is impaired in CKD and is manifested as an amplified phosphate pulse following administration. This pulse, rather than hyperphosphatemia per se, generated an increased transfer of phosphate and calcium selectively into vascular tissues. The maladaptive nature of this mineral handling process reveals an important early mechanism in both the initiation and progression of vascular calcification in CKD. &#xD;
&#xD;
This mechanism will potentially generate new therapeutic targets for reducing the impact of phosphate on vascular calcification outcomes in CKD. Although the management of circulating phosphate levels in CKD patients is clinically recognized to attenuate soft tissue calcification, the present findings indicate for the first time that targeting the oscillations in phosphate, rather than the circulating phosphate level per se, is likely to be more relevant approach for reducing the morbidity linked to the progression of vascular calcification.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are in the “highest risk” group for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and nephrology guidelines recommend referral to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) to prevent its development. However, there is limited evidence supporting this recommendation and as few as 10% of patients with CKD utilize this service. In the general population, CR has been shown to enhance cardiovascular (CV) health and exercise self-efficacy (SE). Among persons with CKD, evidence suggests that CR may be an effective tool to improve CV health; however, no studies regarding its impact on exercise SE have been conducted. Given the low utilization of this service among patients with CKD, it is necessary to determine accrual and retention rates to inform the potential for a larger systematic trial. The primary goals of our study were to: (a) determine recruitment and enrollment ratios of patients with CKD to CR; and (b) examine changes in exercise SE across their participation in a CR program.&#xD;
Methods: A retrospective chart review was undertaken at the Nephrology Program at Kingston General Hospital. Charts were screened for demographic information and clinical descriptors. Eligible participants were offered enrollment in a 16-week CR program; where exercise SE, CVD risk factors, self-management behaviours, and physical function outcomes were measured.  Results: A total of 611 charts were reviewed. Of those eligible for inclusion, 7 individuals were recruited to the study (recruitment ratio = 4.6%); however, only 3 were retained for enrollment (enrollment ratio = 2.0%). The lack of physician endorsement and travel distance may have contributed to the low enrollment. Across the course of their participation in CR, exercise SE was observed to change by +12.8%, -5.3%, and +11.5% from baseline to discharge for each participant, respectively.&#xD;
Conclusions: This is the first study to: (a) quantify the feasibility of recruiting and enrolling persons with CKD in CR and (b) describe monthly changes in exercise SE via a case series. Evidence supports the hypothesis that CR is a potentially powerful agent to improve exercise SE among patients with CKD; however, further work is needed to elucidate barriers and facilitators to CR enrollment, and the relationship between exercise SE and participation in this health service.

      <dcterms:abstract>The aim of the study was to develop implantable poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) cylinders capable of releasing oseltamivir phosphate (OP) and gemcitabine (GEM) over 30 days and to establish proof of principle for the sustained delivery of OP and GEM for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
Resistance to the current standard of care, GEM, is common in pancreatic cancer. Recent studies have indicated mammalian neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) as a potential therapeutic target due to its role in receptor tyrosine kinase activation. OP inhibits Neu1 and has shown promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In vitro experiments have indicated combined treatment with OP and GEM may be more effective than either drug alone.&#xD;
Localized treatment with OP and GEM will allow a higher drug concentration at the tumor site while reducing systemic toxicity. OP and GEM were encapsulated in implantable PLGA single layered and double layered cylinders, which were capable of releasing OP and GEM over 30 days. Single layered cylinders were approximately 9 mm in length and 4 mm in diameter, while double layered cylinders were 10 mm by 5 mm. Double layered cylinders containing OP and GEM in distinct layers, termed OPin/GEMout and GEMin/OPout, displayed the most linear release of OP and GEM and were selected for cell viability testing. OP and GEM released from OPin/GEMout and GEMin/OPout cylinders effectively reduced cell viability of pancreatic cancer cell line PANC1 and GEM-resistant PANC1 (PANC1 GEMR) in experiments lasting 3, 6, 10, and 15 days. PLGA had no effect on cell viability. Future work should include in vivo studies with OPin/GEMout and GEMin/OPout cylinders in a murine model of pancreatic cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are a class of proteins that adsorb to the surface of ice crystals to prevent their growth. Recent structural work has shown that the ice-binding site (IBS) of a bacterial AFP organizes surface waters into an ice-like clathrate arrangement that matches and fuses to the quasi-liquid layer on the ice surface. On cooling, these waters join the ice lattice and freeze the AFP to its ligand. Evidence for the generality of this ice-binding mechanism, which is termed as anchored clathrate water (ACW) mechanism, is limited because AFPs tend to crystallize with their IBS as a preferred protein-protein contact surface, which displaces some bound waters. &#xD;
	My thesis applies two strategies to test the universality of the ACW mechanism. First, I determine the crystal structure of a fish AFP called Maxi. This AFP is an elongated molecule, which crystallized such that almost half of its IBS was free from crystal packing influences. Waters on the solvent-exposed IBS are ice-like and can bind to the target ice planes, supporting the ACW mechanism. Second, in the crystal structure of type III AFP alone, one region of the IBS was completely engaged in crystal packing. We force that region to expose to solvent by crystallizing a fusion of type III AFP to maltose-binding protein. By combining the crystallographic data with MD simulations, the waters on the IBS were revealed and were shown to support the ACW mechanism. &#xD;
	Studies showed that AFPs also can inhibit gas hydrate formation and growth. However, the mechanism for this process is not known. The crystal structure of Maxi revealed a novel protein fold, which retains ~400 ice-like waters in its core. Surprisingly, the internal water network of Maxi, which extends to the protein’s outer surface, is remarkably similar to the {100} planes of structure type II (sII) gas hydrate. The crystal structure of this water web has facilitated the construction of in silico models for Maxi and type I AFP binding to sII hydrates. The model suggests that AFPs adsorb to the gas hydrate lattice through the same anchored clathrate water (ACW) mechanism used to bind ice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Employing a practical material culture approach, the primary aim of this thesis is to address the diverse alterations that women’s eighteenth-century apparel underwent in both form and context.  Evidence collected through extensive direct examination of several hundred clothing objects held in museum collections across England including the Museum of London, the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall in Manchester, the Wade Costume Collection house at Berrington Hall and the Fashion Museum at Bath is combined with archival research of household accounts, wills, trial records, letters, and journals at numerous libraries and archives around the country to develop a foundational narrative of the reuse and recycling of English women’s eighteenth-century dress.&#xD;
The theoretical concept that objects possess social biographies is applied here to form the suppositional basis that these clothes experienced multiple lives and incarnations. To this end five main themes are explored beginning from shortly after the point of first acquisition. The thesis begins with day-to-day care and maintenance of clothing, tracking how garments transition from new to worn and methods employed to prolong their usefulness. Next, resizing requirements are detailed first for lifecycle events such as pregnancy, then as a consequence of new ownership. Following on this, various modes of the incessant redistribution of used and old clothing is examined in depth involving the second-hand market, bequests in wills, and the perquisite system whereby clothing was cast-off by employer to servant. Stylistic alterations for changing fashions are then identified and mapped to reveal women’s real-life practices and attitudes towards fashionability intersected with thrift. Finally, post-eighteenth-century reconceptualization as fancy dress costumes and historical museum artefacts are introduced as representing further chapters in the lives of garments rather than the end of the story. This thesis contributes to a burgeoning scholarship on post-acquisition consumption of dress and material culture, its use, reuse, and recycling; and seeks to complicate women’s engagement with the fashion system and assumptions around novelty and escalating consumer culture, their relationships with clothing over time, and with each other.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Field-scale experiments were used to investigate the behaviour of pipe joints connecting four segments of vitrified clay pipe subjected to differential ground movement. Firstly, linear potentiometers, inclinometers and strain gauges were installed to monitor joint rotations, joint axial compression or extension, and pipe strain. An articulation test using a servo-controlled hydraulic actuator was then employed to assess the instrumentation functionality and accuracy. The second stage of the project involved design and construction of a field-scale test chamber to simulate a normal ground fault. This facility employs manually operated screw jacks to displace a moveable floor. A test using olivine sand was conducted with floor displaced downwards by 122 mm, and this demonstrated that the new test chamber simulates normal ground faulting safely and within the design requirements. Thirdly, two tests were conducted where the pipe assembly was buried at different depths in the olivine sand and subjected to differential ground motion resulting from 30 mm of vertical floor displacement. Analysis of the experimental results included examinations of how joint rotations, joint axial compression or extension, and pipe strains increased with floor (i.e. fault) displacement, how burial depth influenced the observed behaviour, and how measured joint responses compared to two simple geometrical models.&#xD;
The relationship between joint rotation and vertical floor (i.e. fault) displacement was almost linear, and close to a simple trigonometric relationship developed in an earlier project. Joint axial compressions/extensions were non-linear functions of vertical floor (fault) displacement. This included a transitional event, where after the joint experienced a small amount of axial compression or extension that axial response reversed direction and much larger (i.e. dominant) extension or compression developed. Pipe burial depth had little effect on joint rotations, but a substantial effect on joint compressions or extensions. While total net axial extension was similar to that predicted using a simple geometric relationship, the values at individual joints were substantially higher. Maximum bending strains of 114 and 300 microstrain were measured along the pipe segments at 0.6m and 1.2m burial depth, respectively. The larger value is about 1/3 of the tensile strain capacity of vitrified clay.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Water soluble polymers find applications in both consumer (e.g. superabsorbers in diapers, antiscalants in laundry detergent, and thickeners in shampoo) and industrial applications (e.g. antiscalants, antiflocculants and viscosity modulators in water treatment and oil drilling). Despite their industrial importance, the understanding of their kinetics have lagged behind their organic counterparts due to interaction of the monomer and polymer with the solvent, affecting the kinetics, and complicating experimental analysis such as molecular mass measurements. Additionally, the high viscosity of these systems at low monomer concentration (~5 wt%) make it difficult to take samples during polymerization reactions. Improved and specialized experimental techniques allow for the study and better understanding of these complex systems.&#xD;
The work presented in this thesis focuses on the copolymerization of acrylic acid with acrylamide as a function of monomer concentration, monomer composition, temperature, and the degree of ionization of acrylic acid. Experimental monomer conversions and compositions were collected using an in-situ NMR technique developed and verified as part of this project. The in-situ NMR technique allowed for reliable data collection at monomer concentrations up to 40 wt%, covering a broader range of conditions than in previous literature, with reactivity ratios mapped over the complete range of monomer concentration and degree of ionization. &#xD;
Successful modeling of the acrylamide homopolymerization included the backbiting mechanism using rate coefficients measured by our collaborators on this project and allowed for a comprehensive model valid for a range of temperatures and monomer concentrations for our and literature conversion profiles. Models of the acrylic acid and acrylamide copolymerization at non- and fully ionized conditions were also developed. However, insufficient knowledge of rate coefficients highlighted some gaps in our understanding of this copolymerization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Evaluating patient knee function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) can be difficult. With current evaluation methods, some patients are unable to return to their previous level of physical activity and if they do, they have a high risk of re-injury. One reason for these poor outcomes could be a lack of evaluation options in the clinic. Clinical evaluations require inexpensive and objective tests that have low physical demand. One objective and low demand test is the step-up-and-over (SUAO). Presently, the test uses a force plate, an expensive device. Replacing the force plate with an accelerometer could make the SUAO test an inexpensive evaluation tool of ACLR patients. Therefore, this thesis had three objectives. First, to discover if an accelerometer is a valid alternative to a force plate for the SUAO test. Second, to determine if the accelerometer-modified SUAO test is performed differently by ACL-intact individual and ACLR patients. Third and final, to determine if a relationship exists between SUAO test performance and subjective knee function.&#xD;
	Two studies were completed for this thesis. In the first study, 17 ACL-intact individuals completed the SUAO test while being measured with a force plate and an accelerometer. In the second study, 26 ACL-intact individuals and 25 ACLR patients completed questionnaires on subjective knee function and fear of re-injury, then were measured with an accelerometer during the SUAO test.&#xD;
	Results showed that the force plate and accelerometer measures were strongly correlated. Results also showed that the SUAO test, was performed differently by ACL-intact individuals and ACLR patients, and that the test performance was correlated to subjective knee function. Together, these results demonstrate that the SUAO test, with an accelerometer, is a clinically viable option on which normal and abnormal knees perform differently, and that the performance is related to the person’s opinion of their knee’s function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inhibiting the maladaptive migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in injured blood vessels can help to reduce the development of intimal lesions in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is involved in the regulation of VSMC migration and can be targeted in these diseases to reduce their impact. cAMP signaling is ubiquitous and dynamic, and requires control through signaling termination mechanisms. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP and are critical in the control of cAMP signaling. The spatial restriction of these enzymes in cells allows for the generation of distinct cAMP-mediated responses. The PDE4D gene family plays a dominant role in cAMP hydrolysis in migratory human VSMCs. Considerable interest exists in the idea that the unique N-terminal domains of PDE4D isoforms promote their spatial restriction in cells through selective interactions with other proteins, and that this localization allows individual isoforms to regulate discrete cellular functions. This study extends on previous work that examined the targeting of individual PDE4D isoforms in human arterial SMCs (HASMCs) through the overexpression of GFP constructs containing the unique N-terminal domains of the PDE4D isoforms (NT-PDE4D/GFP). The overexpression of NT-PDE4D7/GFP was observed to affect the morphology of migrating cells. In this study, using these N-terminal constructs and an RNAi-based strategy, we establish that PDE4D7 is involved in controlling rear retraction in migrating HASMCs. We show that altering PDE4D7 targeting and expression in these cells affects rear retraction largely through its ability to impact RhoA-ROCK signaling. We also report that PDE4D7 interacts with AKAP5, PKA and EPAC in HASMCs. Our results suggest a functional role for localized PDE4D7 activity in regulating cAMP-mediated rear retraction in migrating HASMCs, and identify PDE4D7 as a potential therapeutic target in controlling VSMC migration.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The major challenge in understanding the history in high-pressure continental terranes is dating the timing and duration of fluid infiltration and circulation events related to eclogitization and exhumation. Through a combination of high-resolution 40Ar/39Ar and Rb/Sr dating, coupled with detailed petrological and geochemical studies and numerical Ar-diffusion modelling, the thermal history of the Lofoten Islands – a continental terrane in northern Norway transected by Caledonian (c. 480 Ma) eclogite-facies shear zones formed at P ≈ 15 kbar and T ≈ 680°C – was studied to elucidate its associated fluid infiltration and melt injection histories.&#xD;
	Six shear zones were studied from two islands – Vestvågøy and Flakstadøy. 40Ar/39Ar results in eclogitic garnet indicate that the fluids involved in the eclogitization at T ≈ 650–600°C (newly estimated temperatures) were 40Ar-rich. 40Ar/39Ar results and numerical models reveal that isothermal retrogression to amphibolite facies occurred at 425 Ma, lasting an integrated time of ≤ 1 Ma, during which the zones served as pathways for 40Ar-rich hot fluids that migrated through conduits reaching the overlying allochthon of Vestvågøy. The models indicate that the retrogressed eclogites and allochthon were exhumed soon after the eclogitization to shallower crustal levels (depth ≈ 8 km) where the ambient T did not exceed 300°C. These rock units remained at these levels for 90 Ma and 60 Ma, respectively, and experienced episodic injection of hot fluids associated with extensional events and local melt intrusions. 40Ar-poor fluids at 415 Ma infiltrated the zones at T ≈ 500°C for c. 100 ka in the Flakstadøy basement and at T ≈ 650°C for c. 400 ka in the allochthon of Vestvågøy. 40Ar-rich fluids at c. 365 Ma infiltrated the zones in Vestvågøy reaching the allochthonous at T ≈ 600°C for c. 150 ka. In a zone of Flakstadøy, a melt intrusion at 335 Ma reheated the rocks at T ≈ 500°C for c. 25 ka.&#xD;
	Short-lived thermal events such as melt intrusions (390 Ma and 320 Ma) and fluid infiltration (280 Ma, 200 Ma, 180 Ma and 55 Ma), continued in different shear zones of Flakstadøy associated with Pangaea breakup and seafloor spreading.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>‘Urban Metabolism’ (UM) is a well-established concept based on the parallels between the metabolisms’ of ecosystems and cities. These parallels consist of the intake, storage, and transformation of materials and energy, and the creation and output of wastes. These traits, which suggest cities possess a metabolism similar to ecosystems, also exist within water distribution systems (WDSs). Four common areas of UM assessments include: the evaluation of environmental sustainability indicators; greenhouse gas accounting; numerical models for the assessment of metabolic flows; and design and decision support tools. These applications show promising opportunities if applied to WDSs, and therefore a novel framework based on UM was developed specifically for the assessment of WDSs. This framework was tested on a water distribution network via three experiments. Experiment 1 utilized factorial design to systematically assess predominate network parameters (water demand, static lift, and pipe roughness). Experiments 2 and 3 studied the effects of two network management strategies (water conservation and pipe replacement scheduling) as well as the effects of static lift and pipe roughness in the presence of these strategies. The results were reported in terms of four metabolic flows: water, operational energy (O/E), embodied energy (E/E), and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Experiment 1 showed that individual increases in water demand, pipe roughness, or static lift, all led to decreases in network pressures and reductions in leakage volume. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated increases to leakage volumes and decreases in per capita GHG emissions in the presence of water conservation measures, and decreases in leakage volumes and increases in O/E transmission efficiency in the presence of pipe replacement programs. Experiments 2 and 3 also demonstrated a reduction in network pressures, and a resulting reduction in leakage volumes, due to additional static lift and pipe roughness. Recommendations for future work were made in four specific areas: (1) the expansion of pre-established metabolic flows, (2) the further study of the effects of pressure management under the scenarios studied, (3) the consideration of other urban systems which may benefit from the application of an UM-based assessment, and (4) the assessment of non-hypothetical WDSs using the developed framework.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Since 1972, genocidal violence and conflict in Burundi has generated over nearly one million refugees. With the signing of peace accords in 2000, and shifts in asylum policies, an unprecedented number of former refugees had returned, prior to increased political violence in 2015. The Burundian government and its humanitarian partners have constructed Villages Ruraux Intégrés (VRIs, or Rural Integrated Villages) to resettle those not able to reclaim their former land, or who are otherwise landless. Framed as a pragmatic solution for resettling landless returnees’ in a predominantly agrarian setting, it aims also for a transformation from a subsistence economy to a market economy, transforming residents from supposedly aid-dependent former refugees, to self-sufficient, peaceful citizens, responsible for their own wellbeing. This thesis highlights the challenges of regained citizenship for these displaced people in a neoliberalizing landscape of peace and reconstruction. The first manuscript examines the logic behind the creation of these villages, and how this logic took form in their actual construction. While past villagisations’ have been characterised as ‘authoritarian high modernist grand schemes’ and are thus different from today’s more subtle modes of governing populations, I argue that the two are not mutually exclusive. The VRI program draws on both modes of governance, constructing ordered landscapes and seeking to shape citizen conduct. In doing so, it exemplifies what many geographers have identified as a contradictory shift in neoliberalism towards a more interventionist shaping of society. The second manuscript examines the experiences of regained citizenship and resettlement among former Burundian refugees in newly created VRIs.  Here I aim to understand how living in these socio-spatially ordered landscapes has affected returnees’ experiences of citizenship and belonging. I argue that VRIs are problematic as a post-conflict reconstruction spatial strategy because they rely upon contradictory forms of neoliberal governance that require residents to behave both as passive, compliant, apolitical humanitarian aid recipients when rare aid is delivered, and as enterprising and self-sufficient neoliberal subjects in environments that offer limited livelihood opportunities. Addressing the challenges of return requires attention to the processes shaping their experiences, beyond the common-sense scales of the village and the state.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: In computer assisted surgery accurate navigation tools are a necessity in many applications.  The current most widely used navigation systems are expensive compared to the cheaptest imaging modalities such as ultrasound.  Permanent magnet based tracking systems potentially offer adequate tracking accuracy and workspace size for limited clinical adoption.  This thesis investigates the development of such a tracking system, in order to facilitate future work in developing this technology.  Methods: Tracking the position of a permanent magnet involves finding a solution to a field model which matches the measured field to a position around the magnet.  The work here first compared common magnetic field models to one another, and to measured magnetic field data to determine their suitability in tracking systems.  A repeatable experimental data collection method is presented along with a method of calibration to reduce systematic error.  A simulator was also written in MATLAB which simulated the experimental setup allowing systematic and random errors to me controlled.  Results: Two simple magnetic field models were compared and found to have nearly identical fields.  A more complex model was compared and had measureable different field magnitudes to the dipole and monopole models (on the order of 10% difference), but was unusable in the tracking algorithm due to limitations of the non-linear optimizer and not investigated further.  Simulated results showed a high sensitivity to most errors sources, particularly the orientation error in the data collection setup and in the sensors minimum resolution of measurable magnetic field.  Tracking accuracy on experimentally collected data in 3-DOF after calibration was less than desired, with position error exceeding 5 mm at distances as low as 10 cm between sensor and magnet.  Conclusion: Permanent magnet tracking was found to be less accurate than is clinically useful, and highly sensitive to errors in sensors and experimental setup.  The range of the system was found to be particularly limited by the sensor measurement resolution.  This work provides solutions to some common error sources and could be used as a starting point for future investigations into permanent magnet tracking systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) model was applied to the fatigue deformation of dissimilar Mg alloy bi-crystals. The mesoscopic stress-strain and microscopic slip and twinning behaviour of the model were first validated with experimental tension and compression data of pure Mg single crystals. High-cycle fatigue (HCF) simulations up to 1000 cycles were then used to systematically examine the effect of different textures on the cyclic deformation behavior of Mg AZ31-AZ80 bi-crystals at room-temperature. Fatigue behaviour was characterized in terms of the mesoscopic average stress-strain response and the evolution of the microscopic deformation (slip/twin activity). The model captures load asymmetry, cyclic hardening/softening and ratcheting. However, the model did not capture stress concentrations at the grain boundary (GB) for the grain shapes considered. &#xD;
Either basal slip or tensile twinning was activated for any given orientation. When the soft AZ31 grain is oriented for basal slip almost all the shear strain is contained in that grain and has approximately ten times more accumulated shear strain than the other orientations. The results reveal there is a strong effect from orientation combinations on the cyclic deformation wherein a “hard” orientation shields a “soft” orientation from strain. When the AZ80 grain is oriented for basal slip and the AZ31 grain is oriented for tensile twinning the bi-crystal is soft, but only in one direction since twinning is a polar mechanism. Approximately half as much accumulated shear strain occurs when both grains are oriented for twinning. The slip and twinning systems quickly harden in AZ31 in the first few hundred cycles and the shear strain amplitudes quickly devolve from values between 10-6 – 10-4 to around 10-7; values which would be difficult to resolve experimentally. &#xD;
The results were then extended to the possible effects on the fatigue behaviour of an AZ31-AZ80 dissimilar weld idealized as an AZ31-AZ80 bi-crystal. It is predicted that the worst fatigue behaviour would occur when one grain is oriented for basal slip: AZ31 grain, results in strain localization; AZ80 grain, results in an increase in twin boundaries and irreversible deformation in an AZ31 grain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abnormal maternal inflammation during pregnancy is linked to complications such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. There is growing evidence that insulin resistance is also associated with a heightened inflammatory state, and is linked to pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes. This study tested the hypothesis that abnormal inflammation during pregnancy is causally linked to elevations in blood glucose and insulin resistance. To induce a state of abnormal systemic inflammation, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered to pregnant rats on gestational days (GD) 13.5-16.5. Dams treated with LPS exhibited an abnormal immune response characterized by an elevation in white blood cells, which was linked to reduced fetal weight and increased glucose levels over pregnancy. Abnormal inflammation is characterized by increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and interleukin-6, which contribute to insulin resistance by inhibiting the insulin signalling pathway. TNF in particular induces a serine phosphorylation (pSer307) of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). In our model, insulin resistance was assessed by measuring the extent of pSer307 of IRS-1 and total IRS-1 expression in skeletal muscle, as well as changes in metabolic parameters and pancreas tissue morphology associated with insulin resistance. LPS-treated dams exhibited a significant reduction in IRS-1 expression, elevation in fasting glucose levels, and reduction in insulin sensitivity indices. There were also biologically relevant increases in fasting plasma insulin levels and insulin resistance indices, but not pSer307 of IRS-1 and pancreatic islet size. To determine whether inflammation plays a role in reducing insulin signalling and the other changes associated with LPS administration, etanercept, a TNF antagonist, was administered on GDs 13.5 and 15.5 prior to LPS injections. With the exception of IRS-1 expression, in rats treated with etanercept all of the measured parameters remained at the levels observed in saline controls, indicating a link between abnormal inflammation and insulin resistance. The results of this study support the practice of monitoring the inflammatory conditions of the mother prior to and during pregnancy, and support further investigation into the potential use of anti-inflammatory agents during pregnancy in women at risk of insulin resistance and gestational diabetes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation offers a critical history of the Sport for Development and Peace paradigm by exploring the United Nations’ use of sport in the development context. It questions the dominant, ideal vision of Sport for Development and Peace in which sport is understood to offer an innovative and pragmatic approach to development and to act as a vehicle for the promotion of health, education, peace-building, economic growth, and infrastructural development. Within a framework of the “history of the present” and drawing upon a post-structural discourse analysis and archival research I trace the use of sport from colonial and imperial endeavours, through to post-World War II reconstruction, to the contemporary moment, so as to make visible the political and contested nature of implementing sport in the development context. Arguing that the Sport for Development and Peace paradigm is not a novel venture, that it extends a (neo)colonial governmental apparatus, and that it reinscribes neoliberal rationalities, I seek to explore how Sport for Development and Peace policies conceal and reproduce broader global power relations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Through ethnographic fieldwork and archival research, this thesis examines the historical and contemporary governing practices that inform waste management in Iqaluit, Nunavut.  I draw on governance theory to critically examine the diffuse network of power that influences waste management practices and outcomes, and that have contributed to the city’s waste issues. Like other communities in Canada’s Nunavut territory, Iqaluit lacks sophisticated technologies to manage waste and abandoned dump sites are littered throughout the city’s landscape. Across the territory, communities are concerned about their waste future.&#xD;
This case study of waste governance is divided into three parts. In part one, waste is examined within the wider context of colonialism and contemporary neoliberal governance practices that have contributed to what scholars are referring to as the Anthropocene. It is argued that waste itself is part of a colonial context within which Inuit and other northerners continue to live. In part two, two of Iqaluit’s ‘trash animals’-- ravens and dogs--  are examined to highlight the role of nonhumans in waste governance. It is argued that waste materially reconfigures relationships between human and nonhuman animals, and that these relationships are bequeathed to future generations. In part three, I examine the 2014 Iqaluit ‘dumpcano’ controversy, which coincided with my field season in Iqaluit. The dump fire brought to the fore a history of contaminant exposure and federal government underfunding that was differently framed and responded to by community members and government officials; while government risk management practices privileged neoliberal epistemologies and governance, active participation by Iqaluit residents placed community understandings of health, wellbeing, and sovereignty at the forefront of the ‘dumpcano’ debate. Within the context of myriad social and environmental issues, increased community growth and development, and Inuit efforts to self-determine, I suggest that improvements to Iqaluit’s waste management infrastructure should integrate supports to Inuit culture and knowledge systems. Doing so involves replacing a technical configuration of waste with one of knowing, being, and relating to others and the environment; and would help meet community goals and definitions for sustainable community development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mechanical testing is used to estimate the properties of materials and constructs.  A video extensometer is a common measurement device in mechanical testing which uses a video camera to track fiducial markers on a specimen.  This work presents the development and validation of a custom video extensometer that was assembled from readily available components and can be used to track two dimensional motion for mechanical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The video extensometer was used to track the motion of fiducials affixed to a linear XY translation stage, relative to static fiducials, to validate the accuracy in a static case.  The sensor error for tracking fiducials from targeted position to actual position was less than half a pixel.  A second validation assessed the accuracy in a low-speed mechanical testing case by tracking the motion of fiducials on the machine head of a Universal Testing Machine relative to static fiducials.  The sensor error of video measurements compared to Universal Testing Machine position data for tracking fiducials was less than a quarter pixel.&#xD;
&#xD;
The video extensometer was then used as the measurement device in mechanical testing of distal radius fracture plates.  Fractured plastic distal radius models, repaired using either locking or non-locking screws, were tested through a simulated healing and rehabilitation period.  Changes with respect to failure criteria were measured using calipers and the video extensometer.  Similar trends were found between video and caliper measurements; the differences were largely due to angular changes in the constructs causing differences in the caliper measurements, as well as to uncertainties intrinsic to caliper measurements, such as repeatability of measurements and assumptions of verticality.  There was no clear advantage for either fixation method found in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work shows that a high accuracy video extensometer for planar motion tracking was easy to implement using commonly available materials and could have applications in a variety of fields.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: &#xD;
To assess the associations of different shift work exposure metrics with circadian melatonin mesor, amplitude and acrophase.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: &#xD;
In a cross-sectional study of 328 female hospital personnel working fixed-day or rotation schedules, shift work exposure metrics were determined through self-report. 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations were analyzed by cosinor analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results:&#xD;
Shift workers working at night had lower mesors and earlier acrophases than day workers. Shift workers working three or more consecutive nights had lower mesors and smaller amplitudes than those working less than three consecutive nights. After adjusting for confounders, acrophases were no longer different, while smaller amplitudes were apparent among shift workers compared to day workers. Shift length or duration of shift work were not associated with melatonin pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion:&#xD;
 Rotating patterns of shift work, specifically high intensity rotations, are associated with depressed melatonin rhythms, an indicator of circadian disruption.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) is a member of subfamily C of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of membrane transport proteins. In polarized cells, MRP4 localizes to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane depending on the tissue type. To gain insight into mechanisms regulating MRP4 plasma membrane trafficking, its interactions with the PDZ domain-containing CortBP1, a member of Shank2 family of adapter proteins, were investigated. Since CortBP1 is known to recruit proteins involved in endocytosis, it was hypothesized that CortBP1 plays a role in MRP4 internalization from the plasma membrane. Ectopic expression of CortBP1 led to decreased total MRP4 levels in HEK293T cells and cell surface biotinylation experiments and confocal microscopy showed that this decrease was at the plasma membrane. Pull-down experiments indicated that the interaction between CortBP1 and MRP4 requires the last four amino acids 1322ETAL of the transporter. They also suggested that MRP4 may exist in a complex with CortBP1 and endocytic proteins. In SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cells, RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous SHANK2 isoforms (including CORTBP1) resulted in increased total MRP4 levels. Confocal microscopy of SHANK2-depleted BE(2)-C cells suggested that this increase occurred at the plasma membrane. These observations demonstrate that the internalization of plasma membrane MRP4 is regulated by CortBP1, and possibly other SHANK2 family members. In addition to PDZ domain-containing adapter proteins, N-glycans can regulate the apical membrane localization of some proteins. Whether this is true for MRP4 is unknown. Based on in silico analyses and topological models of human MRP4, it was hypothesized that it is glycosylated at Asn746 and Asn754. Single substitutions of these Asn residues with Gln (N746Q, N754Q) increased the electrophoretic mobility of MRP4; double substitutions (N746/754Q) increased its mobility further such that it was comparable to wild-type MRP4 deglycosylated with PNGase F. Importantly, confocal microscopy indicated that the apical membrane localization of the single and double Asn mutants in polarized LLC-PK1 cells was comparable to wild-type MRP4. This suggests that N-glycans are not required for apical membrane localization of MRP4, at least in LLC-PK1 cells. Overall, the results of these studies provide novel insights into the membrane trafficking of MRP4.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Iron and Mg isotopic composition of alteration minerals from the environs of the McArthur River uranium deposit Zone 4 in the Athabasca Basin are the main focus of this project. Iron isotopic signatures can be used to discriminate areas where significant redox reactions have occurred and thus, may provide indications of areas fertile for uranium mineralization. Therefore, this study investigates the premise that Fe isotopic values can be used to indicate how and where uranium ore deposition occurred. Fe has been known to play an important role as a reductant for U during the formation of U-deposits, acting as a reducing agent during their formation as follows:&#xD;
U6+(aq) + 2Fe2+(aq) + 2H2O ↔ U4+O2(uraninite) + 2Fe3+(chlorite or hematite) + 4H+(aq)&#xD;
Using Mg isotope ratios, this study also aims to ascertain whether δ26Mg values are useful in differentiating alteration minerals associated with diagenetic, hydrothermal, and retrograde alteration origins.&#xD;
Mineral phases that control the isotopic composition for both Fe and Mg are illite (I1, I1bsmt), chlorite (C1, C1bsmt, C2 and C3), and illite-chlorite mixed-layer (ICML). There is a minor contribution from dravite (T1) on Mg isotopic values. Both the Mg and Fe isotopic compositions indicate that samples above the silicified zone (up to 300m) were affected by the primary dispersion of the mineralizing system. The initial δ56Fe and δ26Mg values at McArthur River deposit are constrained based on available literature. Fe is sourced from the basement rocks in the McArthur River area with δ56Fe values near 0‰, similar to most igneous and metamorphic rocks. Magnesium is mainly sourced from evaporated seawater, with background δ26Mg values ranging from -2 to -0.23‰, typical of evaporates and continental crust.&#xD;
This study could become the stepping stone in exploration of unconformity related U deposits. The results obtained in this study support the role of Fe as a reductant for U in deposits in the Athabasca Basin. If δ56Fe values &gt;0.5‰ are in fact reflecting hydrothermal alteration associated to the ore-stage alteration, then Fe isotopic signatures would prove useful vectors for mineralization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lolium perenne (Lp), the perennial ryegrass, produces an antifreeze protein (AFP) when seasonal temperatures and levels of available sunlight drop in the autumn. This protein, along with other low-temperature induced stress proteins with distinct functions, allows the plant to survive sub-zero temperatures. LpAFP adsorbs to developing ice crystals, marginally lowering the freezing point of solutions but shows a more impressive capacity to prevent ice recrystallization. Its ability to inhibit ice recrystallization has resulted in interest in industrial applications of LpAFP, from its use as a frozen food additive and as a potential useful sequence for transgenic crop enhancement and even as a model to understand the inhibition of gas hydrates, which have a crystal structure distinct from ice. This thesis shows that the wild-type LpAFP sequence when placed in a suitable expression vector can be displayed on the bacterial membrane and increased the incorporation of the host bacterium into polycrystalline ice. Extensive in vitro mutagenesis has allowed the investigation of the relative importance of particular amino acids in LpAFP for adsorption to both ice and a model gas hydrate, tetrahydrofuran hydrate. Notably, certain steric mutations that disrupted ice affinity retained appreciable hydrate binding. These experiments have generated a greater understanding of LpAFP through the selective characterization of its recombinant mutants and wild-type states, and have prompted some suggestions and strategies to work towards the development of gas hydrate inhibitors modeled on this protein.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research investigating emotion regulation (ER) has failed to accomplish three goals: (1) to develop a clear understanding of how ER relates to emotion theory; (2) to reach a consensus on which actions constitute ER; and (3) to assess patterns of ER behaviours rather than only one-to-one relations between specific regulatory behaviours and aspects of well-being. The current study aimed to address these gaps in the literature through the following objectives: (1) develop a self-report measure to simultaneously assess an individual’s propensity to use six regulatory acts identified by a new model of ER derived from emotion theory; (2) identify how regulatory acts cluster within individuals, and (3) identify the relation between ER groups and psychosocial outcome measures. &#xD;
Using two independent samples, the first objective was achieved by creating the Regulation of Emotion Systems Survey (RESS), which was a reliable and valid measure of the six acts of regulation specified by the ER Acts Model. The second objective was achieved through Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), which determined that three distinct profiles of regulatory behaviour existed in the sample: Average ER Act Use (using the full range of ER acts), Suppression Propensity (using expressive suppression almost exclusively), and Engagement Propensity (using expressive engagement almost exclusively). Finally, the third objective was achieved through comparing psychosocial outcome measures for the three groups, which demonstrated significant differences between LPA group membership and well-being. The Average group had significantly lower levels of depression and  anxiety than the Suppression and Engagement groups; however, the Engagement and Suppression groups did not differ on depression and anxiety scores. Furthermore, the Suppression group showed significantly higher family and peer relationship quality than the Engagement group.&#xD;
Based on these findings, one-to-one relationships between individual regulatory acts and well-being may not be ideal as it is the pattern of ER act use that has more meaningful relations with well-being.  Participants in either the Suppression or Engagement groups used these regulatory behaviours almost exclusively, thereby rendering problematic even ER acts traditionally thought of as beneficial.  Consequently, the ability to flexibly utilize a variety of ER acts may lead to more successful socio-emotional outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Shift work is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This thesis focuses on the potential disruption of cortisol production by shift work, a proposed underlying pathway to CVD.&#xD;
Objectives: (1) To describe the diurnal quantity and pattern of cortisol production according to shift work status (exclusive-day, or rotating days and nights), and according to parameters of rotating shift work (timing, length, and intensity). (2) To determine how current shift work status and past shift work affects diurnal quantity and pattern of cortisol production. (3) To determine the effects of rotating shift work parameters on diurnal pattern and quantity of cortisol production.&#xD;
Methods: 328 female hospital employees (160 day workers, 168 rotating shift workers) participated in a cross-sectional study consisting of: (1) an initial interview and anthropometric assessment, (2) completion of a questionnaire package to ascertain work characteristics, and (3) collection of urine over a 48-hour period to measure creatinine-adjusted cortisol. Cortisol profiles and unadjusted summary measures were used to describe the quantity and pattern of diurnal cortisol production by shift work status and parameters of rotating shift work exposure. The effect of shift work on diurnal cortisol was determined using multivariable linear regression modeling.&#xD;
Results: Compared to day workers, rotating shift workers had flatter diurnal cortisol curves and produced less cortisol during their night shift cycle. However, during day shift cycles, there was no difference between shift workers and day workers in the quantity produced. Each additional year of shift work exposure was associated with an increase in diurnal cortisol production in day workers only. Conclusions: Night work is associated with acutely attenuated cortisol production, while a greater number of years of past shift work increased cortisol production. Thus, cortisol disruption may be a potential mechanism linking shift work to CVD development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>When one noxious stimulus is coupled with a second noxious stimulus applied to a remote region of the body relative to the first stimulus, the perception of pain is reduced.  This phenomenon is termed conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and it’s thought to engage descending inhibitory controls originating in the brainstem which modulate pain processing pathways, resulting in a decrease in pain. This thesis explores the CPM effect in humans, to further our understanding of pain modulation within the central nervous system (CNS).  Previous research reveals that CPM evokes pain inhibition in the majority of healthy pain-free individuals, while recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of healthy individuals also demonstrate pain facilitatory responses similar to those exhibited by individuals with chronic pain.  Currently, no imaging studies have exclusively explored subcortical changes in activity evoked by the CPM paradigm. Therefore, this thesis delves into uncovering the changes in the brainstem and spinal cord activity in response to the CPM paradigm by investigating the behavioral and neural responses of healthy females using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  CPM was induced by delivering a heat test stimulus to the right thenar eminence and a cold conditioning stimulus to the left thenar eminence simultaneously, in 25 females aged 27.6 ± 7.82, while obtaining behavioral and imaging data. We found that the CPM paradigm evoked a significant reduction in perceived pain coupled with significantly greater blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) responses in the PAG, RVM, DRt and the DH of the spinal cord, compared to the control condition, where only the heat test stimulus was delivered.  Furthermore, the connectivity between these regions was greater during CPM than during the control condition.  Lastly, we found significant differences in the behavioral and neural responses between individuals demonstrating pain inhibition and those demonstrating pain facilitation in response to CPM.  Furthermore, connectivity findings suggest that different networks are engaged when experiencing an enhanced perception of pain compared to when the pain is reduced during CPM.  These findings enhance our current knowledge of the subcortical network involved in CPM, and provide novel insights into the neural correlates of pain modulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Medication and surgery, the traditional treatments for Parkinson’s disease, can have serious side effects for Parkinson’s patients. Nurses need low-risk and effective treatments for their patients. Some of the brain areas associated with bradykinesia, one of Parkinson’s diseases cardinal symptoms, can be trained using cognitive-training programs. The objective of this study was to test the effect of anti-saccade eye-movement training on bradykinesia and the ability to perform the activities of daily living in participants with Parkinson’s disease. Anti-sacccade eye-movement training asks participants to ignore a stimuli and look in the opposite direction, which trains their ability to exert control over their own movements. &#xD;
A convenience sample of participants with Parkinson’s disease (N = 10) was recruited for this study. Over the span of 12 days, participants conducted a baseline data collection, which measured demographics; ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs) and gait; used an eye-movement training program for 10 consecutive days; and then returned for a second data collection, which measured ADLs and gait. &#xD;
The results of the study include detailed notes on barriers to adherance, such as understanding the program, using the tablet and finding time to train; changes that had to be made to scheduling; and difficulties with collecting motion-capture data from this population. The ADLs questionnaires had perfect scores pre- and post-intervention for all except one participant, and the change in gait speed was not significant. &#xD;
Anti-saccade eye-movement training is a feasible intervention for this population given enough teaching and support. There was no significant change in walking speed or ADLs. The program requires modifications in order to increase the effect. This may include adaptive programming, improved feedback and more adaptive technologies. Also, using a more sensitive measure of ADLs may be beneficial and should be considered for future studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: An increasingly large proportion of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities are frail. Measuring frailty is challenging, and generic measures of frailty inaccurately identify frailty in this population. In the general population, frailty reflects an increased risk of outcomes, including admission to long-term care. Institutionalization of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities may be a reflection of high levels of frailty. &#xD;
OBJECTIVES: 1) To develop a frailty index for home care users with intellectual and developmental disabilities using Ontario standardized clinical assessment data, 2) to describe the prevalence of frailty among these adults, and 3) to determine the association between frailty and admission to long-term care. &#xD;
METHODS:  A frailty index was developed using published criteria to select items from the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care. Assessments of 7,863 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Ontario (aged 18-99 years) provided the data. A comparison measure of health instability, the Changes in Health, End-stage disease, Signs and Symptoms scale, identified individuals as stable or unstable. Using a subset of this sample (n=3,034) retrospectively followed over four years, survival analyses determined differences in rates of admission to long-term care according to frailty and instability. &#xD;
RESULTS: The frailty index combined 42 deficits from five domains of health (physiological, psychological, cognitive, social and service use). Almost half of the cohort was pre-frail (21%) or frail (27%). In the 4-year follow-up, 22% of the sample was admitted to long-term care. Adjusting for age, sex, rural status, caregiver status, living situation, and cognition level, at any given time, frail individuals were twice as likely to be admitted to long-term care compared to non-frail individuals. &#xD;
CONCLUSIONS: The frailty index is developed from items currently incorporated into home care assessments, and can predict institutionalization in adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Further research should evaluate the feasibility of implementing this measure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The accuracy of the inertial dissipation method (IDM), commonly applied to estimate the observed rate of turbulent dissipation in bottom boundary layers (BBL), is evaluated by performing direct numerical simulations (DNS) and large eddy simulations (LES) of unidirectional turbulent channel flows. Errors in the IDM occur as the mean velocity is commonly used for the convection velocity and when the canonical Kolmogorov -5/3 constants, which assume isotropy and homogeneity of the flow, are applied. The optimal convection velocity, as previously shown by many researchers, is found to be 2 times greater than the local mean velocity near the bed and the Kolmogorov constants are significantly affected by anisotropy. Usage of the canonical Kolmogorov constants leads to significant errors (&gt;50%) in computation of dissipation. &#xD;
Using the same DNS and LES data, the accuracy of Kolmogorov 2/3 constants, used in the structure function method (SFM) to compute dissipation, is also investigated. As with the IDM, comparison of the dissipation, calculated directly from DNS/LES with that from the SFM, shows that usage of canonical constants results in considerable error (&gt;50%) from the vertical or spanwise velocity components. Application of anisotropy-adjusted constants to data from the BBL of Lake Erie shows that these constants improve computed dissipation by a factor of two, with results within 20% of published dissipation obtained from the Batchelor fitting method.&#xD;
 	DNS and LES of oscillating turbulent flows were also carried out to calibrate and evaluate common analytical models used in oscillatory BBLs in lakes and costal oceans. These include the log-law, Stokes second problem, the IDM, and a one-equation Spalart-Allmaras model. Velocity profile predictions from the Spalart-Allmaras model were found to be more accurate than those from the log-law and Stokes’ second problem. Comparison of the LES data and the turbulence models, with published field measurements, shows that the rate of dissipation from the IDM is more accurate than that obtained from the log-law, particularly when the flow reverses. The differences between the IDM and LES suggest that the errors in prediction of dissipation can be due to the anisotropy conditions in the BBL.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>PhnY and PhnZ comprise a new microbial pathway for the degradation of the naturally occurring phosphonate 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid into glycine and inorganic phosphate.  PhnY is an α-ketoglutarate / Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase that hydroxylates the α-carbon of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid. PhnZ is a di-iron-dependent oxygenase that cleaves the C-P bond of the PhnY product, 2-amino-1R-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, using a mechanism unlike that used by other C-P bond cleaving enzymes. Kinetic parameters for PhnY were determined with 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid. A series of substrate analogues were also tested for reactivity, but PhnY was strictly specific for its native substrate. Attempts to crystallize PhnY to provide insight into its mechanism were unsuccessful in spite of the development of improved procedures to obtain concentrated samples of PhnY suitable for crystallography. PhnZ and active site variants were assayed with the native substrate 2-amino-1R-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid and a series of analogues. A primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 1.36 ± 0.06 was measured for the PhnZ reaction, indicating that cleavage of the αC-H bond of the substrate is only partly rate limiting. PhnZ was observed to convert 2R-amino-1R-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid, 3-amino-1R-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid, and N-methyl-2-amino-1-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid to inorganic phosphate. New X-ray crystal structures of PhnZ complexed with 2R-amino-1R-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid, 3-amino-1R-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid, and 1R-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid provided further insight into its substrate specificity revealing that it can accommodate some additional bulk in the active site, however the amino group and its location on the substrate are crucial for activity. The structures of PhnZ also provided new insights into the importance of the flexible loop that closes the active site upon substrate binding, and the roles of two residues along this loop, Y24 and E27. Based on these results, a more complete mechanism for C-P bond cleavage by PhnZ is proposed.</dcterms:abstract>

Through the case of the Quebec Family Policy, one of the largest and most comprehensive child care policies enacted in North America, the six papers making up this thesis investigate the impact of universal child care on a variety of child outcomes, including cognitive, health, and behavioural, and demonstrate that the effects of this policy are complicated along a number of dimensions. Moving beyond average effects, this research instead considers heterogeneity to produce a more nuanced analysis of the effects of universal child care. This research contributes significantly to debates surrounding best practices in child care policies, and the ways in which child care fits into trends such as gender gaps in education and increasing rates of childhood obesity. &#xD;
&#xD;
The first paper analyzes reporting of negative impacts of the Quebec Family Policy, confirming the notion that universal child care programs weaken individual and family outcomes but suggesting that substantial heterogeneity exists in response to child care attendance. The next paper examines these heterogeneous effects of universal child care through a consideration of differential impact according to child ability levels. Analysis reveals that formal child care can indeed boost developmental outcomes for some children, thus connecting a study of universal child care to the large literature on targeted programs. In the third paper aspects of the health outcomes of universal child care are examined, presenting both a complex image of the impact of child care on Body Mass Index and an initial investigation of the mechanisms driving these outcomes. The fourth paper demonstrates substantial heterogeneity across subgroups defined by child gender, and suggests that the availability of subsidized child care changed home environments disproportionately according to child gender. An analysis of heterogeneity in policy impacts by child age is the subject of the sixth paper, revealing that affects to young children drive the reported negative effects of the policy. Finally, in the sixth paper a triple difference identification strategy is used to consider the differential effects of exposure to policy access.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prostate cancer is the most common non-dermatological cancer amongst men in the developed world. The disease is manageable if detected early; treatment is thus becoming highly individualized, placing emphasis on detection and prediction of disease prognosis. This thesis is  concerned with the integrative analysis of gene expression data from prostate cancer, to reveal molecular signatures of metastases and the mechanisms of disease progression. &#xD;
&#xD;
Meta-analytic procedures are used to integrate three datasets and compare primary tumors based on metastatic outcome. Four datasets are also integrated to compare primary and metastatic tumour tissue types. This statistical integration provides a more robust and accurate characterization of gene expression signatures, and helps minimize microarray noise and study-specific effects. Multiple methods of integration are explored. Once integrated, a subset of significantly differentiated transcripts is selected to form a tentative expression signature. A support vector machine was used to construct a predictive model of metastatic outcome based on the identified expression signature. Its performance was assessed using a nested cross-validation procedure and out-of-sample testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data integration and network analysis have proved to be useful tools in providing context to the complex systems studied in system biology. This thesis makes use of a number of such techniques. Pathway enrichment analysis with DAVID and PathDIP were used to identify which biological pathways and related functions are most influenced by the signatures.  Pathways related to extracellular matrix were found to be significantly enriched in the metastatic outcome comparison. Integrating these lists using iCTnet and Cytoscape with heterogeneous disease-gene interaction networks revealed the relationships between the expression signatures and other cancers. Integrating the data with protein interaction datasets using the I2D database and Navigator network application allowed for the more robust comparison of various integration methodologies and expression signatures beyond just simple intersection. The results of the comparisons agree well with previous findings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are prevalent in the population, highly comorbid, and have similar clinical features that complicate diagnoses despite rather distinct diagnostic criteria. Executive functioning deficits in ADHD are similar to those reported in BD but lack the specificity to distinguish between these groups. Emotion processing similarly affects both ADHD and BD and, by combining these processes on a single task, we may increase sensitivity to differences between these populations in a way that may better categorize each disorder. Therefore, we compared performance on a cognitively demanding, affective oculomotor task. Adults, aged 18-62, with ADHD (n=22), BD (n=20), and healthy Controls (n=21) performed an interleaved pro- and antisaccade task (look toward versus looking away from a visual target, respectively). Task irrelevant emotional faces (fear, happy, sad, neutral) were presented on a subset of trials either before or with the target. We observed a group by task interaction (F(2,58)=3.849,p=.027,ηp2=.117) where the ADHD group made more direction errors (looked in the wrong direction) than Controls in the antisaccade condition (p=.027). A three way interaction between image, task, and group (Fig.6; F(8, 58)=2.607,p=.013,ηp2=.082) revealed that presentation of negatively valenced, fear (p=.044) and sad (p=.053), and ambiguous, neutral (p=.003), emotional faces increased saccadic reaction time in BD. In summary, the antisaccade task in general differentiated ADHD from Controls and simultaneous emotion processing further impaired processing speed in BD only. These findings suggest that response inhibition-emotion processing interactions differ between BD and ADHD and reinforce that emotion processing deficits are fundamental in BD and may be attention-driven in ADHD. We propose that response inhibition is critical in both processing systems, but this inhibitory signal is selectively slowed down by concurrent emotion processing dysfunction in BD. We refer to a hypothetical framework integrating these systems and suggest potential loci of dysfunction, the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, that may result in the emotional modulation of oculomotor behaviour we have observed here. The differences in how these processing systems interact in ADHD and BD may better characterize each disorder and suggests that refinement of an emotional antisaccade task may be clinically useful.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis defends the claim that the core idea of moral responsibility is fixed by our best theory of agency. Such a theory concerns the proper conditions of attribution of an attitude or an action to an agent for the purposes of moral appraisal – or what I call the rational relations view. The first chapter attempts to outline and motivate the conception of agency that has as its core the idea that agents are responsible for the judgement-sensitive attitudes that can be appropriately attributed to them and that they can be morally responsible for those attitudes when their judgements have morally objectionable contents. In my second chapter I present and argue against what I take to be the strongest alternative to the rational relations view, the theory of moral responsibility that has been elaborated by Harry Frankfurt over a number of years. The third chapter addresses a concern that conceptions of responsibility that are too closely tied to theories of agency can either be too superficial in their assessment and evaluation of the agent or actually unfair in their determinations of responsibility. The fourth chapter extends this discussion of the unfairness charge by explicitly addressing the question of the value of moral responsibility. My final chapter concerns an issue that lies at the intersection of questions in the philosophy of agency and moral responsibility: how to make sense of and be open to criticism for our acts of irrationality. I take the example of akratic, or weak-willed action, where an agent acts contrary to her better judgement (or what she judges best in a situation) as a paradigm instance of irrationality. I argue that RR has adequate resources to make sense of this phenomenon. &#xD;
At base, this thesis aspires to show that by elaborating an attractive picture of our agency we can at the same time shed light on what it means to be a responsible agent – one for whom it is intelligible and valuable to say we are morally responsible for our attitudes and actions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies the role of intermediate input goods in explaining international trade patterns and determining gains from trade based on heterogenous firms models. The first chapter provides a preview and literature review. In the second chapter, I extend two workhorse heterogenous firms trade models to incorporate intermediate inputs and value-added productivity differences across firms. This set-up yields a positive relationship between the international trade elasticity and the share of intermediate goods used in production. I test this relationship using trade and input-output data from the 1980s and 2000s, finding evidence which is consistent with the model's predictions. I then quantify the gains from trade based on this modified framework, finding values which are significantly higher than those from the standard models. In the third chapter, I extend a standard heterogeneous firms trade model by including sector-level productivity differences across production stages (intermediate and final). I then use input-output data from 2005 to explore the degree of cross-stage production specialization across countries. Based on the model and data, I find that the welfare gains from this margin are, on average, modest. For emerging economies, however, the gains are significantly higher than the average. In the fourth chapter, I explore the implications of the rising share of non-tradable services and rising share of intermediate inputs on the gains from trade based on a standard heterogeneous firms trade model. I use data from 1995 and 2011 to document and quantify these trends. Based on the model and data, I find that the negative impact of the rise of services and the positive impact of intermediate inputs growth roughly offset one another. I emphasize the role of intermediate inputs sectoral linkages in moderating these trends.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Woven shawls from the Kashmir region of the Indian subcontinent became a popular fashion in Europe during the latter half of the eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth. European manufacturers soon picked up on this trend, producing textiles which imitated eastern designs but sold at competitively lower prices from the 1780s onwards. As a consequence of their fashionability, Kashmiri shawls and their imitations made frequent appearances within European paintings. To date, there has been an absence of art historical investigation into the visual representation of Kashmiri shawls and their imitations within nineteenth-century painting, though several scholars have examined their appearance within French and English literature. This paper seeks to fill a literary gap by investigating Kashmiri shawls and their imitations depicted in British paintings from 1850 to 1910, with several French paintings included to support the analysis. Paintings are an appropriate source for considering the materiality of the shawl as they are some of the only available visual evidence to how shawls were worn and consumed as textiles (and to who wore and consumed them). &#xD;
Each of the three paintings selected for the three main chapters of this thesis serves as a case study. These are Hunt’s The Awakening Conscience (1853-1854) and The Children’s Holiday (1864-1865), and Francis Henry Newbery’s The Paisley Shawl (c. 1910). These examples have been selected for the visual centrality of the shawls within each painting, for their differing temporality (dated to the mid-1850s, mid-1860s, and c.1910, respectively) and settings (a London villa interior, English country park, and a Scottish cottage interior, respectively), and for the shawls’ dissimilar materiality and appearance. The women depicted are also of varying ages and social classes, representing diverse consumers of the shawls at separate moments of its history. Through a material culture-based analysis of the shawls, which combines close-reading of the depicted shawls as objects with consultation of ‘external’ historical sources, this thesis utilizes painted images as texts to interpret nuanced contemporary cultural and social information that was attached to the shawl during the long nineteenth century in Britain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper will examine Canadian public opinion on the WDC, utilizing newspaper editorials, letters-to-the-editor, editorial cartoons, and an examination of Canada’s League of Nations Society (LNS), to demonstrate that public opinion and policymakers often employed the same rhetoric when discussing collective security and disarmament, and conversely, issues of war and peace, but adopted to different approaches to these issues. Traditional scholarly interpretations of Canada and the League of Nations, focusing exclusively on upper-level diplomats and politicians, tend to adopt an over-simplified binary of internationalism versus isolationism, wrongfully making Canadian public opinion synonymous with the diplomatic isolationism en- acted by the Canadian government and League delegation. While the Canadian state was partial to isolationist politics, not all Canadians were isolationists. Bearing this geopolitical situation in mind allows us to reinterpret Canada’s stance to- wards the world as one that was fundamentally internationalist, especially on questions of collec- tive security and disarmament. While Canadians were far removed from the League and its pro- ceedings in Geneva, public organization and discourse enabled supporters to evaluate and inter- pret the League’s initiatives, placing themselves and their country within the political, social, and economic values of the League of Nations. In turn, Canadians positioned themselves within internationalist political paradigms rapidly developing during the interwar period. Many historians of interwar Canada describe a country poised on the brink of an isolationist continentalism, with a widespread sense of the country as a “fire-proof house” far removed from European troubles. They have paid little attention to the extent to which many Canadians favoured far more involvement in the world through the League of Nations, a body that enjoyed mass support in the country.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Internet of Things (IoT) refers to an evolution of the current Internet in which a large number of “smart objects” sense their surroundings and communicate amongst themselves and to data analytic servers. IoT applications are rooted in our physical world to offer users more convenient context and location-aware services, for which a common requirement is the ability to locate objects. Two approaches are proposed to localize IoT objects based on Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology: localize mobile/stationary tagged objects through a set of coordinated readers that report to a central server and localize mobile reader based on connectivity information with a set of tags deployed at known locations. The former is based on a centralized and fixed infrastructure which provides limited scalability while the latter is not cost effective for IoT settings as a large number of objects have to be equipped with RFID readers. In a typical IoT environment, there are considerable RFID crowdsourcing resources in terms of a large number of tags attached to objects and a considerable group of ad hoc mobile readers which are possibly heterogeneous and un-coordinated and can be used for locating objects. &#xD;
We investigate this promising direction and devise distributed localization schemes that leverage heterogeneous and independent mobile RFID readers along with RFID tags’ residual memories to cooperatively localize passive-tagged objects, while maintaining high scalability. In estimating object location, Multilateration is a commonly used technique that estimates object location based on the intersection of all plausible areas where the object is expected to exist. This technique requires at least three concurrent readings about an object to estimate its location which is a challenge under IoT settings. We address ways to overcome this challenge and provide better location accuracy in the absence of sufficient concurrent readings. We propose location information dissemination strategies that work on providing high location information availability with low overhead. We validate our schemes via extensive simulation and field experiments and show that our approach has the potential to provide localization service in typical IoT environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pain is a multifaceted and malleable sensory experience that is processed at all levels of the central nervous system. It can be influenced by cognitive factors such as attention, expectation, suggestion, and attitudes; the role of attention in cognitive modulation of pain is the focus for the work that is presented in this thesis. Behavioural studies showed that pain perception was reduced under cognitive loads that place a continuous demand on executive functions such as working memory. Neuroimaging, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies provide evidence that the underpinnings of cognitive modulation of pain involve a network of descending modulation of pain among cortical and brainstem structures. However, the role and relationship of subcortical regions in the brainstem and spinal cord (SC) during cognitive modulation of pain is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to confirm the behavioural effect of cognitive modulation of pain using a working memory task and to investigate the neural correlates of this modulatory mechanism in the brainstem and cervical SC using a combination of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Twelve female participants, ages 24-52, was given noxious thermal stimulation on the C6 dermatome while simultaneously performing three levels of the N-Back task. Our findings demonstrated a significant attenuation in pain perception across the group as a result of the task, along with high inter-subject variability in the degree of modulation. Functional MRI results exhibited neural responses in brainstem regions known to be involved in descending modulation of pain and the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the SC. SEM analysis revealed connectivity between the brainstem and SC at the group level and individual level that varied depending on the cognitive load and the degree of pain modulation, respectively. Altogether, the findings of this thesis demonstrate the behavioural effect of cognitive modulation on pain perception and give insight into the subcortical neural response to this process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Physical inactivity is a public health problem and surveillance data indicate remarkably low levels of physical activity amongst children globally. In Canada, only 14% of children between the ages of 5-11 are meeting the guidelines for physical activity. Correspondingly, the time children spend outdoors has decreased in recent decades, which suggests that they engage in less outdoor active play. Outdoor active play refers to unstructured and self-directed physical activity which occurs during leisure time. Little is known about the determinants of outdoor active play, although it is likely that parents influence this behaviour. &#xD;
The purpose of this thesis was to examine how parental encouragement for outdoor physical activity and parental role modeling for physical activity are associated with outdoor active play. An anonymous survey was completed by 514 parents of 7-12 year old children using FluidSurveysTM online survey software. The survey assessed outdoor active play frequency, parental encouragement for outdoor active play, and parental role modeling for physical activity. The survey also included items that assessed child and family demographics, other factors of parental influence (eg, independent mobility, facilitation, involvement), and neighbourhood factors such as perceptions of road safety and crime risk.&#xD;
A key result of this thesis is that parental encouragement for outdoor play was strongly associated with outdoor active play. After adjusting for confounding variables, children who received the most parental encouragement engaged in outdoor active play nearly three times more often than children who received the lowest amount of encouragement (5-6 times per week or more vs. 1-2 times per week or less). Parental role modeling for physical activity was weakly associated with outdoor play after controlling for confounders as there was a 2.3 unit difference in outdoor active play frequency scores across parental modeling quintiles. A parental sex by role modeling interaction was found indicating that only mothers’ role modeling was positively associated with outdoor active play.&#xD;
	These findings suggest ways that parents can promote their children’s outdoor active play, particularly by encouraging this behaviour. This work could inform future public health interventions aimed at increasing outdoor active play participation among 7-12 year old children.</dcterms:abstract>
