      <dcterms:abstract>During the 2010-11 school year, KFL&amp;A Public Health partnered with Lancaster Drive Public School (LDPS) to develop and implement a Walking School Bus Program (WSBP). This study was designed as a pre-test post-test study to explore parental concerns and attitudes towards their children’s use of active transportation and the WSBP, perceptions of the social and built environment, and how these may be associated with parental willingness to allow their children to participate in the WSBP.  However, a low response rate did not allow comparisons of pre- and post-test results. Therefore, this thesis uses the pre-test data as a pilot study to evaluate the methods, tools, and feasibility of a future, multi-school pre-and post-test study.  &#xD;
As part of the pilot study, a questionnaire was developed and administered to 298 households. Parental willingness was assessed using one item rated on a 10-point scale. Concerns and attitudes were assessed from similar scales developed for this study. Social environment perceptions were measured using a neighbourhood collective efficacy scale and a name generator/interpreter social network instrument. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association of parental willingness with the aforementioned variables. &#xD;
Fifty parents participated, which may have contributed to low power to detect associations. However, even with low power, attitudes of parents whose children had already used active transportation to school were found to be significantly associated with willingness when contrasting high and low levels (OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.02-2.54). This association did not appear in parents of children who used inactive transportation. Significant correlations were seen between parental willingness and compositional aspects of parental social network ties, i.e., having ties to individuals of diverse ages (τ=0.271) and having ties to individuals with children of the same age as their own (τ=0.267). Qualitative analyses of concerns revealed sub-themes related to the traffic, the need to cross a street, and the need for a suitable place to walk and bicycle, as well as concerns about the WSBP.  KFL&amp;A Public Health, LDPS, and Kingston’s City Traffic Engineers can use these results to address barriers to the WSBP and to advocate for improvements in the community infrastructure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to perform a scoping review of the current literature and available clinical practice guidelines to generate an understanding of the primary health care needs of women following treatment for breast cancer. &#xD;
Methods: Based on an extensive scoping review of the literature, research findings regarding the complications of breast cancer treatments and corresponding primary care interventions were synthesized. Additionally, validation of the findings of the scoping review was performed through semi-structured interviews with two primary care physicians and three post-treatment breast cancer patients. &#xD;
Results: Eleven broad categories related to the primary health care needs of women after undergoing treatments for breast cancer were identified. These included concerns related to: surgical complications, lymphedema, gynecologic and menopausal symptoms, psychosocial issues, additional primary cancers, cardiovascular implications, osteoporosis, lifestyle changes, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and pregnancy. Additionally, it was determined that the majority of existing clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer were outdated, and related to cancer detection and treatment as opposed to survivorship care. &#xD;
&#xD;
Summary: Findings from the scoping review and interviews demonstrate the vast range of primary care needs of women after undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Additionally, these results highlight the critical need for the development of a comprehensive set of current clinical practice guidelines which target primary care physicians and are specifically focused on the survivorship needs of women following breast cancer treatment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Heavy fuel oils (HFO) are produced from the refining of crude oils, and have high&#xD;
specific gravities and high viscosities. In recent years, spills of HFO have increased in the environment, and are of great concern because they are difficult to clean up. Spilled HFO is likely to become submerged, and can become stranded if fresh HFO coats benthic substrates or if weathered HFO sinks as tarballs. Conversely, lighter oils float on the surface and their components disperse and become diluted in the water column. There is a research need to assess the unique ecological risks of HFO that can sink and contaminate spawning shoals of fish. Chronic toxicity of HFO to fish embryos is&#xD;
correlated with exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) that become&#xD;
bioavailable from spilled HFO to identify under which spill conditions fish populations&#xD;
are at greatest risk. The results of this research demonstrate that: (1) Stranded HFO is a significant source of PAH to the receiving environment and causes chronic toxicity to embryonic fish; (2) Tarballs and weathered HFO cause less toxicity than fresh HFO, likely a consequence of physical limitations to PAH release; (3) HFO 7102 samples collected from an HFO spill in Wabamun Lake, Alberta, are less toxic than HFO 6303; (4) HFO is at least 2-fold more toxic than Medium South American (MESA), a well-studied reference crude oil, coincident with 3-fold higher concentrations of alkyl PAH, namely alkyl phenanthrenes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Tandem source-channel coding is proven to be optimal by Shannon given unlimited&#xD;
delay and complexity in the coders. Under low delay and low complexity constraints,&#xD;
joint source-channel coding may achieve better performance. Although digital joint&#xD;
source-channel coding has shown a noticeable gain in terms of reconstructed signal&#xD;
quality, coding delay, and complexity, it suffers from the leveling-off effect. However, analog systems do not suffer from the leveling-off effect. In this thesis, we investigate the advantage of analog systems based on the Shannon-Kotel’nikov approach and&#xD;
hybrid digital-analog coding systems, which combine digital and analog schemes to achieve a graceful degradation/improvement over a wide range of channel conditions.&#xD;
First, we propose a low delay and low complexity hybrid digital-analog coding that is able to achieve high (integer) expansion ratios (  &gt;3). This is achieved by combining&#xD;
the spiral mapping with multiple stage quantizers. The system is simulated for a 1 : 3 bandwidth expansion and the behavior for a 1 : M (with M an integer  &gt;3) system is studied in the low noise level regime.&#xD;
Next, we propose an analog joint source-channel coding system that is able to achieve&#xD;
a low (fractional) expansion ratio between 1 and 2. More precisely, this is an N : M&#xD;
bandwidth expansion system based on combining uncoded transmission and a 1 : 2 bandwidth expansion system (with N &lt; M &lt; 2N).Finally, a 1 : 2 analog bandwidth expansion system using the (Shannon-Kotel’nikov) Archimedes’ spiral mapping is used in the compressed sensing context, which is inherently analog, to increase the system’s immunity against channel noise. The proposed system is compared to a conventional compressed sensing system that assumes noiseless transmission and a compressed sensing based system that account for noise during signal reconstruction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this study was to examine the effect of heat on the growth of a biofilm in a parallel glass plate fracture table.    Groundwater was collected from a limestone aquifer and amended with a nutrient mixture to stimulate the indigenous microbial population.  The amended water was heated to approximately 30oC in an upgradient reservoir attached to the fracture table and recirculated through the 2-m long, 0.6-m wide, parallel glass plate fracture having an approximate fracture aperture of 2000 μm.  The fracture was maintained at approximately 10oC to simulate natural in situ groundwater temperature and the upgradient reservoir maintained at 30oC.  Geochemical parameters and bacterial counts were measured regularly throughout the biostimulation to monitor biofilm growth in the fracture.  Hydraulic tests and tracer experiments completed before and after the biostimulation were used as the primary indicators of the successful bioclogging of the fracture. &#xD;
Geochemical parameters measured throughout the trial revealed an increasingly reducing environment capable of supporting the development of a diverse biofilm.   Direct and indirect bacterial counts revealed the dominant bacteria within the system included common groundwater bacteria pseudonomads, enteric, and slime-forming bacteria.  Heterotrophic bacteria were also present in significant concentrations.  Visible clusters of biofilm were observed on Day 2 of the trial with a fully-connected biofilm observed by Day 7.  &#xD;
The biofilm impacted the groundwater flow through the fracture resulting in an approximately 2.75-hour delay in the tracer’s breakthrough during the tracer experiment completed on Day 13 of the trial compared to an experiment conducted during the initial stages of biofilm development.  Based on the results of the tracer experiment, the biofilm growth reduced the velocity of the groundwater by 9.8%, the fracture aperture by 37.8%, and increased the bulk dispersivity to 50mm.   Recommendations for future work include the application of heated biostimulation at the field scale in a well-characterized, isolated fracture.  &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: To primarily determine the effect of ziprasidone augmentation therapy on sleep architecture, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM), in the treatment of bipolar depression.  Secondarily, to determine the effect of ziprasidone augmentation treatment on clinical measures of subjective sleep quality and illness severity.  Finally, to examine the correlation between change in sleep architecture and change in clinical measures.&#xD;
Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. 14 patients with bipolar disorder currently experiencing a major depressive episode were included.  Patients were on a stable medication regime for 4 weeks prior to study enrollment and throughout the study.  Sleep architecture was measured by overnight, ambulatory polysomnography.  Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a visual analogue scale.  Illness severity was determined using the 17 item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S).  Polysomnographs and clinical measures were administered at baseline, after 2-5 days and after 28-31 days of treatment.  &#xD;
Results:  There was no significant difference between ziprasidone and placebo treated groups on age, gender, diagnosis, education level, employment or marital status and number of children.  Duration of SWS, latency to REM, duration of stage 2 sleep, total sleep time, onset to sleep latency, sleep efficiency and number of awakenings significantly improved in ziprasidone treated participants over placebo, whereas duration of REM sleep did not.  CGI-S and HAMA scores were significantly improved with ziprasidone treatment.  No significant difference between treatment groups was seen on the HAMD-17 and MADRS or in self-reported sleep quality.  Change in REM sleep significantly correlated to change in subjective sleep quality in the ziprasidone group. &#xD;
Conclusion: Ziprasidone augmentation treatment in bipolar depression improves SWS duration, REM latency, and sleep continuity while also having a beneficial effect on overall illness severity and anxiety symptoms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fission yeast Srk1 kinase is essential for cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. It is activated downstream of the MAPK Spc1 and participates in controlling mitotic entry by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting Cdc25 phosphatase during the normal cell cycle and also in response to osmotic stress. Following phosphorylation, Cdc25 is exported out of the nucleus. Heat stress caused by a temperature shift from 25°C to 36°C, which is within the normal temperature tolerance of fission yeast, temporarily inhibits nuclear division in wildtype cells. The same response is seen in cells deleted for the Pyp1 and Pyp2 phosphatases which normally serve to down regulate the Spc1 stress response. I have shown that the transient block in nuclear division caused by temperature shifts within the physiological range does not occur in srk1- cells but instead there is a stimulation of mitosis and cell division in response to the heat stress. This pattern of mitotic stimulation is phenocopied in cdc25-9a cells where nine putative Srk1 phosphorylation sites on Cdc25 are changed to alanine. Cells lacking srk1, however, display the same cell cycle progression pattern as the wildtype cells in response to osmotic stress. This experiment clearly distinguishes separate pathways for these two stress responses. Also, Cdc25 is found to be phosphorylated after a mild heat stress and seems to be exported out of the nucleus. These data indicate that Srk1 kinase plays the central role in regulating mitotic entry in response to mild heat stress by negatively regulating the Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase. Thus my work highlights the role of Srk1 kinase in cell cycle regulation and is consistent with the Spc1 MAPK cascade linking the G2/M transition to extracellular stress. This response to mild heat stress is important because temperature sensitive mutants are frequently used in fission yeast research and this work shows that a temperature shift from 25°C to 36°C, which is within the physiological growth range, can trigger a stress response.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abdominal pain is a common symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the extent differs, visceral inflammation is thought to play a significant role in nociception in these disorders. This thesis describes studies examining mechanisms of inflammation-induced changes in nociceptive signaling from the colon using human colonic biopsy and animal models of the conditions. &#xD;
Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice produced profound colitis at day 10 post-infection which resolved by day 30. Perforated current clamp recordings showed that inflammation induced hyperexcitability of colonic DRG neurons that persisted at day 30 post-infection. Similarly, multi-unit afferent nerve recordings revealed enhanced firing of colonic afferents following colon distension at this time. In voltage clamp studies, suppression of IA K+ currents in post-infected C. rodentium neurons was observed. Combining water-avoidance stress (WAS) and C. rodentium infection exaggerated these effects. Interactions between proteases and stress mediators underlie these actions. In vivo studies revealed WAS combined with C. rodentium post-infection induced visceral hyperalgesia and allodynia.&#xD;
A separate series of studies examined the possible role of cysteine proteases in post-infectious IBS.  The cysteine protease cathepsin-s (Cat-S) induced neuronal excitability and, provoked visceral hypersensitivity in mice. Human IBS supernatants increased neuronal excitability, but this was reversed in neurons pre-treated with the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64. Together these data suggest that Cat-S is a secreted neuromodulator in human IBS supernatants and could be important in nociceptive signaling in IBS.&#xD;
In studies examining whether similar mechanisms operate in a traditional inflammatory condition, IBD, human ulcerative colitis (UC) supernatants showed elevated TNF-α levels. Exogenous TNF-α and UC-supernatants increased colonic nociceptor excitability, which was attenuated in neurons from TNFR knock-out animals. TNF-α and UC-supernatants both increased TTX-R Nav1.8 and suppressed IA and IK K+ currents. &#xD;
Together these results suggest that inflammation significantly increases and sustains peripheral nociceptive signaling in IBD and IBS.  These effects involve changes in the properties of nociceptive DRG neurons through actions of specific secreted factors which modulate specific voltage-gated ion channels. Chronic stress exaggerates these changes through synergistic actions of stress hormones and local mediators, suggesting an interplay between central and peripheral mechanisms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Permafrost disturbances, including active layer detachments (ALDs), have occurred both recently and historically at Cape Bounty, Melville Island. These recent and relict ALDs were studied to determine their short- and long-term landscape effects. Six relict detachments showed altered vegetation and site characteristics, despite 60 or more years of recovery. Of the environmental variables studied, including soil moisture, soil temperature, and active layer depth, soil moisture showed the greatest changes in disturbed zones. These were attributed to the concavity of disturbance, which allows for more snow accumulation. Two vegetation types influenced by moisture regimes, polar desert and mesic heath, were compared to determine the role of moisture in recovery.&#xD;
The best indicators of disturbance differed in areas of different moisture regimes, with canopy height showing increases in disturbed mesic heath zones, while Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values increased in polar desert disturbances.&#xD;
Ultimately, the comparison of vegetation in disturbed and undisturbed zones revealed differences to be highly localized and minimal. Remote sensing was utilized to compare the effects of recent and relict disturbances as seen on satellite and airborne imagery. Vegetation was classified using NDVI, and zonal separation of these values in ALDs revealed the upper scar areas and lower toe zones contained significantly different NDVI values. The upper scar values were similar to undisturbed control areas, as blocks of vegetation in these areas often contain unmodified vegetation, which later helps with revegetation. The lower toe zone displayed both elevated and lower NDVI values, as material accumulates in these areas but often in a complex with bare soil. Remote sensing techniques also allowed for site characterization of disturbances, with physiographic factors including slope and flow properties determined through satellite imagery. Slope values ranged from 3 to 13 degrees in each disturbance, but were found to be slightly lower in relict disturbances, as recovery and revegetation have reduced these slopes. Flow paths were identified in ALDs, however similar patterns were also identified in surrounding undisturbed landscapes. Given the small scale of many ALDs, it is difficult to characterize the nature of the changes associated with these events, particularly for relict ALDs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The generation of a functional nervous system requires that neuronal cells and axons navigate precisely to their appropriate targets. The Eph Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and their ephrin ligands have emerged as one of the important guidance cues for neuronal and axon navigation. However, the molecular mechanisms of how Eph RTKs regulate these processes are still incomplete. The purpose of this work was to contribute to the understanding of how Eph receptors regulate axon guidance by identifying and characterizing components of the Caenorhabditis elegans Eph RTK (VAB-1) signaling pathway. To achieve this objective I utilized a hyper active form of the VAB-1 Eph RTK (MYR-VAB-1) that caused penetrant axon guidance defects in the PLM mechanosensory neurons, and screened for suppressors of the MYR-VAB-1 phenotype. Through a candidate gene approach, I identified the adaptor NCK-1 as a downstream effector of VAB-1. Molecular and genetic analysis revealed that the nck-1 gene encodes for two isoforms (NCK-1A and NCK-1B) that share similar expression patterns in parts of the nervous system, but also have independent expression patterns in other tissues. Genetic rescue experiments showed that both NCK-1 isoforms can function in axon guidance, but each isoform also has specific functions. In vitro binding assays showed that NCK-1 binds to VAB-1 in a kinase dependent manner. In addition to NCK-1, WSP-1/N-WASP was also identified as an effector of VAB-1 signaling. Phenotypic analysis showed that nck-1 and wsp-1 mutants had PLM axon over extension defects similar to vab-1 animals. Furthermore, VAB-1, NCK-1 and WSP-1 formed a complex in vitro. Intriguingly, protein binding assays showed that NCK-1 can also bind to the actin regulator UNC-34/Ena, but genetic experiments suggest that unc-34 is an inhibitor of nck-1 function. Through various genetic and biochemical experiments, I provide evidence that VAB-1 can disrupt the NCK-1/UNC-34 complex, and negatively regulate UNC-34. Taken together, my work provides a model of how VAB-1 RTK signaling can inhibit axon extension. I propose that activated VAB-1 can prevent axon extension by inhibiting growth cone filopodia formation. This is accomplished by inhibiting UNC-34/Ena activity, and simultaneously activating Arp2/3 through a VAB-1/NCK-1/WSP-1 complex.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr) that is important for cardiac repolarization. Previously, we have discovered that hERG channels rapidly internalize in low extracellular K+ ([K+]o). In cell culture, this process is driven by the endocytic protein, caveolin-1 (Cav1), which is an integral player in the caveolae-dependant endocytosis pathway. However, in the heart, Caveolin-3 (Cav3) is, in fact, the predominant form in the myocyte, and thus may play a direct role in regulating hERG expression in the heart. Thus, I hypothesize that this reduction of hERG conductance in cardiac myocytes derives from the presence of Cav3, which is integral regulator of hERG homeostasis innately in the heart. To investigate the effect of Cav3 on hERG, I overexpressed Cav3 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells stably expressing hERG channels. Cav3 overexpression significantly and specifically decreased both the hERG current amplitude and the mature channel expression in normal culture conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis and confocal imaging demonstrated an association between hERG and Cav3 in HEK cells as well as rat and rabbit cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, I discovered that Cav3 possesses a faster turnover rate compared to Cav1, and can enhance hERG degradation through up-regulating mature channel ubiquitination via the ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4-2. Knockdown of Cav3 in neonatal cardiac myocytes also enhanced hERG expression. My data indicate that Cav3 participates in hERG trafficking, and is an important regulator of hERG channel homeostasis in cardiac myocytes. This information provides a platform for future intervention of the hERG-induced type-2 long QT syndrome (LQTS).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>What is the measure of the effectiveness of corporate governance? What is the relationship between corporate governance and performance? This thesis sheds light on these questions by examining the consequences of two kinds of corporate governance monitoring mechanisms, religion as an external mechanism and independent directors as an internal mechanism. &#xD;
            Though recent work in finance and accounting provide evidence that religion is an effective external monitoring mechanism, whether it has pricing effects has yet to be examined. I explore this issue by investigating the relation between the degree of religiosity surrounding a firm’s headquarters and the firm’s cost of equity capital in Chapter 2. I find that firms located in more religious counties of the U.S. exhibit a lower cost of equity capital. The effects are also more pronounced for firms and during periods lacking alternative regulation mechanisms. Finally, I find that the effects of religion on the firm’s cost of equity capital are more pronounced for firms with greater information asymmetry.&#xD;
           The second part of my thesis is motivated by the considerable debate on whether board independence is an effective internal monitoring mechanism. I offer a new perspective by examining the relationship between firm risk and board independence. I find that board independence is associated with a significantly lower level of idiosyncratic risk. Further tests suggest that firms’ idiosyncratic risk is negatively related to the independence of audit committees and nominating committees, but positively related to the independence of compensation committees. In addition, I find that firms with greater board independence display lower degrees of operating risk exposure, and are less prone to stock price crashes.            &#xD;
            My thesis makes several important contributions to the literature. First, my thesis shows that studying the important social factors that influence different agents and determine the deeds of collective groups may be important for corporate governance research and practice. Furthermore, my results provide robust evidence supporting the view that religion facilitates economic development. Finally, my findings provide an explanation for the insignificant relationship between board independence and firm performance documented by recent literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with atrial enlargement in response to high arterial and pulmonary pressures and increased sympathetic tone. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment for OSA; its impact on atrial electrical remodeling has not been investigated however. Signal-averaged p-wave (SAPW) is a non-invasive quantitative method to determine p-wave duration, an accepted marker for atrial electrical remodeling. The objective was to determine whether CPAP induces reverse atrial electrical remodeling in patients with severe OSA.&#xD;
Methods: Prospective study in consecutive patients attending the Sleep Clinic at Kingston General Hospital. All patients underwent full polysomnography. OSA-negative and severe OSA were defined as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt; 5 events/hour and AHI ≥ 30 events/hour, respectively. In severe OSA patients, SAPW was determined pre- and post-intervention with CPAP for 4 - 6 weeks. In OSA-negative controls, SAPW was recorded at baseline and 4 - 6 weeks thereafter without any intervention.&#xD;
Results: A total of 19 severe OSA patients and 10 controls were included in the analysis. Mean AHI and minimum O2 saturation were 41.4 ± 10.1 events/hour and 80.5 ± 6.5% in severe OSA patients and 2.8 ± 1.2 events/hour and 91.4 ± 2.1% in controls. Baseline BMI was different between severe OSA patients and controls (34.3 ± 5.4 vs 26.6 ± 4.6 kg/m2; p &lt; 0.001). At baseline, severe OSA patients had a greater SAPW duration than controls (131.9 ± 10.4 vs 122.8 ± 10.5 ms; p = 0.02). After CPAP intervention, there was a significant reduction of SAPW duration in severe OSA (131.9 ± 10.4 to 126.2 ± 8.8 ms; p &lt; 0.001). In controls, SAPW duration did not change within 4 - 6 weeks.&#xD;
Conclusion: CPAP induced reverse atrial electrical remodeling in patients with severe OSA as represented by a significant reduction in SAPW duration.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (WRDB), located in the boreal forest region of Canada, is a pivotal region of focus for the assessment of water availability to determine susceptibility to drought in the past. To date, there have been relatively few paleolimnological studies focusing on how lake levels have changed in the past and whether these changes have been synchronous in the WRDB. This study investigates temporal patterns in effective moisture from Little Raleigh Lake over the last two millennia. Analyses are based on diatoms from two near-shore sediment cores from different locations and water depth in Little Raleigh Lake. Changes in diatom assemblages are used to reconstruct quantitative estimates of effective moisture in the past through the calibration of a diatom-inferred depth model developed from diatom assemblages in surficial sediments along a depth transect in Little Raleigh Lake. Declines of ~1-3m occurred during the late Holocene, with prolonged periods of aridity consistent with the timing of the Medieval Climate Anamoly (~950-1250AD) and the Little Ice Age (~1650-1750AD).  The nearshore core retrieved closer to the present-day ecotone between the benthic and planktonic diatom assemblages was more sensitive to tracking water level changes in the lake than the deeper core. Conditions during the last two millennia can be used for the assessment of water availability in the past, and may offer insight on future conditions under increasing temperatures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the literacy-related professional development preferences of participating secondary teachers in one school board in Ontario. Data was collected using a survey. The findings of this study confirm and extend existing research: the majority of secondary teachers want to engage in literacy-related professional development; secondary teachers have preferences for various forms of professional development, including duration and form; there are differences in preferences for duration, form, and content of teachers in different subject areas; and differences exist in preferences for form and content of teachers of different course types. The findings of this study that confirmed existing research included: the preferences by teachers of Science and Geography for literacy-related professional development on instruction of reading graphical text; the preference for literacy-related professional development by teachers of Math on reading word problems; the preference for literacy-related professional development that results in practical ideas and strategies; and the preference for literacy-related professional development that meets the needs of teachers and students. Interesting themes emerged that extend previous research: the preference for literacy-related professional development that is short in duration (between one to five hours); a higher percentage of teachers of Science, Math, and Technology wanting no literacy-related professional development; the preference by teachers of Open type courses for literacy-related professional development on differentiating literacy instruction; and a stronger focus on the content (as opposed to a focus on form) of literacy-related professional development by teachers of Science, Math, and Technology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective The primary objective of this study was two-fold. First, to determine whether incidental physical activity (IPA), which is composed of both light-intensity physical activity (LPA) and sporadic moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA; physical activity accrued in bouts less than 10 minutes), was associated with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Second, to determine whether sporadic MPA was associated with CRF. &#xD;
Methods Participants were abdominally obese (defined as a waist circumference &gt; 102 cm in men and &gt; 88 cm in women), inactive, adult men (N = 24; [mean ± SD] age = 55.5 ± 7.8 years) and women (N = 55; age = 52.3 ± 7.5 years) recruited from Kingston, Canada. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a graded treadmill test. IPA (activity ≥ 1 metabolic equivalent (MET)) and sporadic MPA (activity ≥ 3 METs accrued in bouts less than 10 minutes) was measured using the SenseWear Pro Armband (SWA). IPA and sporadic MPA were categorized into duration (minutes/day) and expenditure (MET-minutes/day). In secondary analyses, we investigated the association between LPA (activity between 1 – 2.99 METs), sedentary behaviour (SED; activity &lt; 1.0 MET) and CRF. &#xD;
Results Participants accumulated an average of 326.6 ± 127 minutes of IPA per day which was composed of 40.7 ± 17.8 minutes of sporadic MPA and 285.9 ± 118.2 minutes of LPA. Both duration and expenditure of IPA were significantly associated with CRF independent of sex, however, after further control for body mass index and age neither association remained significant (p &gt; 0.05). Sporadic MPA was significantly associated with CRF after control for covariates (p ≤ 0.05). Neither LPA nor SED were associated with CRF after control for covariates (p &gt; 0.05).   &#xD;
Conclusions IPA was not significantly associated with CRF, however, sporadic MPA was an independent predictor of CRF.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Landfill facilities are required to have a barrier system that will limit escape of contaminants to groundwater and surface water for the contaminating lifespan of landfill. Heat generated by the biodegradation of waste and chemical reactions in landfills reduces the service-life of geomembranes by accelerating the ageing process of high-density polyethylene. It may also lead to the desiccation of clay components of the liners.  &#xD;
Four considerations with respect to the evaluation of the potential effects of liner temperature on the service-life of liners and the potential control of liner temperature are examined. For the first time, the likely temperature and service-life of a secondary geomembrane in a double composite lining system is predicted. It is shown that, in some cases, the temperature is likely to be high enough to substantially reduce the service-life of the secondary geomembrane. The possible effectiveness of using tire chips as passive thermal insulation between the primary and secondary liners, as well as traditional soil materials, is then explored. For the barrier system and contaminant examined, the results show that tire chips could potentially lower the temperature of the secondary geomembrane sufficiently to significantly extend its service-life. However, the use of tire chips brings about other practical issues, which are also discussed in this study. An active alternative method of controlling the increase in the landfill liner temperature is then examined.  This approach, which is inspired by geothermal heat pumps, involves an array of cooling pipes beneath the waste. Numerical modelling showed that the hypotetical introduction of the cooling pipes resulted in a reasonable decrease in liner temperature. It is suggested that the proposed technique warrants further consideration. Finally the conditions that may lead to the desiccation of geosynthetic clay liners used in composite liners due to waste generated heat are examined and recommendations regarding possible means of mitigating the effects of heat on the performance of GCLs are presented. For example, numerical modelling shows that the hydration of GCL prior to waste placement, liner temperature, overburden stress, depth to aquifer and moisture content and grain size of subsoil affect desiccation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spontaneous foetal loss is the most common complication of pregnancy, affecting up to 20% of recognized pregnancies and recurring in 1-3% of cases. Abnormal maternal inflammation and systemic maternal coagulopathies are associated with foetal loss; however, the causal role of inflammation in the development of obstetric coagulopathies has not been determined. Further, questions remain as to whether maternal systemic coagulopathies are associated with placental haemostatic alterations and what role these local alterations play in foetal outcome. &#xD;
&#xD;
We hypothesized that abnormal maternal inflammation during pregnancy is causally linked to maternal coagulopathies and that these coagulopathies are associated with impaired utero-placental blood flow preceding foetal death. To induce inflammation-mediated fetal death, we administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100-µg/kg) to Wistar rats on gestational day 14.5 and characterized the systemic maternal coagulation status 1hr post LPS administration using thromboelastograpy. Utero-placental haemostatic alterations were analyzed by periodic acid Schiff staining (PAS) and immunohistochemistry for fibrin/fibrinogen. Spiral arteriole peak flow velocity was determined by Doppler ultrasound. To determine causality between abnormal maternal inflammation, coagulopathies, and placental hemodynamics, the TNF -inhibitor etanercept (Enbrel®) was administered six hours prior to LPS administration. &#xD;
&#xD;
Systemic maternal coagulopathies were evident in 82% of LPS-treated dams and were associated with specific placental haemostatic alterations as well as reduced utero-placental blood flow. Etanercept administration prevented the development of systemic coagulopathies and placental haemostatic alterations. Furthermore, etanercept maintained normal spiral arteriole peak flow velocity. &#xD;
&#xD;
 This study demonstrated that abnormal maternal inflammation is causally linked to systemic coagulopathies specific to pregnancy. Moreover, we showed that inflammation-induced systemic coagulopathies are associated with placental haemostatic alterations and reduced utero-placental blood flow preceding foetal death. Modulation of maternal inflammation may thus be useful in the prevention of coagulopathies associated with complications of pregnancy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this research study was to profile exemplary rural music programs, examining how their components and contexts contributed to a deep sense of place for students, teachers, and the community. Using case-study methodology, two rural communities were profiled: Bella Coola, British Columbia and Winkler, Manitoba. By examining these programs through interview, observational, and questionnaire data, the conditions that support these programs and the perceptions of stakeholders were garnered in order to create a rich view of music education programs that could inform the development of high-quality music programs in other rural communities. Analysis procedures consisted of coding the data for emergent themes as well as a priori themes combed from music education curricula and place-based education literature. The analysis was guided by complexity thinking literature. Closed-ended questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Through this analysis process, a descriptive framework of the contents and context of the music programs was created. The adaptive and iterative nature of the music programs and how they related to the communities were also examined. Findings from this study revealed rich place-based music education general music programs, choral programs, and band programs that were highly regarded by the communities. Features in each music program were reflective of the musical practices in the communities. Developing place-based music programs also included the celebration of diversity and the incorporation of activities that broadened students’ musical experiences and allowed students to be leaders. The extent to which diverse types of music could be incorporated into the music programs was dependent on the teachers’ background and available resources. Performances were an important aspect of these place-based programs as attending students’ performances served as one of the only times that community residents interacted with the school, and for many, these performances were the only source of live music. Performing at other local and provincial music events strengthened students’ musical understanding and also deepened their connections to the respective communities. Students were part of their communities, and they were actively able to participate in the present in a way that honoured the past and brightened the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ be a non-zero integer.  Let $p$ be a prime such that $p \nmid a$.  Define the index of $a$ modulo $p$, denoted $i_{a}(p)$, to be the integer $i_{a}(p) := [(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\ast}:\langle a \bmod{p} \rangle]$.  Let $N_{a}(x) := \#\{p \le x:i_{a}(p)=1\}$.  In 1927, Emil Artin conjectured that&#xD;
\begin{equation*}&#xD;
N_{a}(x) \sim A(a)\pi(x)&#xD;
\end{equation*}&#xD;
where $A(a)&gt;0$ is a constant dependent only on $a$ and $\pi(x):=\{p \le x: p\text{ prime}\}$.  Rewrite $N_{a}(x)$ as follows:&#xD;
\begin{equation*}&#xD;
N_{a}(x) = \sum_{p \le x} f(i_{a}(p)),&#xD;
\end{equation*}&#xD;
where $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$ with $f(1)=1$ and $f(n)=0$ for all $n \ge 2$.\\&#xD;
\indent We examine which other functions $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$ will give us formul\ae&#xD;
\begin{equation*}&#xD;
\sum_{p \le x} f(i_{a}(p)) \sim c_{a}\pi(x),&#xD;
\end{equation*}&#xD;
where $c_{a}$ is a constant dependent only on $a$.\\&#xD;
\indent Define $\omega(n) := \#\{p|n:p \text{ prime}\}$, $\Omega(n) := \#\{d|n:d \text{ is a prime power}\}$ and $d(n):=\{d|n:d \in \mathbb{N}\}$. We will prove&#xD;
\begin{align*}&#xD;
\sum_{p \le x} (\log(i_{a}(p)))^{\alpha} &amp;= c_{a}\pi(x)+O\left(\frac{x}{(\log x)^{2-\alpha-\varepsilon}}\right) \\&#xD;
\sum_{p \le x} \omega(i_{a}(p)) &amp;= c_{a}^{\prime}\pi(x)+O\left(\frac{x\log \log x}{(\log x)^{2}}\right) \\&#xD;
\sum_{p \le x} \Omega(i_{a}(p)) &amp;= c_{a}^{\prime\prime}\pi(x)+O\left(\frac{x\log \log x}{(\log x)^{2}}\right)&#xD;
\end{align*}&#xD;
and&#xD;
\begin{equation*}&#xD;
\sum_{p \le x} d(i_{a}) = c_{a}^{\prime\prime\prime}\pi(x)+O\left(\frac{x}{(\log x)^{2-\varepsilon}}\right)&#xD;
\end{equation*}&#xD;
for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$.\\&#xD;
\indent We also extend these results to finitely-generated subgroups of $\mathbb{Q}^{\ast}$ and $E(\mathbb{Q})$ where $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The schedule of growth, reproduction and survivorship of an individual are the key components of life history, which reflect fitness performance of a genotype. Examining the variation in life history performance among genotypes provides an avenue for which genotypic fitness differences can be compared. The parthenogenetic freshwater zooplankton, Daphnia pulicaria, is a model organism to investigate and disentangle the genotypic from the phenotypic influences of life history variation. While Daphnia spp. life history has been extensively studied, few have examined the effect of low food concentrations on life history traits. Since Daphnia spp. are frequently subjected to periods food limitation caused by natural phytoplankton cycles, it is necessary to understand how individuals respond in low food environments in order to obtain an accurate representation of life history responses among genotypes. In this study, I conducted a set of highly controlled laboratory experiments using multiple genotypes of Daphnia pulicaria under a range of food-limited conditions in order to gain insight into the environmental and genotypic responses of life history traits. I measured a suite of life history traits, growth, reproduction and survivorship, as discrete elements for each individual and synthesized these traits into a representation of the life history schedule. This provided an accurate method to compare genotypes and allowed for identification of trade-offs between life history traits. My results indicate a significant effect of low food concentration on life history traits, causing a decrease in performance of all traits. Additionally, genotypic differences occurred in most traits, however these differences only manifested within the intermediate food levels. There were no genotypic differences in daily reproductive rate, indicating that genotypes only differ in the number of individuals reproducing within an environment. Allocation-based trade-offs among these life history traits were examined within a genotype, however the only trade-off identified was between reproduction and survivorship and this only manifested at low food levels. Even though these genotypes do not co-exist in the same lakes, similar patterns occurred in trade-offs among genotypes. This potentially indicates that trade-offs among genotypes occur due to the same physiological mechanisms witnessed at the individual level.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My dissertation explores the enabling contributions of love to the practice of ethico-political and cultural critique. Engaging with the work of Alain Badiou, Simone Weil, Erich Fromm, and Roland Barthes, I examine love in terms of the following modalities: waiting, giving, and looking. I place the aforementioned thinkers in dialogue with selected literary and cinematic texts to explicate and interrogate the meaningful possibilities of their discourse on love. In my chapter on Alain Badiou, I discuss his ontology, which I draw upon heavily to set the theoretical parameters of my study. I also discuss the logic of love that he develops in his philosophy. Speaking to the problem of pre-Evental agency that critics of his work identify, I suggest that waiting as attention, as theorized by Simone Weil, might be the closest form of agency that a pre-Evental (amorous) being can experience. In my discussion of Erich Fromm, I reevaluate his “art of loving” within the constellation of late capitalism. Reading his work through a Lacanian lens, I explore the utility of his prescriptions by examining Chuck Palahniuk’s controversial novel Fight Club. In my chapter on Roland Barthes, I theorize the possibility of cinematic looking that does not depend on the antagonism inherent in the binaries masculine/ feminine and (Gazing) spectator/ (to-be-looked-at) image. Towards this objective, I propose the “amorous look,” a mode of viewing occasioned by cinematic punctual encounters, that I contend is beyond the domain of desire and perversion. I deploy the “amorous look” as I reflect on Aureus Solito’s film Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Olivares (The Blossoming of Maximo Olivares) and its representations of love and waiting.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis is the study of the control of the shape of formamidine motifs and application to folding open-ended structures and more elaborate macrocycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
The multi-step synthesis of macrocycles M1 and M2, which are analogs of 18-crown ether-6, have been successfully achieved. Macrocycles M1 and M2 have been fully characterized. The study of the crystal structures of M1 and M2 gave interesting information about their packing and molecular recognition properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
Moreover, analysis of some by-products formed in macrocyclizations gave intriguing results. The existence of a four-pyridine-unit interlocked catenane which was isolated from the synthesis of M1 has been confirmed by MS-MS. A surprisingly large 54-membered macrocycle “Maxi-M2” was isolated from the synthetic crude product of M2 and confirmed by X-ray crystallography. &#xD;
&#xD;
Driven by the desire to understand the formation of catenane and “Maxi-M2”, a systematic study of the corresponding condensation reaction was performed. The E isomers derived from N-acyl-N’-substituted formamidoximes were, for the first time, reported and isolated. The protons can facilitate E to Z isomerization. The best conditions to selectively generate either the E or Z isomers have been fully studied and applied to the synthesis. &#xD;
&#xD;
The unexpected formation of the E isomers may promote polymerization and limit the yield improvement of macrocyclization. Therefore, a new synthetic method for the target macrocycle M2 was investigated, trying to avoid the formation of E isomers and thus cyclize more efficiently.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The standard theoretical account of transnational advocacy networks (TANs) is one of principled non-state actors remaking world politics by upsetting conventional notions of power in the international system.  Relying on persuasion and framing instead of disruption and protest, these global networks of activists, NGOs, scientists and technical experts transform states and their preferences by developing, promoting, and monitoring compliance with norms.  At the core of this literature is an implicit assumption of fixity in the moral commitments of TANs that galvanizes collective identity, sustains transnational mobilization, and ultimately allows them to leverage actors much more powerful than themselves.  By contrast, this dissertation develops a theory of “advocacy drift” based on a selection of transnational issue campaigns in the People’s Republic of China.  It argues that in state-dominated contexts with highly developed institutions of social control, immovable national interests sometimes exert transformative effects on the principled goals of activist campaigns or see the TAN incorporated into the state itself.  This finding not only suggests that authoritarian governments influence advocacy networks just as advocates can influence those governments, but that the preferences and identities of TANs are less static than previously thought, and may shift in response to exogenous environmental stimuli.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The main success of my thesis has been to establish the mechanism by which antifreeze&#xD;
proteins (AFPs) bind irreversibly to ice crystals, and hence prevent their growth. AFPs organize&#xD;
ice-like water on their ice-binding site, which then merges and freezes with the quasi-liquid layer&#xD;
of ice. This was revealed from studying the exceptionally large (ca. 1.5-MDa) Ca 2+-dependent&#xD;
AFP from the Antarctic bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis (MpAFP). The 34-kDa antifreeze-&#xD;
active region of MpAFP was predicted to fold as a novel Ca 2+-binding β-helix. Site-directed&#xD;
mutagenesis confirmed the model and demonstrated that its ice-binding site (IBS) consisted of&#xD;
solvent-exposed Thr and Asx parallel arrays on the Ca 2+-binding turns.&#xD;
The X-ray crystal&#xD;
structure of the antifreeze region was solved to a resolution of 1.7 Å. Two of the four molecules&#xD;
within the unit cell of the crystal had portions of their IBSs freely exposed to solvent. Identical&#xD;
clathrate-like cages of water molecules were present on each IBS. These waters were organized&#xD;
by the hydrophobic effect and anchored to the protein via hydrogen bonds. They matched the&#xD;
spacing of water molecules in an ice lattice, demonstrating that anchored clathrate waters bind&#xD;
AFPs to ice.&#xD;
This mechanism was extended to other AFPs including the globular type III AFP from&#xD;
fishes. Site-directed mutagenesis and a modified ice-etching technique demonstrated this protein&#xD;
uses a compound ice-binding site, comprised of two flat and relatively hydrophobic surfaces, to&#xD;
bind at least two planes of ice. Reinvestigation of several crystal structures of type III AFP&#xD;
identified anchored clathrate waters on the solvent-exposed portion of its compound IBS that&#xD;
matched the spacing of waters on the primary prism plane of ice.&#xD;
Ice nucleation proteins (INPs), which can raise the temperature at which ice forms in&#xD;
solution to just slightly below 0oC, have the opposite effect to AFPs. A novel dimeric β-helical&#xD;
model was proposed for the INP produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas borealis. Molecular&#xD;
dynamics simulations showed that INPs are also capable of ordering water molecules into an ice-&#xD;
like lattice. However, their multimerization brings together sufficient ordered waters to form an&#xD;
ice nucleus and initiate freezing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Crohn’s disease and Colitis, the two most common Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), are on the rise among young people. IBD symptoms include severe abdominal pain and frequent bowel movements, which can result in major dietary restrictions and delays in growth. IBD can also limit people’s physical activity, eating habits, and activities that are distant from a bathroom.  Having IBD can be both limiting and embarrassing but little research has investigated the social and emotional implications of these diseases from a qualitative approach. Existing research fails to identify how stigma and dominant IBD discourses affect the lived experiences of people with IBD, young people in particular. IBD can create additional challenges for adolescents because it is perceived to threaten their normal development into healthy adults. The purpose of this project is to investigate how being young complicates the already difficult experience of being ill. &#xD;
I conducted interviews with three young people and a discursive analysis of official IBD resources for adolescents and found almost no descriptions of the actual experience of illness. Participants who engaged in photo-elicited interviews minimized the physical and emotional repercussions of having IBD. Informational resources designed for youth failed to address the severe physical and emotional pain of Crohn’s and Colitis. Instead, the available resources provided saccharine and arguably unrealistic depictions of IBD that deny young people a forum to express their own struggles. I compare my analysis of the interviews and IBD resources with my own experience and experiences presented in a zine. Analysis of both the interviews and the IBD resources reveals that young people with IBD can experience an embodied disappearance. Their bodies are smaller and weak, they retreat from social situations to avoid embarrassment, and their emotions are denied because they have no forums to be expressive. Finally, young people can experience a compounded disappearance because they are treated not for who they are but for what they should become. I argue that enabling young people the opportunity to speak candidly about the social conditions that contribute to their struggles could help them better understand, negotiate, and express their illness experiences</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sympathetic catecholamines and co-transmitters released within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract provide dynamic regulation of gut motility, fluid secretion, blood flow and immune cell function. Pathological GI inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) evokes functional and structural plasticity in sympathetic neurons that innervate the gut, which may contribute to symptom generation. The mechanisms responsible for aberrant sympathetic behaviour during colonic inflammation remain elusive, though evidence points to a role for mediators of the mucosal immune response. Interleukin (IL)-17 is the principal cytokine of the novel TH17 lineage of helper T cells. Based on mounting clinical, genetic and experimental evidence, IL-17 is thought to play a pivotal role in the immunopathogenesis of IBD. However, nothing is known of the contribution of IL-17 to sympathetic neuroplasticity during chronic inflammatory disease. We hypothesized that remodelling of postganglionic sympathetic axons occurs in response to exposure of axons to the inflamed colonic milieu and that IL-17 serves as the primary mediator of this neuroanatomical remodelling.&#xD;
    An increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, a marker of sympathetic axons, was observed in the muscularis externae and mucosae of colons from mice subjected to acute and chronic models of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. In parallel, we found markedly elevated levels of IL-17 in the serum and colonic tissues of mice with colitis. To investigate whether the colitis microenvironment promoted axonal growth, distal neurites of adult sympathetic neurons from the superior mesenteric ganglion (SMG) were incubated in supernatant collected from explant cultures of inflamed colon. Colitis supernatant enhanced neurite outgrowth from gut-projecting SMG neurons compared to supernatants from control colon. Importantly, this effect was abrogated following the addition of IL-17-neutralising antiserum to cultures. Moreover, IL-17 increased the morphological complexity of SMG neurites in vitro while none of the other inflammatory cytokines known to be elevated during IBD had a similar effect. These findings suggest a novel role for IL-17 as a mediator of sympathetic neuroanatomical plasticity during colonic inflammation. Whether this contributes to the functional deficits and chronic inflammatory response that occurs in the GI tract during IBD remains to be determined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>OBJECTIVES: (1) Describe the population of mentally ill offenders over whom Ontario Review Board (ORB) held jurisdiction. (2) Assess the influences of psychopathology and criminal factors on criminal career.&#xD;
METHOD: This study was a retrospective case series design that reviewed all offenders who were court ordered for psychiatric evaluation at Mental Health Services Site of Providence Care in Kingston, Ontario from 1993 to 2007 (N=347). Eighty five subjects were found not criminally responsible on the account of mental disorder and were included in statistical analysis (n=85). Bivariate associations between five key variables and two outcome variables, seriousness of crime and recidivism, were examined. Logistic regressions were conducted to test the role of the predictor variables on the outcome variables.&#xD;
RESULTS: Age and change in principal psychiatric diagnosis over time were shown to be associated with seriousness of crime. Timing of psychiatric onset, early signs of deviance and change in diagnosis were shown to be associated with recidivism. On the whole, study population did not markedly vary in their distribution of variables by the outcome variables. Regression model included timing of psychiatric onset; psychiatric history; existence of criminal associate; child abuse history; and early signs of deviance. Recidivism was shown to be predicted by early signs of deviance (OR=8.154, p&lt;0.05). Existence of criminal associates was shown to have substantial values of odds ratio at marginal significance (OR=7.577, p=0.13).&#xD;
CONCLUSION: Seriousness of crime is a complex factor that could not be sufficiently predicted by any one or combinations of study variables. Recidivism is better predicted by criminality factors than psychopathology. In the future, an exploratory analysis that more broadly examines the psychopathology and criminal factors in Canadian forensic population is needed. Findings from this study have important clinical and legal implications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is about the increasing technologization of domestic spaces and the implications for human-technology sociality that are ‘built-into’ ICT-enabled domestic spaces and technologies. Its central focus is the socio-cultural development of the networked home in terms of convergences of and between humans and technologies throughout the twentieth century. The dissertation considers electricity, automobility, and the informationalization of domestic spaces as necessary conditions for the emergence of the contemporary networked home. Acknowledging the broader context of changes in capitalism, the dissertation focuses upon sociotechnical change represented within ordinary and popular visions of domestic spaces that circulated in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. To this end, it traces the long history of the networked home between 1906 and 2006 in two mass circulation magazines (and in appliance and home industry research materials between 1993 and 2008), and analyzes the advertisements, advice columns, and research reports contained therein. A framework drawn from social studies of technology, theories of the network society, and of consumption is used to address several broad questions: What are the implications of the scripted, built-in, and assumed characteristics of the relationships between humans and technologies in domestic spaces? What do these mean for the ways in which domestic spaces are configured? What lessons for the future of sociality between and among humans and technologies in and around domestic spaces might be taken from prior configurations? The hybrid sociality that is created by combinations of ICTs, domestic spaces and appliances, and human users relies upon ‘built-in’ scripts to function, layers of which – including the competences, skill sets, and preferred uses – become sedimented and help to facilitate the introduction, normalization, and domestication of novel technologies. By understanding how these built-in scripts have worked in technologized homes since 1906, this dissertation is an important step toward a sociological account of the next emerging trend in domestic technologies: those concerned with environmental sustainability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy has developed rapidly and is opening the door to new types of experiments. This work describes the development of new laser sources for CARS microscopy and their use for different applications. It is specifically focused on multimodal nonlinear optical microscopy—the simultaneous combination of different imaging techniques. This allows us to address a diverse range of applications, such as the study of biomaterials, fluid inclusions, atherosclerosis, hepatitis C infection in cells, and ice formation in cells. For these applications new laser sources are developed that allow for practical multimodal imaging. For example, it is shown that using a single Ti:sapphire oscillator with a photonic crystal fiber, it is possible to develop a versatile multimodal imaging system using optimally chirped laser pulses. This system can perform simultaneous two photon excited fluorescence, second harmonic generation, and CARS microscopy. The versatility of the system is further demonstrated by showing that it is possible to probe different Raman modes using CARS microscopy simply by changing a time delay between the excitation beams. Using optimally chirped pulses also enables further simplification of the laser system required by using a single fiber laser combined with nonlinear optical fibers to perform effective multimodal imaging. While these sources are useful for practical multimodal imaging, it is believed that for further improvements in CARS microscopy sensitivity, new excitation schemes are necessary. This has led to the design of a new, high power, extended cavity oscillator that should be capable of implementing new excitation schemes for CARS microscopy as well as other techniques. Our interest in multimodal imaging has led us to other areas of research as well. For example, a fiber-coupling scheme for signal collection in the forward direction is demonstrated that allows for fluorescence lifetime imaging without significant temporal distortion.  Also highlighted is an imaging artifact that is unique to CARS microscopy that can alter image interpretation, especially when using multimodal imaging. By combining expertise in nonlinear optics, laser development, fiber optics, and microscopy, we have developed systems and techniques that will be of benefit for multimodal CARS microscopy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I examine Ontario history textbooks to demonstrate how the portrayal of the white settler fantasy of Canada being peacefully colonized and settled is enforced through the temporality and geography of the Canadian settler state, leading to the erasure of connections between indigenous and black communities in the development of the settler state. The temporality of the settler state is enforced through the Indian Act and the Multiculturalism Act, which work together to deny shared time between indigenous peoples, black peoples, and settlers. Settlers are positioned as inhabiting the here and now as reflected in the temporality of the modern settler state, while indigenous peoples are consigned to a status of primitivity, and black peoples are positioned as hailing from a primitive place, yet recently arriving in Canada. The temporality of the Indian Act is represented geographically through the reserve system, which works within the Indian Act to replace indigenous sovereignty and nationhood with Indian Bands, while the temporality of the Multiculturalism Act is represented geographically through the image of Canada as a cultural mosaic, which enforces the divide-and-conquer strategies of the settler state. If indigenous peoples and black peoples are always positioned as temporally and spatially distant, then it follows that their histories developed discretely. However, through analyzing how, what Patrick Wolfe terms, a “logic of elimination” (105) is deployed within the Canadian settler state, it become clear that settler colonialism and transatlantic slavery have always been engaged in an intimate and mutually reinforcing relationship in Canada. By moving beyond the temporality and geography of the settler state, not only does it becomes clear that the connections between indigenous and black peoples are actually foundational to the Canadian settler state’s current formation, but space is also created to develop alliances between indigenous and black peoples. Developing alliances is integral to imagining a reconfiguration of the current settler state that moves beyond divide-and-conquer politics, and towards a more just way of organizing societies that takes seriously the flesh-and-blood of all individual subjects and the human species as whole (Wynter 47).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Our behaviour is guided by the ability to predict future events. The predictive saccade paradigm has been shown to be a valuable tool that uses eye movements to measure the control of predictive behaviour. In this task, subjects follow a visual target that alternates or “steps” between two fixed locations at either predictable or unpredictable inter-stimulus time intervals (ISIs). Response times can be measured by subtracting the time of saccade initiation from the time of target appearance. When the ISI is predictable, saccadic reaction times (SRTs) become predictive (SRT &lt;100ms) within 3-4 target steps, but when the ISI is unpredictable, the SRTs remain reactive to target appearance (SRT &gt;100ms). The goal of our study was to investigate neural mechanisms controlling prediction by contrasting areas in the brain that were more active for predictive (PRED) versus reactive (REACT) saccades in young healthy adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI analysis revealed two distinct neural networks more recruited for REACT and PRED tasks. We observed greater activation for the REACT task compared to the PRED task in oculomotor network areas including the frontal, supplementary, parietal eye fields, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and putamen. These structures are all involved with the control of saccades. We also observed greater activation for the PRED task compared to the REACT task in default network areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and hippocampus. These structures are known to be involved with passive thinking when subjects are not focused on their external environments. We also observed greater activation for the PRED task in the cerebellum (crus I), which may serve as the internal clock that drives the regular rhythmic behaviour observed for predictive saccades. In summary, our findings suggest brain activation in the PRED task reflects automated and motor-timed responses, while that for the REACT task reflects externally-driven responses. Therefore, the predictive saccade task is an excellent tool for measuring prediction involving fast internally-guided responses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this dissertation, I investigate three different issues related to signalling and price dynamics in mergers and acquisitions. The first issue is whether the act of raising capital signals an increase in takeover probability for a forthcoming target. Analysing target returns under event-study methodology, I find that this is indeed the case, as was initially pre-supposed by financial journalists. The second issue is whether the observed increase in target returns which are associated with the increase in takeover probability can be attributed to the actions of sophisticated traders, either via information leakage or through the adept analysis of publicly available information. An examination of price-volume dynamics reveals that investors incorporate the increased likelihood of a takeover attempt into target firm returns without necessarily resorting to illegal insider trading. The final issue is whether this public signal of raising capital impacts the target price runup and takeover premium in a meaningful way. Multivariate regression analysis reveals substantial support that raising capital close in proximity to the acquisition announcement date is associated with significant increases in both target firm returns as well as takeover premiums paid by acquiring firms. In sum, these three essays provide evidence which supports the notion that raising capital can act as both a statistically and economically significant signal to all market participants of a forthcoming takeover attempt.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Morrison has constructed a geometric relationship between K3 surfaces with large Picard number and abelian surfaces. In particular, this establishes that the period spaces of certain families of lattice polarized K3 surfaces (which are closely related to the moduli spaces of lattice polarized K3 surfaces) and lattice polarized abelian surfaces are identical. Therefore, we may study the moduli spaces of such K3 surfaces via the period spaces of abelian surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we will answer the following question: from the moduli space of abelian surfaces with endomorphism structure (either a Shimura curve or a Hilbert modular surface), there is a natural map into the moduli space of abelian surfaces, and hence into the period space of abelian surfaces. What sort of relationship exists between the moduli spaces of abelian surfaces with endomorphism structure and the moduli space of lattice polarized K3 surfaces? We will show that in many cases, the endomorphism ring of an abelian surface is just a subring of the Clifford algebra associated to the N\'eron-Severi lattice of the abelian surface. Furthermore, we establish a precise relationship between the moduli spaces of rank 18 polarized K3 surfaces and Hilbert modular surfaces, and between the moduli spaces of rank 19 polarized K3 surfaces and Shimura curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we will calculate the moduli space of E_8^2 + &lt;4&gt;-polarized K3 surfaces as a family of elliptic K3 surfaces in Weierstrass form and use this new family to find families of rank 18 and 19 polarized K3 surfaces which are related to abelian surfaces with real multiplication or quaternionic multipliction via the Shioda-Inose construction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>More than half of all cases of breast cancer occur among women without any known risk factors.  More research is needed on suspected risk factors in order to refine current breast cancer screening tools.  The objectives of this thesis were: to determine the breast cancer risk associated with known risk factors (ethnicity, family history, breast biopsy, age at menarche, age at first birth, alcohol, HRT, and BMI), suspected risk factors (smoking, second-hand smoke exposure, smoked/grilled foods, and NSAID use), and to examine the above associations according to tumour receptor status, histologic grade, and menopausal status, with potential confounders also considered.  This thesis project was conducted within the framework of the Molecular Epidemiology of Breast Cancer study, a case-control study of women in Vancouver, BC and Kingston, ON, with 1140 cases and 1169 controls recruited from 2005-2010.  Information was collected from a detailed questionnaire.&#xD;
       Cases and controls were similar in terms of age at menarche, age at first birth, smoking history, second-hand smoke exposure, lifetime smoked/grilled food consumption, HRT, and BMI.  Among cases, there were significantly less Europeans and more Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino subjects compared to controls.  Cases were more likely to have a first degree relative with breast cancer, as well as a previous benign breast biopsy.  Alcohol consumption and past NSAID usage was higher among controls.  The level of education completed was higher among controls.  Cases were also more likely to be postmenopausal.&#xD;
       Family history was associated with breast cancer risk (OR=1.59, CI=1.30-1.94), as was BMI (OR=1.28, CI=1.05-1.58 for overweight and OR=2.28, CI=1.35-3.86 for obese class II).  Second-hand smoke was also found to be associated with breast cancer risk (OR=1.42, CI=1.02-1.97 for individuals with a less than 10 pack-year smoking history).  Due to reduced sample size with stratification and marginally significant results, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions regarding pathology sub-types.  &#xD;
In summary, these results provide support for the association between several risk factors and breast cancer risk.  More research is needed to ascertain how receptor status, histologic grade, and menopausal status affect these associations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The non-polar nature of polystyrene has allowed this material to be widely used in both industrial and household applications. This same property also limits its interactions with polar materials and its stability renders it slow to degrade in an environmental setting.  Considering its widespread use in society, this makes polystyrene an environmental concern.  The introduction of a limited number of polar groups along the backbone could increase its compatibility with polar materials as well as possibly rendering it biodegradable.  The literature contains many reports of iron based catalysts that oxidize small molecule alkanes in moderate yields to introduce ketone or alcohol groups.1-3  In principle, the chemistry applicable to small molecules should also be applicable to their macromolecular analogues.  This thesis used two such iron complexes, [(Fe(TPA)(MeCN)2] (OTf)2 and Fe(BPMEN)(OTf)2, to catalyze the oxidation of polystyrene using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant.  The polymeric product was analyzed first by IR and if oxyfunctionalization was detected in the form of a carbonyl or hydroxyl peak, the material was further analyzed by DSC, GPC and 1H NMR.  The results reported herein constitute a proof of principle for the use of iron based non-heme catalysts and hydrogen peroxide for the oxyfunctionalization of polystyrene.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is little research examining the impact of divorce on children’s experiences of food and eating. This is surprising considering the high rates of divorce in Canada, 50% of which involve children, and current concerns about children’s health and weight. The purpose of this project was to explore how divorce and spending time in two households affects teenagers’ eating practices, the social and cultural meanings they associate with food and eating, and their identities. Situated in the childhood studies literature, this study acknowledged teenagers’ agency and competence by engaging them in photo-elicited, open-ended interviews. Nine teenagers between the ages of 11-17 were recruited and participated in individual interviews that ranged from 55 to 120 minutes in duration. I used inductive qualitative techniques to code and analyze the data. The findings show that teenagers from divorced families who split their time between two homes must negotiate and adapt to new food cultures in each of their homes. Rules around the types of, and access to certain foods changed between homes as did the expectations around dinnertime, eating together, and food preparation responsibilities. The rules and expectations of the teenagers changed as parents re-married and as new stepsiblings and half-siblings joined the family. The participants were active agents in each home, often deciding to comply with the rules and expectations but also exerting power and control, for example, by withholding mealtime conversation. The participants were aware of hegemonic ideals of the family and the family meal and worked to protect the image of their parents and families. This study shows that divorce influences social and cultural aspects of food and eating for teenagers. The findings can help inform public health strategies and best practice of clinicians, such as dietitians, counsellors, and doctors. It can also add to the limited body of research on the topic in childhood studies and food studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The cardiac rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr) is encoded by the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG), which is important for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Reduction in hERG expression levels due to genetic mutations or drugs causes Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Recently, we demonstrated that ubiquitination of hERG channels is involved in low K+ induced hERG endocytic degradation. Since homeostatic degradation is an important pathway in maintaining hERG membrane expression levels, we investigated the molecular mechanisms for hERG degradation by focusing on the role and consequence of overexpressing the ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, Nedd4-2 (Neural Precursor Cell- Expressed Developmentally Downregulated Gene 4- 2) (Yang &amp; Kumar, 2010). Previous work in the lab demonstrated that Ub plays a role in the internalization of cell-surface hERG channels, and I hypothesized that ubiquitination of hERG channels is facilitated through Nedd4-2. To study the effects of Nedd4-2 on hERG channels, I overexpressed Nedd4-2 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that stably express the hERG channels. Electrophysiological recordings, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and confocal microscopy were performed to identify Nedd4-2’s role in hERG expression. The data from whole-cell patch clamp recordings demonstrated that, among hEAG, Kv1.5 and hERG, Nedd4-2 specifically eliminates the hERG channel current. Western blot and confocal imaging analyses showed that Nedd4-2 overexpression led to a significant reduction in mature hERG channels in the plasma membrane. Data obtained using co-immunoprecipitation indicated that Nedd4-2 significantly increases ubiquitinated hERG channels. These data indicate that Nedd4-2 may play a role in hERG homeostatic degradation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It has been proposed that the field of appropriate technology (AT) - small-scale, energy efficient and low-cost solutions, can be of tremendous assistance in many of the sustainable development challenges, such as food and water security, health, shelter, education and work opportunities. Unfortunately, there has not yet been a significant uptake of AT by organizations, researchers, policy makers or the mainstream public working in the many areas of the development sector. Some of the biggest barriers to higher AT engagement include: 1) AT perceived as inferior or ‘poor persons technology’, 2) questions of technological robustness, design, fit and transferability, 3) funding, 4) institutional support, as well as 5) general barriers associated with tackling rural poverty. With the rise of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for online networking and knowledge sharing, the possibilities to tap into the collaborative open-access and open-source AT are growing, and so is the prospect for collective poverty reducing strategies, enhancement of entrepreneurship, communications, education and a diffusion of life-changing technologies. In short, the same collaborative philosophy employed in the success of open source software can be applied to hardware design of technologies to improve sustainable development efforts worldwide. To analyze current barriers to open source appropriate technology (OSAT) and explore opportunities to overcome such obstacles, a series of interviews with researchers and organizations working in the field of AT were conducted. &#xD;
The results of the interviews confirmed the majority of literature identified barriers, but also revealed that the most  pressing problem for organizations and researchers currently working in the field of AT is the need for much better communication and collaboration to share the knowledge and resources and work in partnership. In addition, interviews showcased general receptiveness to the principles of collaborative innovation and open source on the ground level. A much greater focus on networking, collaboration, demand-led innovation, community participation, and the inclusion of educational institutions through student involvement can be of significant help to build the necessary knowledge base, networks and the critical mass exposure for the growth of appropriate technology.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>South America and the Andes harbour a rich biodiversity. High levels of in-situ speciation, survival of relict lineages into modern times, and mixing of biotas (Gondwanian and North American), have been demonstrated to contribute to the extant biodiversity. Here I examined the four species in the shorebird family Thinocoridae (seedsnipes) as a test case of complementary hypotheses about the origins of this diversity: 1) that some lineages arose from cold-adapted Antarctic ancestors (post-Gondwana), and 2) that the Andes have promoted diversification through vicariance and via the creation of novel alpine niches. &#xD;
First, I reviewed the tectonic and environmental history of the Andes, and the major biogeographic patterns in South America. Second, I reviewed Antarctic and Southern Hemisphere paleoenvironments, putative refugia, colonisation routes, molecular and biogeographic studies, and found strong evidence supporting the role of Antarctica as a source of global cold-hardy biodiversity. Third, I developed universal protocols to purify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Using these methods, I uncovered nuclear pseudogenes, true mtDNA heteroplasmy, and possible hybridisation between seedsnipe lineages. Fourth, I investigated geographic patterns in seedsnipe morphology in four species. I also investigated the relationships of ecogeographic variables related to cold on morphology. I found strong and significant regional differences particularly in the smaller Thinocorus species, including an effect of the high Central Andes. Altitude, latitude, and wind (the effect of cold) have shaped seedsnipe morphology; Thinocoridae as a group generally support Bergmann’s and Allen’s rules. Fifth, based on phylogeographic and phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA and hemoglobin sequences, a putative southern origin for seedsnipes was supported, and an early origin in alpine habitats is suggested. Sixth, I compared data on Andean uplift and glaciation in South America, and found concordance between seedsnipe diversity, known areas of endemism in other taxa, and paleoenvironmental history. Finally, I briefly examined molecular evolution in hemoglobins and mtDNA and found preliminary evidence of adaptations to high altitude (hemoglobins) and to cold (mtDNA and hemoglobins). In summary, an Antarctic ancestor for seedsnipes, pre-adapted for life in the Andes, is supported. Antarctica may have contributed a great proportion of cold-hardy biodiversity to the South and globally.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Women face unique challenges in their careers over and above those faced by men.  Women continue to be underrepresented in the most powerful positions in society (Collins &amp; Singh, 2006; Eagly &amp; Carli, 2007).  The purpose of this project is to design a workshop to help women develop fundamental skills for building powerful relationships, and to strategically position themselves for success by creating a positive action plan for their future.  The first workshop session on goal setting will help participants identify where they are going or want to go, both personally and professionally.  Since work life and home life are intertwined, it is important in a goal setting exercise to set goals for both areas of life, in order to achieve a better work-life balance.  The second workshop session on how women learn corporate culture is designed to help participants understand what corporate culture is and how learning and leveraging their corporate culture is imperative for advancement.  The third workshop session on building strategic relationships is intended to help participants develop practical skills for positive networking. The workshop is based on the anticipated career needs of women and is grounded in adult learning theory.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Call centres have in the last three decades come to define the interaction between &#xD;
corporations, governments, and other institutions and their respective customers, citizens, and members. From telemarketing to tele-health services, to credit card assistance, and even emergency response systems, call centres function as a nexus mediating technologically enabled labour practices with the commodification of services. Because of the ubiquitous nature of the call centre in post-industrial capitalism, the banality of these interactions often overshadows the nature of work and labour in this now-global &#xD;
sector. Advances in telecommunication technologies and the globalization of &#xD;
management practices designed to oversee and maintain standardized labour processes &#xD;
have made call centre work an international phenomenon. Simultaneously, these &#xD;
developments have dislocated assumptions about the geographic and spatial seat of work in what is defined here as the new international division of knowledge labour. The offshoring and outsourcing of call centre employment, part of the larger information technology and information technology enabled services sectors, has become a growing practice amongst governments and corporations in their attempts at controlling costs. &#xD;
Leading offshore destinations for call centre work, such as Canada and India, emerged as prominent locations for call centre work for these reasons. While incredible advances in &#xD;
technology have permitted the use of distant and “offshore” labour forces, the grander &#xD;
reshaping of an international political economy of communications has allowed for the acceleration of these processes. New and established labour unions have responded to &#xD;
these changes in the global regimes of work by seeking to organize call centre workers. These efforts have been assisted by a range of forces, not least of which is the condition of work itself, but also attempts by global union federations to build a bridge between international unionism and local organizing campaigns in the Global South and Global North. Through an examination of trade union interventions in the call centre industries located in Canada and India, this dissertation contributes to research on post-industrial employment by using political economy as a juncture between development studies, critical communications, and labour studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A method was developed to produce and incorporate a network of discrete, genipin-crosslinked&#xD;
gelatin microfibers around a pancreatic islet within a barium alginate microcapsule. This&#xD;
technique allows for the encapsulation of a porous fibrous matrix without the geometrical&#xD;
restrictions required for cellular aggregate seeding. Microfibers were produced from a novel&#xD;
vortex-drawn extrusion system with an alginate support matrix. Optimization culminated in a&#xD;
hydrated fiber diameter of 22.3 ± 0.4 μm, a 98% reduction in cross sectional area, while making&#xD;
the process more reliable and less labour intensive. The optimized microfibers were encapsulated&#xD;
at 40 vol% within 294 ± 4 μm 1.6% barium alginate microparticles by an electrostatic-mediated&#xD;
dropwise extrusion system. Pancreatic islets extracted from Sprague Dawley rats were&#xD;
encapsulated within the microparticles, and analyzed over a 21-day preliminary in vitro study.&#xD;
Acridine orange and propidium iodide fluorescent viability staining and light microscopy&#xD;
indicated a significant increase in viability for the fiber-laden particles relative to fiber-free&#xD;
control particles at days 7, 14, and 21. The fiber-laden system also reduced the incidence of&#xD;
disrupted islet cohesion from 31% to 8% at day 21, and showed evidence of islet-fiber adhesion.&#xD;
Preliminary investigations into insulin secretion and metabolic activity showed no significant&#xD;
difference between test and control groups. Further investigation into benefits of islet&#xD;
encapsulation within an extracellular matrix fiber network will be the subject of future studies&#xD;
with this body of work serving as a foundation.&#xD;
The system developed in this investigation could be developed into a modular scaffold system for&#xD;
tissue engineering beyond the field of islet research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goal of this study was to develop a model of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to be used for in vitro testing of oral insulin delivery devices.  The method and intensity of mixing and effects of gastrointestinal fluids with and without enzymes were evaluated.  Comparisons were made between an actively mixed simulator and a passively mixed simulator, where the actively mixed simulator is a magnetically stirred flask while the passively mixed simulator is a flexible container on a rocking stage.  Slower mixing times and larger time constants for mixing were seen for the passively mixed simulator during a pH tracer experiment.  Release studies were performed with several oral insulin delivery device models to evaluate the effects of different mixing techniques on insulin release.  In all cases, the more intense mixing of the actively mixed simulator resulted in more insulin release.  When using a nanoparticle model in intestinal fluid for example, 100% insulin release was observed in the actively mixed simulator while only 53% was released in the passively mixed simulator after 1 hour.  Trypsin and pepsin were used to determine the ability of a drug delivery device to protect insulin from enzymatic degradation in which trypsin was added to simulated intestinal fluid and pepsin was added to simulated gastric fluid.  Premature insulin release and insulin denaturation at body temperature occurred in the intestinal fluid so the protective effects against trypsin were unable to be effectively evaluated.  An increase in insulin loss from 70% to 95% was detected in the presence of pepsin compared to gastric fluid without enzymes in the actively mixed simulator, indicating that acid hydrolysis of insulin as well as protease attack by pepsin will impact the behavior of an insulin delivery device.  An improvement in insulin retention was observed in the passively mixed simulator.  After 1 hour, insulin retained was increased from 4% in the actively mixed simulator to 10% in the passively mixed simulator, and after 2 hours, this increase was 2% to 7%.  Premature insulin release from the delivery device, acid hydrolysis, temperature denaturation, and enzymatic degradation are factors limiting the effectiveness of oral insulin.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Contraction of cardiac muscle is a highly regulated event that relies on a delicate balance of ions entering and leaving the cell through ion channels. In particular, voltage gated sodium channels are responsible for the rapid depolarization that leads to a contraction. During an oxidative challenge, sodium channels rapidly activate, but do not fully turn off. This alters the rate of cardiac repolarization and can induce cardiac arrhythmias. It is currently unknown whether the most common sodium channel isoform found in the heart, NaV1.5, generates this oxidant-induced persistent current or if other isoforms are responsible. Therefore, I sought to further explore the biophysical properties NaV1.5, and determine if it can enter this persistent mode.&#xD;
I tested the biophysical properties of native INa in cardiac myocytes and in NaV1.5 transfected HEK293 cells under macro cell-attached voltage-clamp. I used a sodium channel enhancer (Anemonia sulcata toxin II; 10 nM), a sodium channel blocker (tetrodotoxin; 10 nM) and a model of oxidative stress (H2O2; 100 µM, 200 µM, 1000 µM) to compare and contrast the cellular responses between both cell types. I observed that transfected HEK293 cells and cardiac myocytes were unaffected by H2O2 at various concentrations. Given the lack of other isoforms in transfected HEK293 cells, and the low abundance (&lt;5%) of other isoforms in cardiac myocytes, I propose that NaV1.5 function is unaffected by H2O2. Furthermore, ATX II prolonged the inactivation process in both HEK293 cells and cardiac myocytes in a voltage-dependent manner, indicating that NaV1.5 can give rise to persistent sodium current.  Finally, by comparing both cell types under control settings, I found that transfected HEK293 cells inactivated at a much slower rate and at more negative potentials compared to the current in cardiac myocytes. My results suggest that NaV1.5 does not underlie oxidant-induced persistent current and that β subunits likely play a significant role in the inactivation process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled anaplerotic enzyme situated at a pivotal branchpoint of plant C-metabolism. Plant genomes encode several closely related plant-type PEPC (PTPC) isozymes, and a distantly related bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC). Two physically and kinetically distinct oligomeric classes of PEPC occur in the endosperm of developing castor oil seeds (COS). Class-1 PEPC is a typical homotetramer composed of 107-kDa PTPC subunits, whereas the novel 910-kDa Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex arises from a tight interaction between Class-1 PEPC and 118-kDa bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC) subunits. BTPC functions as a catalytic and regulatory subunit of the allosterically-desensitized Class-2 PEPC, hypothesized to support PEP-flux to malate for leucoplast fatty acid synthesis. Previous studies established that BTPC: (i) subunits of COS Class-2 PEPC are phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo and (ii) phosphorylation at Ser425 provides a new tier of enzyme control in developing COS. LC MS/MS and LTQ-FT MS identified Thr4 and Ser451 as additional in vivo phosphorylation sites of immunopurified COS BTPC (corresponding to acidophilic and basophilic protein kinase consensus sequences, respectively). Immunoblots probed with a phosphorylation-site specific antibody raised against a synthetic phosphopeptide indicated that Ser451 phosphorylation is promoted during seed development, becoming maximal in stage VII (full cotyledon) COS. Although several pThr4 containing BTPC peptides were non-immunogenic, the collective results indicate that Thr4 is also phosphorylated in vivo. Kinetic effects of each phosphorylation site were examined using phospho-mimetic mutants of heterologously expressed COS BTPC. BTPC’s phosphorylation at Ser451 appears to be inhibitory, as reflected by significantly increased&#xD;
Km(PEP) values, and reduced I50(malate) and I50(Asp) values of a S451D mutant. By contrast, kinetic characterization of a T4D phosphomimetic mutant indicated that Thr4 phosphorylation is not regulatory in nature. However, Thr4 exists in a conserved forkhead-associated (FHA) binding domain (pTXXD) that has received considerable prominence as a phospho-Thr dependent protein interaction module. These results further our understanding of multisite phosphorylation of BTPC in developing COS and its possible contribution to the control of Class-2 PEPC activity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: The validity of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) as a clinical tool for use by clinicians in the conservative management of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has not been well established.  The objective of this study was to determine the validity of the WIQ as a tool to identify high and low walking ability (performance) in patients with PAD.    &#xD;
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study and enrolled 132 new and existing PAD patients who consecutively attended the vascular clinic at Kingston General Hospital between May 2010 and May 2011.  Patients with an Ankle Brachial Index ≤0.9 were approached for study inclusion.  Participants were excluded if they had (a) severe ischemia requiring intervention; (b) comorbid conditions that limited walking (angina, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe arthritis); (c) wheel chair, cane or walker requirement; (d) non-compressible arteries; and/or (e) severe cognitive impairment.  Walking performance was assessed with the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (surrogate measure) and a standardized graded treadmill test (gold standard measure).  Other study variables were obtained via questionnaire (age, sex, comorbid conditions and smoking status) or direct measurement (weight, height, waist circumference).              &#xD;
Results: 123 patients completed the treadmill test (70.7% males, mean age of 66.5 and mean ABI of 0.6 with range 0-0.9).  The scores on the WIQ ranged from 0 to 100 and absolute claudication distance (ACD) ranged from 0.03 to 0.98 miles.  All WIQ subscale and overall scores were positively and moderately associated with the ACD (r values 0.63 to 0.68, p&lt;0.05).  Based on the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, an overall WIQ score of 42.5 or less identified low performers (sensitivity 0.9, specificity 0.7, area under the curve 0.89) while a combined distance and stair score of 75.5 or more identified high performers (sensitivity 0.4, specificity 0.9, area under the curve 0.81).            &#xD;
Conclusions: Based on these findings, the WIQ, an easily administered self-report questionnaire, and the cutoffs identified could be used to quantify and classify walking ability in PAD patients, making this a potentially useful tool for clinicians to manage PAD patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to prepare new photochromic N,C-chelate four-coordinate organoboron compounds and investigate their photophysical and photochemical properties. &#xD;
Phenylpyridine-based organoboron compound (PhPyBMes2) was prepared and studied with NMR, X-ray, and UV-Vis. Experimental and theoretical results established that PhPyBMes2 is photochromic and the photoisomerization process involves a reversible intramolecular C-C bond formation/breaking. The structure of the dark colored isomer of PhPyBMes2 was established by 2D NMR experiments and computational studies. The discovery of the photochromic behavior of PhPyBMes2 led to the investigation of other phenylpyridine-based organoboron compounds.&#xD;
 A series of substituted PhPyBMes2 compounds were synthesized with substituents on the phenyl ring or the pyridine ring of the N,C-chelate. Two other compounds were synthesized by substituting the mesityl rings in PhPyBMes2 with phenyl or pentaflurophenyl rings. The photophysical and photochemical properties of these compounds were studied by NMR, UV-Vis, and DFT/TD-DFT. The studies established that the steric hindrance imposed by the mesityl groups and the nature of substituents on the N,C-chelate  have substantial effects on the photoisomerization process.  &#xD;
New organoboron compounds based on N,C-chelates other than phenylpyridine were prepared and their photochemical and photophysical properties studied using NMR, UV-Vis, and DFT/TD-DFT. The phenyl group in the N,C-chelate was replaced by TMS-furan, TMS-thiophene, benzofuran, benzothiophene, and N-phenyl pyridylindole groups. The conducted studies show that these new compounds have photochromic properties similar to those of phenylpyridine-based compounds. Crystals of the dark isomer of the N-phenyl pyridylindole organoboron compound were successfully grown and the structure of the dark isomer was determined by X-ray diffraction.&#xD;
New organoboron compounds based on phenyl-benzoxazole and phenyl-benzothiazole have been also prepared and studied. The photoisomerization of these compounds is similar to the other N,C-chelate organoboron compounds but their thermal behavior is different.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a study in Representation Theory and Geometry. These two branches of mathematics have a fruitful interaction, with many applications to Physics and other sciences. Central objects of interest are homogeneous spaces and their symmetry groups. The geometric and analytic properties of homogeneous spaces relate to the structure and representation theory of the corresponding groups. The focus of this work is on certain representation theoretic phenomena related to equivariant embeddings of homogeneous spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, a milestone in Representation Theory and Geometry, provides realizations for every irreducible module of a semisimple complex Lie group as various cohomology spaces of homogeneous vector bundles on flag manifolds of the group. The purpose of this dissertation is to initiate a study of the behaviour of the Borel-Weil-Bott construction under pullbacks along equivariant embeddings of flag manifolds. These pullbacks provide certain geometric branching rules for representations. This is where the notion of a cohomological component arises from.&#xD;
&#xD;
The central result of the dissertation is a criterion for nonvanishing of the pullback. The framework used for the formulation and proof of the result is Kostant's theory of Lie algebra cohomology. After the general criterion is established, various specializations and applications are presented: special classes of embeddings are considered, for which the criterion takes simpler forms; relations are established between pullbacks along embeddings of complete and partial flag manifolds; properties of the set of cohomological components are obtained; various examples are considered, the most interesting of which is related to the theory of invariants of semisimple Lie algebras.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the design of fast-settling pulse generators and pulsed low noise amplifiers (LNAs) for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) applications. These components are critical in pulsed UWB transceivers, and a high energy efficiency is sought without adversely affecting RF performance and functionality. To this end, new pulse generators with a subnanosecond settling time and a low energy consumption of only a few picojoules per pulse are targeted. Moreover, a novel pulsed LNA is investigated for a low power consumption that can be scaled with the duty cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, an energy-efficient tunable pulse generator is proposed for high-data-rate 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB applications. A current-starved ring oscillator is quickly switched on and off, and the amplitude envelope is shaped using a passive attenuator. The energy consumption per pulse is below 4.2 pJ while the pulse amplitude is 150 mV, yielding a high energy efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
A quadrature pulse generator is then presented for 22-29 GHz UWB applications with a settling time below 0.5 ns. An inductor-capacitor (LC) oscillator is quickly switched on and off with a new technique, and the amplitude envelope is shaped using a variable passive attenuator. The energy consumption per pulse is only 6.2 pJ, and the pulse amplitude is more than 240 mV, yielding the highest energy efficiency reported to date in CMOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Next, a 3-10 GHz pulsed ring oscillator that offers direct quadrature phase modulation is demonstrated. Current impulses are injected into the oscillator to enable fast startup and implement quadrature phase modulation. The energy consumption and voltage swing varies from 13 pJ and 300 mV at 3 GHz to 18 pJ and 200 mV at 10 GHz respectively, yielding a high energy efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
Lastly, a fast switching noise cancelling LNA is proposed for 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB applications that settles within 1.3 ns for switching speeds as high as 200 MHz. Inductive peaking is introduced in the noise cancelling topology to achieve a sub-4dB flat noise figure and a high gain of 16.6 dB for frequencies up to 10 GHz. The average power consumption is also below 10 mW with a 50% duty cycle clock.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The portability, ease of use and improved accuracy of miniature inertial sensors brought by current microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology has inspired researchers to develop human movement monitoring system with body-fixed sensors. Although a large number of studies have attempted to explore the use of miniature inertial sensors in estimating walking speed for the past two decades, there still remain some questions regarding applying inertial sensors in estimating walking speed under different walking conditions and for different subject populations. In this thesis, I focus on evaluating and improving the performance of a shank-mounted mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) based walking speed estimation method. My research can be divided into four parts. The first part was a systematic review regarding the state of the art of current development of the inertial sensor based walking speed estimation method. A total of 16 articles were fully reviewed in terms of sensor specification, sensor attachment location, experimental design and spatial parameter estimation algorithm. In the second part, a comprehensive performance evaluation was conducted, which included the treadmill and overground walking experiments with constraint on the walking speed, stride length and stride frequency. A systematic error was observed in the error analysis of this study, which was adjusted by subtracting the bias by linear regression. In the third part, a post-stroke subject overground walking experiment was carried out with an improved walking speed estimation method that reduced the systematic error caused by previous false initial speed assumption. In addition to walking speed estimation, the gait asymmetry for post-stroke hemiparetic gait was also evaluated with the proposed method. The last part was the sensor error model analysis. We elaborately analyzed and discussed the estimation errors involved in this method in order to completely understand the sensor error compensation in walking speed estimation algorithm design. Two existing sensor error models and one newly developed sensor error model were compared with the treadmill walking experiment, which demonstrated the effect of each sensor error component on the estimation result and the importance of the sensor error model selection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interluekin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine critical to the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The main role for this cytokine is in the proliferation and differentiation of the IL-17 producing CD4 T helper cell, Th17. Virus infection deregulates IL-23 expression and function, but little is known about the mechanism behind this phenomena. Here, I demonstrate a reduction of Toll like receptor (TLR) ligand-induced IL-23 expression in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), indicating that a function of these cells is disrupted during virus infection. I propose a mechanism of TLR ligand-induced IL-23 expression inhibition upon LCMV infection via the deactivation of p38, AP-1, and NF-κB. Further analysis revealed a direct relationship between LCMV infection with the IL-10 and SOCS3 expression. To understand IL-23 function, I characterized IL-23-induced JAK/STAT signalling pathway and IL-23 receptor expression on human CD4 T cells. My results demonstrate that IL-23 induces activation of p-JAK2, p-Tyk2, p-STAT1, p-STAT3, and p-STAT4 in CD4 T cells. For the first time I show that IL-23 alone induces the expression of its own receptor components, IL-12Rβ1 and IL-23Rα, in CD4 T cells. Blocking JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 activation with specific inhibitors detrimentally effected expression of IL-23 receptor demonstrating that activation of JAK/STAT signalling is important for IL-23 receptor expression. I also addressed the effect of viral infection on IL-23 function and receptor expression in CD4 T cells using cells isolated from HIV positive individuals. These studies were based on earlier reports that the expression of IL-23 and the IL-23 receptor are impaired during HIV infection. I demonstrate that the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 induced by IL-23, as well as IL-23 receptor expression are deregulated in CD4 T cells isolated from HIV positive individuals. This study has furthered the understanding of how the expression and function of IL-23 is regulated during viral infections.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of the present study was to understand the lived experiences of three male elementary teachers working at the Kindergarten to Grade 4 level in a single school district in northwestern Alberta. The study investigated how the participants saw their roles as male elementary teachers, the work-related challenges they faced, and how they responded to those challenges. &#xD;
Three male teachers with single-grade assignments ranging from Grade 2 to Grade 4 participated in the study. The participants were asked to reflect on various aspects of their experiences of teaching in the traditionally female-dominated profession of elementary education. Data were collected through individual interviews with each participant between May 2011 and June 2011. &#xD;
Data were analyzed with respect to the participants’ approaches to physical contact with students, their attitudes about role modelling, and their perspectives on men in elementary education. Andrew, Brian, and Peter had various degrees of physical contact with their young students with most of the physical contact in all three participants’ classrooms being initiated by students. All three participants saw role modelling as an important task for male elementary teachers; however, they tended to model socially acceptable human behaviour for all students rather than attempting to serve as “father figures” who modelled stereotypically male attributes for male students to emulate. Finally, all three participants were hopeful that more men would decide to enter the profession in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability to safely and efficiently negotiate stairs is an essential skill for independent ambulation. To date, basic research to identify biomechanical and physical costs is limited in older adults. In persons with stroke, this aspect of mobility is virtually unexplored. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate biomechanical alterations during stair negotiation and to evaluate the physical costs of the task in older adults and persons with stroke. This was approached by conducting four studies.  The first study identified age-related alterations in joint kinetics during stair negotiation. The results showed age-related differences in moment magnitudes, an exaggerated net support moment and sustained abductor moments through stance. To gain insight into these adaptive changes with respect to mechanical efficiency, the second study evaluated age-related changes in mechanical energy transfers during stair negotiation. During ascent, older adults achieve similar efficiencies as young adults by slowing their cadence. During descent, age-related differences in mechanical energy expenditures and related variances in mechanical energy compensation coefficients reflect a loss in mechanical efficiency. The impact was likely the provision of enhanced extensor support and stability. The results also highlight a functional role for concentric energy expenditures during descent. The third study provided a detailed biomechanical description of stair negotiation in people with stroke, revealing important differences in how stroke survivors manage stairs and how handrail use modifies the magnitudes of lower limb joint moments. The fourth study evaluated the strength and aerobic requirement of stair ambulation in persons with stroke. The findings reveal increased costs of the task, primarily due to reduced neuromuscular and aerobic capacities and serve to identify factors that may be limiting during stair negotiation.&#xD;
This thesis provides new information regarding movement control in older adults during stair negotiation, providing a normative benchmark of age-related alterations in movement patterns. In persons with stroke, this work is the first to quantify the biomechanical patterns and physical requirements of stair negotiation. Future work may extend these findings to explore mobility challenges in persons with greater levels of impairment as well as guide the development of targeted and task oriented rehabilitation programs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the past twenty years an increasing number of Global South nations have vied for the rights to host prestigious and expensive sport mega events. This trend requires significant reflection given the enormous economic costs of these events, which often produce little capital gain for the host nation (Whitson &amp; Horne, 2006). Furthermore, sport mega events are often utilized for their symbolic capital (Belanger, 2009), which sometimes manifests through forcing people from their land for the sake of “beautification” (Davis, 2006). In this project, then, I asked how technologies of power were utilized by FIFA, corporate stakeholders, and the South African government to control people who were marginal to, or impeded the success of, the World Cup in Nelspruit, South Africa. This project consisted of two parts: the first involved constructing a theoretical framework for better understanding power as it operates through sport mega events in general. To this end I employed Marxian notions of the ordering of physical space, Foucauldian conceptions of sovereignty and governmentality, and Agamben’s (1998) state of exception to determine how particular bodies are constituted and controlled through sport mega events. In the second part, I applied this theoretical framework to the events in South Africa to better elucidate how people became displaced and killed because of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. I used South African popular news and documentaries as empirical evidence and conducted a discursive analysis of said news media. Through this coverage it became apparent that the mega event created the conditions in which new forms of rogue sovereign partnerships could arise through a historically and spatially contingent process of capitalism. The rogue sovereigns’ para-juridico-political orders, the discourses and practices of accumulation by dispossession as a tactic and effect of govermentality, and other historical non-capital subjectivities such as racial identity, all contributed to constituting Agamben’s state of exception in which people could be displaced, killed or left to die in the events surrounding the World Cup.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Public Power in the Planning Process is a discussion of the decision-making process used in the creation of the Lansdowne Partnership Plan, which deals with the redevelopment of an urban park in Ottawa. It analyses three stages of the process (from June 2009 to November 2010), using three different frameworks for the evaluation of collaborative planning processes, and aims to achieve two purposes: first, to shed some light on the intricacies of a controversial planning process and second, to examine the effectiveness of the evaluation frameworks. The analysis, based on the principles of access, deliberation, and accountability, indicates that the process was not fully democratic. The decision-making process for the Lansdowne Partnership Plan degraded trust and relationships and increased tensions. The analytic framework based on the 2008 work of Agger and Löfgren was successful, and is recommended for the evaluation of a wide range of different planning processes. However, critiques are made of Arnstein’s 1969 Ladder of Citizen Participation framework.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) binds the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to exert its effect on target cells. VDR expression is found in a number of immune cells including professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells.  It has been found that the actions of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the immune system are mainly immunosuppressive.  The cross-presentation pathway allows for exogenously derived antigens to be presented by pAPCs on MHC-I molecules to CD8+ T cells.  CD8+ T cell activation results in the expansion of epitope-specific T cell populations that confer host protection. These epitopes can be organized into an immunodominance hierarchy.  Previous work demonstrated that introducing LCMV-NP via the cross-priming pathway significantly alters the immunodominance hierarchy of a subsequent LCMV infection.  Building upon these observations, our study assessed the effects of LCMV-NP cross priming in the presence of a single dose of 1,25-(OH)2D3.  Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 was found to have biological effects in our model system.  In vitro pAPCs were demonstrated to up-regulate IL-10 and CYP24A1 mRNA, in addition to the transactivation of cellular VDR, as demonstrated by a relocalization to the nuclear region.  Mice treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 were found to produce up-regulated IL-10 and CYP24A1 transcripts.  Expression of VDR was increased at both the transcript and protein level.  Our results demonstrate that a single dose of 1,25-(OH)2D3 does not affect the cross-priming pathway in this system.  Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not influence the ability of differentiated pAPCs to phagocytose or cross-present exogenous antigen to epitope-specific CD8+ T cells.  Furthermore, 1,25-(OH)2D3  did not alter cross-priming or the establishment of the LCMV immunodominance hierarchy in vivo.  By confirming that 1,25-(OH)2D3  does not suppress cross-priming in our model,  our study helps to expand the understanding of the immunomodulatory role of exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the outcome of virus infection. Collectively, our data supports the observation that the role of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the immune system is not always associated with suppressive effects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Men engage in fewer health-promoting behaviours than women.  Despite being more active than women, the majority of men are inactive.  Physical activity (PA) decreases the risk of developing numerous chronic conditions and may be an optimal behaviour to target in men’s health interventions.  However, informational resources and health-promotion interventions for men are lacking.  To address this gap, we conducted two studies using the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM; Witte, 1992) as a guiding framework.  Study 1 examined relevant and appealing health message content for men and explored the relevance and applicability of EPPM constructs to men’s health messages and PA messages in particular.  Four semi-structured focus groups and four semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted.  Participants (n=26) easily related to the EPPM constructs.  Participants preferred demographically-tailored health messages that addressed modifiable behaviours (e.g. PA) and self-regulatory strategies (e.g. planning) and included reputable sources, strong language, and sex appeal.  From these findings, four sets of PA messages with different combinations of risk and efficacy information were developed.  Study 2 tested the effectiveness of these EPPM-based messages to increase men’s PA intentions and behaviours.  Inactive participants (n=353) were randomly assigned to one of four message groups and read four health messages over four consecutive days.  Intentions were assessed at baseline and the first follow-up (Day 5) while manipulation check items were assessed at Day 5.  PA behaviour was assessed at baseline and the second follow-up (Day 14).  Men who received low efficacy and risk information were less likely to meet the Canadian PA guidelines at Day 14 than men who only received low efficacy information (OR=2.15 95% CI:0.963-4.80, Wald=3.49, p=0.062).  Providing risk information led to increases in PA behaviours (F(1, 157)=7.29, p=0.008, d=.22).  Intentions to be active were greater in the high efficacy group than the low efficacy group (F(1, 345)=4.10, p=0.044, d=.21).  Bivariate correlations indicated a disconnect between fear and efficacy perceptions, intentions, and defensive avoidance.  From these collective findings, we provide insight into the EPPM as it relates to men’s PA behaviours, propose preliminary recommendations regarding the development of PA messages for men, and suggest areas for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interstitial Cystitis / Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC/PBS) is a persistent and refractory medical condition that is characterized by chronic pelvic pain along with abnormal urinary frequency and urgency. There is no widely accepted etiology or efficacious cure for IC/PBS, thus treatment often relies on pain and symptom management. IC/PBS is associated with strong functional disability but theoretical models of disability have yet to be tested with these patients. As well, psychosocial factors associated with various IC/PBS outcomes (i.e., depression, catastrophizing, social support) are also associated with disability in a variety of chronic painful medical conditions but remain untested in disability models for IC/PBS. Thus, this research evaluated psychosocial factors as potential mediators of disability within the Disablement Process Model. Female patients diagnosed with IC/PBS by a urologist in a tertiary care hospitals were recruited (n=196; females). In using structural equation modeling of a final IC/PBS disability model, negative affect and catastrophizing were found to be partial mediators on the relationship between impairments and functional disability and social support was not a significant mediator of disability. Negative affect and catastrophizing may be key psychosocial factors in IC/PBS disability. Research implications for the Disablement Process Model and potential clinical interventions are discussed in light of the current findings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis synthesizes theoretical and methodological insights of actor-network theory with the political economy of communication in order to trace the history of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, 2005-2009. The purpose is to demonstrate how a power elite of transnational corporate actants are increasingly structuring transnational border policy, encouraging the deployment of ubiquitous surveillance technology and the liberalization of transborder data flows and markets, primarily for the purposes of maximizing capital accumulation, ideological legitimation and the suppression of resistance. This hybridization of state and corporate actants exemplifies how prosperity partnerships and other similar informal working groups are increasingly being used as powerful vehicles for mobilizing the private sector into influencing border policies throughout North America, effectively creating powerful socio-technical scenarios for influencing global markets. The argument advanced is that borders are increasingly becoming topological spaces which unevenly distributed objects and people across various networks and flows, in turn re-shaping urban landscapes towards private interests. As such, topological prosperity entails configuring networked infrastructures and spaces such as borders and airports in ways which favour particular socio-economic groups, primarily an ascending global economic elite.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>From a normative perspective, sport is often viewed as a form of benign entertainment and an optimal vehicle for health and community development devoid of political bias. This thesis examines the way sport has been constructed and mobilized as an instrument of neoliberalism, especially through a nexus of biopedagogies that instruct ways of knowing, ordering and conditioning bodies. Historically, sport's instrumental role to the politics of governance similarly continues to be a powerful way and useful vehicle to exercise dominance and mastery over one's own body, nature and others. Building upon the work of Michel Foucault and Nikolas Rose, I contend that psy-prefixed disciplines that surfaced from Western capitalism play a distinct role in mobilizing sport to reconfigure the body in such a way that it serves political economic goals. &#xD;
	This thesis offers a sociological approach to critically examine the disciplining of the body through sport with the intent to foster moral development, social inclusion and peace-building according to a neoliberal framework of health. Drawing from Foucault’s work as a kind of theoretical toolbox to inform a geneaology, with some archaeological examples, of the biocitizen as he or she has been made a useful subject of neoliberal health. This geneaology addresses the shifts and splits in the human sciences that have contributed to the ubiquity of psy- practices and disciplining techniques that shape the youth education of bodies, movement and physicality. Foucault’s notion of “dividing practices” and the relational interdependency of what is constructed as normal or deviant, reveals a co-dependent producing of the self and its normalization as well as the problematizing and policing of the “other.” These systems of difference undermine the diversity of physical cultures and practices while also creating a binary oriented approach to healthism discourses, which effectively order, dominate and subordinate specific bodies, thereby furthering networks of inequality and exclusion. Finally, the last section turns to the period of modern aestheticism, theatre performance and critical pedagogy in order to rethink possibilities of sport beyond the present limits of the competitive capitalist rubric that shapes body knowledges and practices in current physical education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is growing prominence as an automated identification technology able to turn everyday objects into an ad-hoc network of mobile nodes; which can  track, trigger events and perform actions. Energy scavenging and backscattering techniques are the foundation of low-cost identification solutions for RFIDs. The performance of these two techniques, being wireless, significantly depends on the underlying communication architecture and affect the overall operation of RFID systems. Current RFID systems are based on a centralized master-slave architecture hindering the overall performance, scalability and usability. Several proposals have aimed at improving performance at the physical, medium access, and application layers. Although such proposals achieve significant performance gains in terms of reading range and reading rates, they require significant changes in both software and hardware architectures while bounded by inherited performance bottlenecks, i.e., master-slave architecture. Performance constraints need to be addressed in order to further facilitate RFID adoption; especially for ultra large scale applications such as Internet of Things. &#xD;
&#xD;
A natural approach is re-thinking the distributed communication architecture of RFID systems; wherein control and data tasks are decoupled from a central authority and dispersed amongst spatially distributed low-power wireless devices. The distributed architecture, by adjusting the tag's reflectivity coefficient creates micro interrogation zones which are interrogated in parallel. We investigate this promising direction in order to significantly increase the reading rates and reading range of RFID tags, and also to enhance overall system scalability. We address the problems of energy-efficient tag singulations, optimal power control schemes and load aware reader placement algorithms for RFID systems. We modify the conventional set cover approximation algorithm to determine the minimal number of RFID readers with minimal overlapping and balanced number of tags amongst them. We show, via extensive simulation analysis, that our approach has the potential to increase the performance of RFID technology and hence, to enable RFID systems for ultra large scale applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We discuss the design of an e-textile shirt with an interactive Lumalive display featuring a touch-controlled image browser. To determine where to place touch sensors, we investigated which areas of the Lumalive shirt users would be comfortable touching or being touched. We did so by measuring how often participants would opt out of touches. Results show signiﬁcant diﬀerences in opt-outs between touch zones on the front of the shirt. For both touchers and touchees, opt-outs occurred mostly in the upper chest touch zone. We also found signiﬁcant diﬀerences in comfort ratings between touch zones on the front as well as on the back of the shirt. On the front, the &#xD;
upper chest and lower abdominal zones were the least comfortable touch zones. We found no gender eﬀects on overall comfort ratings, suggesting the upper chest area &#xD;
was equally uncomfortable to males as it was to females. Interestingly, touching some areas rated as most uncomfortable produced a signiﬁcantly greater calming eﬀect on heart rate. Findings suggest participants were less comfortable with touches on the upper chest, the lower abdomen, and the lower back. We conclude that the most appropriate areas for touch sensors on a shirt are on the arms and shoulders, as well as on the upper back. Based on these ﬁndings, we created an interactive shirt for &#xD;
a proximity-based game of tag using Lumalive e-textile displays. This custom shirt features touch sensors located on the shoulder and lower arm regions of the shirt.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stefan Zweig had an extraordinary gift for mirroring the complexity of humankind and the human mind, and was undoubtedly one of the most translated authors in the 1930s, but he is still considered a “poor cousin” in the academic world. Indeed, both his life and his work have been consistently viewed through the events of history, something neither caused nor endorsed by him, with the result that his worldview and the general perception of that view often have been misunderstood. In the 1950s and 1960s, scholars focused on the author’s use of genres and language, as well as his political views during the Second World War, rather than on the analysis of his literary texts. Although recent research points to the importance of Zweig’s humanistic worldview, which insists on viewing all human action equally, the poor image of the author caused by his earlier reception still prevails. This thesis focusses on Zweig’s autobiographical work Die Welt von Gestern: Erinnerungen eines Europäers (1942) as an adaptation of both culture and history. This dissertation demonstrates, how through the subject perception of the “I,” “life writing” becomes “history writing,” dismantling a cultural and political world. Not only does this “I” hold multiple functions, but each function illuminates a different fragment of an event in search of a “truth.” Zweig’s autobiography incorporates elements from other genres, which enables us to see him in part as a postmodern author. To illustrate the game-like use of Zweig’s subjective worldview, Philippe Lejeune’s “autobiographical pact,” Mieke Bal’s concept of focalization, and Walter Benjamin’s essay “Der Erzähler” will form the framework for a linguistic, narratological, and philosophical analysis. In order to show that autobiographical writing resides in the tradition of alternative history, rather than in the simple enumeration of facts, Henry Adams’ The Education of Henry Adams (1918) has been woven into the analysis of Zweig’s text, as an example of an autobiography from a historian’s point of view, who, although motivated by different circumstances, exposes a similar philosophy of history to Zweig’s.&#xD;
Besides Zweig’s autobiography this dissertation will also include other works of the author, such as Triumph und Tragik des Erasmus von Rotterdam (1934), Maria Stuart (1935) und “Schachnovelle“ (1942) as part of the analysis in order to show the reflexion of history and life in the author’s biographical work as well.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The superior mesenteric ganglion (SMG) provides sympathetic input to areas of the small intestine, colon, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Interactions between the nervous and immune systems in the SMG influence sympathetic regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) and immune function. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated changes in SMG neuron activity resulting from exposure to inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor α&#xD;
(TNFα). The current project focused on interactions between mast cells and sympathetic neurons.&#xD;
Mast cells within the SMG release mediators, including histamine, that can act on neurons and alter their activity. We tested the hypothesis that histamine influences signaling in SMG neurons by inhibiting calcium ion influx during cell depolarization using immunohistochemistry and calcium imaging.&#xD;
Immunohistochemistry revealed H3R on the majority of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive&#xD;
sympathetic neurons in the ganglia. Dissociated neurons were incubated in the ratiometric fluorescent calcium indicator dye Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, then superfused with extracellular solution containing histamine receptor agonists (histamine, HTMT, imetit) and antagonists&#xD;
(thioperamide) before being depolarized with a KCL solution (70 mM). Application of both&#xD;
histamine (10 μM) and the H3 receptor agonist imetit (100 nM) caused a decrease in&#xD;
depolarization-induced calcium ion influx. However, the inhibition of calcium ion influx became smaller as the concentration of histamine was increased (100 μM, 1 mM) until the inhibition was no longer&#xD;
statistically significant. Application of H3R antagonist thioperamine (300nM) reversed the inhibition of calcium ion influx caused by histamine (10 μM). Application of H1R &amp; H2R agonist histamine trifluoromethyl toluidide (HTMT) (10 μM) caused an increase in calcium ion influx during depolarization. We conclude that activation of H3R decreases calcium ion influx through voltage-gated&#xD;
calcium ion channels, while activation of H1R / H2R increases calcium ion influx. H3R has a higher affinity for histamine, and therefore is preferentially activated at lower concentrations. Increases in histamine receptor activation may alter SMG input to the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, small&#xD;
intestine, and colon, resulting in changes in immune and gut function, such as those described in irritable bowel syndrome.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We present a study of the effects of structural holds and rigidity of a flexible display on touch pointing and dragging performance. We discuss an observational study in which we collected common holds used when pointing on a mock-up paper display. We also measured the force patterns each hold generated within the display surface. We analyzed this data to produce 3 force zones in the display for each of the four most frequently observed holds: the grip zone, rigid zone, and the flexible zone. We report on an empirical evaluation in which we compared the efficiency of pointing and dragging operations between holds, and between structural zones within holds, using a real flexible Lumalive display. Results suggest that structural force distributions in a flexible display affect the Index of Performance of both pointing and dragging tasks, irrespective of hold, with rigid parts of the display yielding a 12% average performance gain over flexible areas.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The current study examined the efficacy of a 1 month future time perspective modification intervention over a 1 month and 6 months period. Participants (N = 92) with elevated scores on measures of depressive symptoms or suicidal ideation were assigned to either the intervention condition or a no-intervention control condition. A repeated-measures manova revealed that those in the time perspective modification intervention condition showed significant reductions in psychache and hopelessness at 1 month, relative to those in the control condition. Repeated-measures manovas did not reveal significantly greater changes in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, or future time perspective. No results at 6 months were found to be significant. These results suggest that a future time perspective modification intervention can reduce important predictors of suicidality, although the sustainability of these gains and their relation to suicide is unclear.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Directors in not-for-profit organizations are not only monitors who ensure that financial reports are free from misreporting but also often act as fundraisers. This paper examines the intensity of directors’ monitoring when management misallocates expenses to solicit donations; especially whether the directors’ oversight is influenced by the organization’s expense disclosure transparency and the donors’ evaluation focus. The results from two experiments indicate that directors play a monitoring role to not allow management’s expense misallocation. Further, the enhanced transparency of expense disclosures increases directors’ tendency not to endorse management’s expense misallocation. However, the donors’ adoption of a balanced evaluation process (i.e., considering both financial and nonfinancial performance metrics) reduces directors’ monitoring compared to the donors’ adoption of an expense-focused evaluation process (i.e., focusing solely on financial metrics). This effect of the donors’ adoption of a balanced evaluation process occurs when directors anticipate donors will not donate to the not-for-profit organization, but not when directors anticipate donors will donate. This paper contributes to a richer understanding of directors’ role in not-for-profit organizations’ expense misallocations. Implications for nonprofit governance are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cycles of reversible hydrogenation reactions are important for at least two different energy-related applications: reversible chemical hydrogen storage and  thermally regenerative fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel is a green alternative to conventional hydrocarbon fuels for transportation applications. This is because the combustion product of hydrogen is simply water, which is non-toxic and ubiquitous. Hydrogen is also an attractive fuel because of its high energy content; however, because it is a gas it has poor volumetric energy density. In Chapter 2, ionic liquids consisting of both cations and anions that can undergo reversible dehydrogenative aromatization were used to chemically store hydrogen. Cations investigated included pyridinium ions, which were easily hydrogenated but could not be regenerated through the dehydrogenation of piperidinium ions; and carbazole containing ammonium (whose synthesis failed) and imidazolium (which failed to hydrogenate) cations. The anions studied were heterocyclic carboxylates and sulfonates, these ions were observed to undergo both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation to various degrees when reacted in solution. However, as components of ionic liquids, they fail to react at a significant rate. The viscosity of the fluids was suspected to be hindering the diffusion of either hydrogen or the ions to or from the catalyst surface.&#xD;
	In addition to using hydrogen as the primary source of energy in a vehicle, reversible hydrogenation can form the basis of a thermally regenerative fuel cell: a device that converts low grade vehicle waste heat, from a conventional engine, into electricity for the vehicles auxiliary power units. In Chapter 3, secondary benzylic alcohols, in particular 1-phenyl-1-propanol, were determined to be able to undergo dehydrogenation to the corresponding ketone rapidly and with extremely high selectivity over a palladium on silica catalyst. The dehydrogenation gave an initial rate of hydrogen evolution of 4.6 l of hydrogen per gram of palladium per minute and the enthalpy and entropy of the dehydrogenation is +56 kJ mol-1 and +117 J mol-1 K-1. This adsorbed energy can then be released as electricity in a fuel cell and be used to power auxiliary units in a vehicle without decreasing fuel economy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The idea of `probabilistic distances' (also called divergences), which in some sense assess how `close' two probability distributions are from one another, has been widely employed in probability, statistics, information theory, and related fields. Of particular importance due to their generality and applicability are the Renyi divergence measures. While the closely related concept of Renyi entropy of a probability distribution has been studied extensively, and closed-form expressions for the most common univariate and multivariate continuous distributions have been obtained and compiled, the literature currently lacks the corresponding compilation for continuous Renyi divergences. The present thesis addresses this issue for analytically tractable cases. Closed-form expressions for Kullback-Leibler divergences are also derived and compiled, as they can be seen as an extension by continuity of the Renyi divergences. Additionally, we establish a connection between Renyi divergence and the variance of the log-likelihood ratio of two distributions, which extends the work of Song (2001) on the relation between Renyi entropy and the log-likelihood function, and which becomes practically useful in light of the Renyi divergence expressions we have derived. Lastly, we consider the Renyi divergence rate between two zero-mean stationary Gaussian processes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Everyday speech perception frequently occurs in degraded listening conditions, against a background of noise, interruptions and intermingling voices. Despite these challenges, speech perception is remarkably successful, due in part to perceptual learning. Previous research has demonstrated more rapid perceptual learning of acoustically-degraded speech when listeners are given the opportunity to map the linguistic content of utterances, presented in clear auditory form, onto the degraded auditory utterance.  Here, I investigate whether learning is further enhanced by the provision of naturalistic facial gestural information, presented concurrently with either the clear auditory sentence (Experiment I), or with the degraded utterance (Experiment II). Recorded materials were noise-vocoded (4 frequency channels; 50- 8000 Hz). Noise-vocoding (NV) is a popular simulation of speech transduced through a cochlear implant, and 4-channel NV speech is difficult for naïve listeners to understand, but can be learned over several sentences of practice. In Experiment I, each trial began with an auditory-alone presentation of a degraded stimulus for report (D). In two conditions, this was followed by passive listening to either the clear spoken form and then the degraded form again (condition DCD), or the reverse (DDC); the former format of presentation (DCD) results in more efficient learning (Davis et al, 2005). Condition DCvD was similar to DCD, except that the clear spoken form was accompanied by facial gestural information (a talking face). The results indicate that presenting clear audiovisual feedback (DCvD) does not confer any advantage over clear auditory feedback (DCD). In Experiment II, two groups received a degraded sentence presentation with corresponding facial movements (Dv); the second group also received a second degraded (auditory-alone) presentation (DvD). Two control conditions and a baseline DCvD condition were also tested. Although they never received clear speech feedback, performance in the DvD group was significantly greater than in all others, indicating that perceptual learning mechanisms can capitalize on visual concomitants of speech. The DvD group outperformed the Dv group, suggesting that the second degraded presentation in the DvD condition further facilitates generalization of learning. These findings have important implications for improving comprehension of speech in an unfamiliar accent or following cochlear implantation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Research on social capital and physical activity has relied on proxy measures of trust and participation to assess individuals’ social capital. However, less is known about how social network capital is associated with physical inactivity. More recently, the association between neighbourhood context and health behaviours has been highlighted, suggesting that the social and physical environments can enhance or deter physical activity. The purpose of these two studies was to 1) assess and compare the association of trust, participation and network capital with physical inactivity; and 2) to assess the association between neighbourhood factors and physical inactivity in Montreal. These studies used data from the 2008 Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Health Survey (MoNNET-HA), which consisted of 2707 adults residing in 300 Montreal neighbourhoods. Physical inactivity was assessed using an adapted version of the short International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Social capital was measured in three forms: generalized trust, social participation, and network capital. Network capital was measured using a position generator and consisted of network diversity, upper reachability, and range dimensions. Neighbourhood socioeconomic status and population density were used to assess aspects of the neighbourhood social and built environment. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the association of physical inactivity with social capital and neighbourhood factors. In the first study, network diversity (OR: 0.88; 95% CIs:  0.80-0.96), and social participation (OR: 1.81; 95% CIs: 1.08-3.01) were significantly associated with lower odds of physical inactivity. This study directs attention towards the association between network capital and physical inactivity. Further investigation of network capital might lead to a better understanding of how social capital is associated with physical inactivity. In the second study, population density was significantly associated with lower odds of physical inactivity (OR: 0.97 95% C.I: 0.95, 0.99). Further investigation of neighbourhood context is recommended to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the association of neighbourhood population density and physical inactivity. Greater knowledge of neighbourhood context could lead to the development of supportive neighbourhood social and physical resources that promote and enhance physical activity behaviour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Adolescence is a developmental period marked by heightened emotional intensity, negative emotions, and self-consciousness. Problems with emotion regulation during adolescence have been linked to the development of internalizing and externalizing disorders (Hastings et al., 2009). Emotion regulation involves changes across several integrated emotion domains: (1) Experience, (2) Arousal, and (3) Expression (Ekman, 1992; Gross, 2007; Lang, 1994; Lazarus, 1991; Levenson, 1994). Emotion is not necessarily regulated equally across these three domains, in fact discordant responses are more common than concordant ones (Mauss &amp; Robinson, 2009). Discordance represents how emotion is being regulated during a specific event, but it has not been directly linked with habitual emotion regulation strategies. Different patterns among these emotional domains have been linked to internalizing and externalizing problems and coping skills (Hastings et al., 2009; Mauss et al, 2005; Zalewski et al., 2009a, b). The current study expands on previous research by (1) simultaneously measuring and analyzing experience, arousal, and expression, and (2) understanding how patterns of concordance and discordance relate to individual difference factors such as gender, habitual emotion regulation strategies, and internalizing and externalizing problems in a typically developing adolescent sample. &#xD;
	This study involved measuring the experience, arousal, and expression of self-conscious emotion in 138 adolescents (55% female) during a video-recorded social stressor speech task. Participants rated their emotional experience via questionnaire after the speech task. Physiological data were reduced from recordings during the speech and observational coders rated the emotional expression of participants from video files of the speeches. Patterns of responses across experience, arousal, and expression were grouped using cluster analysis. The different patterns of response were related to different profiles of habitual emotion regulation strategies and problematic internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Adolescents classified as “Experience-Expressive” (high experience, moderate arousal, high expression) or “Suppressive” (high experience, high arousal, low expression) had more problematic socioemotional functioning than those classified as “Expressive” (low experience, moderate arousal, high expression) or “Low-Reactive” (low experience, low arousal, low expression).   There was not strong evidence for differences across gender. The current study contributes to the understanding of adolescent emotional regulation and the development of psychopathology in adolescence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is devoted to a study of the effect of disorder on strongly correlated electrons. For non-interacting electrons, Anderson localization occurs if the amount of disorder is sufficient. For disorder-free systems, a Mott metal-insulator transition may occur if the electron-electron interactions are strong enough. The question we ask in this thesis is what happens when both disorder and interactions are present. We study the Anderson-Hubbard model, which is the simplest model to include both interactions and disorder, using a Gutzwiller variational wave function approach. We then study Anderson localization of electrons from the response of the Anderson-Hubbard Hamiltonian to an external magnetic field. An Aharonov-Bohm flux induces a persistent current in mesoscopic rings. Strong interactions result in two competing tendencies: they tend to suppress the current because of strong correlations, and they also screen the disorder potential and making the system more homogenous. We find that, for strongly interacting electrons, the localization length may be large, even though the current is suppressed by strong correlations. This unexpected result highlights how strongly correlated materials can be quiet di erent from weakly correlated ones.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>PEPC [PEP(phosphoenolpyruvate) carboxylase] is an essential and tightly controlled enzyme located at the core of plant C-metabolism. It fulfils a broad spectrum of non-photosynthetic functions, particularly the anaplerotic replenishment of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates consumed during biosynthesis and N-assimilation. In plants, a small multigene family encodes several closely related plant-type PEPC (PTPC) isozymes along with a distantly related bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC) isozyme. The PTPCs are well studied ~110-kDa subunits that typically exist as a homotetramer (Class-1 PEPC).  By contrast, little is known about the larger ~118-kDa BTPC isozyme except that it occurs in developing castor (Ricinus communis) endosperm in tight association with PTPC subunits as a ~900-kDa hetero-octameric complex (Class-2 PEPC) that is greatly desensitized to metabolic effectors compared to Class-1 PEPC. This thesis elucidates the physiological purpose of the BTPC subunits by examining their structure/function relationship within Class-2 PEPC and identifying mechanisms of post-translational control. Recombinant expression and purification of the castor bean BTPC revealed unusual physical and kinetic properties including a remarkable insensitivity to metabolic effectors and a dependence upon PTPC subunits for structural stability. The first purification of a non-proteolyzed plant Class-2 PEPC complex was performed, and the kinetic analysis determined that the BTPC and PTPC subunits have complimentary catalytic properties. The BTPC subunits’ high Km(PEP) and desensitization to metabolic effectors may function as a metabolic overflow mechanism for sustaining flux from PEP to malate when PTPC subunits become feedback inhibited. An anti-PTPC co-immunopurification strategy was utilized to highly enrich non-proteolyzed BTPC from developing castor endosperm for downstream immunological and mass spectrometric analysis. BTPC was in vivo phosphorylated at multiple novel sites, identified by mass spectrometry as Thr4 or 5, Ser425 and Ser451. Phosphosite-specific antibodies towards Ser425 and Ser451 confirmed the existence of these sites in vivo and comparisons of Ser425 phosphorylation patterns established that the castor BTPC and PTPC phosphorytation sites are regulated independently. Phosphomimetic mutants of Ser425 caused BTPC inhibition by increasing its Km(PEP) and sensitivity to feedback inhibition. These results establish a novel mechanism of PEPC control whose implications within plant carbon metabolism are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this report is to evaluate Ontario’s brownfields regulation through the policy maturity model introduced by Adams et al. (2010). This is an ideal time to evaluate Ontario’s progress toward policy maturity because the Province has recently adopted a new brownfields regulation, Regulation 511/09 under the Environmental Protection Act, which came into full force on July 1st, 2011.  According to the policy maturity model, brownfield policy maturity is achieved when policy creates a framework where brownfields are consistently viewed as a strategic source of profit by the private sector (Adams et al. 2010).&#xD;
	The report begins by providing a summary of the progress Ontario has made in terms of brownfield policy over the past decade, including the introduction of Regulation 153/04, Records of Site Conditions, and Community Improvement Plans. Regulation 153/04 governed the investigation and remediation processes prior to Regulation 511/09. Records of Site Conditions were introduced to decrease liability associated with redevelopment, and Community Improvement Plans can provide financial incentive for redevelopment.  &#xD;
Next, this report summarizes the key changes introduced by Regulation 511/09, including the new generic standards for acceptable concentrations of contaminants, the new requirements for Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments and the new Streamlined Risk Assessment process. Third, this report introduces the steps of the policy maturity model through which Regulation 511/09 is evaluated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the potential ability of nano-scale zerovalent iron (nZVI) to remediate multiple metal contaminants, specifically in the context of mine tailings. The project began by adopting techniques reported on by investigators researching the remediation effectiveness on metal contaminants of nZVI within the framework of civil engineering applications, such as groundwater treatment (Karabelli et al, 2008). This phase of the project saw the treatment of laboratory prepared samples of copper contaminated waters (at 10, 30, 50 and 100 ppm) by the addition of unstabilized nZVI. Results showed that all but the 100 ppm samples were effectively cleared of nearly all metal contamination following treatment additions of 1 mL nZVI to 50 mL of sample water. The second phase of the project sought to expand on this success by subjecting laboratory prepared water samples containing multiple metal contaminants to the same dose on nZVI. A collection of metal contaminants, known as the Arctic Suite, containing arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, nickel, lead and zinc, was made up as contaminated waters (at 1, 3, 5, and 10 ppm concentrations) and was tested for nZVI remediation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results showed that only the 10 ppm samples were not effectively remediated and furthermore showed preferential treatment of arsenic, chromium and lead instead of an even distribution of treatment amongst all metal contaminants present. The final phase of the project saw the testing of contaminated waters produced from five mine tailings, acquired from separate sources, by the same dose of nZVI as in the first two phases of the project. Results showed that where contaminant metals were present some remediation effect did occur. However, an inability to produce highly contaminated leachates from the mine tailings meant that no trends in nZVI remediation effectiveness could be determined with any certainty.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
The intent of this study was to explore the life and values of three home schooled adolescents with learning disabilities and their families, to determine the level of social inclusion for the students and to examine academic individualization within the learning process of these students. The data were collected through interviews with teaching parents, the students and non-parent coaches or teachers. Observations took place in the home and outside the home in various locations for each student. Socially, the role of interest, context, friendships and social networks were all significant factors. Academically, the home school environment provided a dynamic intersection of different schooling environments with instructional characteristics that were deemed essential for learning. &#xD;
Despite the differences between families, the themes were similar across the case studies. The social landscape of these students looks different from regularly schooled children but it is healthy, with many opportunities for friendship and social networks. The academic environment allows for the advantages of tutorial and small-group instruction as well as opportunities to be included in larger, classroom-style groups in certain contexts. These three case studies demonstrate that home schooling can support the needs of children with learning disabilities through instructional strategies and through contextual advantages. For non-home schoolers, the qualities found within this context are promising and worth considering in other educational environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The dynamics of molecules in the gas and liquid phase is investigated using ultrafast&#xD;
optical techniques. The development of sub-25 fs ultrafast sources using noncollinear optical parametric amplification is discussed. These intense pulses are utilized in coherent&#xD;
anti-Stokes Raman scattering to investigate vibrational motion in I2 Br2 and&#xD;
IBr.&#xD;
For larger bio-molecules relevant dynamics may not be related to the absorption of&#xD;
light. Here, a new technique is introduced, in which an optically excitable molecule&#xD;
is incorporated into the bio-molecule. Photoisomerization of the trigger molecule&#xD;
initiates structural rearrangement in the larger system. To demonstrate this approach,&#xD;
azobenzene was synthesized into short strands of DNA to time-resolve base&#xD;
pair destacking dynamics and DNA melting. The isomerization of azobenzene in thin&#xD;
polymer films (and their corresponding change in optical properties) was also used to write birefringence and surface relief gratings. This method was used to demonstrate&#xD;
a rewritable Bragg filter for telecom wavelengths.&#xD;
Lastly, an alternative to typical crystal based wavemixing is presented for the generation of ultrafast tunable ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet pulses. The approach utilizes difference frequency four wave mixing in hollow waveguides filled with noble gas.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“Red coats and wild birds: military culture and ornithology across the nineteenth-century British Empire” investigates the intersections between British military culture and the practices and ideas of ornithology, with a particular focus on the British Mediterranean.  Considering that British officers often occupied several imperial sites over the course of their military careers, to what extent did their movements shape their ornithological knowledge and identities at “home” and abroad?  How did British military naturalists perceive different local cultures (with different attitudes to hunting, birds, field science, etc.) and different local natures (different sets of birds and environments)?  How can trans-imperial careers be written using not only textual sources (for example, biographies and personal correspondence) but also traces of material culture?  In answering these questions, I centre my work on the Mediterranean region as a “colonial sea” in the production of hybrid identities and cultural practices, and the mingling of people, ideas, commodities, and migratory birds.  I focus on the life geographies of four military officers: Thomas Wright Blakiston, Andrew Leith Adams, L. Howard Lloyd Irby, and Philip Savile Grey Reid.  By the mid-nineteenth century, the Mediterranean region emerged as a crucial site for the security of the British “empire route” to India and South Asia, especially with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.  Military stations served as trans-imperial sites, connecting Britain to India through the flow of military manpower, commodities, information, and bodily experiences across the empire.  By using a “critical historical geopolitics of empire” to examine the material remnants of the “avian imperial archive,” I demonstrate how the practices and performances of British military field ornithology helped to: materialize the British Mediterranean as a moral “semi-tropical” place for the physical and cultural acclimatization of British officers en route to and from India; reinforce imperial presence in the region; and make “visible in new ways” the connectivity of North Africa to Europe through the geographical distribution of birds.  I also highlight the ways in which the production of ornithological knowledge by army officers was entwined with forms of temperate martial masculinity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examines the mentalities and sensibilities of government that get (re)produced in one programmatic narrative about ‘child abuse’ and child homicide. It shows how a perspective of governance takes shape through the lens and language of risk, and how a discourse of risk can take very different forms even within one governmental programme.  Empirically the study examines the major report released from the Public Inquiry into Pediatric Forensic Pathology in Ontario (known after its chairperson as the Goudge Inquiry/Report). The Goudge Inquiry (2008) was commissioned by the Ontario government in the wake of a Chief Coroner’s Review into the problematic practices of Dr. Charles Smith, the province’s most trusted paediatric forensic pathologist for nearly 15 years. The resultant Goudge Report presents a rationalization of Ontario’s paediatric death investigation system and its failures. It presents an ideal-typical narrative that carves out the image of a fully formed and perfected risk management complex for combatting ‘child abuse’. To understand the mentalities and sensibilities of government that shape and get shaped by the Report’s risk management narrative, this study probes what ‘risk’ does in the Goudge Report. Risk discourse in this case proves to be entangled in a ‘volatile and contradictory’ set of ‘superficial’ connections, associations and activities, one that operates at the nexus of ‘common sense’ mentalities and populist sensibilities. That the Report depends for its rhetorical power on the silencing of alternative claims, discourses and rationales is central to this analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prisoners are among the most vulnerable categories of citizens in every country, due to the large amount of control the state has over them. Enforcing Human Rights Law is a challenge in all areas that it covers. However, ensuring human rights for those behind bars sometimes seems nearly impossible because of the isolation, the lack of interest of the outside world and mostly because of the sometimes conflicting goals that Correctional Law and Human Rights Law seem to have. &#xD;
This is why this thesis focuses on the protection of convicts against torture and ill-treatment. The structure is that of a comparison between the regional protection granted to these people by the European Court of Human Rights and the local avenues granted in Canada, a country that does not benefit from a regional protection for its citizens. The purpose is to analyze how convicts can best fight abuses in a world where their inherent rights are increasingly ignored in the name of security. The parallel between a regional system and a national one will be developed by discussing and comparing the shared human rights framework provided by international instruments, the case law and the evolving principles for convicts’ protection in Europe and Canada, the abuses that take place in both regions under consideration and, finally, how these abuses are addressed and remediated by the authorities. &#xD;
I conclude by pointing out the importance of developing a strong national correctional system that obeys Human Rights Law and that is permanently under the national courts’ jurisdiction. Nevertheless, based on this analysis, I believe it is crucial that there also be an external monitoring and juridical mechanism that can enforce human rights when the national authorities deliberately or accidentally ignore them. It is hazardous to leave the protection of human rights, especially of those in an enclosed environment, to the state which sometimes has conflicting interests and which in most cases is the one that trespasses them.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Major Depressive Disorder is a highly prevalent and recurrent psychological disorder, affecting approximately 12% of Canadians across their lifetime and 5% each year. Studies have shown that a history of childhood maltreatment increases risk for depression by conferring a vulnerability to the effects of stressful life events (i.e., stress sensitization). The goal of the current investigation was to examine whether the relation between childhood maltreatment and stress sensitization in depression is influenced by age group and depression history. This study also sought to investigate whether specific characteristics of the maltreatment experience differentially relate to stress sensitization. Two hundred and seven clinically depressed adolescents (i.e., 12 – 17 years; n = 59) and adults (i.e., 18 – 64 years; n = 148) participated in this study. Childhood accounts of maltreatment were assessed using the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Scale, and stressful life events experienced 3 months prior to depression onset were assessed using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule. Results revealed that individuals with a history of severe maltreatment reported lower severity levels of stressful life events prior to depression onset than did those without such a history, but only among adolescents. Further, this relation was specific to independent stressors (i.e., those totally or nearly totally independent of the behaviour of the individual) and not dependent stressors (i.e., those at least partly due to the individual’s behaviour), and was specific to emotional abuse. Results also suggested that it is the experience of severe maltreatment, rather than particular aspects of it, that sensitizes individuals to the effects of stress. In summary, this study provides support for the relation of childhood maltreatment to stress sensitization in adolescents. Maltreated adolescents may be especially vulnerable to the depressogenic effects of stress, perhaps because their maltreatment experience is more proximal to depression onset. In contrast, other relevant processes (e.g., cognitive schema and neurobiological consolidation, chronic stress) may drive stress sensitization in adulthood; however, further research is required to investigate such mechanisms. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My dissertation examines the traces of inverse (mytho)mysticism, more synchronous with mythical alchemy than transcendent mystery, in H.D.’s mature work (1946-1961).  Whereas H.D.’s earliest works respond to a fin de siècle occultism and a collective psyche troubled by the eschatological distress that, as Susan Acheson writes, “was widespread amongst modernist writers grappling with …world events and with the implications of Nietzsche’s inaugural annunciation of modernity in terms of the death of God” (187), her later oeuvre is dedicated to the same work of soul undertaken by the “secret cult of Night” in Vale Ave.  Here, her thematic scope faces two ways: backward to ancient Greek mystery cults and their palingenesic rites and forward to depth psychologists searching for the Soul of the World. Vale Ave plays a pronounced role in my study as symbolic guide; in its seventy-four sequences the layering of time in the “trilogy” of past, present, and future that H.D. had explored during the years of the Second World War in order to get behind the fallen walls of cause and effect collapses into two distinct phases of human origin—“meeting” (evolution) and “parting” (involution)—and the poem invites Lilith and Lucifer to be its archetypal guides. My method for the study is imaginal, entering such disciplines as history, philosophy, and theology and bringing psychological understanding to them.&#xD;
	John Walsh’s introduction to Vale Ave notes H.D.’s theme “that the human psyche exists in a dimension outside of time and space as well as within them. In Vale Ave, H.D. presents the extremity of this dual-dimensionality: metempsychosis” (vii).  However, the concept that H.D. investigates is more than a literary processus of characters who adopt different masks and appear at various junctures in a chronological unwinding of history.  I explore H.D.'s works as part of a Modernist tradition of writing “books of the dead” designed not to guide the soul after death, but to draw the gaze upon “a nearer thing,” as H.D. writes in Erige Cor Tuum Ad Me In Caelum, the wisdom intrinsic in the spirit of life itself.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ultrasound elevation beamwidth is the out of plane thickness causing image artefacts&#xD;
normally appearing around anechoic areas in the medium. These artefacts could also&#xD;
cause uncertainties in localizing objects (such as a surgical needle) in the ultrasound&#xD;
image slices. This thesis studies the clinical significance of elevation beamwidth artefacts&#xD;
in needle insertion procedures. A new measurement device was constructed to&#xD;
measure the transrectal ultrasound elevation beamwidth. The beam profiles of various&#xD;
lateral and axial distances to the transducer were generated. It is shown that&#xD;
the ultrasound elevation beamwidth converges to a point within its focal zone close&#xD;
to the transducer. This means that the transrectal ultrasound images have the best&#xD;
resolution within the focal zone of the ultrasound close to the transducer. It is also&#xD;
shown that the ultrasound device settings have a considerable impact on the amount&#xD;
of beamwidth artefacts. Needle tip localization error was examined for a curvilinear&#xD;
transrectal ultrasound transducer. Beveled prostate brachytherapy needles were inserted&#xD;
through all holes of a grid template orthogonal to the axial beam axis. The&#xD;
effects of device imaging parameters were also investigated on the amount of localization&#xD;
error. Based on the developed results, it was found that the imaging parameters&#xD;
of an ultrasound device have direct impact on the amount of object localization error&#xD;
from 0.5 mm to 4 mm. The smallest localization error occurs laterally close to the center of the grid template, and axially within the beam’s focal zone. Similarly, the&#xD;
largest localization error occurs laterally around both sides of the grid template, and&#xD;
axially within the beam’s far field. Using the ultrasound device with appropriate&#xD;
imaging settings could minimize the effects of these artefacts. We suggest to reduce&#xD;
the gain setting of the ultrasound device. This will reduce the energies assigned to&#xD;
the off-axis beams and as a result, the elevation beamwidth artefacts are minimized.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The growth in the number of individuals with end-stage renal disease has implications in terms of both the health of individuals, especially older adults (aged 65 years and older), and the capacity of the health care system to provide adequate treatment needed by these patients. Much has been written regarding the pathophysiology of end-stage renal disease as well as how modern advances in technology have contributed to the ‘dialysis world’. However, the literature is sparse in relation to how older adults experience end-stage renal disease and the technological complexity of dialysis in their daily lives.&#xD;
Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the meaning of being hemodialysis-dependent for the older adult living with end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
Method: A descriptive method using a qualitative interviewing approach was used. Systematic focused thematic analysis guided by the Crisis of Physical Illness conceptual model allowed for the findings to surface. Data sources included individual interviews, direct observation of participants and the hemodialysis unit, along with field notes. A purposive sample of nine participants was obtained from two different hemodialysis units, both operated by Kingston General Hospital. Data were analyzed using the Colaizzi method.&#xD;
Findings: Five themes were identified by the participants: The Will to Live, Recognition of a Lifetime Commitment, Learning to Live with Technology, The Yin and Yang of Dialysis, and Transcending Dialysis. &#xD;
Conclusions: End-stage renal disease and thrice weekly hemodialysis treatment have an impact on the daily life of older adults and their ability to cope with the changes. This study revealed that despite the restrictions of being on hemodialysis, all of the participants had the will to live and some expressed the need for further education using a variety of strategies that would meet the specific needs of this population. A more in-depth understanding of how older adults experience hemodialysis is needed to provide adequate care/resources for this special population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate how purposeful metacognitive instruction affected students’ use of metacognitive skills and their abilities to solve complex chemistry problems. The pilot (n = 18 to 26) and study (n = 21) groups were enrolled in separate Ontario Grade 11 university preparation chemistry classes. A quasi-experimental intervention was implemented, using the pilot study as a control.  A Metacognitive Framework that outlined metacognitive skills specific to problem solving in chemistry formed the foundation for the intervention. Pre- and post-test self report questionnaires measuring students’ use of metacognitive skills (MCAI) and the problem solving tasks (i.e., PSTs) were used to measure the impact of the intervention. Data about students’ metacognitive and problem solving processes were also collected for the study group from: (a) think aloud pair problem solving (TAPPS) protocols, (b) an exit interview with the classroom teacher, (c) the students’ lab reports for two design labs, and (d) a survey of students’ use of the Metacognitive Framework.&#xD;
	One way repeated measures ANOVA indicated that the pre- and post-test MCAI scores were not significantly different within and between the pilot and study groups. A comparison of the higher and lower achievement subgroups within the study group revealed that over time, the mean scores on the MCAI increased for the higher achievement group and decreased for the lower achievement group. One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the post-test PST scores were significantly higher than the pre-test scores, and the groups differed significantly from each other with the study group scoring higher on both scores. While the statistical analyses revealed few differences, the teacher’s exit interview, TAPPS protocols, pre- and post-test lab reports, and student survey of the Metacognitive Framework indicated that the intervention supported students’ abilities to solve complex chemistry problems and use metacognitive skills associated with planning, monitoring, and evaluation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) encompasses a segment of individuals with major depressive disorder who are severely ill in terms of chronicity, comorbidity, and prognosis.  Although functional impairment is a prominent and costly feature of treatment-resistance, very little is known about the factors that contribute to and maintain functional impairment in TRD.  &#xD;
Purpose: This study examined the relationships among neurocognition, symptoms, and functional impairment in TRD.  Specifically, I examined the neurocognitive impairments that relate to different symptom domains and to level of symptom severity, as well as the predictors of functional outcomes and real-world behaviour in TRD.  &#xD;
Method: Patients (N = 29) with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder were recruited from the Mood Disorders Treatment and Research Service at Providence Care Mental Health Services in Kingston, Ontario.  Data were collected during a baseline assessment for a neurocognitive enhancement therapy program.&#xD;
Results:  Individuals with TRD show mild to moderate impairments across all neurocognitive domains, with a superimposed severe impairment in verbal working memory.  Verbal working memory significantly correlated with depressive symptoms and anxiety, such that increased verbal working memory capacity was related to more severe clinical symptoms.  Greater response inhibition significantly correlated with less anxiety.  Interpersonal competence was predicted by sustained attention and severity of depressive symptoms.  Adaptive competence was significantly predicted by age at baseline and set shifting.  Real-world work behaviour, interpersonal relations, and general satisfaction were predicted by the severity of depressive symptoms, whereas observed mood and anxiety predicted real-world recreational activity.  &#xD;
Conclusions: The current study pioneered some of the first data regarding the relationships among neurocognition, symptoms, and functional outcomes in treatment-resistant depression.  Verbal working memory appears to play an important role in the symptomatology of TRD.  Neurocognitive variables and depressive symptoms are important in predicting functional competence (what one can do) but only depressive symptoms predict functional performance (what one actually does in the real world). There may be additional intrinsic or extrinsic factors that mediate the relationships among neurocognition, symptoms, and functioning in TRD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The current stimuli of climate change and rising oil prices have spurred the development of hybrid electric (HEV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV): collectively termed EVs. However, the battery technology needs much development: at the time of writing, the range of a BEV is too low to be practical in many situations. A critical limitation is the sensitivity of batteries to temperature: the heat generated during operation affects their performance and reduces the lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
This study investigates battery cooling using cooling plates: thin rectangular fabrications inserted between battery cells. A coolant pumped through internal channels absorbs heat and transports it away from the battery. Previous studies of liquid heat exchangers have indicated that the geometry of the channels plays a significant role in the performance; however, there is a lack of rigorous numerical optimization applied to EV cooling plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
By developing a numerical optimization framework utilizing parametric geometry generation and computational fluid dynamics, this research has investigated the characteristics of optimum cooling plate geometry with respect to three objectives: average temperature, temperature uniformity, and coolant pressure drop. By applying each objective separately, improvements of up to 70% have been made compared to a reference design. The influence of boundary conditions on performance and optimum design has been assessed, and multi-objective optimization has investigated the trade-off between competing objective functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Although care should be taken when extrapolating the results beyond the geometry and conditions in the study, some general design principles can be proposed. Objectives of average temperature and pressure drop can both be satisfied by a common design with wide cooling channels, but different characteristics are needed for temperature uniformity. Additional assessments have revealed that optimizations of temperature uniformity are especially sensitive to the boundary conditions, whereas the other objective functions are largely insensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
The optimization process developed in this work can be applied to any potential cooling plate design and will lead to gains in the targeted performance measure. In doing so, the performance of the EV will be incrementally improved, thereby advancing the day when an EV is not only an environmental choice, but also a practical choice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We introduce real second-order freeness in second-order noncommutative probability spaces.  We demonstrate that under this definition, independent ensembles of the three real models of random matrices which we consider, namely real Ginibre matrices, Gaussian orthogonal matrices, and real Wishart matrices, are asymptotically second-order free.  These ensembles do not satisfy the complex definition of second-order freeness satisfied by their complex analogues.  This definition may be used to calculate the asymptotic fluctuations of products of matrices in terms of the fluctuations of each ensemble.&#xD;
&#xD;
We use a combinatorial approach to the matrix calculations similar to genus expansion, but in which nonorientable surfaces appear, demonstrating the commonality between the real ensembles and the distinction from their complex analogues, motivating this distinct definition.  We generalize the description of graphs on surfaces in terms of the symmetric group to the nonorientable case.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the real case we find, in addition to the terms appearing in the complex case corresponding to annular spoke diagrams, an extra set of terms corresponding to annular spoke diagrams in which the two circles of the annulus are oppositely oriented, and in which the matrix transpose appears.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: We evaluated the validity of a set of 11 quality indicators for prostate cancer radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy by examining their association with outcomes. The selected indicators were: hospital volume, pre-treatment risk assessment, patient consultation with a radiation oncologist, appropriate follow-up care, leg immobilization during radiotherapy, bladder filling during radiotherapy, portal film target localization, use of nerve sparing surgery, operative blood loss, margin status and pelvic lymph node dissection. The selected outcomes were: cause-specific survival, disease-free survival, late morbidity (urinary incontinence, gastrointestinal and genitourinary morbidity), change in node stage from clinical N0 to pathologic N1, and margin status. Methods: Our study sample consisted of 1570 prostate cancer patients who were diagnosed in Ontario between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1998 who received radical prostatectomy within 6 months of diagnosis (n=646), or curative radiotherapy within 9 months of diagnosis (n=924). Quality of care, outcomes, and potential confounders were measured using patient chart and administrative data. Regression techniques were used to evaluate the associations between quality indicators and relevant outcomes. Results: For patients treated surgically, hospital volume met our test of validity. Patients treated in the lowest volume hospital (0-1 RP/month) were at greater risk of prostate cancer death than patients treated in the highest volume hospitals (7+ RP/month) (HR=5.37 95% CI=1.23-23.46). For patients treated with radiotherapy, leg immobilization and bladder filling during radiotherapy met our test of validity. Patients treated without leg immobilization were more likely to experience urinary incontinence (RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.23-3.87) and genitourinary late morbidities (RR=1.72, 95% CI=1.16-2.56) than patients who received leg immobilization. Patients who were treated with an empty bladder were more likely to experience GU late morbidities (RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.08-3.63) than those treated with a full bladder. The remaining indicators did not meet our test of validity. Conclusion: Our results support the validity of one surgical quality indicator and two radiotherapy quality indicators. Explanations for our non-significant findings, including limited study power, data quality, our definition and measurement of indicators, and a true failure to predict outcome(s) are discussed, and recommendations for further research are presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability to process and respond to environmental cues requires the transformation of a sensory stimulus into an appropriate motor response, a process known as a sensorimotor transformation. The anti-saccade task can be used to investigate the ability of a subject to suppress a reflexive saccade towards a visual stimulus (pro-saccade) and generate a voluntary saccade 180° away from it.  Additional steps are involved in the anti-saccade sensorimotor transformation that do not occur in the pro-saccade, which may produce performance differences between pro- and anti-saccade metrics. We were interested in exploring these differences to gain insight on the mechanism of the sensorimotor transformation of the anti-saccade and to uncover any directional biases in saccadic performance. Two experiments were performed, one in which stimuli were presented at 20 angular positions with a constant eccentricity of 12°, and another using 18 possible eccentricities along the horizontal. Pro-saccades had faster SRTs and velocities, larger amplitudes, higher accuracy and less variation in their trajectories than anti-saccades. Pro- and anti-saccade performance was shown to exhibit a similar dependence on both saccade goal direction and eccentricity. Differences manifested as a generalized reduction in anti-saccade performance that can be described as a scalar multiple of pro-saccade performance at all locations. Possible causes of this reduced performance were speculated to be i) the involvement of higher cortical structures, ii) errors in the internal representation of the stimulus, iii) sensorimotor coordinate transformation inaccuracy, and iv) online updating of the motor plan and the speed accuracy trade off inherent to saccades. The results of this study are comparable to previous monkey and human studies however certain differences were found that require further investigation. Further investigation is also required to determine the validity of the possible causes of performance reduction in the anti-saccade task and their specific contributions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project investigates the English-language life writing of diasporic Iranian Jewish women.  It examines how these women have differentially imagined their diasporic lives and travels, and how they have in turn been imagined and accepted or rejected by their audiences.  In the first chapter, I use “home” as a lens for understanding three distinct life writing texts, showing how the authors write about what it means to have a home and to be at home in contrasting and even contradictory ways.  I show how, despite potential hegemonic readings that perpetuate unequal relationships and a normative definition of the ideal home, the texts are open to multiple contestatory readings that create spaces for new formulations and understandings.  In the second chapter, I look more closely at the intersections between trauma stories and the life writing of Iranian Jewish women, and I argue that readers use life writing texts about trauma to support an egocentric reconstruction of American democracy and dominance.  I also show how a critical frame for understanding trauma can yield interpretations that highlight, rather than ignore, relationships of power and privilege.  In the final chapter of the thesis, I present a case study of two online reading groups, and I show that communal reading environments, though they participate in dominant discourses, are also spaces where resistance and subversion can develop.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the experiences of women in the military using narratives published by military servicewomen from Canada and the United States. The success of traditionally “female” bodies in combat-related trades in the military destabilizes the binary opposition between “male” and “female” in western society. Nevertheless, women are still excluded from identifying with the “soldier ideal” that is emphasized in western militaries and must make alternative “hybrid” identifications in order to articulate their understanding of their experiences in the military. Gender integration needs to be rethought in hyper-masculine military institutions. Since “hybrid” identities can be seen emerging in military servicewomen, members of the military have a unique opportunity to rethink the “soldier ideal” in order to make room for bodies that express gender identifications other than “male.” While military servicewomen adapt to their roles by generating “hybrid” identifications in the “Third Space” between the “soldier ideal” and feminine identities, military men are excluded from accessing the benefits of women’s “hybrid” identifications.&#xD;
Men, women, and other emergent gender identities need to engage in a theatrical exploration of their experiences to investigate the possibility of generating new military ideals that resist social constructions that oppose gender integration. It is crucial that research about the experiences of women in the military involve bodies in order to acknowledge that these women experience resistance to their presence because their bodies visibly differ from the masculinised “soldier ideal.” Some of this experience cannot be articulated verbally. I work toward creating the conditions for bodies to engage with my research by combining a theatrical script with an accompanying analytic essay.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>X-ray and neutron computed tomography (CT) have been used successfully for the non-destructive imaging of artifact in art conservation.  These applications range from object investigations to the use of micro-focus CT for experimental studies.  While there is precedent for the use of CT in art conservation, the method is still limited in application partially due to restricted access to facilities and the high cost of producing publishable results.  The purpose of this study was to identify alternative CT methods including the use of different radiation sources and industrial imaging system.   Both investigations of the use of low-flux neutron CT at the Royal Military College in Kingston compared to high-flux neutron CT at the Advanced Neutron Tomography And Radiography Experimental System (ANTARES) at FRM-II in Garching, Munich and the use of megavoltage gamma ray computed tomography at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston successfully imaged the corroded metal artifacts.  The artifacts investigated were from the Diniacopoulos Collection at Queen’s University and were underwater concretions of L’Anse aux Bouleaux provided by Parks Canada.  This study also evaluated the Xradia XCT-400 for comparison to similar systems used in conservation.  This evaluation also provided successful images of corroded metal coins from the Diniacopoulos Collection for use in identification.&#xD;
To address the issue of cost prohibitive image analysis programs, a workflow using the open-source software programs ImageVis3D, 3DSlicer and ImageJ was developed.  This workflow would enable researchers and conservators to produce publishable images and analyze the information in the CT data sets.   Additionally, this workflow addresses some common research questions that might arise during investigations that would guide conservators in optimizing their imaging parameters and image analysis.  The combination of the alternative radiation sources and the open-source workflow allows for greater accessibility of CT for conservators and researchers.  While the preliminary success of the study is promising, more research is needed to optimize the scanning parameters and image analysis through the use of phantoms and comparisons to traditional investigative methods in conservation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ordered mesoporous silicas have been shown to have a variety of useful applications ranging from adsorbents for containments to supports for catalysts. While these materials have received a good deal of attention in the literature there is still much opportunity for new technologies. We present research describing a novel approach to incorporate functionality onto the pore surfaces of these materials as well as a highly active catalyst for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our approach to selectively graft functionality on to the pore walls of the mesoporous silicas SBA-15 and MCM-41 involves treating the materials loaded with a structure directing agent (SDA), with hexamethyldisilazane that passivates the external surface through silylation. Once the SDA is removed the mesopores can be functionalized selectively using standard methods. A test designed to look at the passivation layer is also described.&#xD;
&#xD;
The catalyst developed is designated Pd-SBA-15-SH(g) and it is active for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. The activity, recyclability and leaching of Pd-SBA-15-SH(g) was found to be superior to related materials. A mechanistic analysis suggests the catalyst is a reservoir for soluble Pd metal.&#xD;
&#xD;
A key challenge that is holding back wide scale application of ammonia borane (NH3BH3) as a hydrogen storage material for mobile applications is the dearth of regeneration strategies. Presented are our forays into the development of an organic hydride based regeneration strategy. The first phase of the project focused on the reaction between Hantzsch esters and B(C6F5)3. N-substituted Hantzsch esters were found to transfer hydride to boron in &gt;90 % yield. Mechanistic analysis of the reaction suggests either a SET mechanism or a highly asynchronous transition state. A novel hydride transfer equilibrium promoted by B(C6F5)3 was observed and it operated at temperatures below -10 ºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
N,N-ditertbutyl-dihydroimidazole is also an effective hydride donor to B(C6F5)3 as well as other Lewis acids that are more relevant mimics to those invoked in regeneration schemes. When the redistribution of B(SPh)3 is carried out with N,N-ditertbutyl-dihydroimidazole in the presence of NEt3 and CH2Cl2 at 50 ºC, BH2(NEt)3(SPh) is formed. CH2Cl2 functions as a thiol scavenger under the reaction conditions. 1-Octene trapping experiments provided indirect evidence for the formation of diborane, a critical component in the regeneration of NH3BH3.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this mixed-methods study I report on a three-part investigation related to reading intervention at Grade 1 in one Ontario school board during the 2009-2010 school year.  First, I report the results that Peer Assisted Learning Strategies (PALS) had on the reading outcomes for all Grade 1 students (n = 436) in terms of sex, aboriginal status, and at-risk status.  Second, I use progress monitoring benchmark data to show how students unresponsive to instruction may have benefitted from additional instruction generated from monthly data-informed In-School Team meetings. Third, I report on educators’ perceptions of how monthly data-informed In-School Team meetings influenced their knowledge, confidence, and willingness to plan additional reading interventions for students persistently at-risk for reading failure.  Findings indicate that compared to previous years, when PALS was not used, students in this study made significantly greater gains in reading scores.  Boys made similar gains to girls, First Nations students made similar gains to non First Nations students, and at-risk students closed the achievement gap slightly with their typically-achieving peers.  For students who did not make adequate progress in reading throughout the year a logistic regression analysis of the data indicates that the best predictor of at-risk status is not a student’s sex or First Nations status, but their letter sound fluency and word identification fluency scores at the beginning of the school year.  Findings also indicate that the slope of improvement in reading scores for nonresponders begins to increase once In-School Team meetings begin.  Educators’ perceptions of how the monthly In-School team meetings influenced practice differed according to the perceived role that each held of his or her position, and according to the level of involvement, training, and access that each had to the data used in this study.  The more professional development that educators had in the theory, use, and application of progress monitoring data the more likely they were to report that they were willing to use it to inform their practice.  Likewise, the more access that educators had to the data in terms of collecting, viewing, and interpreting it, the more likely they were in reporting knowledge, confidence, and willingness to use it to plan additional interventions for students.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) is a long-established image processing library used for image analysis, visualisation, and image-guided surgery applications. ITK is a collection of C++ classes that can potentially pose usability problems for users without appropriate C++ programming experience. In order to remove the programming complexities and facilitate rapid prototyping, an implementation of ITK within a higher-level visual programming environment is presented: SimITK. ITK functionalities are automatically wrapped into "blocks" within the visual programming environment of MATLAB, Simulink, where these blocks can be connected to form workflows: visual schematics that closely represent the structure of a C++ program. The heavily C++ templated nature of ITK does not facilitate direct interaction between Simulink and ITK; an intermediary is required to convert respective datatypes and allow intercommunication. As such, a SimITK "Virtual Block" has been developed that serves as a wrapper around the ITK class responsible for resolving the datatypes used by ITK to native types used by Simulink. Part of this challenge surrounds the automated capturing and storage of the pertinent class information (name, inputs/outputs, acceptable datatypes, and allowed dimensionalities) that needs to be reflected within the final block representation. The WrapITK package, included with ITK, serves to generate initial class representations as complex eXtended Markup Language (XML) files that are consolidated and refined to organise the information into an easily accessible structure when extracting during wrapping. Once refined, the data are transferred into custom-written SimITK-templates - one template for each required filetype - through a series of custom-keyword substitutions that replace special keywords with appropriately retrieved XML information and/or programming code. The primary result from the SimITK wrapping procedure is the generation of multiple Simulink Block libraries. From these libraries, blocks are selected and interconnected to demonstrate case study examples: a 3D segmentation workflow using cranial-CT data and a 3D MRI-to-CT registration workflow. Suggestions for future development are included as well as several appendices containing a list of classes, code comparisons between ITK C++ and SimITK workflow, installation documentation (both user and developer), as well as example file templates used to integrate ITK within Simulink.</dcterms:abstract>
