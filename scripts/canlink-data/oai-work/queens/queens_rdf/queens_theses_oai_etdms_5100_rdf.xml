      <dcterms:abstract>My dissertation is divided into four parts. Chapter one summarizes and analyzes data on the Canadian banking system using data from CANSIM and a little used dataset from OSFI. I describe how the Canadian banks earn revenue, fund business activities, and pay expenses and a broad overview of the data, accounting rules, and trends in Canadian banking. Chapter two is an in-depth study on cost efficiency and returns to scale (RTS) in Canadian banking, and I estimate a transcendental log cost function for the six largest Canadian commercial banks. To my knowledge, this is the first work to find evidence of constant RTS among the Canadian banks and it is robust to a number of different asset and price specifications. In Chapter three, I compare the U.S. and Canadian banks from 1996 to 2015 and estimate both a trans-log cost function and, for robustness, an input-oriented distance function. Among the ten largest U.S. commercial banks, I find that constant returns to scale best describes the average bank in this period. However, the smaller banks in the sample exhibited increasing RTS but this became exhausted as bank size increased. In Chapter four, I apply a stress test model based on the work of Duarte and Eisenbach (2015) to estimate potential fire-sale losses in the Canadian banking system from 1996 to 2015. I find that the major banks are resilient to all but the most extreme event. This is because (i) Canada has strong macroprudential regulation that improves the quality of assets, (ii) if given a scenario of severe losses, banks retain a sufficient quantity of liquid assets that these could be used to meet short-term liabilities, and (iii) sufficient equity is available to absorb significant losses. However there remain some areas of concern. Using aggregate vulnerability (AV), I find that the Canadian banking system has become more vulnerable to a fire-sale episode since 2011 which could suggest a rising probability of future losses. The concentration of loans-to-households, including residential mortgages and consumer loans, should be of some concern to regulators.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Classical liberalism has wrongly been regarded as an ideology that rejects the welfare state. This study endeavours to replace this far too common reading of the classical liberal tradition with an approach I term “rule egalitarianism”. Not only is classical liberalism compatible with social justice, but it can also help us understand why some egalitarian endeavours are an essential feature of a market society. If a necessary link exists between the classical liberal tradition and the moral and institutional dimensions of the rule of law, then this tradition is bound to uphold a substantial form of social justice.&#xD;
&#xD;
Coherence requires that classical liberals adopt an authentic egalitarian program by which I mean that if the set of beliefs classical liberals like Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Richard Epstein have favoured is justified, then it follows that we should have social justice in market societies. The neoclassical liberal tradition, represented by scholars like Jason Brenan and John Tomasi, has recently argued that social justice requires market capitalism. My argument, conversely, is slightly more ambitious – market capitalism requires social justice, or, to be more precise, classical liberals cannot argue for market capitalism without also arguing for social justice, because of their prior commitment to the rule of law. They must ameliorate poverty and limit extreme inequality of wealth. There is indeed a need to provide a principled grounding for egalitarian policies within classical liberalism, while at the same time showing how only some such policies are compatible with the main tenets of the classical liberal tradition. This grounding has two dimensions – showing what is compatible, and showing what is required. The rule egalitarian program provides us with such grounding from a classical liberal standpoint.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The most serious complication in treating hemophilia A (HA) is the development of an immune response to the therapeutically-administered factor VIII (FVIII). A better understanding of initiating events leading to FVIII immunity may highlight alternative treatment interventions. We have explored this synapse at the level of the FVIII protein, the cellular interactions, and the surrounding microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the protein level, we have confirmed epidemiological findings suggesting that recombinant FVIII produced in a baby hamster kidney cell line is more immunogenic than FVIII produced in Chinese hamster ovary cell line. We have attributed this, in part, to differences in protein N-linked glycosylation, where incomplete occupancy of N-linked consensus sequences reveals epitopes for naturally circulating IgM antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
To elucidate cellular immune responses, we observed that human FVIII interacts initially with MARCO+ macrophages in the marginal zone of the mouse spleen. Functional enrichment analysis of the upregulated splenic transcriptome 3 hours after intravenous FVIII administration suggests a modulation of STAT1 and STAT3 signaling, while a similar analysis in the liver implicate Wnt signaling. Interestingly, an endocytic receptor has never been implicated in FVIII immunity in vivo. A GWAS study recently implicated a role of the endothelial cell scavenger receptor, stabilin-2, on circulating FVIII levels. Here, we showed that stabilin-2 knockout mice exhibit an attenuated immune response against FVIII compared to wildtype mice in a human von Willebrand factor-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
Lastly, we assessed the role of an inflammatory microenvironment on FVIII immunogenicity. The proximity of pediatric vaccination and the initiation of FVIII replacement therapy has prompted clinical concerns that concurrent exposure to inflammatory viral constituents may increase the risk of FVIII immune responses. In a transgenic HA mouse model, we have shown that intramuscular immunization against influenza decreases FVIII immune responses through a mechanism of antigenic competition leading to CD4+ T cell diversion towards the site of immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
Collectively, these studies highlight potential areas for therapeutic intervention, and also provide clinicians with mechanistic evidence that may aid in the treatment of HA.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hemophilia A and B are bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or coagulation factor IX (FIX), respectively. Due to the X-linked inheritance pattern, males are affected with the disease, while females are almost exclusively carriers of hemophilia. Although carriers were historically assumed to be asymptomatic, it is now known that many hemophilia carriers experience abnormal bleeding. Hemophilia carriers have higher bleeding scores compared to controls and have decreased health related quality of life. Despite this recognition, little is understood concerning the cause of this bleeding. As such, this study aims to evaluate hemophilia carrier bleeding to elucidate the cause of the abnormal bleeding phenotype. &#xD;
	The objectives of this study are to evaluate hemophilia carrier bleeding in several contexts and with respect to numerous determinants of bleeding in order to elucidate the relative contribution of each determinant to the Self-administered Bleeding Assessment Tool (Self-BAT) bleeding score, and to examine the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of abnormal bleeding in hemophilia A carriers by comparing the response to desmopressin in hemophilia A carriers and controls.&#xD;
	This study demonstrates that hemophilia carriers experience comparable levels of bleeding as women with other bleeding disorders and that there may be differences in the manifestation of bleeding between hemophilia A and B carriers. Importantly, we also demonstrate that increasing age, O-type blood, and low factor level may contribute to an abnormal bleeding phenotype in carriers.  Additionally, we show that hemophilia A carriers, even with normal baseline FVIII levels, have a significantly reduced and less sustained FVIII responses to DDAVP compared to controls. &#xD;
	To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine multiple determinants of bleeding in hemophilia carriers in a single study and the first to fully characterize the response to DDAVP in hemophilia A carriers compared to controls. &#xD;
In conclusion, these results have begun to elucidate the cause of hemophilia carrier bleeding. Ultimately, an improved understanding of what factors put a carrier at risk of abnormal bleeding and of the mechanism of this abnormal bleeding will allow for improved healthcare and quality of life for these women.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis develops a critical geography of physical activity by examining the implications of socio-spatial processes at the scale of the everyday exercise environment for gendered inequities. Around the world, men are more active than women. Meeting recommended physical activity guidelines significantly reduces risk of a range of chronic conditions and premature death; yet, on the whole, women are missing out on these health benefits as compared to their male counterparts. Gyms—although routine places for exercise—are conspicuously absent from health geography research. In this thesis, I investigate the central question: What is the role of an everyday exercise environment, specifically the gym, in the gendering of physical activity? Situated in a conceptual framework linking literature on gender, health geographies, and emotional geographies, my research design comprises an in-depth, multi-method qualitative study incorporating semi-structured interviews, participant-generated drawing, and journaling with 52 women and men in a mid-sized Canadian city. First, I investigate how gender manifests in gym environments and identify five multisensorial gendered performativities of place: bodily materialities; the soundscape; visual fields; the physical environment; and the imaginary. Next, I examine how gender influences gym-users’ practices and mobilities and identify three socio-spatial processes at play (embodying gender ideals, policing gender performance, and spatializing gender relations), along with a fourth theme illustrating the agency some individuals interject to disrupt gender hegemony. I then turn to consider how gender matters in the emotional geographies of the gym where I find three processes (dislocation, evaluation, and sexualization) that create a sense of gender displacement and configure an unevenly gendered emotional architecture of place, while individual factors can mediate negative emotional outcomes. My findings demonstrate that while gyms are potentially sites for health promotion, they are also places where gendered inequities in health opportunities emerge. I argue that addressing gender inequities requires attention to the complexities of the socio-spatial processes that naturalize, as well as challenge, gender differences and disparities in the very places where physical activities are undertaken. Interventions to improve gender equity in physical activity participation need to account for the gendered features of everyday exercise environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examines the political integration of immigrants in the two advanced democracies of North America: Canada and the United States. Literature shows that immigrants tend to participate more and feel more politically efficacious in countries, such as Canada, characterized by multiculturalism policies that proactively support the integration of immigrants. The literature, however, leaves unexplained the mechanisms through which multiculturalism policies influence immigrants at the individual level, where political attitudes crystallize and behavior is carried out.  This inattention to mechanisms poses a serious inferential problem. As we cannot determine how multiculturalism policies influence immigrants’ integration, we cannot establish whether integration outcomes are actually a result of multiculturalism policies or rather, as critics of multiculturalism argue, of the selective immigration criteria in multiculturalism countries, which privilege highly-skilled immigrants who are arguably better able to integrate, regardless of integration policies. &#xD;
&#xD;
Using an original data set I built through a survey with immigrants from India and El Salvador in the Greater Toronto Area (Canada) and the Santa Clara County (United States), I examine the processes through which multiculturalism policies influence the likelihood that immigrants will engage in politics and feel politically competent. I also address questions that remain empirically under-investigated in the literature, such as whether multiculturalism policies incentivize immigrants to develop ties within the immigrant community, to the detriment of wider social integration, and the relative influence of in-group and out-group connections for immigrants’ political participation.   &#xD;
&#xD;
The findings in the study shows that multicultural policies – through their effects on ethno-specific civic organizations-, redistribute social resources that are helpful for political incorporation in favor of more socioeconomically disadvantaged immigrant groups, while equalizing the distribution of such resources within better off immigrant groups. The findings also show that in-group and out-group connections are positively related in both Canada and the United States. &#xD;
&#xD;
This study challenges the arguments of critics of multiculturalism who argue that these policies are inconsequential, or harmful to integration, or more beneficial to already better off immigrant groups. It shows instead that they matter particularly for more disadvantaged immigrant communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The transition of graduate nurses to practice has been identified as challenging. Graduate nurses report feeling stressed, ill prepared, and having intentions to leave (ITL) jobs and the profession. Concerns of ITL are worrisome for the nursing profession, especially when faced with the need to replace an aging nursing workforce, and to maintain quality patient care. Graduate nurse transition and ITL have been the focus of many studies, yet the constructs are typically studied separately without directly connecting graduate nurse transition to subsequent retention in a job and the nursing profession. Guided by a transition theory, the study aimed to test a theory linking ITL and transition, and the personal, community and societal conditions of transition. &#xD;
A predictive, non-experimental design using cross-sectional data was employed. Using a random sample obtained from the provincial regulatory body, registered nurses within their first 24 months of practice were surveyed (N=217) between June and July 2015.  The mailed survey included validated tools to assess self-efficacy, work/family conflict, role stress, work environments, transition, and ITL. &#xD;
An overall response rate of 32% was obtained. The mean transition rating, on a scale from 1 to 10, was 6.9, suggesting a positive transition. Intention to leave measures, assessing ITL jobs and the profession were low; however, 45% of respondents reported having left their jobs, and one percent reported having left the profession.  Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of all scales, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was completed to test the theory which hypothesized that transition is directly associated with ITL. Overall, the model was not supported by the data (χ2 245.07, df 106, p&lt;.01, sRMR .07, GFI .88, CFI .88, RMSEA .08); however, significant relationships among study variables were identified. Thematic analysis of responses to an open-ended item revealed themes of facilitators (supportive work environment, personal factors, and policy), and barriers (feeling unprepared, negative work environments, personal struggles, and policy) to graduate nurse transition. Based on these findings, a number of implications targeting graduate nurse transition and retention at nursing practice, education, research and policy levels are proposed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis focuses on two distinct investigations: filter replications and the testing of a real-time system. &#xD;
The filter replication section used a Finisar WaveShaper programmable filter, a Yenista adjustable bandpass filter and a Luna Optical Vector Analyzer to adjust the input to the WaveShaper in a feedback method. There were two different scenarios for the filter replication: bandwidth narrowing/ center frequency shift and passband impairments. Both were meant to model the effect of concatenating filters from a signal being transmitted through cascaded ROADMs.&#xD;
The real-time testing section was based around using a WaveLogic 3 real-time transceiver in QPSK mode. In this setting, the transceiver sends and receives a QPSK signal, performing all of its digital signal processing in real-time. Similar to the filter replication section, the real-time performance of the WL3 transceiver was tested with bandwidth narrowing/center frequency shift as well as passband impairments. For the bandwidth narrowing, only the Yenista bandpass filter was used between the transmitter and receiver to provide the effect of bandwidth narrowing/center frequency shift. For the passband impairments, the WaveShaper and Yenista filter were used together to provide passband impairments with an adjustable bandwidth setting. Unlike the filter replication case, the WaveShaper was used in a feed-forward capacity.&#xD;
For the filter replication, the metric for measuring success was the reduction of the mean squared error compared to the feedforward case. The bandwidth narrowing/center frequency shift case had limited success, with a mean MSE reduction of 16.08% and one scenario of 10 resulting in an increase in the MSE. The passband impairment filter replication was much more effective, resulting in a mean reduction in MSE of 73.53% and an improvement in all 10 scenarios. &#xD;
With real-time testing, the penalty associated with narrow bandwidth filtering / center frequency shift was explored by determining the required OSNR for a BER of 1x10-3 at different bandwidths and amounts of center frequency shift. The overall range of ROSNR was 2.2 dB, after which there was breakdown in the Forward Error Correction coding. &#xD;
It was found that for the passband impairments, passband ripple had a much larger effect on the performance of the system than passband slope, due to the interaction with the Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier. In the ranges tested, the slope was not correlated with the mean SNR, whereas the ripple amplitude was negatively correlated with the mean SNR. The ripple period was also found to influence the performance penalty.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Benzene, a common chemical solvent and component of cigarette smoke, is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant that most Canadians are routinely exposed to by inhalation. Benzene is classified as a group 1A carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and exposure to benzene is linked to both myeloid leukemia and aplastic anemia in humans. Benzene is metabolized to toxic reactive metabolites by CYP2E1 enzymes in the body and many studies have concluded that benzoquinone and hydroquinone are the most toxic of benzene metabolites. There are several transcription factors that play a significant role in hematopoietic differentiation. Of these transcription factors, PU.1, AML-1, C/EBP-a, c-Myb, and GATA-2 are considered the most crucial to differentiation. PU.1, AML-1, C/EBP-a, c-Myb, and GATA-2 are specific to cells in the hematopoietic system and play a critical role in hematopoietic differentiation as knockout mice deficient in any of these transcription factors possess impaired hematopoietic cells, eventually resulting in death of the animal. To test the hypothesis, that exposure of HL-60 cells to hydroquinone and benzoquinone will result in altered DNA binding activity and relative protein expression of PU.1, AML-1, C/EBP-a, c-Myb and GATA-2, HL-60 cells were plated at 5.0 x105 cells/ml in 10 ml plates and exposed to either phosphate buffered saline, or equal parts hydroquinone or benzoquinone totaling 5, 10, 15, or 25 µM parts for 20 hours. Following exposure, cells were harvested and nuclear fractions were isolated and then used in a filter plate assay to determine DNA binding of the transcription factor. &#xD;
Western blotting was also performed on nuclear extract samples in order to confirm protein presence. Filter plate assays revealed no significant differences in DNA binding amongst the different treatment groups when assaying for PU.1, AML-1 and C/EBP-a iiDNA binding. However, c-Myb and GATA-2 DNA binding assays revealed a decrease in DNA binding when the 25 µM benzoquinone and hydroquinone treatment group was compared to the vehicle control. Western blotting performed on the nuclear extracts demonstrated the presence of PU.1, AML-1, C/EBP-a, c-Myb and GATA-2 with no observable difference in relative protein expression. This data suggests that altered DNA binding of c-Myb and GATA-2 may play a role in benzene-mediated toxicity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This three-essay thesis examines the role of social media in financial markets from multiple perspectives. Chapter 2 explores the economic consequences of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) regulation of corporate use of social media. Following the April 2nd, 2013 SEC regulation allowing firms to use social media to communicate financial information to investors, corporate tweeting becomes informative: meaning that a firm’s stock price responds to its own tweeting. This was not the case prior to the regulation.&#xD;
Chapter 3 examines whether firms that use social media have a lower cost of equity capital. To the extent that the use of Twitter can lower information asymmetry between firms and investors, firms’ cost of capital is expected to be reduced. The two findings of chapter 3 are that 1) the use of Twitter corresponds to a lower cost of equity capital, and 2) firms that face the greatest information asymmetries – namely smaller firms, firms that are covered by the least number of analysts, and firms with the least proportion of institutional ownership, benefit particularly from tweeting financial information about their firm.&#xD;
Chapter 4 turns to investors’ use of Twitter. Harnessing the wisdom of the crowd, Twitter daily sentiment about stocks corresponds to daily stock prices. Specifically, positive Twitter sentiment corresponds to higher returns and negative sentiment corresponds to lower returns. Furthermore, firms whose stock exhibits the greatest dispersion of analyst forecasts are tweeted about more often. This suggests that social media provides an outlet where investors provide opinion and discussions about stocks, especially in the absence of analysts’ (professional) consensus.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the challenges in the fabrication of array transducers suitable for high-frequency ultrasonic imaging is providing electrical connections between the array elements and external systems such as pulser and beamforming circuits. Element connectivity is difficult due to the fine element pitch, as well as strict limitations on the physical size of the probe required for some high-frequency imaging applications such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. Previously, channel reduction has been demonstrated through single-element or partially-sampled array transducers that are mechanically translated during image acquisition. These systems offer ease of fabrication and connectivity due to their low channel count, however, the reliance on mechanical scanning is undesirable. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents the proof-of-concept of a new type of high-frequency array transducer that maintains the low system complexity associated with a reduced channel count, while at the same time offers the ability to electronically scan an active array pattern. A unique feature of this design is the presence of a custom scanning application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which is fully integrated into transducer stack. The ASIC reduces the number cables required by multiplexing a collection of array elements into a small number of channels. To allow for simplified methods of fabrication, two novel substrate bonding techniques are demonstrated that allow full integration of the scanning ASIC into the acoustic stack while not relying on the precise alignment of the two substrates. The integration schemes were demonstrated using a 68 element linear array that includes a custom scanning ASIC in the acoustic stack. The concept is extended to show the feasibility of an electronically-scanned, 50 MHz annular array, which would be suitable for catheter based IVUS imaging for the management of vascular disease. Feasibility has been shown through simulation and experiment, demonstrating that satisfactory transducer performance can be achieved when incorporating a combination of unique materials and structures into the integrated transducer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prostate cancer spheroid based three-dimensional culture models (referred to as prostaspheres) have provided insight into prostate cancer biology by highlighting the importance of cell–cell interactions and the extracellular matrix in the tumor microenvironment. The prostasphere model have particular advantages over 2D monolayer culture models in terms of 3D structure and having cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion instead of cell-culture plate adhesion. The cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide-based biochemical method is a simple, reproducible and cost-effective method of spheroid formation. The cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide method of spheroid formation depends on the cell surface glycoproteins, integrins and cadherins. The terminal monosaccharide of these glycoproteins is sialic acid. Using human metastatic androgen independent prostate carcinoma PC3 and DU145 cell lines and their respective gemcitabine resistant (GemR) variants, prostaspheres were generated by using cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys peptide modified with 4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)). By using cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide in a dose- and time-dependent manner, both DU145 and DU145GemR cells formed prostaspheres. In contrast, PC3 and PC3GemR cells formed irregular cell aggregates at all concentrations of cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide. The formation of prostaspheres was not dependent on the level of E-cadherin expression by the prostate cancer cell lines. Using lectin cytochemistry and flow cytometry, it was found that DU145 and PC3 cells and their drug resistant variants expressed different levels of α2,3 sialic acid (SA) and α2,6 SA residues on the cell surface which correlated with the ability to form prostaspheres. Prostasphere volume was dose-dependently reduced following pretreatment with&#xD;
α2,6 SA specific neuraminidase (Vibrio Cholerae). Oseltamivir phosphate (OP), a neuraminidase1 inhibitor, did not have any effect on the level of sialic acid and therefore in the formation of spheroids. These results suggest that the relative levels of specific sialoglycan structures on the cell surface glycoproteins correlate with the ability of prostate cancer cells to form prostaspheres.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The home is a bedrock of Western culture, society and economics. Consumer research draws attention to the home as a space laden with meaning and of ubiquitous importance in consumers’ lives. However, this literature also reveals inherent misalignments in how we understand the home. The home is a site for self-expression, but also a site of conformity to taste, aesthetics and expectations of market value. The home is a site for family practices, which may conflict with social norms of tidiness that manifest in the home. The ubiquity of the home masks its cultural complexity. The purpose of this work is to examine how consumers navigate these cultural misalignments, multi-level forces, and overall work of creating and recreating the space we call “home.” I draw upon Henri Lefebvre’s (1974) model of the production of space as a theoretical lens to examine how consumers negotiate the creation of the space of home. Through 21 in-depth interviews with consumers engaged in home renovations, four interviews with service providers and a purposeful observation of home exhibitions shows, marketing and media, my study reveals four major findings which contribute to consumer research and broader theories of space. First, I find that part of the reason home renovations are stressful for consumers is that in the process, consumers configure the home as a reflection of their personal identity. An outdated home reflects an outdated identity. Second, I find that consumers are fearful of an ever-present market-based anonymous gaze in their home regulating the enactment of their identity. Third, I introduce the importance of the role of harmony, as opposed to resistance, in the creation of space. Lastly, I introduce a new role in the market, that of a Space Orchestrator. Space Orchestrators are deeply embedded in understanding the consumer and the market, which therefore positions them to guide consumers to configure their homes in ways that represent both their identity and the demands of the market, thus helping to create the home as a space of cultural alignment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the development of British secularist ideas of morality and social ethics, and how those ideas informed secularist views of non-Europeans and the imperial civilizing mission. I investigate the relationship between secularism as an ideology and the development of secularity as one of the defining characteristics of modernity. Secularism was founded by G. J. Holyoake, a whitesmith and Owenite lecturer, in 1851. The movement served as a vital link between a pre-1848 artisan radical tradition and the socialism of the final decades of the nineteenth century. &#xD;
I investigate how imperial knowledge creation informed the development of secularist ethical and political ideas, and the impact of those ideas upon secularist interventions into imperial debates, particularly regarding the European civilizing mission. Previous historians of the secularist movement have neglected to demonstrate how the religious pluralism of empire and its attendant political and administrative challenges shaped secularism as a strain of liberal thought. Concomitantly, research into Britain’s uneasy negotiation of the religious diversity of its empire has not sufficiently incorporated the dynamics of domestic freethought. Secularism promoted belief in a rational, utilitarian morality that would unleash humanity’s innate capacity for moral and intellectual progress. My research contributes to scholarship on the impact of empire and globalization on European modernity and secularity. Faith in universal human progress was and remains a defining characteristic of secularism. I am interested in how ideas of progress have been both informed and challenged by difference and the implications of power.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is anticipated that Arctic vegetation will respond in a variety of ways to altered temperature and precipitation patterns expected with climate change, including changes in phenology, productivity, biomass, cover and net ecosystem exchange. Remote sensing provides data and data processing methodologies for monitoring and assessing Arctic vegetation over large areas. The goal of this research was to explore the potential of hyperspectral and high spatial resolution multispectral remote sensing data for modelling two important Arctic biophysical variables: Percent Vegetation Cover (PVC) and the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR). A series of field experiments were conducted to collect PVC and fAPAR at three Canadian Arctic sites: (1) Sabine Peninsula, Melville Island, NU; (2) Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, NU; and (3) Apex River Watershed (ARW), Baffin Island, NU. Linear relationships between biophysical variables and Vegetation Indices (VIs) were examined at different spatial scales using field spectra (for the Sabine Peninsula site) and high spatial resolution satellite data (for the CBAWO and ARW sites). At the Sabine Peninsula site, hyperspectral VIs exhibited a better performance for modelling PVC than multispectral VIs due to their capacity for sampling fine spectral features. The optimal hyperspectral bands were located at important spectral features observed in Arctic vegetation spectra, including leaf pigment absorption in the red wavelengths and at the red-edge, leaf water absorption in the near infrared, and leaf cellulose and lignin absorption in the shortwave infrared. At the CBAWO and ARW sites, field PVC and fAPAR exhibited strong correlations (R2 &gt; 0.70) with the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) derived from high-resolution WorldView-2 data. Similarly, high spatial resolution satellite-derived fAPAR was correlated to MODIS fAPAR (R2 = 0.68), with a systematic overestimation of 0.08, which was attributed to PAR absorption by soil that could not be excluded from the fAPAR calculation. This research clearly demonstrates that high spectral and spatial resolution remote sensing VIs can be used to successfully model Arctic biophysical variables. The methods and results presented in this research provided a guide for future studies aiming to model other Arctic biophysical variables through remote sensing data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My thesis takes as its central question ongoing colonialism in white queer settler affective and discursive relationships to the prairies and to “home.” I engage with the works of queer and feminist Indigenous theorists, poets, and arts by the likes of Gregory Scofield, Adrian Stimson, Erica Violet Lee, Zoe Todd, Billy-Ray Belcourt in order to fully articulate my critique of queer settler colonialism. I observe how white queer settlers experience their queerness as an obstacle to full and immediate participation in the settler colonial project, which hinges on cis and heteronormativity, and then recuperate their belonging through queer articulations of colonial claims to home on occupied Indigenous lands. Over the course of this project, I also notice how whiteness mobilizes both anti-Black racism and Indigenous dispossession. In order to investigate these white queer affective attachments to home, I work closely with cultural production made by white queer settlers from Edmonton and Calgary, specifically works by Darrin Hagen, Trevor Anderson, and Rae Spoon. I find it necessary to take these books, films, and music seriously as they are located within and reproduce larger systems of settler colonialism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study used a quantitative approach to explore Canadian undergraduate students’ motivation to engage in sustainable engineering practice. Engineering is considered to be a key profession for sustainable development, which requires engineers and engineering students to be motivated. An ex-post facto design was used to measure students’ stereotypes of and previous experiences with, self-concept of abilities of, and relative value of sustainable engineering practice. These elements were used to investigate and compare students’ motivation levels across gender, year of study, and engineering discipline. A survey instrument was developed specifically for this study and was tested in a mixed method pilot study with a sample of graduate engineering students. After the pilot study, the improved survey instrument was distributed to undergraduate students at eight engineering institutions across Canada.&#xD;
	The results from the survey instrument suggested that students’ have high value for but limited experiences with sustainable engineering practice. As a result, the the results suggested that students are not necessarily motivated to engage in sustainable engineering practice. Male students were found to have slightly higher self-concepts of some of their abilities and no differences were found among year of study. Most differences occurred among the engineering disciplines in the Stereotypes and Previous Experiences factors. Students in the ECE and Science, and Mechanical- Based disciplines had less positive and more limited experiences than students in the Chemical- and Environmental-Based disciplines. There were some differences between the ECE and Science and the Environmental-Based disciplines in students’ relative value. Generally, students valued sustainable engineering practice more for utility than intrinsic reasons. In all disciplines, students were biased towards the environmental element of sustainable engineering practice and incorporated only simplistic considerations.&#xD;
	A universal definition and understanding of sustainable engineering practice should be adopted to provide a foundation for practice. Generally, students require more experiences with sustainable engineering practice in their engineering programs. To address the differences among the disciplines, discipline-specific interventions should be developed to address the application and integration of the social, economic, environmental, and multidimensional elements of sustainable engineering practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Situated within an increasing trend of globalization and internationalization, 97 percent of Canadian universities offer international experiences to students. Chinese international students are the biggest international student group in Canada, and they are also the group with the lowest spoken English scores. Studies have demonstrated that oral English capacity significantly influences international students’ academic acculturation. However, little is known about the lived academic acculturation experiences of Chinese international students with limited spoken English. To address this literature gap, this study aimed to understand the academic acculturation experiences of Chinese international students with limited spoken English currently studying at a Canadian university. A musically enhanced narrative inquiry approach was employed, building on traditional forms of narrative inquiry by utilizing sound and music. Data were collected through art-informed interviews with six Chinese international students, and were analyzed through both narrative and musical re-storying, resulting in the creation of both literary and musical narrative representations. Expectancy-Value Theory served as a theoretical framework that informed the study design and the interpretation of results. The narratives from all six Chinese students demonstrated high levels of psychological stress during their academic acculturation and that their motivation for spoken English learning was drastically improved in relation to their academic acculturation experiences. By exploring the experiences of Chinese international students with limited spoken English capacity through a musically enhanced narrative inquiry, this study contributes to the existing understanding of international students’ academic acculturation, and has uncovered implications for various associated stakeholders including Chinese students, parents, and teachers, and host country educators and support service personnel who work with international students.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The leading cause of death in breast cancer is metastatic burden. Classification of breast cancer cases by molecular subtype reveals that those categorized as triple-negative (TNBC) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpressing (HER2+) exhibit more invasive phenotypes, higher rates of metastasis, and worse survival. Tumour progression requires signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2, as well as invasion through the extracellular matrix (ECM) directed by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP). Coordinated endocytosis of these receptors is essential for their cellular functions. Endophilin A2 (Endo II) is a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain protein involved in endocytosis. Studies have identified Endo II as a substrate of Src kinase involved in establishing and maintaining a tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype in mice. However, the specific role of Endo II in human breast cancer progression remains unclear. This thesis investigated the role of Endo II in human TNBC and HER2+ cancer models. High Endo II expression was detected in TNBC and HER2+ subtypes, and was correlated with poor prognosis in human breast tumours. Stable knock-down (KD) of Endo II in several human TNBC and HER2+ cell lines resulted in defects in internalization and signaling by EGFR and HER2 in TNBC and HER2+ models, respectively. Cell migration and invasion in vitro were also reduced upon Endo II KD. In TNBC cells, Endo II KD suppressed ECM degradation by invadopodia, despite higher levels of MT1-MMP on the cell surface. Endo II KD also limited tumour growth and metastasis in mammary orthotopic tumor xenograft models. Lastly, HER2 internalization and the cytotoxicity of Trastuzumab and Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) were suppressed in Endo II KD HER2+ cells. These results identify Endo II as a positive regulator of both breast cancer metastasis, as well as the cytotoxic response to antibody-based therapy. Overall, this thesis provides a foundation for refined approaches to alter Endo II expression and function in high-risk patients, as a means to increase sensitivity and mitigate resistance to targeted therapies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Groundwater can be impacted by many types of contaminants, some of which are difficult to remediate, such as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). DNAPLs can exist for long periods of time in the subsurface and may result in decreased groundwater quality, decreased land value and an increased risk of indoor air quality impacts to nearby infrastructure. In situ thermal remediation has been proposed and implemented at sites impacted by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), though additional information is required to elucidate fundamental mechanisms and establish performance expectations. &#xD;
&#xD;
Preliminary laboratory studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of heating at moderate temperatures on soil impacted to various degrees with creosote, a multi-component SVOC DNAPL. Co-boiling temperatures observed during heating were near the boiling point of water due to the low volatility of the creosote. Though VOC removal from soil occurred quickly during co-boiling, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in soil appeared unchanged, indicating that higher temperatures or longer heating durations are necessary to achieve typical regulatory standards.  Subsequent laboratory tests were conducted to determine the effectiveness of heating at moderate, elevated and highly elevated temperatures on soil impacted with creosote. PAH concentrations in soil decreased the most during co-boiling for all heating tests, and continued to decrease during extended heating periods of up to 10 days at highly elevated temperatures (320 °C). However, PAH concentrations in soil remained above Ontario’s regulatory standards after completion of all tests. Dissolution tests designed to simulate groundwater flow through treated sites post-heating revealed continuing PAH dissolution into water.&#xD;
&#xD;
The results from these two studies indicate that in situ thermal remediation of multi-component SVOC DNAPLs, at least to the temperatures tested in this study, does not result in soil PAH concentrations below applicable regulatory limits. Furthermore, remaining PAHs in treated soil continue to partition into the aqueous phase. Additional research into higher temperature thermal applications and the effects of pumping during heating are recommended to fully determine whether in situ thermal remediation is a viable option for SVOC DNAPL impacted sites.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Body segment inertial parameters (BSIPs) are required to study human kinetics and to model the human form. The purpose of this study was to determine the BSIPs in toddlers using the photogrammetric method. Twelve male and twelve female toddlers (1.5-3years) were photographed in two planes, front and side, with reflective markers placed at the joint centres. The subjects were also weighed and had their height measured. Jensen’s elliptical model was used to segment the images and zone the segments in 3mm thick slices. The segment masses, centre of mass (COM) locations and radii of gyration (ROGs) about the three principal axes were calculated and normalized in a percent form.&#xD;
Segment mass proportion of the head was found to decrease as the child ages while the mass proportion of the thigh increases. The trunk’s mass proportion increased with body mass index. These trends follow those found in the literature. The COM locations of segments were compared to the literature. The COM location of the head moves distally as the child ages. The COMs of the thigh and shank move proximally as muscle mass is developed. ROGs were highly variable due to posture variability from a population who found the photogrammetric protocol difficult to follow. To minimize positional errors, all subjects were analyzed together. The arm, forearm, thigh and shank were found to be similar to the literature while the hand and foot differed due to protocol difficulties. The ROGs of the head, neck and trunk could not be compared to the literature due to segmenting differences. The estimated total body mass was compared to the measured mass using a scale. The average error was 1.7% (SD=2.9%).&#xD;
Despite some challenges and limitations of working with toddlers, the study was able to collect BSIPs of toddlers and provide data for a frequently overlooked population. The results of this study provide important data for those studying the biomechanics of toddlers or developing models of toddlers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The development of molecular techniques has spurred thousands of population genetic studies on a wide variety of plant and animal species. Particularly important, but still relatively rare, are studies that properly test for geographic variation in genetic structure across species’ ranges. This thesis investigates the effects of population density, mating system variation, distance between populations and hybridization on the genetic diversity, differentiation and structure across the range of Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia (Onagraceae). By combining a transplant experiment with microsatellites, I also provide an empirical test of one of the most poorly resolved questions in evolutionary biology: Why do species exhibit limits to their distributions?&#xD;
I developed 24 species-specific nuclear microsatellites loci (nSSR) and used 13 of these and six variable chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSR) to investigate the genetic consequences of the transition from outcrossing to selfing in C. cheiranthifolia. As predicted, small-flowered, selfing populations had lower nSSR diversity (but not cpSSR) than large-flowered, outcrossing populations but they were not more differentiated. The reduction in diversity was greater than the expected from selfing alone, but could not be accounted for by indirect effects of selfing on population density. Five parapatric nSSR clusters and three groups of cpSSR haplotypes usually (but not always) differed in mating system, suggesting that selfing may often initiate ecogeographic isolation. However, lineage-wide diversity failed to support that selection for reproductive assurance initiated selfing in this species.&#xD;
I also investigated if hybridization with C. bistorta has influenced the genetic structure of C. cheiranthifolia in areas of closest parapatry. I confirmed that closet parapatry was associated with extensive genetic continuity between self-incompatible C. cheiranthifolia and C. bistorta and these were indistinguishable genetically within the broader context of geographic variation in C. cheiranthifolia, suggesting that C. bistorta could be an inland ecotype of C. cheiranthifolia&#xD;
Finally, fitness increased toward and beyond the northern range limit of C. cheiranthifolia but edge individuals were not best suited to conditions beyond the range. Despite strong genetic differentiation and very low, nondirectional gene flow, there was no evidence of local adaptation, except at the coarsest spatial scale, suggesting range limitation via constraints to dispersal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding how animals control the dynamic stall vortices in their wake is critical to developing micro-aerial vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles, not to mention wind turbines, delta wings, and rotor craft that undergo similar dynamic stall processes. Applying this knowledge to biomimetic engineering problems requires progress in three areas: (i) understanding the flow physics of natural swimmers and flyers; (ii) developing flow measurement techniques to resolve this physics; and (iii) deriving low-cost models suitable for studying the vast parameter space observed in nature. This body of work, which consists of five research chapters, focuses on the leading-edge vortex (LEV) that forms on profiles undergoing rapid manoeuvres, delta wings, and similar devices. Lagrangian particle tracking is used throughout this thesis to track the mass and circulation transport in the LEV on manoeuvring profiles. The growth and development of the LEV is studied in relation to: flapping and plunging profile kinematics; spanwise flow from profile sweep and spanwise profile bending; and varying the angle-of-attack gradient along the profile span. Finally, scaling relationships derived from the observations above are used to develop a low-cost model for LEV growth, that is validated on a flat-plate delta wing. Together these results contribute to each of the three topics identified above, as a step towards developing robust, agile biomimetic swimmers and flyers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“If it were not for the great variability among individuals, medicine might as well be a science, not an art.”  Sir William Osler, Canadian physician and McGill alumnus, quoted in 1892.&#xD;
&#xD;
       Personalized medicine is the approach that tailors the treatment of patients based on their unique genetic makeup and genetic environment.  When equipped with details of individual variation, physicians can separate patients into subgroups to predict which patients must be treated aggressively and which patients would respond to one drug rather than another. Personalized medicine is now being applied towards the prediction of mortality in childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients. This is because individual children differ in the sensitivity of their leukemic cells and in their response to treatment-related toxicity. Currently, mortality prediction for childhood ALL is based on risk-stratification performed by expert doctors. The genotypic (actual set of genes), phenotypic (expression of those genes in observable traits) and clinical information is used to stratify children into various risk categories. The information collected by doctors for risk-stratification include response to certain drugs, clinical factors such as age and gender and biological measurements such as white blood cell count.&#xD;
       The goal of this thesis is to automate the prediction of childhood ALL mortality using genotypic and phenotypic information of patients. We intend to achieve this using the Deep Learning algorithm, which is known to analyze non-linear and complex information, such as cell-interactions, effectively. We conduct this thesis using the Big Data software called H2O, using R. We first experimented with the standard Deep Learning parameters, and later adjusted the size and shape of the general network by optimizing the depth and retention factor of hidden neurons. We improved the accuracy by using the techniques of Out-of-Bag Sampling, Bagging and Voting. We later tuned H2O’s platform-specific network parameters. Later, the number of votes needed to obtain the highest accuracy of predictions, is also tuned.  We built confusion matrices for each of our Deep Learning models to evaluate how well our models perform. Our results are promising as they are corroborated by the clinical dataset and they perform better than the physicians’ predictions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multidrug efflux systems are important determinants of antimicrobial resistance in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa where they compromise anti-pseudomonal chemotherapy. The major multidrug efflux system in P. aeruginosa is encoded by the mexAB-oprM operon, expression of which is regulated by a MexR repressor whose activity is negatively modulated by the anti-repressor protein, ArmR. armR occurs as part of a two-gene operon, PA3720-armR, that is regulated by the product of the divergently-transcribed nalC repressor gene, with nalC mutants showing elevated PA3720-armR expression and, so, elevated mexAB-oprM expression and multidrug resistance. The function of the PA3720 protein is unknown. We show here that PA3720 functions as a non-specific RNA binding protein that binds to and destabilizes the adjacent armR-bearing mRNA. Expression of armR is also shown to be translationally coupled to PA3720. In an earlier study, aminoglycosides were shown to induce expression of PA3720-armR, suggesting that these drugs may also promote mexAB-oprM expression dependent on ArmR. Consistent with this, aminoglycosides promoted expression of mexAB-oprM; however, this was independent of ArmR. Instead, the aminoglycoside-responsive AmgRS two-component system mediated aminoglycoside induction of this efflux system. Consistent with this, mutational activation of the AmgS sensor kinase yielded elevated levels of mexAB-oprM expression, and purified AmgR bound specifically to the mexAB-oprM promoter region. Screening of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 transposon mutants for increased sensitivity to carbenicillin- carbenicillin is a MexAB-OprM substrate and carbenicillin sensitivity is a surrogate for loss of mexAB-oprM expression - led to the identification of several genes with probable roles in mexAB-oprM expression or activity. The gene disrupted in one of these mutants, bamB, encodes for a component of the outer membrane β-barrel protein assembly machinery and was assessed for its role in facilitating the assembly of OprM, a β-barrel outer membrane protein. Western immunoblotting revealed that BamB is not required for OprM insertion into the outer membrane. These studies provide additional insights into the regulation of mexAB-oprM expression in P. aeruginosa.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents research related to the preliminary design, construction and testing of a novel autorotating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for gathering 3D maps of underground cavities. The novel UAV is called "The Mapkey". Current underground cavity surveying is conducted by using a stationary light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor extended into a void to collect a 3D point cloud. This method is costly and takes a significant amount of time. An autorotating UAV equipped with a LiDAR payload was constructed to collect a 3D point cloud as it flies along the vertical extent of an underground cavity. The potential benefits of this novel surveying method include: cost reduction, increased survey accuracy and reduced survey times. &#xD;
&#xD;
Autorotation is the state of flight where the main rotor rotates due to the flow of air upwards through the rotor. The constructed autorotating UAV passively falls through the cavity and rotates as it falls. A single-beam LiDAR payload attached to the UAV collects range data from the surrounding environment and monitors the relative position and orientation of the UAV as it falls. The vertical descent and rotation of the LiDAR payload maps the surrounding environment by way of a 3D helical scan pattern. Data is retrieved and post processed to create a 3D map of the cavity.  Applications for the acquired data could be to estimate the volume of the cavity or to identify interesting features such as overhangs. This device was tested in a laboratory environment and results show that the UAV is capable of recreating a 3D point cloud of its surrounding environment. Future work includes testing in a more representative underground environment and further processing of the collected point cloud to determine the volume of an underground cavity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gear transmission systems are widely used in many industry applications. Increased demand for higher-speed, improved performance and longer-lived machinery, makes the prediction and control of gear vibration and noise, as well as the early detection and diagnosis of gear defects important considerations. Many researchers use dynamic modelling of gear vibration to increase knowledge about the vibration generating mechanisms in gear transmission systems and the dynamic behaviour of gear transmission systems in the presence of some kinds of localized tooth defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
This project aims to advance the current understanding of gear dynamics by introducing more accurate and realistic gear dynamic modelling strategies for cylindrical gear (spur gear and helical gear) transmission systems with and without localized tooth defects (tooth fillet crack and spalling defect). A series of studies have been conducted to reflect different aspects of gear dynamics. The main conclusions can be as summarized below:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Corner contact effect should not be neglected in the gear dynamic analysis if no or an insufficient amount of tooth profile modification is applied when the gears are working under heavy load.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. The dynamic coupling behaviour is obvious in the direction of off-line of action when a gear pair with gear eccentricities is running at relatively low-speed range where the resonances of gear torsional vibration are most likely to be excited.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. The addendum modification can affect gear dynamics through the back-side mesh stiffness, especially when the gears are working under light load or idling conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Special attention should be paid to the tooth inclination deformations for the early detection of the initial crack damage. Besides, the spatial crack with non-uniform crack depth will lead to unevenness of the dynamic load distribution on the cracked tooth flank. Tilting motions can therefore be excited whenever the cracked tooth comes into the mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. The nonlinear elliptical contact patterns do affect the excitations due to spalls especially for spalls with small size and gear pairs running under heavy load. The proposed model considering the effect of the nonlinear elliptical contact patterns by introducing modification coefficients can yield more realistic and accurate results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the early twentieth-century, the Communist Party of Canada (CPC) initially hesitated to discuss the politics of reproduction as a means of easing material inequity for women and men of the working class. Nevertheless, over five decades, this topic appeared often in the CPCs official and unofficial publications, illustrating a sustained interest in the taboo subject. My thesis draws upon archival materials, communist and mainstream newspapers, and medical periodicals to survey contemporary opinions of birth control, abortion, eugenics, juvenile delinquency, venereal disease, and state medicine. Using the lens of left-politics, these topics are contextualized with reference to the extant literature on the histories of politics, sex, reproduction, labour, and medicine in Canada and beyond. Far from being confined to a few secretive individuals, the militant left engaged a dense network of activists who took stock of the social as well as physical reproduction of the nation. Often their interests appeared indistinguishable from the mainstream, and occasionally overlapped with those of their right-leaning opponents. The CPC unfailingly argued for an understanding of sex and reproduction that reflected its Marxist worldview. Some multi-generational discussions were so durable that they would outlast and outgrow the militant left to emerge within the rhetoric of a multitude of Canadian liberation groups by the late sixties and early seventies. I argue that investigation of the politics underwriting the ideas of the CPC and its ideology of a healthy, socialized body politic, elucidates complexities in the formation of mainstream Canadian approaches to sex, reproduction, and health.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The DEAP-3600 experiment is a single-phase liquid argon dark matter detector employing pulse discrimination to mitigate background-like events and isolate WIMP-like events. The vessel that holds 3600~kg of target, and the flowguide that guides convective flow, are made of ultrapure acrylic plastic. Diffusion of radioactive radon and radon progeny within air into the acrylic post-fabrication result in a surface layer that is orders of magnitude more radioactive than the bulk material. The robotic sanding of the vessel and the manual sanding of the flowguides, to reduce surface contamination to that of the bulk, are discussed: the Resurfacer removed 360 ± 30 μm of acrylic from the vessel surface as a rate of 10.5 ± 2.3 g/hr, and a minimum of 37 μm was manually removed from the argon-exposed flowguide surfaces. The empirical assay of acrylic bulk contamination is also discussed: a content of (2 ± 2) × 10^-19 grams of Pb-210 per gram of acrylic was measured, with a procedural Pb-210 recovery efficiency of 47 ± 13%.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this dissertation, I first explore the effects of categories of capital inflows on output volatility and output growth in developing countries and propose a welfare-improving capital control policy. I provide empirical evidence and theoretical support for capital control targeted at foreign portfolio liabilities and examine its quantitative welfare implications. I then examine the dynamic effects of global monetary policy as well as emerging economies’ domestic monetary and exchange rate shocks on the categories of capital inflows.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 2, I first analyze the effects of financial account openness on output volatility and output growth in developing countries. I then study the effects of the categories of capital inflows on output volatility and output growth. I use panel cross-country ordinary least square regressions and panel instrumental variable regressions, and estimate the effects of financial account openness and categories of capital inflows on output volatility and output growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 3, I develop and analyze a stochastic, small open economy, real business cycle model. The model incorporates two categories of capital inflows, endogenous collateral constraints, interest rate premia above the world interest rate and adjustment costs which are increasing and convex in each capital inflow type. Investments financed by foreign direct liabilities increase production more than those financed by foreign portfolio liabilities as foreign direct liabilities increase productivity via technology transfer. A capital control taxis imposed on foreign portfolio liability interest payments. Model simulations indicate that an increase in the tax rate on foreign portfolio liability interest payment results in a welfare improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 4 analyzes the effects of the U.S. monetary policy shocks on gross foreign direct and portfolio investment inflows to emerging markets and compares them to those associated with domestic monetary policy and exchange rate shocks. It uses panel and country-specific structural vector auto-regressions to analyze and compare the dynamics, magnitude, and differential impacts of the shocks on each inflow category. The response of foreign direct investment inflows to policy shocks is weak while that of foreign portfolio investment is stronger and immediate. I also provide clearer comparison of “push" and “pull" factors on financial flows via forecast error variance decomposition.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Drosophila melanogaster has been an attractive animal model for more than 100 years. Our laboratory has established a high-throughput assay for fly locomotion in a circular arena. Fly locomotor activity involves the interaction between the environment and internal physiological characteristics, including age. Behaviors such as walking, feeding and resting are age-specific, however, how age affects the fly locomotion and whether such changes are strain specific is unclear. Environmental effects such as variation in temperature and humidity also affect locomotor performance. However, the effects on locomotion of long-term environmental change such as the pulsed light stimulation, or the short-term environmental change such as acute hypoxia, are unknown. For my thesis, I investigated the effect of age on locomotor performance by examining boundary preference, path length per minute and 0.2 s path increment during locomotion in small circular arenas, and the speed of locomotor recovery from anoxia. My results show that locomotor performance depended on age, and such age-dependent changes differed between fly strains. I also studied the effect of pulsed light stimulation on locomotor activity and extracellular electrical activity in the brain. This stimulus increased boundary preference and the distance travelled in a circular arena, as well as the periodicity of episodic motor activity. In addition, I examined locomotor responses to hypoxia and the role of CNGL channel in these responses. Hypoxia and re-oxygenation modulated locomotor performance, and flies with down-regulation of CNGL showed reduced locomotion under normoxia, reduced recovery from hypoxia, and reduced basal level of CNS extracellular K+ concentrations. In response to hypoxia, down-regulation of CNGL increased extracellular K+ concentration change, reduced time to reach the K+ concentration peak, and delayed time to recover from hypoxia. Upregulation of cGMP partially compensated for the changes in locomotor activity and electrophysiological alterations in response to hypoxia. Taken together, age and environmental stimuli affect fly locomotor performance, and CNGL channels are involved in modulating locomotion and CNS function in response to hypoxia in adult Drosophila.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My dissertation has three main chapters. Chapter 2 develops a structural dynamic factor model that estimates the effects of commodity price shocks on the Canadian macroeconomy, bank lending and bank risk. Unlike most literature treating commodity price changes as exogenous, I identify global structural shocks driving real commodity prices and find that global demand and commodity market–specific shocks are crucial. These two shocks are shown to have quite different implications for bank lending and risk, which confirms the importance of disentangling shocks driving commodity price changes. I also discover that on average, the total loan growth and the noninterest income ratio of large Canadian banks are more responsive to the above two commodity price shocks than those of small Canadian banks. Chapter 3, coauthored with Tian Xie, studies how to better forecast the daily market volatility (VIX) index. We propose utilizing the ordinary least square post–least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (OLS post–Lasso) from Belloni and Chernozhukov (2013) to select the predictors and estimate the coefficients for a heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model (Corsi, 2009). In an out–of–sample analysis with the VIX data, our proposed OLS post–Lasso HAR (OLHAR) model generates a different combination of predictors from those ex ante imposed by the standard HAR model. Moreover, the OLHAR model shows its dominance over the standard HAR and other competitor models at forecasting the VIX either weekly, biweekly, or monthly ahead. Chapter 4 develops a tail risk forecasting system tailored to Canada and provides a set of one–quarter ahead forecasts of tail real and financial risk by factor–based conditional quantile projections. My model forecasts the steepest decline in GDP–Oil at 2009Q2, and the peaks of the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios of Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) at 2010Q2 and 2010Q3, respectively. For BMO and CIBC, the banking factors contribute the most to the peaks of the Value at Risk (VaR) forecasts of the NPL ratios. The commodity price factors also compose a prominent portion of the total contribution from the global factors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: A child with disabilities (CWD) can have a significant impact on the entire family unit. Families with a CWD are more likely to experience poverty and inequitable access to important resources, particularly in low resource countries like Bangladesh due to stigmatization and discrimination. Over the last few decades, an increased number of studies on family needs had been conducted in high-income countries, but family needs are under-studied in low-income countries. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: (a) explore the needs of families of children with cerebral palsy (CP) in Bangladesh; (b) investigate how some of the family needs have been met, and (c) identify the sources of supports that might help families to meet their needs in the future. &#xD;
Methods: Face to face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 family members (12 mothers, 4 fathers, 1 sister, 2 grandmothers, and 1 aunt) who visited the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP), Bangladesh between June and August 2016 to receive services for a child with CP. A constant comparison method of the grounded theory approach within the broader spectrum of qualitative inquiry was used to analyze the data. &#xD;
Results: Participants identified five categories related to needs: (a) financial needs, (b) access to disability-related services, (c) family and community cohesion, (d) informational needs, and (e) emotional needs. Participants overwhelmingly reported that financial need is their greatest family need. Participants highlighted that some of their needs have been met through non-governmental organizations, extended family and community members. Participants reported that they receive little to no support from the government. However, participants identified the government as the key source who can play vital role in meeting their unmet needs. &#xD;
Conclusions: Further studies on needs of families of children with conditions other than CP and those who do not have access to rehabilitation services at CRP may provide greater insights into the needs of families impacted by disability in Bangladesh. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of existing disability related policies is required to determine the extent to which consideration of and accommodation for family needs is embedded within existing policies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the advancement of new technologies, the frequency of malicious attacks is also growing rapidly. Even networks without external connections cannot hide from these attacks. Constant monitoring of a network is vital for an organization's security system. Among numerous monitoring techniques, network behavior analysis has become popular. Normal traffic patterns of a network can be modeled as network constraints. The violation of these constraints indicates the possibility that an intrusion has occurred. &#xD;
&#xD;
Expressing network vulnerabilities is not an easy task. Sometimes, it is more complicated than recognizing an intruder's attack pattern. Currently, network administrators use Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules to define security concerns regarding their networks. An IDS rule finds it difficult to detect sophisticated multi-packet intrusions. Constraints compared to IDS rules possess better expressiveness to describe a network behavior for defending the network against different attacks. &#xD;
&#xD;
Evaluating constraints in an efficient manner is a key to achieving a better IDS. Numerous constraint checking techniques provide good performance in solving constraints. However, they are not always effective in checking constraints with dynamic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we propose a protocol specific constraint-based IDS to detect intrusions in a network. We investigate two protocols used in the Data Distribution Service (DDS) and identify their vulnerabilities. These two protocols are Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Real-Time Publisher Subscriber Protocol (RTPS). We develop constraints to protect a network against attacks that may exploit these vulnerabilities. For checking these constraints, a naive tree-based technique along with an optimized version is presented. Both techniques have the adaptability to cope with a continuous update of relevant network behavior information from a network traffic. The structure and life cycle of the constraint trees are explained in detail. A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is designed to express these constraints. An experimental private network is built which simulates network traffic similar to an Air Traffic Control System (ATC). Finally, we present how this IDS evaluates network constraints against the traffic generated from the experimental network and prevents attacks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Teacher educators have the potential to wield tremendous influence in shaping educational reform through the education of teacher candidates. Brookhart, a leading assessment researcher, argues that a primary influence on teacher candidates’ assessment capability involves teacher educators’ approaches to assessment: “teacher candidates’ repertoire of effective teaching practices depends on the beliefs about learning and the approach to assessment espoused by the respective teacher educator” (2016, p. 17). This study examines Canadian teacher educators’ approaches to assessment, with particular attention to the relationship between instructional focus (e.g., assessment, curriculum, professional studies) or assessment education model on teacher educators’ approaches to assessment.&#xD;
	A quantitative design was used to examine teacher educators’ approaches to classroom assessment. Through completion of the Approaches to Classroom Assessment Inventory, teacher educators from nine provinces shared their approaches to assessment in relation to five classroom assessment scenarios. They also reported the degree to which assessment content was integrated into the teacher education courses they instructed.&#xD;
	Results of this study showed that teacher educators’ approaches to assessment within discrete themes (i.e., Assessment Purpose, Assessment Process, Assessment Fairness, Measurement Theory), were highly consistent. However, when considering teacher educators’ approaches to assessment across Assessment Themes, there was a high degree of variability. Differences in how assessment and curriculum/professional studies educators integrated assessment content into the teacher education courses they instructed were also noted.&#xD;
	Findings from this research serves to inform the development and delivery of teacher assessment education. As this study provides the first examination of Canadian teacher educators’ assessment literacy, teacher educators are provided the opportunity to compare their assessment literacy to that of K-12 classroom teachers and teacher candidates. Findings from this study begin to lay the foundation for future studies into the impact of Canadian teacher educators’ assessment literacy on teacher education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the role and nature of intuition in philosophical inquiry. Appeals to intuition have either been used as evidence for or against philosophical theories or as constitutive features of judgement. I attempt to understand our uses of intuition by appealing to tacit knowledge. The hope is to elicit a picture of intuition as being practical and explanatory. Our reliance on intuition is warranted if we understand it as an expression of tacit knowledge.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
The Indian Act of Canada specifically targeting First Nation women has been blatantly discriminatory. In 1951 section 12(1) (b) was successfully passed and dealt specifically with First Nation women, effectively disinheriting them when they married non-status men. Conversely, Native status was not only retained for their brothers, but also passed on to their non-Native wives. It remained that way until 1981 when the United Nations, an international body, deemed it sexually discriminatory. Though challenged by Native women across Canada, there was little effort from the courts, band councils and Native advocacy groups to correct this injustice. It wasn’t until 1985, when Bill C-31 was introduced to deal with this injustice. This thesis followed Marie’s experience as she was disenfranchised. Disenfranchised women were forced to make do in urbanized communities where opportunities were few and poverty the trend. In Marie’s case poverty, loss of identity, lack of education, abuse and dislocation from her community affected her greatly. She could neither belong in the Western world, nor return to her community. Such Women fell under the full effect of colonization. Their communities crossed them off their membership lists and they were rejected not only from their communities, but often from within their own families. Section 12(1) (b), as it dealt with First Nation women had the deleterious effect of dividing communities and families from within. Though she eventually regained her status, Marie shared reflections about her journey back and acknowledged that her healing came from giving back and serving others. It is what made her resilient. Marie was interviewed over the summer of 2016 and her experiences written as narratives and collected by Catherine Davis, her daughter and author of this study. As the stories of mother and daughter intertwine in the writing of this thesis, it became an autoethnography where personal experiences intersect with the public domain. This study has implications for any Canadian teacher who interacts with First Nation people. Experiences, like Marie’s, offer balance iii and is the first step in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Stories have the power to heal and telling the truth is where we start.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Low immersion and sickness experienced in virtual reality (VR) are two important barriers that inhibit the widespread adoption of VR technology. Both are thought to relate to visual-vestibular mismatch. Recoupling multisensory cues can generate more convincing illusory self-motion (vection) and reduce sickness, but current methods rely on expensive or invasive techniques to simulate expected cues. According to a Bayesian framework of sensory integration, adding sensory noise may also reduce mismatch by changing sensory weights. This thesis explores this idea and proposes that ‘noisy’ vestibular stimulation presents an attractive solution to the above problems. &#xD;
I investigated the potential for improving VR experiences using two techniques that generate noise in the vestibular system. Rather than recoupling the senses, I aimed to encourage discounting of vestibular cues that are inconsistent with vision. In Chapter 2 I assessed the potential for improving immersion by measuring the effect of noisy vestibular stimulation (either bone-conducted vibration, BCV; or galvanic vestibular stimulation, GVS) on vection onset latency. I found a large reduction in vection latency when transient BCV or GVS were used at visual motion onset. The evidence suggests that a more compelling sensation of self-motion is achieved when sensory mismatch is reduced. &#xD;
In a second study I examined the extent to which sickness is reduced when BCV is applied during path navigation in a high-end VR display (Chapter 3). Results revealed lower sickness when transient noisy stimulation was applied. In a replication of this experiment I found that BCV reduced sickness to a similar extent when observers used a commercial head-mounted display.&#xD;
The results of Chapter 2 and 3 offer evidence that BCV reduces multisensory mismatch by down-weighting vestibular information according to Bayesian cue combination models. Given this context I also expected BCV to reduce self-motion sensitivity in a real-world movement discrimination task (Chapter 4). The results of a third study did not support my predictions, suggesting that the effects of noisy stimulation on self-motion may be more complex than previously considered. &#xD;
Together the findings give rise to a variety of opportunities for further testing of the technique, which are discussed in Chapter 5.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the experiences, motivations and the imaginary of people who seek to democratize access to energy. Through a survey of the energy democracy movement in Europe and North America and a case study of two participatory and democratically oriented electricity providers in Central America, this thesis examines the differences and similarities between democratizing energy in the Global North and Global South in the context of marketization and the global push to transition to renewable energy. The forces of an expanding global energy economy are increasingly influencing the way that we can access and consume energy in our lives. Local interactions cannot be understood by an isolated analysis without considering the larger structural conditions that implicate them. Today, we are witnessing a global push to transition our energy resources from fossil fuels to renewables due to the emergency of climate change. For the most part, this transition preoccupies itself with changing the technological instruments that source us the energy. Yet few changes are targeting transition from growth focused market-based economic models. Energy Democracy is one new imaginary that people are rallying around to help realize alternatives to drive more equitable and sustainable post-carbon futures. This thesis finds that there are unfounded normative assumptions being made about groups organizing around energy democracy that is causing scatter in the movement. There is an aggressive strand of energy democracy that readily accepts for-profit schemes and risks turning energy democracy into just another space for capital accumulation in the energy sector. This thesis presents two important suggestions for reconciling these problems. Firstly, to look beyond moving the term itself and prioritize connecting on the basis of the underlying principles that define the term. This will ultimately create more meaningful solidarity in the future, and a more grounded and unified movement. Secondly, to increase focus on exploring the experiences and motivations of like-minded groups in the Global South who are heavily implicated by this global energy transition and, necessarily, by any movement that seeks an alternative to it.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Anhedonia, a severe deficit in reward processing, is an endophenotype of several neuropsychiatric disorders (APA, 2000) and increases susceptibility to depression (Atherton et al., 2015), substance abuse (Hatzigiakoumis et al., 2011), and suicidality (Winer et al., 2016). Recent literature suggests that anhedonia reflects a maladaptive interaction between reward circuitry and stress, the former being mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system and the latter by the glucocorticoid system (Vrieze et al., 2013). The role of the DA system in the development and maintenance of anhedonia has been studied extensively, but little is known about the contribution of the glucocorticoid system to this process. The goal of the current study was to investigate the dopaminergic and glucocorticoid systems as underlying mechanisms of anhedonia using a validated rat test of anhedonia, the probabilistic reward task (PRT). In this task, rats learned to discriminate between two ambiguous tones for a sucrose reward. During testing, one lever was programmed to produce three times more reward than the other lever. Similar to healthy humans, rats develop a response bias toward the more frequently reinforced stimulus, regardless of which tone is presented. Consistent with prior literature, the response bias was enhanced following amphetamine- (AMPH) induced DA activation, and reduced following pramipexole- (PRAMI) induced DA inhibition. Additionally, a 21-day chronic mild stress (CMS) regimen attenuated the response bias in a subpopulation of animals relative to no stress controls. Finally, the glucocorticoid antagonist, mifepristone (MIFE), had no effect on the response bias relative to saline (SAL); however, the glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone (DEX), attenuated the response bias relative to both SAL and MIFE. These results confirm a role of DA in reward processing, and highlight an additional contribution of the glucocorticoid system in the mediation of this effect. Thus, it is plausible that chronic stress directly interferes with normal mesolimbic DA functioning, which leads to an overall impairment in reward responsiveness. These findings underscore the importance of treatment directed toward the DA and glucocorticoid systems, rather than the current SSRI treatment. Future studies on the etiology of anhedonia should carefully investigate the interaction of these systems in reward processing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Negative attitudes towards students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are a lingering challenge in the education system. It is important to examine pre-service teachers’ perceptions of ADHD in an educational setting due to the influential roles of teachers on students. Pre-service teachers’ knowledge and attitudes, as well as their perceptions of ADHD, have powerful influences on the ways in which teachers' pedagogical decisions affect their interactions and relationships with students. The purpose of the study was to explore pre-service teachers’ knowledge of ADHD and their attitudes and perceptions towards including ADHD in the general classroom. The purpose of this study was informed by two research questions: Do coursework and practicum experience influence pre-service teachers’ knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of including students with ADHD in the general education classroom? What underlies a change in pre-service teachers’ knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of including students with ADHD in the general education classroom? A mixed-method study was conducted using a sequential explanatory design, examining 28 primary/junior pre-service teachers from a university, in a city in Ontario. Pre-test and post-test data were collected through questionnaires, responses to vignettes, and in-depth individual interviews. Questionnaire analysis indicated four significant differences from time 1 to time 2. Three individual interviews were conducted; overall pre-service teachers had positive attitudes towards students with ADHD, but lacked content knowledge and felt there were weaknesses in their knowledge due to their teacher education program design. This study provides an in-depth understanding of pre-service teachers’ knowledge, attitudes (what they think or feel) and perceptions (their understanding or interpretation) of students with ADHD. Findings of this study could be of interest to Ontario curriculum developers, policy makers, teacher educators, and practicing teachers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), popularly referred to as ‘drones’, have increased in popularity over the past two decades. Various concerns have been raised about their implementation, primarily focusing on their surveillance capabilities. Through an intervention explanatory sequential design 80 participants (50F/30M) in South Eastern Ontario, Canada, were either exposed to a UAV (Experimental = 40) or not (Control = 40) and were given a word association task. From these participants, a subsample of 16 (F=7, M=9) respondents (8 from both groups) was taken for semi-structured interviews. The findings from the word association task indicate that the control group associated UAVs with more military applications and less positive admirations while the experimental group had the exact opposite results. Additionally, both conditions and genders found surveillance associations to be related to UAVs. Results from the semi-structured interviews indicate that individuals are influenced by previous knowledge surrounding UAVs and are primarily concerned about the surveillance implications for the following reasons: exposures to privacy, chilling/conforming behaviours, feelings of unease, signifies ‘Big Brother’, mobile cameras, gendered notions of surveillance and operation, and influences crime control and perception. Further qualitative analysis revealed that even though both genders found surveillance of UAVs to be an issue, they do so for different reasoning. Females were more likely to indicate the UAV being used to observe their body while males were more concerned with general uses of voyeurism. Overall, UAVs have the potential to evoke a sense of ‘surveillance gone too far’ depending on the context in which they are used. It is speculated that this aversion arises out of the power-space-visuality relationship UAVs hold, causing reactions to become more visceral.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reverse osmosis separation processes are often performed using spiral wound mem- brane modules. Spacer meshes are placed between adjacent membrane layers to prevent them from coming into contact. Spacers promote mixing and increase mass transfer by disrupting fluid flow in the channel, and can reduce the chance of concen- tration polarization in the membrane. In this thesis a simplified membrane module configuration consisting of a straight channel with an array of centred cylindrical spacers is analyzed using direct numerical simulation. The purpose of the study is to gain a better understanding of the fluid flow and mass transfer in the channel, and to determine if any phenomena are periodic. &#xD;
Solutes with Schmidt numbers of 1, 3, and 5 are examined for Reynolds numbers of 100, 300, and 500 (based on the cylinder diameter and bulk velocity when there is no blockage). Flow and concentration fields were analyzed for their impact on effects such as the vortex shedding, velocity spectra, pressure drop, shear rate, and mass transfer. Vortices are shed along the top and bottom of the cylinders, and their convection downstream has significant impacts on the local shear stress at the wall. As the Reynolds number increases, the local peak of the shear rate fluctuates, indicating that the flow is not periodic. &#xD;
The concentration field becomes more dilute with an increase in both Reynolds i &#xD;
and Schmidt numbers. The location of the local maxima and minima is dependent on the nature of vortex shedding. Mass transfer enhancement is strongly related to shear stresses and improved with increasing Reynolds number and Schmidt num- ber. The spatial distribution of the Sherwood number does not indicate a periodic concentration field for a Reynolds number above 100. &#xD;
The scope of the work was limited by a need for computing resources in excess of what was available. Future work should include gaining additional data points for the proposed correlations by varying the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. Additional configurations should be considered, such as an array of cylinders with an off-centre location, and an array of cylinders that follow a ”zig-zag” pattern.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The formation of carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds represents a very rare form of enzyme catalysis relative to other organohalogens. Instead of an oxidative mechanism, desolvation and nucleophilic incorporation of fluoride is required. Nucleocidin, produced by Streptomyces calvus, is a novel fluorinated analog of adenosine. The fluorine at the 4’-carbon of nucleocidin demands an unusual sequence of cleavage of the 4’C-H bond of the ribose ring and stereospecific glycosylation of fluoride. The nucleocidin biosynthetic gene cluster has recently been identified in Streptomyces calvus. This provides an opportunity to elucidate the functions of the encoded enzymes. To determine the minimal set of genes required to synthesize nucleocidin, a strategy was developed to clone the gene cluster using transformation associated recombination (TAR) in yeast, followed by heterologous expression in another Streptomyces strain. In parallel, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to inactivate selected biosynthetic genes. Plasmids encoding CRISPR/Cas9 that were designed to inactivate orf171, nucG, and nucK were conjugated into S. calvus. Additionally, the biosynthesis of a chlorinated derivative of nucleocidin was attempted by incorporating the putative ascamycin halogenase genes acmX and acmY into S. calvus Spore 4. Integration of acmX into the chromosome of S. calvus Spore 4 was successful as confirmed by PCR, while integration of acmY could not be confirmed.The presence of nucleocidin in the extracts of S. calvus Spore 4 att::[acmX, aac(3)IV] and S. calvus Spore 4 was confirmed by 19FNMR spectroscopy. A new signal was observed in the S. calvus Spore 4 att::[acmY,aac(3)IV] extract that was not observed in the S. calvus Spore 4 extract. This could correspond to a chlorinated derivative, or a new nucleocidin biosynthetic or shunt intermediate. AcmX was successfully heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified. Further studies can focus on assaying AcmX to confirm its function as a variant B FADH2-dependent chlorinase. A putative purine nucleoside phosphorylase (orf206) present in the nucleocidin cluster was heterologously expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli, setting the stage for purification under denaturing conditions. Finally, enhanced production of nucleocidin was not observed after orf191 encoding a predicted streptomycin-like regulatory gene was integrated onto the chromosome of S. calvus Spore 4. Overall, this work sets the stage for investigating the functions of nucleocidin biosynthetic genes and generating new nucleocidin derivatives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at a heightened risk for poor mental health. Limitations of medication use for the treatment of ADHD include non-response and adverse side effects. Physical activity has shown promise for such treatments through the alleviation of the direct symptoms of ADHD, as well as the fostering of positive mental health. However, the contexts in which physical activity occurs in youth with ADHD and impacts upon their mental health have not been thoroughly explored.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: The objectives of this thesis are to: 1) describe the prevalence of positive and negative mental health indicators in Canadian youth with ADHD and compare the prevalence of these indicators to Canadian youth without ADHD, 2) estimate the strength and statistical significance of associations between different types of physical activity and mental health indicators in adolescents with ADHD, and; 3) examine the potential influence of biological sex and age in these relationships.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Data from the 7th cycle of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study was used. Prevalence estimates were calculated for each mental health indicator by ADHD status. Rao-Scott chi-square tests were conducted to examine group differences. Multi-level log binomial regression models were developed to explore the associations of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Canadian adolescents with ADHD reported poorer mental health than Canadian adolescents without ADHD. Within the ADHD population, females reported a higher prevalence of negative mental health indicators than males. Inconsistent patterns were found between engagement in different types of physical activities and mental health in youth with ADHD. The main potential etiological finding was that engagement in physical activity in certain contexts was associated with high prosocial behaviour in adolescents with ADHD.    &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Identification of different mental health patterns in males and females in the ADHD population suggests the possibility of differential diagnoses of ADHD by biological sex. Physical activity in different contexts may have differential effects on the mental health of young people with ADHD. Understanding of these relationships could help inform public health to develop physical activity interventions that are the most effective in this subpopulation of youth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goal of this research is to understand how work (both formal and informal) is situated within the lives of homeless youth and how this intersect is affected by peer networks and relationships developed on the streets. This research aims to increase understanding on whether homelessness and formal work are compatible through highlighting the everyday challenges that affect homeless youth in their struggles to successfully transition off the streets and into adulthood. Through 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with a sample of homeless youth recruited from Ottawa, Ontario, this research investigates how peer networks affect a street youth’s ability towards taking conventional or alternative pathways to money- making pathways. Further, it examines why some homeless youth choose the types of informal money- making strategies they are engaged in and why they stray away from conventional working aspirations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results reveal that despite maintaining conventional goals and aspirations regarding rejoining conventional streams of society, youths turned to informal work due to their lack of viable options in the formal economy. Engagement in the informal economy was cited as necessary in order to satisfy addictions and generate a quick income to alleviate economic instability. Informal working involvements were met with numerous impeding risks and barriers including being subject to victimization, harsh weather conditions, mental and physical health issues and demographic barriers. Cumulative disadvantages were seen to impede youths’ abilities to successfully navigate their informal behaviours on the streets as well as maintain an attachment to family, friends, and school. Further, in most cases youth tended to lack significant formal employment experiences. Even when attaining formal employment, youths turned to illegal activities to supplement their incomes. Severe barriers challenged youths’ abilities to maintain employment as well as balance an attachment to family, friends, and school. These included challenges inherent to living without stable shelter, a lack of viable transportation and struggles with addiction. The results also suggest how social networks influenced youths’ navigations on the streets in respect to employment (both formal and informal) by facilitating criminal engagement through direct and indirect exposures and being embedded in criminal networks. Formal employment facilitation was nearly non-existent through means of peer network influences and youths’ motives and attitudes regarding conventional lifestyle aspirations did not reflect that of their peer networks. The findings in this research are discussed in light of Agnew’s (2006) General Strain Theory and McCarthy et al.’s (2002) Social Capital Theory. Suggestions are offered for future research directions and implications for policy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mercedes-Benz Canada Inc., Fuel Cell Division, manufactures polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell stacks for use in vehicles. The manufacturing line is being optimized for efficiency and quality control, in order to uphold the high standards of Mercedes-Benz Inc. vehicles. In an operating polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, the catalyst coated membrane facilitates the electrochemical reaction that generates electricity. This research examines the equilibration of catalyst coated membrane rolls to controlled temperature and humidity conditions, before they are used in the manufacturing of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Equilibration involves allowing the water content in the catalyst coated membrane to stabilize at the controlled conditions, in order to reduce mechanical stress in the material for better manufacturability. Initial equilibration measurements were conducted on discrete catalyst coated membrane samples using novel electronic conductivity measurements of the catalyst layer, and compared to ionic conductivity measurements of the membrane. Electronic conductivity measurements are easier to implement in the manufacturing environment than the more complex ionic conductivity measurements. When testing discrete catalyst coated membrane samples in an environmental chamber, the equilibration trends for the measured ionic and electronic conductivity signals were similar enough to permit us to adapt the electronic conductivity measurements for catalyst coated membrane in roll form. Equilibration measurements of catalyst coated membrane rolls were optimized to achieve a robust and repeatable procedure which could be used in the manufacturing environment at Mercedes-Benz Canada Inc., Fuel Cell Division.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Different cosmological and astronomical observations from the past century indicate that non-baryonic matter, commonly referred to as dark matter, dominates the composition of the universe. Discovering the nature and properties of dark matter has been one of the most pursued goals of modern physics.&#xD;
The DEAP collaboration developed a single-phase 3600 kg liquid argon experiment, DEAP-3600, to measure possible nuclear recoils generated by the interactions between the target nuclei and WIMP particles from the surrounding galactic dark matter halo. DEAP-3600 utilizes the powerful pulse-shape discrimination method to distinguish between the aforementioned interaction and its different types of background. &#xD;
The work presented in this thesis focuses on the identification and reduction of the background from alpha particle decays, from the $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th decay chains. This was first undertaken with the development and deployment of a custom designed sanding robot, aimed at reducing radiogenic surface contamination, which removed 506$\pm$50 $\mu$m of acrylic from the inner-most portion of the detector surface. Furthermore, different analysis tools were developed and used during different phases of the experiment to measure the remaining radiogenic activities carefully. Said analysis estimated a liquid argon bulk activity of 0.540$\pm$0.0016 mBq for the $^{222}$Rn chain and 0.0127$\pm$0.0022 mBq for the $^{220}$Rn chain, as well as an overall surface activity of 3.87$\pm$0.41 mBq. This thesis also reports on the first WIMP analysis performed with the DEAP-3600 experiment. With a total fiducial exposure of 14226$\pm$1384 kg-days, no WIMP candidate events were identified in the dataset allowing to set an upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section of $1.77\times10^{-44}$ cm$^{2}$, at a WIMP mass of 100 GeV.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Data centers are the cornerstone of business in modern society and individual lives. Of similar significance to daily life is the external AC-DC power supply exemplified by the cell phone charger. In both applications, power converters play the key role. As the demand for high-performance-and-small-size power converters increases, resonant converters, have become dominant in the data center power systems, and are gaining popularity in the cell phone charging market.&#xD;
This thesis discusses three challenges in both applications – holdup issue, multiphase operation with current sharing in data center application, and universal AC input for the external AC-DC application. Aiming at these issues, several solutions have been proposed.&#xD;
Specifically, sLLC converter is proposed for holdup applications, and LCLC converter can be used in both holdup and wide-input-voltage-range applications. Both technologies can extend the operational input voltage range of the conventional LLC converters, while have no impact on the performance of normal operation.&#xD;
For the high current application, common-inductor and common-capacitor multiphase LLC converters are proposed to achieve current sharing without additional sensing and control. By adding one wire to connect the resonant inductors or the resonant capacitors in the conventional multiphase LLC converter, the current sharing performance can be improved from completely unshared to almost evenly shared. &#xD;
Following the paradigm of the common inductor and common capacitor LLC converters, the impedance matching concept is proposed to model the coupled resonant tank with de-coupled components. With the proposed impedance matching concept, the current sharing mechanism is explained from the input impedance point of view, and more topologies with current sharing ability have been found.&#xD;
For the universal AC-DC power supply, a new series resonant converter with capacitor bypassing method is proposed to significantly reduce the inductor size and loss. Besides, the performance is expected to improve thanks to the removal of switching loss and reduction of conduction loss as compared to existing technologies. &#xD;
In this thesis, the proposed theories are verified by physical and mathematical analysis and computer simulations. Circuit prototypes are built to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed topologies and design methods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High-Performance Computing (HPC) represents the flagship domain in providing high-end computing capabilities that play a critical role in helping humanity solve its hardest problems. Ranging from answering profound questions about the universe to finding a cure for cancer, HPC applications span nearly every aspect of our life. The impressive power of HPC systems comes mainly from the massive number of processors---in the order of millions---that they provide. The efficiency of communications among these processors is the main bottleneck in the overall performance of HPC systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation presents new algorithms for improving the communication performance in HPC systems by exploiting the topology information. &#xD;
We propose a parallel topology- and routing-aware mapping heuristic and a refinement algorithm that improves the communication performance by achieving a lower congestion across the network links. Our experimental results with 4,096 processors show that the proposed approach can provide more than 60% improvement in various mapping metrics compared to an initial in-order mapping of processes. Communication time is also improved by up to 50%.&#xD;
We also propose four topology-aware mapping heuristics designed specifically for collective communications in the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The heuristics provide a better match between the collective communication algorithm and the physical topology of the system, and decrease the communication latency by up to 78%.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, we expand topology-aware communications into the scope of accelerated computing. Using accelerators---especially Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)---to speed up certain types of computations plays an increasingly important role in HPC. We present a unified framework for topology-aware process mapping and GPU assignment in multi-GPU systems. Our experimental results on two clusters with 64 GPUs show that the proposed approach improves communication performance by up to 91%.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we present a novel distributed algorithm that uses the process topology information to design optimized communication schedules for MPI neighborhood collectives. The proposed algorithm finds the common neighborhoods in a distributed graph topology and exploits them as an opportunity to improve the communication performance through message combining. The optimized schedules reduce the communication latency of MPI neighborhood collectives by more than 50%.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Software issue resolving process is one of the most frequent maintenance activities during the software development process. An issue tracking system (ITS) is often used to better manage the software issues. However, previous research work has shown that the issue resolving process needs development teams to put a large amount of effort to address the reported issues. When developers raise questions to clarify the description of issue reports during the issue resolving process, it takes time for developers to receive the response for the questions. Hence, the raised questions may negatively affect the efficiency of the issue resolving process. Moreover, a large proportion (e.g., 80% in Firefox) of the reported issues are rejected (e.g., the issue is not reproducible). The issue reports might exist in the ITS for a long time before they are rejected (e.g., over 50% of rejected issue reports are rejected after 6.73 days in Firefox). Even though these reports are rejected eventually, developers must have wasted valuable resources on triaging, inspecting and rejecting such reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we conduct two empirical studies to reduce the effort spent on the software issue resolving process. In the first study, we investigate how the process of resolving issues is impacted by the questions raised from the issue reports in the resolving process and apply machine learning techniques to predict if developers will raise questions from a new issue report. Our prediction result can give developers an early warning whether questions will be raised when the issue report is created. Developers can take proper actions to handle the issue reports that are likely to have questions raised, in order to improve the effectiveness of the issue resolving process. In the second study, we investigate the characteristics of issue reports that can be rejected by developers in the resolving process. We propose to prioritize the valid issue reports at higher positions and the predicted rejected issue reports at lower positions so that developers can put more effort on the valid issue reports.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Accurate environmental assessments can help inform landowners, policy-makers, and energy consumers about the risks or benefits of using biomass production for energy over other land-use options such as other renewable energy projects or food production. Life cycle assessment (LCA), a tool often used to assess the potential environmental impacts of bioenergy systems, faces ongoing issues associated with evaluating dynamic multi-scale systems. Although the importance of considering site-specific variation in LCA as geographies change has been identified for some time, adoption of geographical concepts in LCA has been slow to develop.  The aim of this thesis is to facilitate a discussion between geographic and LCA thought, and address what LCA approaches should look like when we need to evaluate environmental systems across a range of geographies, in the context of bioenergy feedstock production. An in-depth analysis of existing LCA standards reveal several areas in goal and scope directions where vague or absent instructions may lead to inappropriate use of geographical attributes by practitioners.  Using gaps identified in LCA standards, a systematic review of bioenergy LCA literature is performed over a ten-year period (2005 – 2015) to understand how spatial and temporal attributes of systems, input data, and scope definitions vary and may affect results when different LCAs are compared. Finally, using a modular multi-scale approach, a LCA of short-rotation coppice (SRC) willow is performed for a site in Guelph, Ontario, to evaluate modified LCA performance that incorporates geographic inputs over more traditional approaches to compiling inventories and evaluating impacts. The inclusion of smaller scale spatial and temporal attributes in the modular approach showed that improving data resolution can be used to address site-specific questions that more aggregated data cannot.  This thesis points towards a need to address issues of scale within LCA standards, particularly with respect to components of the scope such as data quality requirements.  Improving the transparency of geographical attributes of future LCAs provide an opportunity to document underlying characteristics of systems that may otherwise go unnoticed, but also provide a framework in which future dynamic LCA tools and models can be integrated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: The rate of lifestyle induced chronic diseases has increased rapidly over the last few decades. Diseases related to obesity such as Type 2 Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, have become leading causes of death worldwide. The effect of these diseases is becoming increasingly apparent in low and middle-income countries such as Mexico. In response to the rise in obesity and non-communicable diseases, the Mexican government enacted a policy called the Grupos de Ayuda Mutua (GAM), which looks to treat, manage, and prevent chronic diseases. A GAM is a peer-support group of patients with lifestyle-induced chronic diseases that receive guidance and oversight by a multidisciplinary group of health professionals. The health professionals are guided by evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to provide the best quality of care to their patients, however, when CPGs are applied in real world contexts, unforeseen challenges to adherence and application are observed (Larme &amp; Pugh, 2001). Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the barriers and facilitators to CPG application from the perspective of physicians in Mexican GAMs. Methods: Working in collaboration with the Secretariat of Health in Jalisco, physicians (n = 24) were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews, which were guided by the Clinical Practice Guideline Framework for Improvement (Cabana et al., 1999). Deductive thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes from the physician verbatim. Inductive analysis was used to identify facilitators to CPG application and recommendations from participants regarding how the GAMs and application of CPGs could be improved. Results: Physicians identified a variety of barriers and facilitators to CPG application in the GAMs. Barriers included lack of medication, lack of regional guidance, institutional culture, and more. Facilitators included creativity, seeing results, choosing the “right” patients, and more. Discussion: This study is one of the first to explore barriers and facilitators to CPG application in GAMs. Recommendations and considerations from participants on how the GAMs and application of CPGs could be improved are also reported. Study findings can be used by state health officials to improve the GAM strategy and facilitate the use of evidence-based methods in the GAMs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Modification of metallic surfaces using thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been explored in the literature in the past three decades; silver surfaces less explored than gold. This technology has promise in many surface-based applications, specifically in micro electronics, sensors that use the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon, and in catalysis. Unfortunately, the reactivity of silver towards sulfur means that thiol-based monolayers can form sulfide layers at the surface interface in atmospheric conditions making silver a troublesome metal for surface applications.  If sulfidization could be overcome, a robust SAM on silver might prove to be an effective tool for SPR, as silver is more sensitive to surface plasmon effects than gold, the current standard.  Our group has described a series of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) which form SAMs on gold. As the carbene is attached to the surface via a metal-carbon bond, the problem of sulfidization may be overcome. Here, I describe the synthesis of a peptide for the application of heavy metal detection with the use of an NHC on a gold surface as well as the deposition and functionalization of silver surfaces with a series of NHCs, which might serve as appropriate candidates for use in an SPR sensor.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data show the NHCs chemisorb intact on the surface, and the stability of the films to oxidation are explored under a range of conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation focuses on a number of contemporary contiguous fantasies for children, books in which the fantastic is set in the real world of consensus reality. It explores how these texts deploy landscape and argues these contemporary novels use landscape as a means to subvert earlier conceptions of how children’s fantasy and children themselves interact with conceptions of place. Since children are often uncritically associated with the past and the primitive, this dissertation focuses on texts that subvert this paradigm by questioning what spaces children belong in, what places are appropriate for the uses of fantasy, and how past children’s fantasies have embraced nostalgia through their pastoral, rural, and pseudo-medieval landscapes. In the first chapter, I examine Rick Riordan’s Kane Chronicles and argue that Riordan’s text, by focusing on ancient Egyptian forms and structures within the North American landscape, privileges American spaces and places in a genre that has long been associated with European and British landscapes. My second chapter focuses on Charlie Fletcher’s Stoneheart trilogy, in particular its urban London setting, which takes the child out of the gardens and pastoral spaces of traditional British children’s literature and places the child protagonist within urban “Un-London” where the statues of the city are animate characters. Here, among all of London’s statuary, Fletcher’s text privileges statues that represent unexpected layers of that city’s deep palimpsest. My final chapter examines several texts including R.L. LaFevers’ Theodosia Throckmorton series and Philip Pullman’s The Subtle Knife to focus on children in the space of the museum, a space traditionally represented in children’s literature as a realm of adult authority. Rather than accepting the curation of the museum as static and unyielding, these texts offer examples of critical child consumers whose arcane and material knowledge of the artifacts questions the historical narrative that they represent. Through these readings, I argue that landscape (especially for children) is constructed just as childhood is constructed and each of these texts enacts a kind of curation that steps out of monolithic or uncritical nostalgic readings of time and place, interrogating both the place of the child in space and the way the past is presented to children.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores the nature of workers’ self-activity during World War II and the ensuing responses to these actions by the state and capital. A close examination of wartime strikes demonstrates that top-down efforts by unions to operate within normative industrial relations were generally failures. Far more likely to be effective were democratic strikes, generally illegal, called from the shopfloor. The Workers’ War further illustrates that while the government passed incredibly coercive legislation to control labour, such legislation failed to have a significant impact. Even where it was most influential and targeted it was eventually beaten through direct action. Even Japanese Canadian forced labour in work camps with armed guards, undertook effective strikes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Largely interested in institutional and legislative changes, the unions, far from being a militant force, spent much of their energy trying to stop or curtail strikes. This thesis contends that the concretion of industrial legality in Canada was imposed to control effective action. Rather than breaking unions of their militancy, the dearth of a state terror apparatus necessitated the creation of compulsory bargaining legislation. First, it argues that the creation of the modern industrial relations regime that forms the foundation for modern labour law was the result of effective workers’ action rather than militant unions.&#xD;
It further shows that the repressive apparatus of the state was unable to control workers, necessitating a structural adjustment. In a larger sense, this thesis argues that this story is at the centre of the history of capitalism in Canada. The imposition of capitalist social relations on the geographies that become Canada had the transformation of land into capital via labour at the very core of its project. Controlling labour was a central concern, and the manner in which labour relations were consolidated was a reflection of a negotiation between labour, capital, and state- a manifestly unequal negotiation that largely failed to reflect the interests of workers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper aims to re-evaluate the place of Philip II “Augustus” in the canon of medieval French historiography, and seeks to examine his reign within the context of the development of an ideology of sacral Capetian kingship, as opposed to the more traditional interpretation of the rise of the political power of the Capetian dynasty. While acknowledging Philip’s crucial contribution to the emergence of medieval France as one of the pre-eminent political powers of Latin Christendom in the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, this paper argues that the wider historiographical field has diminished Philip’s equally important role in the construction of sacral Capetian ideology, presenting him as a proto-realpolitik monarch, rather than one overly concerned with spiritual or symbolic authority. In challenging the predominant historiographical portrayal of Philip II, this paper returns to an older tradition of scholarship embodied in historians such as Marc Bloch and Ernst Kantorowicz that emphasized both the sacerdotal understanding and representation of medieval monarchical power to contemporary theorists, and further argues that there existed a theoretical framework of uniquely Capetian sacral kingship that informed Philip’s most significant political and administrative reforms, and which he was intimately aware of and responding to. Moreover, Philip presided over the maturation of Capetian monarchical ideology through his own contributions in the patronage of the abbey of Saint-Denis, and a reinforcement of ties between the emergent Dionysian center of historical writing, the veneration of Saint Denis, and the Capetian monarchy. Alongside this development, Philip’s reign saw the revival and incorporation of Carolingian symbolism and nomenclature into the canon of Capetian monarchical conventions, which enhanced the sacral reputation of the Capetian dynasty and legitimized the dramatic expansion of political and territorial authority that characterized Philip’s rule. Ultimately, Philip’s contribution to an ideology of sacral Capetian kingship was highly significant in that it saw the emergence of a nascent understanding of a communal identity of Franci in Francia, united under the figure of the sacral Capetian king and through shared ethnic, linguistic, and religious historical heritage, which would come to full fruition during the reigns of Louis IX and Philip IV.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Model-Driven Engineering tools and techniques have become mainstream aids in the development&#xD;
of embedded cyber-physical systems. The large-scale use of visual models is a powerful&#xD;
paradigm for designing reliable and maintainable systems assembled with complex hardware, software&#xD;
and mechanical elements. Modular design approaches can readily capture the requirements&#xD;
for embedded systems into executable and evolutionary models.&#xD;
&#xD;
We propose a framework to discover, classify and visualize model-patterns in large repositories of&#xD;
Simulink models. We design, and implement in a software toolchain, a set of scalable algorithms to&#xD;
fully traverse and contextually parse the source code of these repositories in order to compute topology&#xD;
hash functions for the size, name connectivity and type connectivity of each model subsystem,&#xD;
as well as properties of Stateflow charts. We use these extracted properties to cluster the subsystems&#xD;
into a set of addressable-by-property classes. We develop an interactive model visualization and&#xD;
querying facility, embodied by the MoSART user interface, to identify further relations, similarities&#xD;
and abstractions in the elements of the cluster classes. This tool provides a configurable environment&#xD;
for inferring structural model-patterns and elaborating on semantic model-patterns with the assistance&#xD;
of skilled domain knowledge. We propose a query system, based on regular expressions that&#xD;
match values of previously computed subsystems properties, as an effective method to iteratively&#xD;
refine Simulink model-patterns abstractions into accumulated modeling knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our implementation works cooperatively with a 3-phase iterative model-pattern discovery approach&#xD;
that we conceptualize as 1) model clustering: repository traversal and subsystem-topology&#xD;
evaluation for clustering subsystems, 2) primary model-pattern inference: visualization, querybased&#xD;
search and clustering for identifying basic semantic patterns, 3) model-pattern refinement:&#xD;
continuous refinement of basic patterns into specialized groups for application in targeted use cases.&#xD;
We effectively support the iterative nature of this approach because our repository traversal, property&#xD;
evaluation and clustering algorithms have low time-complexity, that is, between a lower-bound(n) and&#xD;
O(n lg n)(n = total lines of source code in a repository), and our interactive tool provides a &#xD;
complete-coverage view of a model repository.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Spending time outdoors and connecting with nature are beneficial for the physical and mental health of humans. Nature has been associated with promotion of positive mental health through stress reduction and multiple other pathways. Much of the work on this topic has focused on adult populations. The ways that nature may relate to the mental health of young people represents an important gap in knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: Using a large, nationally representative sample of Canadian adolescents, the objectives of this thesis were: 1) to examine the association between outdoor play and psychosomatic symptoms; 2) to examine the association between perceived importance of nature connectedness and psychosomatic symptoms; and 3) to determine whether these associations were dependent on sex and/or age. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: In an analysis of data collected from young Canadians in 2013/2014, I described the prevalence of outdoor play, perceived importance of nature connectedness, and psychosomatic symptoms. Next, I developed a series of log-binomial regression models to quantify associations between the exposures to nature and the outcome in the form of relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. After accounting for relevant confounders in the models, sex and age were tested as effect modifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The association between outdoor play and psychosomatic symptoms was found to be modified by sex but not age group. Among female adolescents, playing outdoors for at least 30 minutes/week was associated with a 24% (95% CI: 5%, 40%) reduction in the prevalence of high psychosomatic symptoms compared to those reporting no weekly outdoor time. Among males, there was no statistically significant relationship between outdoor play and psychosomatic symptoms. The association between perceived importance of nature connectedness and psychosomatic symptoms did not differ according to sex or age. Perception of connection to nature as ‘important’ was associated with a 25% (95% CI: 9%, 38%) reduction in the prevalence of high psychosomatic symptoms compared to those who perceived connection to nature as ‘not important’.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of adolescent engagement with nature as one strategy to promote their psychological well-being. It also emphasizes the importance of accounting for differences between the sexes when researching, planning, and implementing public mental health initiatives that consider exposure to the outdoors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) are the most common and fatal histological subtype of ovarian cancer, characterised by late stage diagnosis and high mortality rates. Unfortunately, the majority of patients (&gt; 85%) will develop fatal chemoresistant disease despite multiple lines of treatment. Recent studies investigating the tumour immune microenvironment have highlighted the prognostic significance of different tumour infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets and secreted immune factors in HGSC. However, the mechanisms promoting TIL recruitment to the tumour epithelial compartment, where they show the most benefit, remain poorly understood in HGSC. It is known that alterations and activities of TILs are mediated by the interaction of various cytokines and growth factors in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is activated in response to interferon signalling and upregulates cytokines responsible for the recruitment of TILs to the TME. Building on previous findings linking STAT1 expression to a pre-existing immunoreactive TME and improved clinical outcome in HGSC, the current study investigates the role of cancer cell intrinsic STAT1 expression in regulating an anti-tumour immune microenvironment and disease progression in HGSC. Immune transcriptomic analysis of HGSC patient tumours indicates a significant downregulation of immune related genes in chemoresistant patients with low-STAT1 expression. Functional studies confirmed STAT1 as a positive regulator of anti-tumour immune responses in the TME through its role in cytokine signalling and TIL recruitment. In vitro experiments revealed that decreased STAT1 expression is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In vivo experiments in a syngeneic mouse model of HGSC revealed that decreased STAT1 in the TME increased disease burden and led to decreased infiltration of CD8+ TILs. These findings are important for the design of immune based therapies to improve chemotherapy response and overall survival in HGSC patients. Further work is required to identify appropriate immunotherapy and chemotherapy combinations for HGSC patients based on their immune profiles.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The separation between the pressure tube (PT) and calandria tube (CT), known as gap, in the CANada Uranium Deuterium (CANDU®) nuclear reactor fuel channels is monitored using a drive-receive eddy current probe. Gap measurement accuracy is crucial to ensure contact does not occur between the PT and CT, as contact can lead to cracking of the PT. Variation of in-reactor parameters can compromise gap measurement accuracy. Validated models of the eddy current response to changes in gap can be used to help identify parameters whose variations most affect gap measurement accuracy. However, current models are limited, since they assume the PT and CT are infinite parallel conductive plates, thereby, neglecting the potential effects of PT and CT curvature. Finite Element Method (FEM) models of flat-plate geometry, true PT-CT gap probe geometry, and concentric tube geometry were developed to explore how different geometric approximations can model gap response. The concentric tube geometry, where the CT remains axially concentric with the PT, accurately accounted for curvature of the PT and varied gap by changing the radius of the CT, had the possibility of an analytical solution. Comparison between the three FEM models and experimental measurements showed that both curved models gave similar accuracy and were more accurate than the flat-plate geometry model. A Second Order Vector Potential (SOVP) formalism was used to develop a semi-analytical model of the concentric tube geometry. This semi-analytical model was shown to be three to five times more accurate than the analytical flat-plate model, when compared with experimental measurements for varying PT wall thickness and resistivity. Using the semi-analytical concentric model, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate which parameter variations had the largest effect on gap measurements. It was shown that variations in liftoff had the largest effect on predicted gap and were approximately two to three times more influential than the next most sensitive parameter variation, PT wall thickness. The analysis demonstrated the necessity for accurate PT wall thickness measurements, currently obtained by ultrasonic techniques. Variation of PT resistivity was the next most significant, a parameter whose variation is currently uncompensated for in PT to CT gap measurements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:&#xD;
Active transportation positively influences the physical and mental health of children and adolescents. Research on active transportation to school suggests that the walkability of the built environment can influence active transportation. Traditionally, active transportation within children and adolescents has been measured using questionnaires and has focused almost exclusively on the trip to school.  &#xD;
Objectives:&#xD;
This thesis studied 10-13 year olds from Kingston, ON and the objectives were to 1) use objective measures to describe children’s total active transportation and active transportation to common travel destinations, and 2) examine the relationship between neighbourhood walkability and children’s active transportation to different destinations. &#xD;
Methods:&#xD;
This was a cross-sectional study of 388 children and early adolescents (aged 10-13 years) from Kingston, ON, Canada. Participants wore a Garmin GPS watch during waking hours for seven consecutive days. GPS data was analyzed using the Personal Activity Measurement Location System (PALMS) software which identified trips, the time spent in each trip and the trip modality (walking, bicycle, or vehicle). GIS measures of connectivity, proximity to destinations, and pedestrian infrastructure and safety were used to create a walkability index within a 1 km travel distance of each participant’s home. &#xD;
Results: &#xD;
Mean time spent in active transportation was 11.0 minutes/day (95% CI: 10.6, 11.5). Time spent in active transportation was higher for boys (12.4 minutes/day [95% CI: 11.8, 13.1]) than for girls (9.5 minutes/day [95% CI: 9.0, 10.1]) and increased from 8.6 minutes/day (95% CI: 8.0, 9.2) at age 10 to 15.4 minutes/day (95% CI: 14.4, 16.3) at age 13. Time spent in active transportation was lower in the winter by comparison to the other seasons. The most common active transportation destinations were the participant’s home, their school, and other people’s homes. Those living in neighbourhoods in the highest walkability quartile spent an average of 16.2 minutes/day (95% CI: 14.9, 17.5) in active transportation while those in the lowest quartile spent an average of 6.3 minutes/day (95% CI: 5.7, 6.8) in active transportation.&#xD;
Conclusion:&#xD;
Boys engaged in more active transportation than girls, active transportation increased with age and winter was the season with the least active transportation. Home, school and other people’s homes were the destinations with the most active transportation minutes. Those living in the most walkable neighbourhoods accumulated nearly three times more active transportation than those living in the least walkable neighbourhoods.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising and its impact (e.g. climate change) is established among the scientific community. Fuel switching in commercial sectors (e.g. cement plants) is one method to reduce fossil CO2 emissions. Microalgae cultivation provides an opportunity to reduce CO2 via photosynthesis and to produce biomass crop for fuel-switching. Industrial scale production of environmentally sound fuel using microalgae systems is still a challenge due to the small cell size and the low concentration in the growth culture.  This study investigates a dewatering approach consisting of electrocoagulation, gravity sedimentation, sand filtration, briquetting and passive drying to harvest the algal bio-solids and to produce a multi-purpose feedstock for use in cement plants. &#xD;
The microalgae suspension in solution is first destabilized via electrocoagulation by means of charge neutralization and micro-bubble flotation. The highest destabilization achieved at 15 Amp/m2 using aluminum and iron anodes, with 60 min of operational time, were 90% and 48% respectively. The variation of solution pH and stirring speed had no noticeable effects on the overall performance. Further densification of algal bio-solids took place in a sedimentation vessel in which 92% of the process water was removed, allowing for recycling, and the water content was concomitantly reduced from 99.88% to 99.24%.  The algal bio-solids obtained after a combined treatment of electrocoagulation and sedimentation were characterized using ICP-OES, TGA, and bomb calorimeter. The metal hydroxides (i.e. aluminum and iron) contribute in the reduction of raw materials used in cement making. Limestone micro-aggregates were employed as filter medium to reduce the water content of pre-concentrated algal solution from 99.24% to 93.45%, removing 84% of the entrained water.  Multi-purpose briquettes were prepared from algal cake, containing metal hydroxides, and a portion of the filter bed, where the water content further reduced to 65% due to the limestone blending. The water content of the briquettes was reduced to less than 15% within few days under ambient condition (i.e. passive drying).  Full substitution of calciner fuel leads to 4% of CO2 reduction compared to coal, and enhances biogenic carbon dioxide (bCO2) generation which accounts for 18% of the total CO2 emissions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are increasingly being used for&#xD;
the treatment of child and adolescent mental health problems causing concern as there is limited&#xD;
evidence of their safety in this population. SGAs are known to cause metabolic, cardiac and&#xD;
endocrine side effects which may have an amplified effect in youth in periods of growth and&#xD;
development. Metabolic monitoring guidelines from the Canadian Alliance for Monitoring&#xD;
Effectiveness and Safety of Antipsychotic Use in Children (CAMESA) exist to guide practice in&#xD;
the prevention and detection of metabolic instability in pediatric SGA users. However, reported&#xD;
rates of metabolic monitoring are inadequate. Evidence of rates and factors associated with&#xD;
metabolic monitoring of youth on SGAs in Canada is limited and the extent to which the&#xD;
CAMESA guidelines are adhered to is not known.&#xD;
Methods: A retrospective chart review analysis of 294 children and adolescents in an&#xD;
outpatient psychiatry setting was conducted to assess baseline and follow-up metabolic&#xD;
monitoring, demographic, treatment and healthcare utilization variables in a one-year period of&#xD;
interest within a two-year study period (2014-2016).&#xD;
Results: Metabolic monitoring did not adhere to CAMESA guidelines and was poor over&#xD;
a 1-year period. 23.5% (n=69) of participants had any monitoring documented at baseline and&#xD;
22.8% (n=67) had any follow-up monitoring. There were significant differences in between&#xD;
children (ages 4-12, n=99) and adolescents (ages 13-18, n=195). In adolescents, the factors&#xD;
associated with metabolic monitoring documented at baseline were a higher number of psychiatry&#xD;
visits (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.10-1.41), longer duration of contact (OR 14, 95% CI 2.31-82.4), and&#xD;
prescription of medications in addition to SGA (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.17-8.94) while in children,&#xD;
factors were having an emergency room visit (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.01-11.71) and taking&#xD;
aripiprazole as the type of SGA for treatment (OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.02-27.45).&#xD;
Conclusion: Findings from this study support existing literature of inadequate metabolic&#xD;
monitoring of children and adolescents on SGAs and calls for further investigation into factors&#xD;
associated with metabolic monitoring. Recommendations to improve metabolic monitoring in this&#xD;
context include multidisciplinary collaboration and enhancement of the nursing role as a&#xD;
pragmatic approach in improving care for this population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Problem solving in the Ontario mathematics curricula is described as central to learning mathematics. Scholars of mathematics education similarly stress the importance of problem solving, noting its potential to develop students’ academic ability in mathematics and prepare students to be effective lifelong learners. However, despite the value attributed to problem solving in the learning of mathematics, little is known about how pre-service teachers are thinking about problem solving. Given that beliefs are a fundamental domain of cognition, the first step in addressing this gap in the literature is to explore pre-service teachers’ beliefs about problem solving. Hence, the purpose of this mixed methods study was to explore Eastern Ontario pre-service intermediate-senior mathematics teachers’ beliefs about mathematics problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
Following a pragmatic mixed methods approach, quantitative questionnaire data were collected from a sample of 44 pre-service teachers in an Eastern Ontario teacher education program, and qualitative interview data were collected from a subsample of four pre-service teachers. Both types of data were collected at the beginning and end of the Fall 2016 academic term. Analysis followed a convergent parallel design, where quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately then merged to enable the identification of key features being converged upon by the two data sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
Analysis of the qualitative interview data identified and described the pre-service teachers’ ontological and epistemological beliefs about mathematics problem solving (i.e., beliefs about what mathematics problem solving is and how mathematics problem-solving knowledge is acquired, respectively). Additionally, analysis of the quantitative questionnaire data identified statistically significant differences in the pre-teachers’ beliefs about problem solving with respect to experience in the teacher education program and teacher-related variables. Finally, by comparing and integrating the questionnaire and interview findings, it was possible to characterize the prominent features of problem solving the pre-service teachers emphasized when communicating their thoughts about problem solving. The implications for mathematics educators focus on opportunities for recognizing the complex conceptualization of problem solving espoused by pre-service intermediate-senior mathematics teachers. Recommendations for future research highlight the need to expand the scope of this initial investigation and to investigate pre-service teachers’ knowledge of problem solving.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr), which is critical for cardiac repolarization. A reduction in hERG current can cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), leading to potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is increased beyond what is explicable by traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The molecular mechanisms governing CKD-induced cardiac arrhythmias are unknown, but a significant portion of CKD patients have prolonged QT intervals. In CKD, a large number of compounds, which would normally be excreted by the kidneys, are progressively accumulated. These compounds are known as uremic toxins and have been shown to negatively affect a variety of biological functions. Serum concentrations of the uremic toxin p-Cresol (pC) increase exponentially in CKD patients. Increased pC has been correlated with QT interval prolongation in patients, but no causative link has been established. Impairment of hERG function is a common cause of LQTS, so we investigated the effects of pC on hERG protein expression and current. We found that pC chronically reduces both hERG current and protein expression at the plasma membrane. Our findings suggest that pC acts through a Nedd4-2 dependent mechanism to decrease hERG. Our results from stable hERG-HEK cells are corroborated with data collected from cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. We also demonstrate in an in vivo rabbit model that pC injection results in a prolongation of the QT interval. The results presented in this study suggest that pC may play a role in CKD-related LQTS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The abnormal expression of cell surface sialic acid has recently been identified as an important trait of cancer cells. The main sialylation-modifying enzyme in mammalian cells, neuraminidase-1 (Neu1), has been shown to positively regulate several receptors and their activation, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin receptor (IR), and a number of TOLL-like receptors (TLR). Notably, these receptors each play unique and profound roles in tumor development and progression via promotion of cell proliferation and survival pathways, cell growth and metabolism, and immune-mediated tumorigenesis, respectively. Here, we further characterize the role of Neu1 in cancer cell signaling, as well as tumor growth, neovascularization and metastasis. Furthermore, the molecular targeting of Neu1 using competitive inhibitor and sialic acid analog oseltamivir phosphate (OP) has been evaluated for its therapeutic role in suppressing tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
This report uncovers the molecular mechanisms that regulate the role of Neu1 sialidase in insulin receptor activation. Specifically, we show that GPCR agonists bombesin, bradykinin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II can stimulate Neu1 sialidase activity to induce IR activation (phosphorylation) in the absence of insulin. Furthermore, this effect can be blocked by GPCR inhibitor BIM-23127 as well as OP.&#xD;
&#xD;
The studies in this report also investigated the effect of OP in murine models of human triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), ovarian endometrial cancer (A2780), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PANC1) tumor xenografts growing in RAGxCγ mice. In comparison to untreated groups, OP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume, metastatic spread to the mouse liver and lungs, as well as a reduction in tumor-associated neovascularization and recruitment of host endothelial cells. In conclusion, these findings provide insight into the novel targeting of tumor-promoting pathways via Neu1 sialidase and implicate OP as a novel agent in cancer therapy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Test anxiety and foreign language anxiety can affect test takers’ performance on a high-stakes foreign language proficiency test, such as the Test of English for International Communication in Listening and Reading comprehension (TOEIC LR). As&#xD;
the TOEIC LR is most widely used in South Korea (henceforth, Korea), that country presents a meaningful research context to examine this test. However, despite the TOEIC LR’s widespread use, no previous studies have directly examined the relationships between test takers’ anxiety and their performance on this test. Therefore, the present study investigated the extent to which test anxiety and foreign language anxiety influenced Korean test takers’ performance on the TOEIC LR.&#xD;
          Data were collected from 226 Korean test takers who were university students or graduates in need of TOEIC scores for high-stakes decisions, including graduation and/or employment. Participants completed a questionnaire asking for demographic information and levels of cognitive test anxiety, foreign language reading anxiety, and foreign language listening anxiety. Additionally, they provided their TOEIC scores. Correlational analyses, MANOVA, and multiple regression analyses were conducted to answer the proposed research questions.&#xD;
          The two foreign language anxieties formed greater correlations with each other than either did with cognitive test anxiety, suggesting conceptual overlap between the domains of these foreign language anxieties. In terms of predicting language test scores, foreign language anxieties specific to language skills were more effective than cognitive test anxiety. The influence of cognitive test anxiety on TOEIC scores was insignificant when foreign language anxieties were included in the regression model.&#xD;
          This study contributes to a finer understanding of the relationship between test anxiety and foreign language anxiety in the Korean context by including all three of the anxiety constructs into a single investigation. Furthermore, this study sheds light on the extent to which Korean test takers’ test anxiety and foreign language anxiety affect their performance on a high-stakes English proficiency test. Based on these findings, future research should discuss whether or not test takers’ anxiety should be included in test validation and investigate the extent to which test takers’ anxiety threatens validity of test score interpretations as possible sources of construct-irrelevant variance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Despite the focus on assessment for learning (AfL) across Canada, the use of AfL across classrooms is not routine practice. Existing literature has found that secondary mathematics teachers implement AfL strategies along a continuum, from no implementation to deep integration in the classroom. AfL is valuable for all students, and in particular, struggling students may be the strongest beneficiaries of AfL. As a result, my dissertation explored secondary mathematics teachers’ use of AfL strategies with students who may struggle in mathematics, and the extent that there exist systematic differences in the integration of these strategies across classrooms of varying school-achievement results. Three research questions guided this study: (a) What is the nature of teachers’ AfL strategies? (b) What are the relationships between teachers’ AfL strategies and AfL conceptions? and (c) What are the relationships between teachers’ AfL strategies and mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT)? &#xD;
Across Southern Ontario, a teacher questionnaire was administered (N = 131) and case studies (N = 4) were conducted with teachers of Grade 9 applied mathematics (G9APM). The schools in which these teachers taught were categorized as one of three achievement categories—high, average, or low—based on their school-achievement results. School-achievement results were either determined by a school’s average Education Quality and Accountability Office result for students in G9APM or a self-reported measure. Data analyses included the use of descriptive and inferential statistics, correlational-based analyses, and deductive and inductive qualitative thematic analyses. &#xD;
Research findings illustrate: (a) no differences in teachers' AfL strategies, AfL conceptions, or MKT, across school-achievement results; (b) teachers commonly implemented the letter of AfL and had a teacher-centric conception of AfL; and (c) AfL strategies are connected to MKT. Specifically, MKT supported AfL practices, namely identifying and sharing success criteria, engineering effective classroom discussions and tasks that elicit evidence of learning, and providing feedback that moves learners forward. Findings highlighted that teachers require domain specific pedagogical support in implementing the spirit of AfL.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis focuses upon some evolutionary problems related to sexual reproduction and disease. We first consider whether we should expect a fundamental difference between the outcomes of pre- and post-copulatory sexual conflict, and whether an informational asymmetry exists between the sexes. We then examine how sexually-transmitted infections can create selective pressures upon the evolution of mating systems, with a particular focus upon serial monogamy. We also consider more generally how pathogens can shape intraspecific interactions (by host avoidance), and how in turn host avoidance can alter the selective environment for pathogens. Finally, we examine how epidemiology and finite population size can interact to alter the evolution of sterility virulence, providing a novel explanation for why sterility virulence is more commonly associated with sexually-transmitted infections.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is a bi-directional relationship between sleep characteristics (time in bed, sleep duration, sleep efficiency) and outdoor active play (OAP) within children. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Participants consisted of 433 children aged 10-13 years. Time in bed, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency were measured for 8 consecutive nights using data from a sleep log and Actical accelerometer. OAP was measured for the 7 days that fell in between these 8 nights using a combination of data from accelerometers, global positioning system (GPS) loggers, and geographic information system (GIS). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with first-order autoregressive matrix [AR(1)] were used to assess the relationships of interest. These models accounted for the repeated measures nested within participants and adjusted for several confounders. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Time in bed, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency were not significantly associated with the following day’s OAP. There was a small but significant (p = 0.017) association between OAP and the following night’s time in bed, which suggested that each hour increase in OAP was associated with a 5.1 minute (95% CI: 0.9 - 9.4) increase in time in bed. OAP was not significantly associated with sleep duration or sleep efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: None of the sleep characteristics predicted the following day’s OAP. Higher levels of OAP predicted a longer time in bed, but not sleep duration or sleep efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reproduction is an energetically demanding life history stage that comprises costly physiological and behavioural changes. Despite these costs, some individuals invest more in reproduction, and breed more successfully than others. To understand variation in reproductive investment, studies often evaluate factors during breeding, but conditions outside of the breeding season may also play a role. These linkages across life history stages remain poorly understood, particularly at the mechanistic level. Using wild populations of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), we evaluated whether traits relating to energetic condition (i.e., circulating corticosterone concentrations, oxidative balance, haemolytic complement activity, and body condition) during the non-breeding season predicted reproductive investment in the subsequent breeding season. Winter haemolytic complement activity did not predict subsequent breeding investment. However, we found that females with high winter fat scores laid eggs sooner and fed their offspring more often, and females with high winter corticosterone concentrations produced lighter eggs. We also found that males with high winter oxidative stress had smaller clutches, that males with high winter fat fed their offspring more often and had nestlings with lower baseline corticosterone, and that males with high winter corticosterone concentrations had lighter eggs and smaller nestlings in the brood produced by their mate. These winter energetic traits may relate to reproductive investment via carry-over effects across seasons, and/or because they reflect an individual’s phenotypic quality. Altogether, our findings suggest that in wild populations, conditions experienced outside of the breeding season may be important factors explaining variation in reproductive investment, even in a resident species. These linkages between life history stages could have important implications for the study of population dynamics, particularly in declining populations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For a remarkable period between the late 1950s and mid-1970s, a global politics of poverty emerged.  Prompted by anti-imperialist struggles, working class demands, social and cultural ferment, and socialist alternatives, the politics turned on how to alleviate global poverty – and to what ends.  It had different manifestations, but contained shared core insights and practices.  It did not simply animate the international sphere, but permeated national, regional, and local politics as well.  In this context, some Canadian liberals believed that development would contribute to the elimination of poverty, internationally and domestically, by involving people more fully in the values, economic processes, and political practices of liberal capitalist democracy.  Community development, regional development, and international development emerged as concurrent, if contested, schemes to revitalize liberal democracy within and beyond Canada’s borders.&#xD;
	This study is a political history of the relationship between poverty, democracy, and development in Canada in the 1960s and 1970s within a larger global frame.  Through a focus on development programs across three scales, I trace the on-the-ground activism of reformers and radicals in dialogue with the global context in which they consciously rooted their work.  The focus of the local scale is the community development and animation sociale activities of Company of Young Canadians (CYC) in Lesser Slave Lake, Alberta and St-Henri, Montreal.  On a regional scale, I examine the efforts of Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO) to address regional inequality and poverty.  Adopting an international scale allows us to focus on the Third World international development activity of Canadian University Service Overseas (CUSO) – namely, its project in Tanzania.  I argue that liberal reformers, amid exchanges with a New Left, created and committed to development programs they believed would empower people, both in Canada and abroad, to confront their own poverty and foster a meaningful democracy rooted in everyday life.  However, development programs – having stopped short of amending capitalist social relations and the political and economic hierarchies they engendered – realized neither their anti-poverty nor democratic goals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis introduces a model for epidemics on networks based on the classical Polya process. Temporal contagion processes are generated on the network nodes using a modified Polya sampling scheme that accounts for spatial infection among neigh- bouring nodes. The stochastic properties and asymptotic behaviour of the resulting network Polya contagion process are analyzed. Given the complicated nature of this process, three classical Polya processes, one computational and two analytical, are proposed to statistically approximate the contagion process of each node, demon- strating a good fit for a range of system parameters. An optimal control problem is formulated for minimizing the average infection using a limited curing budget, and a number of different curing strategies are presented, including a proven conver- gent gradient descent algorithm. The feasibility of the problem is proven under high curing budgets by deriving conservative lower bounds that turn some processes into supermartingales. Extensive simulations run on large-scale networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis contributes to our understanding of variations in labor productivity over the business cycle, and the long run decline in labor income share. Chapter 2 develops and analyzes a general equilibrium model with goods’ market frictions, heterogeneous ﬁrms, and consumer sentiments. I use the model to demonstrate that the interactions among these features of the model leads to new and interesting results. Firstly, average product of labor can be positively or negatively related to expected real income. Secondly, under certain conditions, lower priced ﬁrms not only sell to a larger market, but also have higher markups. Lastly, ﬁrm level pass through of ﬁrms’ idiosyncratic shocks and sentiment shocks, their elasticities of output and employment with respect to sentiment shocks can be complex. Chapter 3 constructs a stochastic general equilibrium model in which business cycles are driven by changes in sentiments to explain the Labor Productivity Puzzle. In recessions, increased search by consumers - an endogenous rise in the average number of prices observed by consumers - causes expenditures to be reallocated to the more productive ﬁrms. This eﬀect causes employment to fall relative to output and increases APL. At the same time, less productive ﬁrms can also be insulated from a fall in demand by lower marginal labor costs during the recessions. This eﬀect causes employment to rise relative to output and decreases APL. In calibrated versions of the model, I ﬁnd that the former eﬀect dominates over time and the theory is able to explain over three quarters of the decline in the fall in the volatility of APL and a sizable decline in the volatility of employment. Chapter 4 studies the causes of labor share decline in the retail sector. I provide microeconomic evidence that lower price retailers not only enjoy higher revenue productivities and market shares, but they also have lower labor share. Extending the framework in Chapter 2 to allow for capital accumulation, I show that the decline in labor income share can be caused by reallocation of market shares to high productivity ﬁrms as a result of technological adoptions that increase consumer search.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Current inclusive approaches to education create challenges for teachers, who must meet the educational needs of diverse students.  Occupational therapists (OTs) assist some of these students through the provision of school-based occupational therapy (SBOT).  Although competency frameworks exist for interprofessional collaboration (e.g., the National Interprofessional Competency Framework [Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative, 2010]), these frameworks conceptualize collaboration as existing across professions within the health care sector.  Despite the need for OTs and teachers to work together, there is no competency framework in the collaboration literature to guide the intersectoral collaboration that occurs between these two professions.  &#xD;
The objective of this study was to develop a competency framework for collaboration between OTs and teachers.  A scoping review (Arksey &amp; O’Malley, 2005) of the literature on tensions in collaboration between OTs and teachers was conducted.  A total of 46 unique tensions were charted across 30 articles.  This was followed by interviews of OTs (n=5), teachers (n=5), and parents (n=3) with SBOT experience.  An inductive analysis of the data was performed to yield 68 themes across 15 superthemes.  Methodological triangulation of the data was preformed to create a conceptual framework of collaboration between these two professions.  Lastly, based on data from the scoping review and interviews, competency modelling techniques (Marrelli, Tondora, &amp; Hoge, 2005) were used to create a competency framework.  A total of 28 competencies were developed across the attitudes, skills, knowledge, behaviours, and beliefs required for collaboration.&#xD;
The competency framework developed in this study rectifies a shortcoming in the literature on collaboration.  This competency framework can inform learning opportunities for OTs and teachers and potentially improve collaboration between these two professions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The promising energy saving and quality of service (QoS) gains of Predictive Resource Allocation (PRA) for video streaming have recently been recognized in the wireless network research community. The PRA relies on future channel conditions to strategically deliver the video content of the mobile users. For instance, the whole video is pushed to the users moving towards the cell edge while prebuffering is postponed for others heading to the cell center in order to minimize the transmission energy. The focus of this thesis is to present a Robust Predictive Resource Allocation (R-PRA) framework to tackle practical uncertainties in the predicted information. In essence, the R-PRA adopts stochastic optimization techniques such as chance-constrained and recourse programming to model the uncertainties in the problem constraints and objectives. Although deterministic convex approximations are feasible, guided heuristic algorithms are introduced to provide real-time allocation. Moreover, Bayesian filtering methods (e.g. Kalman Filter) are adopted to continuously learn the degree of uncertainty which decreases the cost of robustness and maintains the prediction gains. Different variants for the robust framework are proposed such as energy-minimization and predictive adaptive streaming under erroneous prediction of channel rate, user demand and network resources. The variants unleash various design challenges for the network operators such as the trade-off between the complexity of uncertainty modelling and the prediction gains. All the variants are evaluated using a standard compliant simulation environment that comprises a network simulator 3 (ns-3) integrated with commercial solvers to obtain benchmark solutions. The results demonstrated the ability of R-PRA to meet the QoS level while maintaining the prediction gains over the opportunistic schemes employed in current networks. We believe that this framework set the groundwork for future robust predictive content delivery in which time horizon decisions are taken under practical uncertainties.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We consider the descriptional complexity of neighbourhoods of regular languages and the computational complexity of computing the distance between languages. Distance measures are defined on words to describe their similarity. These measures can be extended to languages, which are sets of words. We consider several different notions of distance measures on languages. &#xD;
&#xD;
The neighbourhood of a language L is the set of words within some fixed distance of a word in L. We show that we can construct weighted finite automata for neighbourhoods of regular languages with respect to additive quasi-distances. We consider the state complexity of the neighbourhoods and the state complexity of approximate pattern matching. We establish a tight state complexity lower bound for the edit distance neighbourhood of a language recognized by a deterministic finite automaton. &#xD;
&#xD;
We consider the deterministic and nondeterministic state complexity of prefix, suffix, and subword distance neighbourhoods. We establish tight deterministic state complexity bounds for the prefix and suffix distance neighbourhoods of regular languages and of finite languages. For prefix distance neighbourhoods, we consider prefix-convex subclasses of regular languages. We also establish the state complexity of suffix neighbourhoods of suffix-closed languages. We give an upper bound for the state complexity of the subword distance neighbourhood of a regular language.&#xD;
&#xD;
Based on the edit distance algorithms of Mohri and Han and co-authors, we give algorithms for computing the prefix distance between two regular languages, a context-free language and a regular language, and two visibly pushdown languages. We extend these algorithms to compute the inner prefix distance of regular languages and visibly pushdown languages. &#xD;
&#xD;
We give algorithms to compute the relative prefix distance of two regular languages. For a given integer k, we show that for a deterministic context-free language and a regular language or for two visibly pushdown languages, it is decidable whether their relative prefix distance is at most k. This is very close to the borderline between decidable and undecidable since, on the other hand, we show that deciding the same question for a deterministic context-free language and a visibly pushdown language is undecidable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Anonymous social media platforms, like Yik Yak, have been at the center of public controversies surrounding the proliferation of trolling, bullying, and gendered and racialized violence. This has led to a renewed scholarly attention to forms of anonymity and pseudonymity deployed in cyber-spaces that allow users to post content without attachment to their identity. This project has employed the use of qualitative and ethnographic methods to develop a case-study to explore two layers of empirical analysis: (1) as an empirical extension of post-structuralist theory, this project demonstrates how social actors engage in (un)disciplined performativity that allow users to share user-generated content as identity performance separated from their overall reputation and (2) explore how (un)disciplined users are regulated through various forms of vernacular and institutional governmentalities. In combining these two layers, I seek to understand how anonymity is performed, how anonymous regimes stabilize, re-stabilize, and through controversy, destabilize, and theorize how this constellation of performative acts and regulatory features are embedded within a larger political economy of Yik Yak. Performative anonymity exists within a sprawling set of collectives defined by unwritten and (un)disciplined norms, values, and creative content which are all captured in a wider surveillant assemblage. The results of this case-study reveal that though anonymity and pseudonymity inevitably feature a proliferation of trolling and e-bile, it also hosts users who may engage in forms of entertainment, caretaking, and/or a flight from social stigmatization. This project positions itself to oppose the imposition of a “real name” web advocated by Facebook and Google, and to maintain more efficiently moderated anonymous spaces for those who need to escape exposure to the constant gaze of friends, family, and strangers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a behaviour, defined as any bodily movement that increases energy expenditure above resting levels, while cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a physiologic trait that reflects the ability of the respiratory, circulatory, and musculoskeletal systems to deliver and utilize oxygen. Although both CRF and PA are inversely associated with mortality risk, whether they are associated independent of each other is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
METHODS: CRF was assessed by a maximal exercise test and PA was measured by self-report in 8171 male veterans. The predictive power of CRF and PA, along with clinical variables, was assessed for all-cause mortality during a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 8.7 (4.4) years during which there were 1349 deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
RESULTS: CRF was associated with mortality after adjusting for traditional risk factors commonly measured in clinical practice, and remained a strong predictor of mortality after further adjusting for PA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 –0.87). PA was a significant predictor of mortality after controlling for clinical variables, however the association was eliminated after further adjusting for CRF (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88 – 1.10). In CRF stratified analysis, being active (≥150 min/week) was not associated with mortality within the unfit or fit categories (p&gt;0.4). However, in PA stratified analysis, subjects categorized as fit (≥7 METS) had a lower risk of mortality regardless of PA status (p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
CONCLUSION: In adult men, PA was associated with mortality above and beyond established risk factors, but not CRF. Conversely, CRF remained a strong predictor of mortality, independent of PA status and established risk factors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Green Roofs appear as an innovative solution for city-wide environmental issues and concerns in the City of Toronto. Recognizing benefits of green roofs based on empirical researches, the City established its green roof policy. As part of the policy, the Toronto Green Roof Bylaw is the first mandatory bylaw for green roof installation in North America. In addition, the Eco-Roof Incentive Program was launched as a direct financial incentive being integrated into the policy. &#xD;
	Despite the seven years of policy implementation, there is a lack of understanding around the influence and effectiveness of the policy. Relatively few policy reviews and evaluation reports, including the 2016 Eco-Roof Incentive Program Review Report by Lura Consulting &amp; Cardinal Group Inc. (2016), are publicly available, however, there is a need for further investigation of the policy implementation.&#xD;
	Therefore, the study’s key objective is to identify strengths and weaknesses of the policy as well as provide a deeper insight into how the policy promotes green roof implementation. The following research questions below were designed to achieve the objectives of the study:&#xD;
♣	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the City’s green roof policy? and&#xD;
♣	How can the policy encourage more developers and property owners to install green roofs on their buildings?&#xD;
	A combined qualitative research method approach was used in response to these questions. One of the two methods used was a policy analysis by conducting the review of policy documents, staff reports, and other academic and industry documents pertaining to the Toronto green roof policy. Additionally, domestic and international cities were used as cases to allow for comparative analysis of different policy tools for green roofs. The other method was face-to-face interviews with eight key informants. The interviews strongly influenced and guided the study by allowing in-depth perspectives of the key informants on realistic impacts of the policy. &#xD;
	On the basis of the overall findings and results, the study concludes with a series of recommendations for policy improvement as follows:&#xD;
1.	Perform inspection and research in partnership with green roof experts and institutions; &#xD;
2.	Enforce certain maintenance practices for long-term performance of green roofs;&#xD;
3.	Consider the provision of various incentives; and&#xD;
4.	Improve public awareness through better education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Comparative work in the divinatory traditions of the Near East and the classical world, aside from the sub-discipline of astrology, has not been forthcoming. John Jacobs’s 2011 article, “Traces of the Omen Series Šumma Izbu in Cicero’s De divinatione,” is a notable exception. In this work, Jacobs compared Mesopotamian birth omens with those found in Graeco-Roman literature, and discovered a concordance in the category of lion births. This concordance, however, is not exclusive to omens concerning the birth of lions. Snake omens drawn from the Šumma Izbu, the Mesopotamian omen corpus of birth omens, focus on two portents: the rise of a powerful leader and a negative change in social status. When snake omens in Roman literature are examined alongside these Mesopotamian omens, it is evident that the apodoses of the Roman omens likewise portend either or both of these events. The secondary focus of this work is to provide a history of snake omens in Roman sources, and to that end, this work draws on virtually all snake omens in classical Roman literature, although some late sources may have escaped notice. Ultimately, this analysis of the Roman snake omens provides evidence that several ideas about snake omens—that they predict eminent people and social discord—migrated from Near Eastern omen literature and surfaced in Roman literature. While this investigation does not theorize the means of this transmission, it reaffirms the complex relationship Mesopotamian omen lore has with the classical world.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the spirit of Artin, Brauer, and Heilbronn, we implement representation theory together with the Artin formalism to study L-functions in this thesis. One of the major themes is motivated by the work of Heilbronn and many others on classical Heilbronn characters. We define the arithmetic Heilbronn characters and apply them to study L-functions. In particular, we prove a theorem concerning the analytic ranks of elliptic curves as predicted by the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. In a different vein, we employ the theory of supercharacters introduced by Diaconis and Isaacs to derive a supercharacter-theoretic analogue of Heilbronn characters. Moreover, we generalise the effective Chebotarev density theorem due to M. R. Murty, V. K. Murty, and Saradha in the context of supercharacter theory. Lastly, we study the conjectures of Artin and Langlands via group theory and extend the previous work of Arthur and Clozel. For instance, we introduce the notion of near supersolvability and near nilpotency, and show that Artin's conjecture holds if $\Gal(K/k)$ is nearly supersolvable. As a consequence, the Artin conjecture is true for any solvable Frobenius Galois extension. Also, we derive the automorphy for every nearly nilpotent group. Furthermore, the Langlands reciprocity conjecture has been established for Galois extensions of number fields of either square-free degree or odd cube-free degree as well as all non-$A_5$ extensions of degree at most 100.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I conducted three studies to investigate the impact of causal uncertainty on people's reactions to social rejection using three different social rejection research paradigms. In Study 1, I used the future-life paradigm, where participants completed a personality test and then were provided with feedback that in the future either they likely will end up with few, if any, meaningful social relationships (exclusion), or they will have many such relationships (inclusion).  In Study 2, I used the autobiographical recall paradigm where participants recalled a time when either they were socially excluded or included. In Study 3, I used a group task wherein participants ostensibly exchange information about themselves with other people in their experimental session but later learn that none of the other participants wanted to work with them (exclusion) or that all of them did (inclusion). In each study, the dependent variables were basic need fulfillment and negative affect. Across all three studies, higher levels of causal uncertainty were associated with lower levels of both need fulfilment and mood, but the predicted interaction between causal uncertainty and the rejection manipulation was not significant.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The eastern section of the Flinton Group, from Cloyne to Clyde Forks, is a long, narrow NE-SW trending belt of metasedimentary rocks belonging to the Mazinaw Terrane of the Grenville Province. Metamorphic grade increases southwest to northeast across the Flinton Group from greenschist to amphibolite facies, with metamorphic isograds perpendicular to the strike of bedding. Rocks from various members within the Flinton Group contain abundant biotite and muscovite and very little evidence of alteration.&#xD;
Detailed petrography, electron-microprobe analysis, and 40Ar/39Ar dating of biotite and muscovite were used to investigate the thermal history of the Flinton Group.  40Ar/39Ar ages were obtained on eleven muscovite/biotite pairs and two muscovites from pelitic schists, and on a muscovite/biotite pair from a pegmatite. Biotite ages show a broad variation across the Flinton Group. Biotite ages in the western half of the study area range from 979 ± 6 Ma to 939 ± 6 Ma with an average pooled age of ~953 Ma, while the ages from the eastern half are much younger, from 908 ± 7 Ma to 885 ± 6 Ma with an average pooled age of ~900 Ma – reflecting a ~50 Ma age difference. Muscovite ages across the Flinton Group are uniform (with one exception) and range from 909 ± 8 Ma to 880 ± 7 Ma (±2σ) with an average pooled age of ~899Ma. &#xD;
The observed age jump appears to coincide with increasing metamorphic grade and a change in quartz microtextures from grain boundary area reduction in the west to grain boundary migration in the east, suggesting that the eastern Mazinaw Terrane was buried deeper than the west due to tilting of the Mazinaw Terrane and movement along the Robertson Lake Shear Zone.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis we study the global fluctuations of random matrices (i.e., the covariance of two traces) from a second-order free probability perspective, putting a particular emphasis on block Gaussian matrices. Our main contributions are threefold.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, we provide a formula for the second-order Cauchy transform of block Gaussian matrices in terms of the corresponding (matrix-valued) Cauchy transform. In order to do this, we introduce a (matrix-valued) second-order conditional expectation, in the spirit of the conditional expectations in operator-valued free probability theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, we establish a criterion, based on the positivity of a cluster function, that guarantees the existence of a particular integral representation for the second-order Cauchy transform. This approach is based on some relations between the moments and fluctuation moments of a measure on the plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we prove that under some conditions the covariance of resolvents converges to the second-order Cauchy transform. In fact, these conditions also ensure the convergence of the covariance of analytic linear statistics to a certain contour integral depending on the second-order Cauchy transform. In this context, we make explicit the relation between the notion of second-order limit distribution and the asymptotic Gaussianity of continuously differentiable linear statistics.</dcterms:abstract>

We study average controllability properties of a random heat equation when the diffusivity is a random variable.

      <dcterms:abstract>In this study, a bio-derived monomer, -methyl--methylene--butyrolactone (MeMBL) was saponified with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to make the water-soluble monomer sodium 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-methylene butanoate (SHMeMB), that was copolymerized via radical polymerization in aqueous solution with acrylamide (AM) and crosslinker to synthesize superabsorbent hydrogels. Absorbency of these hydrogels was shown to be much higher than sodium acrylate hydrogels, with mechanical properties varying with molar composition and crosslinking content. Reactivity ratio of SHMeMB:AM at 50C and 15 wt% were estimated using low conversion data (rSHMeMB=0.12 and rAM=1.10), and the integrated Mayo-Lewis equation (rSHMeMB=0.17 and rAM=0.95). However, in-situ NMR results showed that SHMeMB:AM copolymerizations proceed at a slower rate than of a similar system of AM copolymerized with sodium 4-hydroxy-2-methylene butanoate (SHMB), a similar monomer produced by ring-opening of -methylene--butyrolactone (MBL). Pulsed-laser polymerization coupled with size exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC) studies were done for both systems at 60°C and 10 wt% monomer concentration. Homopolymerization kp values were estimated to be 25 and 165 L/mols for SHMeMB and SHMB, respectively, confirming that SHMeMB is less reactive than SHMB. &#xD;
Further kinetic studies of SHMeMB:AM copolymerization and homopolymerization of SHMeMB were conducted at elevated temperatures. SHMeMB conversions achieved a limiting value which decreased at higher temperatures, suggesting that polymerization rate was limited by depropagation. Comonomer composition drift also increased with temperature, with more AM incorporated into the polymer while SHMeMB underwent depropagation. Homopolymerization of SHMeMB with added sodium chloride (NaCl) showed a decrease in polymerization rate explained by an increase in propagation rate coefficient (kp) but an even greater increase in termination rate coefficient (kt) as supported by parameter estimation done using PREDICI. Even with added salt, however, depropagation was the dominant mechanism at higher temperatures. Lastly, the kinetic parameters estimated were implemented in a copolymerization model used to estimate the variation of kt with composition in SHMeMB:AM copolymerizations. It was found that the overall termination rate coefficient was dominated by the presence of SHMeMB, with as the estimate for kt,SHMeMB of the same order of magnitude as kt of another ionized water-soluble monomer, sodium methacrylic acid.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Network protocol parsers constantly dissect a large number of network data to place into internal data structures for further processing by traffic analysis systems. Many network protocol parsers are hand-written for performance reasons, and lack the security required to run on mission-critical networks. We propose an approach that automatically generates custom protocol parsers to process network traffic to be used as part of an Intrusion Detection System. The user is provided a specification language in which they can define the protocols they need to analyse. This thesis looks at command and control/industrial control networks that are characterized by a limited number of known protocols. We present a robust, secure, and high-performing solution that deals with the issues that have only partially been addressed in this domain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies the null controllability of a system of coupled parabolic PDEs. Moreover, our work specializes to an important subclass of these control problems, where systems are underactuated and are coupled by first and zero-order couplings. We pose our control problem in a fairly new framework which divides the problem into interconnected parts: we refer to the first part as the analytic control problem, where we use slightly non-classical techniques to prove null controllability by means of internal controls appearing on every equation; we refer to the second part as the algebraic control problem, where we use an algebraic method to invert a linear partial differential operator that describes our system, which allows us to recover null controllability by means of internal controls which appear on only a few of the equations. By solving these control problems concurrently, we resolve the original problem (after some technical verifications on the regularity of the controls in the analytic system).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, we study the problem of achieving average consensus over a random time-varying sequence of directed graphs by extending the class of so-called push- sum algorithms to such random scenarios. Provided that an ergodicity notion, which we term the directed infinite flow property, holds and the auxiliary states of nodes are uniformly bounded away from zero infinitely often, we prove the almost sure convergence of the evolutions of this class of algorithms to the average of initial states. Moreover, for a random sequence of graphs generated using a time-varying B-irreducible sequence of probability matrices, we establish convergence rates for the proposed push-sum algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The PICO-2L program commenced in 2013 with the deployment of a 2 litre bubble chamber filled with superheated C3F8 and over the next three years, conducted two separate WIMP-search experiments. The first run was conducted at 4 different energy thresholds ranging from 3.2 keV to 8.1 keV and a total of 12 candidate events were observed during a total exposure of 211.5 kg-days. Due to the non-uniform time distribution of the candidate events, no evidence for a WIMP-signal was claimed and upper limits on WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-sections were reported. These results represented the world leading limits at the time on spin-dependant WIMP- proton cross-sections with a 90% confidence upper limit of σ &lt; 9.7 × 10^−40 cm^2 for a 30 GeV/c^2 WIMP. PICO-2L was redeployed in 2015 with modifications that aimed to control particulate contamination in the superheated fluid, and a follow- up WIMP-search experiment was conducted. During 129 kg-day exposure with the detector operating at an energy threshold of 3.3 keV, only 1 candidate event was observed, consistent with the predicted background rate from neutrons. These data showed that the measures taken to control the particulate contamination resulted in the eradication of the previously observed anomalous background events and provided the most stringent limits on WIMP-proton spin-dependent cross-sections with a 90% confidence upper limit of σ &lt; 5.9 × 10^−40 cm2 for a 30 GeV/c^2 WIMP.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada released 94 Calls to Action including ‘Business and Reconciliation’ (Recommendation #92, TRC, 2015). The recommendation focuses mainly on the role of non-Indigenous Canadians. I argue that reconciliation is a two-way process and the role of Indigenous peoples in reconciliation has been largely overlooked. Thus, this research aims to take an Indigenous perspective on reconciliation, including the role that social innovation and Indigenous entrepreneurship can play in reconciliation processes in Canada. &#xD;
&#xD;
This research employs a qualitative approach to data collection, including storytelling, narrative analysis and comparative methods. Concepts of reconciliation from an Indigenous entrepreneurial perspective, including personal definitions of reconciliation and social innovation, and how Indigenous businesses contribute to reconciliation processes are analysed. The results indicate that Indigenous entrepreneurs are actively contributing to reconciliation processes including playing a role in cultural awareness building through their goods and services. The research also indicates that the term ‘reconciliation’ takes on various meanings and is tied to life experiences, cultural relations, and community histories and dynamics. The results contribute an ‘Indigenous voice’ to current scholarship on reconciliation and might aid in the development of policy on Indigenous entrepreneurship, social innovation and economic development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hyperphosphatemia is a hallmark of progression in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has been linked to the development of vascular calcification (VC), which increases cardiovascular risk. Phosphate binders are prescribed to control hyperphosphatemia. Fermagate is a calcium-free, magnesium-releasing, phosphate binder. Oral delivery of magnesium has been shown to attenuate VC. The aim of this study was to determine whether fermagate treatment compared to no treatment could impact VC in male Sprague-Dawley rats using an experimental model of adenine-induced CKD. The effect of fermagate on two different high phosphate dietary regimens was performed: high phosphate (0.75%) diet at all meals or a combination of low (0.5%) and high (1%) phosphate meals, such that the total amount of phosphate delivered was the same. In both studies, administration of fermagate increased serum magnesium and attenuated the levels of circulating phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). Compared to untreated CKD rats, fermagate treatment significantly reduced the prevalence of VC across a range of vascular tissues (70% VC in treated vs. 24% VC in untreated), but did not alter the accrual of magnesium in the vasculature. Serum phosphate and the prevalence of VC were higher in untreated and fermagate-treated rats on the constant high (0.75%) diet compared to the combination diet (0.5/1%), suggesting the impact of phosphate is dependent on the delivery of phosphate, not only the amount of phosphate consumed. Overall, the findings demonstrate that fermagate effectively reduces the bioavailability of the dietary phosphate load, increases systemic levels of magnesium, and limits the development and progression of CKD and VC.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Shift work has emerged as a risk factor for many diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD). While the pathway by which shift work increases CVD risk is still not fully understood, it is hypothesized that disruption of cortisol during night work is an intermediate.&#xD;
Objective: To determine whether quantity of cortisol production, diurnal pattern, and cortisol variability mediate the relationship between current shift work status and cardiometabolic risk among female hospital employees.&#xD;
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 326 female employees (166 rotating shift workers and 160 day workers) at Kingston General Hospital in Ontario, Canada. Participants completed a baseline interview, questionnaire, and clinical exam, and provided urine samples over two 24-hour cycles (included one-night shift for the shift workers). Diurnal quantity of cortisol production (AUCG), cortisol pattern (AUCI), and the magnitude of variation for both AUCG and AUCI was determined across the two cycles using creatinine-adjusted urinary cortisol. Two measures of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) were used: metabolic syndrome (MetS) based on the 2009 Joint Interim Studies consensus statement, and a continuous CMR score created by Hillier and colleagues (2006).&#xD;
Results: Current shift workers are more likely to have MetS than dayworkers (21% vs. 12%, respectively, OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.25-4.64) and have a higher CMR score (β: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.12-0.78). Shift work is also associated with a lower average AUCG and a higher magnitude of variation in AUCI, but not with average AUCI or magnitude of variation in AUCG. Average AUCG is a partial mediator in the relationship between shift work and CMR, as measured with the CMR score. There is no evidence that AUCI or either magnitude of variation are intermediates between shift work and CMR. &#xD;
Conclusions: Current rotating shift workers have a lower quantity of cortisol production, a higher magnitude of variation in pattern, a higher CMR score, and a higher odds of MetS in comparison to day workers. Quantity of cortisol production is a partial mediator in the relationship between current shift work and CMR. Future studies warrant the consideration of other potential mediators in the causal pathway between shift work and CVD risk.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Self-study is recognized as an effective method for examining, understanding, and improving one’s teaching practices in teacher education. This research employed self-study as a continuous professional learning (CPL) approach to become a better clinical nursing instructor, to learn about the effectiveness of formative assessment for promoting more independent self-regulated learning in nursing students, and to build knowledge for scholarship in the profession of nursing. &#xD;
This research primarily employed a qualitative methodology in three connected studies conducted over three years in clinical nursing education. In each self-study a reflective journal was used for systematic documentation of instructor planning and decision-making, and student responses to the implementation of five formative assessment strategies. Iterative cycles of planning, implementing, and reflecting on instruction and students’ responses facilitated the collection of rich contextually bound data for analysis and interpretation. &#xD;
Study one examined self-study as an approach for a clinical instructor to translate and implement five specific formative assessment strategies, shown to promote student learning in education, in clinical nursing education. To continue learning about formative assessment and to explore others’ perspectives and experiences, study two employed surveys and interviews with clinical instructor colleagues and their nursing students. The third study, conducted in a new self-study context, examined student reflection assignments to examine the potential of a curriculum-required reflection on clinical practice for supporting independent self-regulated learning. &#xD;
This research presents the first known self-study of pedagogical practice in clinical nursing education. Results of this study suggest that self-study is an effective approach for CPL to advance competency in clinical instruction. Embedding formative assessment strategies in clinical nursing education was seen to influence and support both teaching and learning. Participation in learning activities that integrated multiple feedback loops (instructor, peer, self, other) was seen to provide students with more helpful evidence for regulating their learning. &#xD;
The results of this study suggest that instructors and curriculum developers must be explicit in communicating learning intentions and success criteria, and strategic in embedding formative assessment in the instruction and curriculum in support of students’ self-regulation of learning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this study was to develop a mechanistic understanding of remediation in clay lenses in sand by electrical resistance heating (ERH). Clay lenses are areas of accumulation for dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) and are difficult to remediate. Experiments were performed in a two-dimensional, saturated porous medium comprising of an electrically conductive, low permeability clay lens embedded within a less electrically conductive, higher permeability silica sand. This study is based on an experimental program and mathematical modeling of experimentally measured data. To study the lens exterior, experiments compared the differences in heating and gas production during ERH between pure sand geologies and one containing a clay lens. Preferential heating occurred in the lens interiors with higher rates of heating. Gas production occurred preferentially around the sand-clay interface. Gas production in the interior of clay lenses after ERH was quantified for lenses composed of kaolin and #20-30 silica sand (40%, 70% and 100% kaolin by mass). A measurement technique was developed to interpret electrical conductivity as gas saturation in the lens. Gas saturations after ERH increased with decreasing clay fraction, indicating that a connected gas phase capable of rapid mass removal can be produced in lenses containing moderate amounts of clay. While gas was produced in the pure clay lens, it is possible that a connected gas phase was not achieved at the applied power and treatment time considered. To assess mass transfer mechanisms in lenses, pure clay lenses containing dissolved-phase trichloroethene (TCE) were subjected to ERH to produce gas saturations that were either negligible, disconnected, or connected. Electrical and chemical concentration data were analyzed using diffusion models and indicated that TCE concentration reductions where no gas was produced were consistent with liquid phase diffusion. High gas saturations were likely connected and resulted in non-detect levels of TCE after heating. Concentration reductions at moderate gas saturations were consistent with multi-phase (gas and liquid) diffusive transport when the connected gas phase at the lens exterior is considered. The rate of diffusion increases nonlinearly with gas saturations that are disconnected and immobile, and enhanced by connected gas at the lens interface.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rockfall hazards along railway corridors in western Canada increase the risk of train derailment, which could lead to loss of life, infrastructure, and environmental damage. In some cases, such rockfalls exhibit pre-failure deformation prior to their detachment from the slope. The goal of this research is to gain an improved understanding of such precursory behaviour, and how it may be affected by the orientation and condition of discontinuity planes constraining rockfall source blocks. This thesis therefore focuses on the nature of rockfall failure mechanisms, explored using remote terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data.&#xD;
	TLS data was collected at regular 2-3 month intervals at three study sites along the Thompson-Fraser valley in British Columbia, Canada – namely Goldpan, White Canyon, and Mile 109 – from May 2013 to October 2016. A total of 207 rockfalls were identified across all three sites. For each rockfall, the orientation of joints was measured in the post-failure datasets and used to establish a likely failure mechanism. Pre-failure deformation trends were assessed using a roto-translation approach, which expresses the 3-dimensional transformation of a block from one TLS dataset to a successive dataset in terms of translation and rotation components. Rockfalls were classified by their pattern of deformation as well as failure mechanism and it was concluded that toppling blocks are most likely to exhibit detectable translation and rotation deformation using this method. &#xD;
	The pre-failure deformation of blocks at the Goldpan site was also examined using a vector-based method, which measures block movement in a direction normal to the slope. The classification of such blocks by their failure mechanism revealed an apparent linear relationship between rockfall volume and deformation magnitude and duration for toppling and wedge sliding failures, though additional rockfall cases are required to confirm this.&#xD;
        The methods for analyzing pre-failure deformation applied in this research have limitations and uncertainties, which are discussed. This work forms a basis for the analysis of precursory rockfall behaviour, which may be used to assess the likelihood and mechanism of future rockfall events.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) serve many purposes for the organisms producing them, enabling them to thrive in ice-laden environments. Antifreeze proteins (AFPs), a subset of this group, act as biological antifreezes and inhibit ice recrystallization. These ice-binding activities have many applications in the field of biotechnology, and to this end AFPs have been engineered in several ways to increase their activity. One of these strategies is to connect multiple AFPs together using a scaffold, which has been accomplished previously through bioconjugation of AFPs to the reactive termini of branched polymers. The inefficiency of such linkage reactions, however, resulted in heterogeneous mixtures of particles with incomplete occupancy of the available termini. To address this shortcoming, AFPs were genetically fused to the C termini of subunits forming self-assembling protein oligomers, in such a way that the ice-binding site of the AFP was optimally exposed for contact with ice. First, two different type of AFPs were separately fused to 12 of the 24 subunits of a self-assembling protein cage. The subunits assembled into the designed structures, and the AFP multimers showed greatly enhanced freezing point depression and ice recrystallization inhibition over the corresponding monomeric AFPs. &#xD;
A moderately active fish AFP was also fused to a subunit designed to assemble into two-dimensional arrays, and the resulting fusion protein showed increased freezing point depression over the monomer. However, size-exclusion chromatography of the fusion protein suggested that the subunits were not assembled into a two-dimensional array, and additional structural characterization is needed to elucidate the oligomerization state of this design. Overall, genetic fusion of AFPs to the termini of self-assembling oligomers has proven to be a promising method of enhancing their ice-binding activities, and could be used to arrange AFPs into novel orientations. We also envision that the RosettaDesign program used to design the novel protein assemblies can be applied to AFPs themselves, to generate AFP-to-AFP binding sites on their surfaces and arrange them into oligomers not seen in nature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Freshwater systems experience many stressors that can affect aquatic communities; one such stressor is calcium decline. Cation depletion of surrounding soils and watersheds of many North American and Scandinavian lakes is in part due to the legacy effect of logging and acid deposition. An important freshwater grazer, Daphnia, is especially sensitive to calcium decline as it has a heavily calcified chitin carapace that is frequently moulted, resulting in the need to uptake large amounts of calcium from the surrounding water. Studies have documented variation among populations of Daphnia spp. in response to predators, food concentrations, and cyanobacteria, however only one study has assessed intra-specific variation in Daphnia spp. to calcium decline. We predicted that calcium sensitivity of individual Daphnia iso-female lines would depend on the lake calcium concentration of their lake of origin, if the historical exposure to low calcium allowed for a fitness advantage (higher reproduction and survival). Alternatively, variation in calcium tolerance among iso-female lines may exist independent of historical exposure. We tested the calcium sensitivity of 10 Daphnia pulex sensu lato iso-female lines in a life-history experiment under low food and soft water conditions that are associated with the Muskoka, Canada region. Daphnia were exposed to one of five calcium concentrations (0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 7mg Ca L-1) for a 21-day period and monitored daily for survival and reproduction and one size measurement was taken at day six. We found that the calcium sensitivity of Daphnia varied among iso-female lines for three responses; total reproduction, size at day six, and population growth rate, but this variation was not explained by source-lake calcium. Overall, our results highlight the existence of intra-specific variation in Daphnia sensitivity to calcium decline, and the need for future experiments to include multiple genotypes to fully understand the impacts this stressor has on Daphnia communities.</dcterms:abstract>
