      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis details a straightforward synthetic route to the antifungal compound pyrrolnitrin 1.2, along with several analogous halogenated phenylpyrroles. The proposed synthetic protocol involved the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of appropriately halogenated pyrrole pinacolboronate esters and aryl compounds. &#xD;
In the efforts towards preparing the cross-coupling partners, we report a regiospecific and high yielding synthesis of a 3-chloro pyrrole compound 2.14, its brominated analog 2.16, an iodinated analog 2.17, and the corresponding pinacolboronate ester 2.18. We also report a generalized reaction sequence (lithiation/carboxylation/Schmidt reaction/oxidation) for the preparation of halogenated benzoic acids, anilines and nitrobenzenes. In particular, we synthesized the desired halogenated nitrobenzene coupling partner 3.27 in excellent yield. We were also able to show that the conditions employed in this sequence were mild enough to allow preparation of the 2-bromo-6-iodo compound 3.33. &#xD;
Once the coupling partners were prepared, we developed the optimal conditions for our Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. In doing so, we were able to prepare our target compound 1.2 and several halogenated analogs in good yields. We also prepared brominated and deuterated arylpyrroles 4.27 and 4.28, respectively, for future use in mechanistic studies of the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic enzymes, PrnB, Prn C and PrnD. This required preparation of the corresponding brominated and deuterated pyrrole pinacolboronate esters 4.24 and 4.26.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Adolescents experience heightened emotional arousal and difficulty regulating that arousal. Adolescent girls have emotion regulation difficulties particularly associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. In adults, the emotion dysregulation associated with depression and anxiety has been linked to not accepting emotions. Emotional non-acceptance is the act of judging certain emotional experiences as inadmissible and trying to avoid, suppress, or ignore those experiences. In adults, non-acceptance is thought to paradoxically lead to amplified emotional arousal and difficulty regulating arousal. Previous research supports this idea for the subjective experience of emotion but not the physiological response. The goal of the current study was to elicit these differences in physiology in order to better understand the effects of emotional non-acceptance on emotion regulation. Eighty-two adolescent girls were asked to perform a spontaneous speech while physiological and subjective responses were measured. These same measures were taken before and after the speech. Trait-like emotional non-acceptance was also measured. Although trait non-acceptance predicted differences in one aspect of physiology, there were no other effects of emotional acceptance or non-acceptance on physiological response. In line with previous research, emotional acceptance and non-acceptance had their effects on the subjective experience of emotion, both in reaction to, and recovery from, the speech. Interestingly, in the current sample, induced non-acceptance had no effects on arousal or regulation. Also, greater effects were found for self-reported positive emotion than any other measure of emotional response. Results support the idea that emotional non-acceptance and acceptance affect the appraisal of emotional experiences but do not affect the emotional arousal itself. Also, the findings of this study suggest that emotional non-acceptance has more qualities of a trait than a state. The implications for the model of emotional acceptance and the effects of puberty on emotion regulation are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis I explore and evaluate the grounds upon which we can claim that community and activist art makes a difference in peoples’ lives.  To do so, I examine an ongoing art project that seeks to transform the lives of American women with HIV/AIDS through artistic creation, the STITCHES Doll Project.  To evaluate the efficacy of the Project, I position the Project in relation to the history of HIV/AIDS in America, popular and medical understandings of the illness, connections between HIV/AIDS and oppressive structures, representations of the illness, as well as Western conceptions of embodiment, illness, and identity.  Against this history, I provide visual and textual analyses of several of the works produced through the STITCHES Doll Project, in combination with interviews and reports from participants themselves, to determine how these dolls affect these women’s sense of self and agency.&#xD;
	This thesis argues that Western understandings of the meaning of HIV/AIDS, combined with its physical, emotional, social, and psychological effects, violently erodes a sense of self for those who contract the illness. Specifically, I argue that because identity in the West is predicated upon self-control, self-containment, mental control, and a repression of embodiment, illness, and death, HIV/AIDS has been experienced at both a personal and cultural level as corrosive of identity.  In response to such pain, the STITCHES Doll Project provides an opportunity for HIV+ women to use a variety of strategies to re-establish their identity.  Strategies such as sharing the illness or displacing it, when enacted through the Project, can successfully assist in re-affirming identity for participants.  I suggest that this is where the value of the Project is best situated, and that this case study provides reason to believe in the value and power of community and activist art.  Nevertheless, the Project’s success at individual, social, political, and pedagogical levels is tempered by the challenges posed by cultural codes, discourses, institutions, and practices.  In light of this, my research explores how negotiation of these cultural codes, norms and practices helps to both re-build, as well as un-do, identity for participants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is known that the ring of invariants of any two-row group is Cohen-Macaulay.&#xD;
This result inspired the conjecture that the ring of invariants of any two-row group is a complete intersection. In this thesis, we study this conjecture in the case where the ground field is the prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$. We prove that all Abelian reflection two-row $p$-groups have complete intersection invariant rings. We show that all two-row groups with \textit{non-normal} Sylow $p$-subgroups have polynomial invariant rings. We also show that reflection two-row groups with \textit{normal} reflection Sylow $p$-subgroups have polynomial invariant rings. As an interesting application of a theorem of Nakajima about hypersurface invariant rings, we rework a classical result which says that the invariant rings of subgroups of $\text{SL}(2,\,p)$ are all hypersurfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, we obtain a result that characterizes Nakajima $p$-groups in characteristic $p$, namely, if the invariant ring is generated by norms, then the group is a Nakajima $p$-group.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation focuses on contemporary literature produced by Arab American women authors. My study utilizes the works of Diana Abu-Jaber, Mohja Kahf, Suheir Hammad, Naomi Shihab Nye, and Laila Halaby, to raise questions about the processes, methods, and practices of writing, publishing, and reading Arab American women’s literature. Influenced by developments in contemporary Arab American studies, postcolonial, and reception theories, this dissertation examines, from an interdisciplinary perspective, novels, poetry, prose, and online articles that these authors produced in the aftermath of the First Gulf War until today (1993-2007). A study of this literature, I argue, facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the history of Arab American literature, its recent trends, and possible futures. &#xD;
	Chapter Two focuses on the work of Diana Abu-Jaber, one of the most important Arab American women authors today. Tracing literary developments, shifts, and alterations in the author’s work, I argue that Abu-Jaber uses her writing to humanize Arab Americans for her predominantly western audiences. Focusing on what I see as shifts in the author’s political commitments and ideals, I analyze her large body of works in order to understand how they are influenced by the western publication industry, marketing strategies, reader demand, and literary fame. &#xD;
Chapter Three deals explicitly with the works of Mohja Kahf as I examine the author’s attempt to reconfigure Islam’s negative status in the United States by defying the politics of literary representation and challenging the restrictive cultural, racial, and religious boundaries of the Muslim ummah or community. I argue that the author’s work challenges both the mythologies of representations surrounding the figure of the Muslim woman in the West and the gendered and sometimes exclusionary parameters of the Muslim ummah in the United States.  &#xD;
	In Chapter Four, I shift my focus to the writings of Naomi Shihab Nye, Suheir Hammad, and Laila Halaby. I examine how these authors negotiate the national trauma of September 11, 2001 and state of emergency ensuing in the wake of the attacks. I assess how these authors render legible Arab American and Muslim American encounters of 9/11 and its aftermath.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) is a 190 kDa phosphoglycoprotein that mediates the efflux of structurally diverse endo- and xenobiotics across biological membranes, and is known to play roles in drug disposition and resistance. The goal of the present study was to examine the functional importance of the region proximal to transmembrane helix 17 (TM17) of MRP1 by mutational analysis of seven conserved amino acids in this region. Thus, Glu1253, Glu1255, Val1261, Glu1262, Arg1263, Glu1266, and Tyr1267 were initially replaced by Ala, and after expression in HEK293T cells, the properties of the mutant proteins were investigated. All of the mutant proteins were expressed at levels comparable to wild-type MRP1, indicating that these residues are not critical for MRP1 biosynthesis. Vesicular transport assays showed that Ala-substitution of Glu1253 and Glu1262 significantly reduced 17β-estradiol 17-(β-D-glucuronide) (E217βG) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) transport by 30-75% (p &lt; 0.05), while Ala-substitution of Glu1255 and Glu1266 had no effect. Transport activity of the same-charge mutant E1253D was comparable to wild-type MRP1, while transport by E1262D remained reduced (by 50-75%) (p &lt; 0.05). Kinetic analysis suggests that E1253A and E1262A exhibit reduced E217βG uptake as a result of a decreased uptake affinity (Km), while the reduced transport of E1262D was associated with a reduction in Vmax. Reciprocal mutations of potential interhelical bonding partners of Glu1253 and Glu1262 (Lys1141 and Arg1142, respectively), identified by examination of an atomic homology model of MRP1, did not significantly enhance MRP1 function. This suggests that even if bonding interactions exist between the side-chains of these two pairs of amino acids, the interactions are not exclusive. These findings also suggest that Glu1253 and Glu1262 have unique and complex roles in substrate binding and/or translocation. Ala-substitution of Val1261, Arg1263 and Tyr1267 caused a small reduction in E217βG transport (by 25-35%) (p &lt; 0.05), while reductions in LTC4 transport were somewhat more substantial (by 30-55%) (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, these studies have provided the first evidence of the functional importance of anionic residues in the COOH-proximal region of TM17 of MRP1.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The design of two-dimensional signal constellations for the transmission of binary non-uniform memoryless sources over additive white Gaussian noise channels is investigated.  The main application of this problem is the implementation of improved constellations where transmitted data is highly non-uniform. A simple algorithm, which optimizes a constellation by re-arranging its points in a pairwise fashion (i.e., two points are modified at a time, with all other points remaining fixed), is presented. In general, the optimized constellations depend on both the source statistics and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the channel.  We show that constellations designed with source statistics considered can yield symbol error rate performance that is substantially better than rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation signal sets used with either Gray mapping or more recently developed maps.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This collective case study analyzed the experiences of current and past participants of two experiential education programs for low-income inner city youth in order to understand how participants developed personally and socially through their participation. Drawing on research on risk and resilience, this study focuses on programs that attempt to provide inner city youth with ‘protective factors’ against risks they face. One case represents the experiences of participants in an arts education program and the other in an outdoor education program. At each research site, open ended, semi-structured interviews were conducted with current participants (aged 13-15) and past participants (aged 16-21). &#xD;
Past and current participants in both programs described a series of developmental stages of coming out of one’s shell starting with experiencing success, leading to feelings of competence in abilities, feeling trust for group members, and thus, building the confidence to be one’s self. The agents of change in the arts program were: opportunities for self-expression without formal evaluation in dance, drama, music, and visual arts activities; encouragement from staff; and receiving positive feedback for performances from peers, staff, and parents. The major agent of change in the outdoor education program was overcoming challenges in a supportive atmosphere. Group and individual challenges were encountered during canoe tripping, ropes course activities, and the solo experience. A supportive environment was created by respectful relationships with staff and peers built through overcoming challenges together.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A study of the Millennium and Eagle Point basement-hosted deposits was conducted to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the alteration in these two atypical uraniferous systems and to apply these findings in formulating effective exploration strategies. In addition, an investigation of the Wheeler River “apparently barren” sandstone-hosted alteration system was conducted to provide insights into the critical events needed in order to form sandstone-hosted unconformity-related deposits. &#xD;
	At Millennium, the atypical alteration halo, wherein the inner chlorite halo is much smaller than other basement-hosted deposits, is the result of pervasive muscovite alteration of the basement rocks by Na-K-Fe basinal brines during the pre-ore stage at ca. 250°C. As alteration of the basement rocks progressed, the basinal brines acquired Ca, Fe and Mg while creating up to 20% voids in the basement rocks. Prior to the mineralizing event, the chemically modified basinal fluids formed a minor Fe-rich chamoisite halo that demarcates a redox front during the ca. 1590 Ma syn-ore stage, where uranium ore was precipitated. &#xD;
	At Eagle Point, the atypical alteration halo, wherein dolomite and calcite alteration is more significant than other basement-hosted deposits, is the result of more intense pre-Athabasca Basin alteration. The Eagle Point deposit is also distinct by significant late remobilization of primary uraninite into secondary structures that occurred at ca. 535 Ma.&#xD;
	At the Wheeler River “apparently barren” alteration system, the critical factor for the lack of uranium mineralization in the sandstone is the temporal relationship between the different fluids with the uranium-bearing oxidized basinal fluids present prior to the reduced chemically modified basinal fluids and reduced basement fluids. However, the possibility of a small basement-hosted uranium deposit at Wheeler River cannot be excluded because the sudoite-producing basement fluids may represent basinal brines that reacted with basement lithologies to become reducing and Mg-rich, and therefore may have precipitated uraninite during this process. &#xD;
	The results of this study support the genetic model in which basinal fluids were likely the source of uranium deposits and that the basement fluids were unlikely significant sources of uranium in sandstone-hosted deposits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the field of marketing, there is anecdotal evidence that “respect” is an important determinant of marketing relationship success (e.g., Berry 1996; Bitran and Hoech 1990; Costley, Friend, and Babis 2005).  The current relational paradigm that guides much of marketing research, thinking, and practice implies that marketing involves not only exchange between organizations and customers, but also relationships between people.  Given this context, individual-level relationship variables such as respect become important to our understanding of relationship marketing as a whole.  Yet, in marketing and in other relevant fields (e.g., social and organizational psychology, ethics, education), there is no agreement as to how respect should be defined, and there is no measure that captures the complexity of this construct.  In order to gain a more complete understanding of the reasons why certain marketing relationships succeed or fail, it is important to investigate the role of respect.&#xD;
The purpose of this research is to gain an understanding of (1) what respect means in the context of business-to-business marketing relationships, and (2) how respect impacts on the outcomes of those relationships.  Following an extensive review of literature from a number of fields, the empirical research took place over four studies.  In the first study, seventeen elite (in-depth) interviews were conducted with marketing practitioners.  The goal of the interviews was to come to a more complete understanding of the importance of respect, its definition and dimensionality, its key features, and its role in the success of marketing relationships.  As a result of these seventeen interviews, a preliminary model of respect was developed.  In the second study, five additional marketing practitioners were interviewed in order to gain feedback on the proposed model of respect.  Study 3 was aimed at developing a measure of respect to be included in later model testing; a key activity in this phase was an expert analysis of respect items.  This research culminated in study 4, where the model of respect was tested via an experiment involving 114 business and marketing practitioners.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Imagining Public Education in Early Modern England argues that the Tudor vernacular logic and rhetoric manuals participate in the development of early modern publicity.  Although the seventeen extant manuals have a diverse set of social appeals, some of them imagine education as a concern of the many rather than the few, even if their conceptions of the “many” were far from universal.  In the process of imagining a greater social participation in education, the Tudor manuals may have contributed to the ideological function of publicity as a veneer of universal accessibility over a reality involving many degrees of accessibility.  In other words, at the same time that these writers were imagining a larger social function for education, they were also participating in the overall conceptual emergence of publicity itself.  Chapter One examines the manuals aimed most clearly at producing social distinction.  While recent studies have argued that these manuals either reinforce or subvert the established social order, I argue that they represent the intersection of distinction and publicity.  Writers like Wilson and Puttenham engage with social distinction and reproduction in the forum of vernacular print not to subvert the social order but to continue these practices in a newly public way.  Chapter Two focuses on the manuals which address both a professional and a public readership.  These manuals contrast the social limitations of the university with the publicity of vernacular print in an allied appeal to both professional application and to the tradition of common knowledge.  Chapter Three examines the two manuals with the broadest social appeals.  While these authors envision strikingly inclusive ideas for education, they base their ideas of accessibility on the problematic principles of a national language and commodifed discourse.  Chapter Four continues to explore the idea of public education but with a focus on the examples of Francis Bacon’s The Advancement of Learning and the statutes of London’s Gresham College.  Contrary to the Habermasian school of public sphere theory, which allows only an impoverished notion of early modern publicity, the Tudor vernacular manuals indicate a lively and burgeoning discourse surrounding the imagination of public education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
Densification and mechanical properties (hardness, fracture toughness and flexural strength) of the SiC-TiB2 composite were studied. Pressureless sintering experiments were carried out on samples containing 0 to 50 vol % of TiB2 created by an in-situ reaction between TiO2 and C:&#xD;
2TiO2 + B4C + 3C 2TiB2 + 4CO&#xD;
Al2O3 and Y2O3 were used as sintering additives to create a liquid phase and promote densification at sintering temperatures ranging from 1820 to 1940oC. The sintered samples were subsequently heat-treated at temperatures ranging from 1850 to 1970oC&#xD;
	It was found that the presence of TiB2 formed by the above reaction serves as an effective obstacle to crack propagation thus increasing both the strength and fracture toughness of SiC while maintaining high a hardness of the sintered samples. Densities higher than 98 % TD were achieved depending on both the sintering temperature and heat treatment conditions. From a density viewpoint, the optimum volume fraction of TiB2 was from 12 to 24 vol %. Typical microstructures for samples with this volume fraction of TiB2 consist of TiB2 particles (&lt; 5m) uniformly dispersed in a matrix of elongated SiC plates. The presence of TiB2 particles in the matrix of SiC inhibited exaggerated grain growth of the SiC grains and activated additional toughening mechanisms. The subsequent heat treatment of the sintered samples improved mechanical properties. The optimum sintering and heat treatment temperatures were 1940 and 1970oC, respectively. The maximum flexural strength of 593 MPa was obtained in sample with 12 vol % TiB2. A maximum fracture toughness of 6.6 MPa•m1/2 was measured in samples containing 24 vol % TiB2. While both fracture toughness and strength increased with the presence of TiB2 particles, hardness on the other hand decreased from ~18 GPa in samples without TiB2 to 16.4 and 15.9 GPa in samples with 12 and 24 vol % TiB2, respectively. A theoretical analysis was conducted to model the effect of microstructure on the fracture toughness of SiC-TiB2 composites and was experimentally verified.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pryke, Lindsay, Dysart, and Dupuis (2004) investigated a novel method of lineup administration where participants made identifications from multiple lineups showing faces and bodies or playing recorded voices. Identifications from these multiple lineups was diagnostic of guilt; that is, the more lineups a person was selected from the more likely it was that the selected person was actually seen by the witness (as opposed to an innocent suspect; Pryke et al., 2004). The current studies expanded on this procedure and assessed how well the multiple lineup method works when each of the lineups for a target show faces of the same lineup members, with each lineup showing the members facing one of three angles. In Experiment 1, participants (n = 72) saw the targets in the same three views that were shown in the lineups and were asked to make lineup decisions for each of the three lineups. In Experiment 2, participants (n = 96) saw the targets in only one view, which did not always match the views seen in the lineups. Again, participants made lineup decisions for each of the three lineups. For both studies, when the data were collapsed across targets, the procedure was diagnostic in that more selections were associated with a higher probability of guilt (operationalized as being the previously seen target). However, the effectiveness of the procedure varied across targets such that in some cases multiple selections were no more diagnostic of guilt than single selections. Pryke et al., (2004) reported that multiple identifications were highly diagnostic of guilt but relatively rare. In the current studies, most participants made multiple identifications of the targets, probably because all of the lineups used photos of faces. Results for assessments of confidence-accuracy and advantages for certain lineup angles were generally mixed and often differed between the two studies. In all, the most pertinent assessments of utility (diagnosticity and percentage of participants making multiple identifications) showed promise for using multiple lineups of faces.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Health Promoting School (HPS) is s a model that advances both the health and learning needs of students. Yet there is a lack of consensus on student indicators that reflect a HPS or a coherent understanding of what a HPS represents amongst various stakeholders. The goal of this research was to establish indicators of student health and wellbeing associated with policies and practices in schools, and to further our understanding of health promoting schools. The research proceeded in three phases. The first phase established a relationship between student health and academic achievement. The second phase examined the associations amongst student health and wellbeing and student and school-level factors. The third phase involved case studies of two schools in Ontario to examine the organisational and structural elements associated with achieving a HPS, and the mechanisms by which these elements support student health and wellbeing.&#xD;
The association between students’ self-rated health and their academic achievement found in the first phase provides a platform for advancing the health promoting school agenda in Canada at the research and policy levels. Subsequent findings established an association between the environment and disciplinary climate in schools, and the school’s academic and socioeconomic standing to student health and wellbeing outcomes. These findings also suggest overlapping effects of schools and neighbourhoods on students’ health and wellbeing, implying that school health promoting efforts will be more successful when partnered with efforts within neighbourhoods and communities. Finally, the case studies suggest that embracing a HPS philosophy that addresses students’ emotional and physical wellbeing may help support students’ overall learning. Findings, presented in an implementation model of a HPS, emphasise key action areas that need to be addressed when implementing HPS initiatives and enhancing the capability of the education system to improve the health and learning of students.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Bound to violence (1968) is the first novel written by the Malian author Yambo Ouologuem. Winner of the Renaudot Award (November 1968), the novel was pulled from bookstore shelves by the French editor in the early 1970’s, following the accusations of plagiarism, which never went to trial. When the French text is reprinted in 2003, it is presented as an attempt to rehabilitate its reputation to the francophone public.&#xD;
Our study analyzes the intertextual practices, of which plagiarism is a major constituent, that are the foundation of the innovative narrative process of Bound to violence. The author appropriates the texts of the occidental novel as well as of the Bible, which various theories of intertextuality allow to identify. Similarly, the paratext of Bound to violence, which categorizes it as a novel, permits the blending of different discourses of that period in a mixture of narratives and genres. The novel presents “fixed” discourses such as the story of Hamitic Myth, ideological discourses about blackness and colonialism but also discourse about society, particularly History. The intertextual and hypertextual practices allow a fusion of narratives and genres which defines the novel’s originality. This study goes beyond a simple listing of the literary texts which are part of Bound to violence and examines the elaboration of an intertextual link between Bound to violence and other literary texts, as well as their function in the newly created novel.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ubiquitous second messenger cAMP acts to integrate and translate information encoded by extracellular messenger molecules, including hormones and neurotransmitters. Intracellular cAMP concentrations are regulated through coordinated changes in the activities of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs).  Freely diffusing cAMP can reach concentrations sufficient to activate cAMP effector proteins, such as protein kinase A (PKA) or the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), except in defined compartments where PDEs are localized which allows for spatial and temporal control of the cAMP signal. In human aortic vascular endothelial cells (HAECs) and HEK293T cells we recently identified a macromolecular complex consisting of PDE3B and EPAC and showed that this complex coordinated cAMP-induced effects on adhesion of these cells to fibronectin-coated surfaces. Using “pull-down” assays and peptide array-based approaches we have identified the molecular determinants which coordinate the formation of this complex. Our evidence suggests that the extreme N-terminal 13 amino acids of PDE3B represent the portion of PDE3B that interacts with EPAC. In addition, although several EPAC-encoded peptides were shown to bind PDE3B, immunoprecipitation-based studies identified a region proximal to the cAMP-binding domains as likely to have a dominant role in this binding. Of functional relevance, a cell permeable peptide containing these amino-terminal 13 amino acids of PDE3B antagonizes PDE3B-EPAC interactions in cells. In addition, this peptide impacted the ability of cAMP-elevating agents to coordinate EPAC-dependent cell adhesions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Altered sexual function is one of the most devastating consequences of spinal cord trauma (SCT). Despite this fact, current knowledge of the neural circuitry regulating sexual response in the spinal cord (SC) in healthy humans is remarkably incomplete. In order to better understand the changes that occur to sexual responses following SCT, we must elucidate the neural transmission of sexual function in healthy humans. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to map neuronal function have been adapted for the SC and can now reveal this neural circuitry. We mapped, with spinal fMRI, neuronal activity in the lower thoracic, lumbar and sacral SC in healthy men (n = 10) and women (n = 9) that occurs in response to intermittent audiovisual stimulation (AVS), intermittent genital self-stimulation (GSS) and the combination of the former and latter, applied continuously and simultaneously until orgasm (AVGSS). MR images revealed predominantly increased signal intensity changes (ΔS+) in the autonomic preganglionic nuclei of the lower thoracic, lumbar and sacral SC in women and mostly decreased signal intensity changes (ΔS-) in comparable regions in men. In functional MR images, ΔS+ are related to increased neuronal input while ΔS- are associated with diminished neuronal input to a particular region. Linear regression analyses uncovered a greater number of inverse correlations between SC ΔS and scores of sexual function in women than in men indicating greater descending modulation of SC circuits regulating sexual responses in women than in men. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spinal fMRI is an effective and sensitive technique that can reveal signal intensity changes in the lower thoracic, lumbar and sacral SC associated with AVS, GSS and AVGSS in healthy men and women.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
The current study evaluated the effects of training on the haptic classification of culturally universal facial expressions of emotion as depicted in simple 2D raised-line drawings. Blindfolded sighted (N = 60) and blind (N = 4) participants participated in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. A small vision control study (N = 12) was also conducted (Experiment 2) to compare haptic versus visual learning patterns. A hybrid learning paradigm consisting of pre/post- and old/new-training procedures was used to address the nature of the underlying learning process in terms of token-specific learning and/or generalization. During the Pre-Training phase, participants were tested on their ability to classify facial expressions of emotion using the set with which they would be subsequently trained.  During the Post-Training phase, they were tested with the training set (Old) intermixed with a completely novel set (New). For sighted observers, visual classification was more accurate than haptic classification; in addition, two of the three adventitiously blind individuals tended to be at least as accurate as the sighted haptic group. All three groups showed similar learning patterns across the learning stages of the experiment: accuracy improved substantially with training; however, while classification accuracy for the Old set remained high during the Post-Training test stage, learning effects for novel (New) drawings were reduced, if present at all. These results imply that learning by the sighted was largely token-specific for both haptic and visual classification. Additional results from a limited number of blind subjects tentatively suggest that the accuracy with which facial expressions of emotion are classified is not impaired when visual loss occurs later in life.</dcterms:abstract>

Finite element calculations were used to explain how stability is jeopardized by two forms of deterioration, both material failure (yield in the steel) and geometrical nonlinearity (bucking failure). The stability assessments are presented for structures designed using limit states design procedures in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code and the LRFD Bridge Design Code of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. &#xD;
&#xD;
It was found that yield in culverts in intact ground is proportional to plate thickness (thrust and moment are not affected). Buckling strength changes as corrosion occurs, but does not become critical in structures supported by good quality backfill (without erosion). Surprisingly, thrusts decrease when erosion develops adjacent to the culvert, and this implies that factor of safety against yield is increased. However, substantial decreases in buckling strength occur, and elastic instability can then become the critical performance limit after erosion. &#xD;
&#xD;
Three dimensional finite element analysis indicates that local buckling can develop before global buckling, for new structures featuring thin plates, or for thicker structures after corrosion. This form of elastic instability may not be safely estimated using current culvert buckling equations which consider global buckling.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Local buckling results were not effectively estimated using the Bryn’s equation (the conventional method used for stiffened plate structures); therefore a preliminary design equation for assessment of local buckling is provided. &#xD;
&#xD;
After verifying the results obtained from this thesis with physical experiments, these findings can provide practitioners with useful evaluation tools for a quantitative assessment to the stability of buried culverts subjected to these two different kinds of deterioration (corrosion and erosion) in order to augment engineering experience or judgment, which is the primary tool currently being used. Moreover, the current study helps future experimental and numerical studies by investigating various significant deterioration scenarios, and the impacts of these scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A major hurdle facing in vitro protein characterization is obtaining soluble protein from targets that tend to aggregate and form insoluble inclusion bodies.  Soluble protein is essential for any biophysical data collection and new methods are needed to approach this significant problem.  Directed evolution can be used to discover mutations which lead to improved solubility using an appropriate screening method.  Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been shown to be an effective solubility reporter which can be used to screen for soluble protein variants.  We have chosen three diverse enzymes as targets for improving protein solubility using this technique:  arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase—an enzyme which converts fatty acids into leukotrienes, PhnG—an  enzyme belonging to the bacterial carbon-phosphorus lyase pathway, and RebG—a glycosyltransferase.  Error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling were used to generate libraries of mutants which were subsequently cloned into a GFP-fusion screening vector.  From the evolution of 5LO and RebG, much was learned about the optimization of the protocols involved in this methodology, including valuable information about how to avoid common “false-positive” results in which fluorescent colonies arise while screening but do not represent an improvement of the target.  Evolution of these two targets did not result in an improvement of solubility, however truncation strategies may still prove to be effective, and more work needs to be done in this area. Evolution of PhnG successfully produced one variant, named clone B6, which showed both an improvement in expression and folding over wild type PhnG.  It was also discovered that GFPuv can act as an effective solubility enhancing fusion tag for PhnG.  Prior to the current studies PhnG had not been effectively expressed and purified in E. coli , however purification and refolding of resolubilized inclusion bodies of the clone B6 PhnG-GFP fusion construct was shown to yield enough soluble protein for future crystallographic studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is some evidence to suggest that oxygen consumption (VO2) and oxygen delivery to muscle are reduced at exercise onset and steady state in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), although no studies have combined measurements of both muscle blood flow and VO2 during exercise in this population. OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine whether a reduction in VO2 during exercise would be accompanied by reduced leg blood flow (LBF). 2) To examine the dynamic response characteristics of LBF to determine whether feedforward and/or feedback control systems of blood flow regulation are impaired. METHODS: Four men with T2D and six healthy, activity matched controls (CON) performed supine, two-leg knee extension/flexion exercise tests involving progressive increase in exercise intensity to exhaustion and step increases to a low intensity equivalent to lifting 7.5 kg (LO7.5kg), and a moderate intensity equivalent to 90% of ventilatory threshold (VT90%). MEASUREMENTS: LBF, VO2, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and stroke volume were measured continuously. RESULTS: Means ± SE, CON vs. T2D. 1) ∆VO2 was not different between groups during the incremental test (P= 0.264), ∆LBF in T2D tended to be lower (P = 0.098). 2) ∆VO2 was not different between groups at any time during LO7.5kg (P = 0.351). Individuals with T2D demonstrated a lower ∆LBF at time = 15 s (3435.6 ± 275.0 vs. 2120.4 ± 218.4 ml/min, P = 0.018). 3) Gains for baseline (G0) and phase I (G1) LBF adaptation to LO7.5kg were lower in T2D compared to CON (G0: 959.8 ± 111.3 vs. 617.0 ± 22.1 ml/min, P = 0.044; G1: 3662.1 ± 229.0 vs. 2128.1 ± 161.6 ml/min, P = 0.002). 4) The time required to achieve 63% of the total response magnitude tended to be slower in T2D (LO7.5kg: 14.3 ± 1.7 vs. 23.1 ± 4.2 s; VT90%: 26.2 ± 3.5 vs. 40.0 ± 7.5 s; P = 0.095). CONCLUSIONS: 1) The initiatory rise in LBF is significantly lower in individuals with T2D, likely due to impairments in feedforward control mechanisms of blood flow regulation, 2) Individuals with T2D do not demonstrate lower VO2 responses to exercise despite an impaired LBF response.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mechanistic aspects of the asymmetric rhodium catalyzed hydroboration of vinyl&#xD;
arenes with catecholborane (HBCat) and pinacolborane (HBPin) have been probed.&#xD;
Competition studies conducted with catalysts bearing asymmetric ligands Josiphos or Quinap&#xD;
reveal substituent effects of varying sensitivity correlating to Hammett parameter sigma. In&#xD;
reactions involving the Quinap ligand, rho-values of +1.97 and +1.02 are observed for&#xD;
HBCat and HBPin, respectively. In Josiphos-ligated systems, rho-values of +1.38 and -3.17&#xD;
are observed, indicating that the reaction proceeds through differing mechanisms depending&#xD;
on the borane employed. Labeling experiments reveal differences in the reversibility of the&#xD;
hydride insertion step of reaction depending on the ligand and borane implemented in&#xD;
hydroboration.&#xD;
A new methodology has been developed for regioselective rhodium-catalyzed&#xD;
hydroboration of internal olefins with pinacolborane. The addition of co-catalytic Lewis&#xD;
acids results in the activation of cationic rhodium catalysts in chlorinated solvents. Increased&#xD;
catalytic activity and regioselectivity are observed under these conditions. For internal alkyl&#xD;
olefins, selectivity for non-isomerized secondary boronate esters was found originate from&#xD;
the non-coordinating solvents employed in the reaction. For aromatic olefins, increased&#xD;
regioselectivity and reaction acceleration are both effects of the Lewis acid additive. Study&#xD;
of the reaction revealed that these properties are linked to Lewis acid-base mediated&#xD;
heterolytic B-H bond cleavage of pinacolborane, and suggests that the reagent is transferred&#xD;
to the rhodium catalyst as borenium ion and hydride moieties. Inhibition studies confirmed&#xD;
that Lewis acid is required throughout the reaction and does not solely act as an initiator.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis focuses on the methods and results of the workspace formulation of wire-actuated parallel manipulators. Four methods of workspace generation are studied. The null space method, based on the calculation of wire tensions, is used to formulate the workspaces of example manipulators. The results of this method are used to verify the results of the following methods. &#xD;
This thesis presents that the convex hull workspace formulation method, a geometric analysis of the manipulator’s Jacobian matrix, can be extended to manipulators that have an external wrench and/or gravity applied to the mobile platform. The convex hull method is applied to the example manipulators investigated with the null space method.&#xD;
 The workspace envelope characterization, an analytical approach of defining the borders of the workspace using the formulation of the kernel of the manipulator’s Jacobian matrix, is applied to the example planar manipulators investigated with the previous methods. A new process, presented in this thesis, of identifying the contribution of each set of four wires/forces of a planar manipulator allows the workspace envelope characterization to be applied to redundant planar manipulators and planar manipulators that have an external wrench and/or gravity applied to the mobile platform. &#xD;
The discrete and analytical antipodal methods, based on theorems from multi-fingered grasping manipulators, are presented and applied to the example planar manipulators investigated with the previous methods. This research generalizes the use of these theorems, which determine wrench-closure poses of planar four-wire manipulators that share wire-connection points on the base or mobile platform, to the discrete and analytical workspace formulation of planar three-degree-of-freedom wire-actuated manipulators with no restrictions on the number of wires or the configuration of the manipulator. &#xD;
Comparing all methods investigated in this thesis, the null space method results in the workspace that takes into account the maximum and minimum wire tensions and is recommended for use in the design of both spatial and planar wire-actuated parallel manipulators. All the other methods presented in this thesis, have similar results when compared to the null space method but formulate the maximum workspace which assumes the wires can operate with very high to infinite wire tension.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the visa mechanism deployed by governments on state borders. I take the Canadian temporary residence visa system experienced by Chinese applicants as my working example. Though the visa system is generally regarded as something essential and efficient for border control, I argue that it only gains its power to judge people’s admissibility from the government’s routinized authority and deemed expertise to deploy the border control mechanisms. The visa system is a realm where governments practise their power on the bordering population and visa applicants are made into subjects of the visa regime. Didier Bigo’s (2005) model of ban-opticon is used as my theoretical model to analyze the Canadian temporary resident visa system in this thesis. Mirroring Bigo’s description of the ban-opticon, I first analyze how the legitimacy of visa system is constructed by the discourse of in-securitization of migration, which, by rendering the migrating population inherently dangerous to the sovereign states, legitimates and necessitates the deployment of border control mechanisms. Also, I argue that the legislation surrounding the Canadian temporary resident visa system not only regulates the operational procedure, but also naturalizes the Canadian government’s expertise in selecting admissible people. Lastly, from the Canadian visa application experience of 9 Chinese applicants, I analyze how the applicants’ admissibility is decided by the visa officers based on their interpretation of the applicants’ identity documents and prediction of the applicants’ future behaviour. Though some means of negotiation are embedded in the mechanism, their existence actually proves that the evaluation system itself is not determinate. As I conclude, the discourse of in-securitization of migration, the related legislation of the visa system, as well as the real-life practices in the process, as the three elements of the ban-opticon on the border, are all at play in the visa regime, jointly making visa applicants into subjects of the government’s power practice on the border.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>What are the causes of the US foreign policy of imperial expansion between 1998 and 2003? &#xD;
US foreign policy in this timeframe is distinctive by its unilateralism and use of force compared to previous instances of American expansion as well as to its political line in the early 1990s. Hence, the thesis conducts an inquiry into the reasons for this transformation in American foreign policy. By contrast to the existing literature on American foreign policy, the thesis argues for an alternative hypothesis in terms of prestige-seeking on the part of the US. Despite its advantage in capabilities, the US found itself constantly unable to translate its preferences into successful outcomes in the 1990s. This discrepancy eventually created the conditions for status inconsistency, i.e. the gap between the social ranks an actor occupies in multiple social hierarchies. An actor experiencing status inconsistency will attempt to balance ranks so as to achieve eventual superiority under all hierarchies. In world politics, prestige is a function of social ranking or status, which is itself conferred according to three dimensions: military capabilities, economic capabilities, and political performance—the ability of successfully translating one’s preferences into successful outcomes. It in this latter respect that the US felt it was particularly deficient in the aftermath of the Cold War, hence the need to conserve and enhance American prestige so as to match America’s pretensions of world leadership. Accordingly, the thesis examines in detail how the pursuit of prestige affected American foreign policy   in the contexts of rejection of the ABM and the ICC treaties, the use of force without a UN Security Council authorization the bombing of Yugoslavia over Kosovo, and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. The thesis concludes that prestige represents a significant and enduring influence over states’ foreign policy conduct due to status inconsistency. Furthermore, the recent American policy of imperial expansion from 1998 to 2003 under the presidencies of Clinton and George W. Bush is likely to be a harbinger of things to follow, because the circumstances favoring status inconsistency and the consequent policy of prestige are still present.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Freehand 3-D ultrasound (US) using a 2-D US probe has the advantage over conventional 3-D probes of being able to collect arbitrary 3-D volumes at a lower cost. Traditionally, generating a volume requires external tracking to record the US probe position. An alternative means of tracking the US probe position is through speckle tracking. Ultrasound imaging has the advantage that the speckle inherent in all images contains relative position information due to the decorrelation of speckle over distance. However, tracking the position of US images using speckle information alone suffers from drifts caused by tissue inconsistencies and overall lack of accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents two novel methods of improving the accuracy of speckle-tracked 3-D US through the use of sensor fusion. The first method fuses the speckle-tracked US positions with those measured by an electromagnetic (EM) tracker. Measurements are combined using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The fusion is able to reduce drift errors as well as to eliminate high-frequency jitter noise from the EM tracker positions. Such fusion produces a smooth and accurate 3-D reconstruction superior to those using the EM tracker alone.&#xD;
  &#xD;
The second method involves the registration of speckle-tracked 3-D US volumes to preoperative CT volumes. We regard registration combined with speckle tracking as a form of sensor fusion. In this case, speckle tracking is used in the registration to generate an initial position for each US image. To improve the accuracy of the US-to-CT registration, the US volume is registered to the CT volume by creating individual US "sub-volumes", each consisting of a small section of the entire US volume. The registration proceeds from the beginning of the US volume to the end, registering every sub-volume. The work is validated through spine phantoms created from clinical patient CT data as well as an animal study using a lamb cadaver. Using this technique, we are able to successfully register a speckle-tracked US volume to a CT volume with excellent accuracy. As a by-product of accurate registration, any drift from the speckle tracking is eliminated and the freehand 3-D US volume is improved.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Optical regeneration has the potential to significantly increase the reach of long-haul transmission systems. In this thesis, wavelength-preserving polarization-insensitive all-optical 3R regeneration is investigated and demonstrated for 10 and 40 Gb/s signals. The all-optical regenerator utilizes a self-pulsating laser for clock recovery, cross-phase modulation (XPM) based spectral broadening in a highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) and offset filtering for retiming, and self-phase modulation based spectral broadening in a HNLF and offset filtering for reshaping. Raman amplification is used to increase the XPM-based spectral broadening and thus allow a design that meets the tradeoffs involved in simultaneously achieving good retiming and reshaping performance. The regenerator is shown to reduce amplitude noise and timing jitter while not causing a BER penalty.  To fully validate the regeneration scheme, the cascadability is demonstrated using a recirculating loop. For a 10 Gb/s signal, with a regenerator spacing of 240 km, a return-to-zero, on-off-keyed (RZ-OOK) signal was transmitted over 18,000 km (75 loops) with a power penalty of 1.6 dB at a BER of 1E-9 compared to the back-to-back case.  For a 40 Gb/s signal, with a regenerator spacing of 80 km, a RZ-OOK signal was transmitted over 8,000 km (100 loops) with a power penalty of 1.2 dB. In addition, all-optical 3R regeneration is demonstrated using a multimode quantum-dot Fabry Petot laser with ultra-low timing jitter.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been well established as a cytoprotective molecule, and has been shown to exert cardioprotective effects in both hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the precise mechanism of the cardioprotective effect of HO-1 has yet to be fully elucidated. The natriuretic peptide system (NPS) is also a key player in cardiovascular homeostasis and tissue dynamics, and has also been shown to be cardioprotective in a variety of pathologic conditions. This study examined the effect of high dietary salt treatment in genetic models of HO-1, and assessed the expression of the NPS in the left ventricle (LV), in order to gain insight into the relationship between varying levels of HO-1 expression with the development of cardiac hypertrophy and the expression of the NPS. Methods: Age-matched 12-week old male HO-1 knockout (HO-1-/-) and HO-1 cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpressing (HO-1Tg) mice were treated with either normal salt (NS; 0.8%) or high salt (HS; 8.0%) chow for 5 weeks. LV mRNA expression was determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results: HO-1-/- mice fed HS diet had significantly higher left ventricle-to-body weight ratio (LV/BW) compared to HO-1+/+ mice fed NS diet. HO-1-/- mice had significantly reduced expression of the NPS compared to controls, and these mice did not exhibit a salt-induced increase in ANP expression. HS treatment had no effect on LV/BW in HO-1Tg mice compared to controls. HO-1Tg mice had significantly higher ANP and BNP expression compared to controls. Conclusions: The presence of HO-1 is required for normal salt-induced changes in the local cardiac NPS. HO-1 ablation resulted in significantly lower mRNA expression of the NPS, whereas HO-1 overexpression resulted in higher mRNA expression of the NPS. These data indicate that the detrimental effect of reduced HO-1 expression and the cardioprotective effect of increased HO-1 expression may be due, in part, to altered expression of the NPS.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: Developmental origins of disease refers to the theory that adverse maternal environments influence fetal development and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adulthood. To test the hypothesis that gestational hypertension influences the development of CVD in offspring, a novel experimental paradigm was developed using atrial natriuretic peptide gene disrupted mice (ANP-/-). The objective of this thesis was to determine the effect of gestational hypertension on cardio-renal function in offspring. Methods: ANP+/+ females were crossed with ANP-/- males (yielding ANP+/-WT offspring) and ANP-/- females with ANP+/+ males (yielding ANP+/-KO offspring). Previous work has established that ANP-/- dams are hypertensive during pregnancy. Offspring gene expression was measured using qPCR. Offspring arterial blood pressure (BP) was measured with a non-invasive tail cuff system. Offspring left ventricular (LV) function was examined using echocardiography (ECHO). Offspring were treated with normal salt (NS) or high salt (HS) chow for five weeks to assess salt-sensitivity. Daily injections of isoproterenol (ISO) were used to induce cardiac stress in offspring. Collagen deposition was assessed using Masson’s trichrome and picrosirius red staining. Results: Absence of maternal ANP had no effect on either litter size or offspring growth, but caused significant LV hypertrophy in offspring, with no change in LV function. Treatment with ISO resulted in myocardial fibrosis and significant LV diastolic dysfunction with a restrictive filling pattern (increased E/A ratio and E/e’) only in ANP+/-KO offspring. Furthermore, absence of maternal ANP was associated with salt-resistant BP in offspring. Conclusions:  Gestational hypertension using the ANP-/- mouse model results in a salt-resistant phenotype in offspring, as well as significant cardiac hypertrophy and an adverse response to activation of the sympathetic nervous system in adult offspring. These data suggest that adverse maternal environments may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in offspring later in life.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Groundwater is an important water resource that must be protected from potential contamination due to anthropogenic activities such as industrial production and agriculture. It is necessary to understand the presence, movement, and persistence of contaminants in aquifers to develop adequate protection plans. Fractured bedrock aquifers with thin overburden cover are very sensitive to contamination, and little is known about transport processes from the ground surface to depth in this setting. Thus, this research was undertaken to improve the understanding of anthropogenic impacts on water quality in a natural fractured bedrock aquifer with minimal overburden protection. This was accomplished through a field-based investigation conducted in an agricultural setting near Perth, Ontario, Canada. The temporal and spatial variations of several contaminants and indicators (including nitrate, E. coli and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) were examined. A unique infiltration tracer experiment was also conducted to simulate the transport of solutes from the ground surface to wells. Results showed that nitrate concentrations were consistent on a daily scale, but varied monthly. In contrast to nitrate, greater bacterial (E. coli) variability was observed daily. E. coli was not identified in some locations for several months. The temporal variability of concentrations is an important consideration for those consuming groundwater in this setting, as concentrations may be acceptable one month while unsuitable another month (or even another day for fecal bacteria). Annual groundwater monitoring will likely not capture maximum concentrations and thus may not protect human health. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants), which had not been previously measured in groundwater, were detected in the study aquifer at concentrations greater than observed in surface water bodies. It is evident that additional surveys of PBDE concentrations in groundwater are warranted. The infiltration tracer experiment showed that solute transport from the ground surface through thin soil to wells in fractured bedrock can be extremely rapid (on the order of hours) although very complex. This is an important consideration for private and municipally owned drinking water systems that draw water from shallow bedrock aquifers. The results of this research demonstrate that protecting water at the source is imperative in order to preserve water quality in sensitive fractured bedrock aquifers with minimal overburden cover.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The functions of sleep remain enigmatic. One of the dominant, yet more contentious hypotheses is that sleep is involved in memory consolidation. A large body of evidence supports the role of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in memory consolidation, especially in rodents. In humans, the role of REM sleep in memory consolidation has also been investigated, however it is unclear if it supports only one type of memory, or consolidation for several memory systems. Recent evidence suggests that non-REM is also involved in memory consolidation. The role of theta activity during REM and sleep spindles during non-REM may provide electrophysiological signatures reflecting memory consolidation processes. The studies presented here attempt to further investigate the electrophysiological characteristics of the learning-dependent changes in REM and slow wave sleep (SWS) in rats. A 2-stage model of memory consolidation is outlined here, and both steps of the model were investigated. Consistent with previous studies, REM increases were observed following avoidance training. During this period, theta power during REM sleep was increased compared to non-learning rats. Increased sleep spindle density during SWS was observed following REM increases. When REM sleep was suppressed by infusing the GABAB agonist baclofen into the pedunculopontine nucleus, avoidance performance acquisition was impaired. Baseline sleep spindles predicted whether rats were able to learn to make avoidance responses. Results suggest that both REM and SWS may be sequentially involved in memory consolidation processes. Discrete periods (windows) exist for REM and SWS when memory consolidation processes appear to take place. Theta activity during REM sleep from 17- 20 h on the first post-training day and sleep spindles during SWS from 21-24 h on the first post- training day are increased in learning rats and are related to memory performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are a well accepted model of primary hypertension.  Among other features common to human hypertension, these rats exhibit sympathetic hyperactivity.  The neurons of the superior mesenteric ganglion (SMG) from SHR display enhanced collateral sprouting, higher firing rates and hyperinnervation of the mesenteric arteries compared to the SMG neurons from age-matched, normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.  Furthermore, SMG neurons in SHR are exposed to different conditions than are SMG neurons from WKY rats, including enhanced oxidative stress, increased afferent stimulation, and an altered hormonal environment.  In order to identify proteins with potential involvement in the establishment or maintenance of peripheral sympathetic hyperactivity in SHR, we used proteomic techniques to search for differences in protein expression between the SMG of SHR and the SMG of WKY rats at 16 and 22 weeks of age.  We found an upregulation of predominantly fetally expressed T1 domain and haptoglobin and a downregulation of serine protease inhibitor 2.1 in SHR relative to WKY rats at 16 and 22 weeks;  Apolipoprotein-A1 was also found to be upregulated in 22 week SHR SMGs compared to age-matched WKY SMGs.  These identifications improve our understanding of the ganglionic microenvironment in SHR and represent targets for the development of novel therapies to treat primary hypertension.&#xD;
	Hypertension is one of the defining components of the metabolic syndrome, together with insulin resistance, visceral adiposity and hyperlipidemia.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is also a common feature of the metabolic disorder, and thus primary hypertension and NAFLD are common comorbidities.  Despite these clinical connections, very little is known about the effects of primary hypertension on hepatic physiology.  We used proteomic techniques to search for evidence of significant involvement of the liver in SHR phenotype at the molecular level.  We detected changes in the expression of several proteins involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and lipid metabolism which together show that the liver is strongly involved in the pathologies associated with hypertension.  Our results suggest several novel mechanisms for the initiation of oxidative stress in SHR which could contribute to new advances in the treatment of metabolic abnormalities associated with hypertension.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is an investigation into the development of amidine and guanidine based compounds to be employed as switchable surfactants.  The surface activity of these molecules can be triggered by reaction with a benign gas, CO2.  The ultimate application of these surfactants was to be used as emulsifying and demulsifying agents of crude oil and water emulsions.  Synthesis and characterization of the following desired bases: N’-octyl-N,N-dimethylacetamidine (1), 2-octyl-2-imidazoline (2), 1-methyl-2-octyl-2-imidiazoline (3), N’-(4-heptylphenyl)-N,N-dimethylacetamidine (4), N’-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-N,N-dimethylacetamidine (5), N’-(4-(methyloxy)phenyl)-N,N-dimethylacetamidine (6), and N-octyl-N',N',N",N"-tetramethylguanidine (7) was carried out.  Their solubility in water was quantified with NMR spectroscopy.  All bases were reacted with CO2 and H2O to form bicarbonate salts, of which in situ characterization was achieved by IR and NMR spectroscopy. Percent conversion to the protonated forms at elevated temperatures was determined using NMR spectroscopy.  A direct correlation between switchability and basicity was observed, as the strongest bases possessed the largest conversions to the protonated species, even at higher temperatures.  The enthalpy of protonation was determined for each base through calorimetry experiments.  These compounds were tested as demulsifying surfactants of crude oil and water emulsions.  Demulsifying ability was determined to differ greatly with the head group structure of the various surfactants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Molecular dynamics simulations of the liquid crystal phases of 2-(4-butyloxyphenyl)-5-octyloxypyrimidine (2PhP) and 5-(4-butyloxyphenyl)-2-octyloxy-pyrimidine (5PhP) are the focus of this thesis. The 2PhP and 5PhP mesogens display different liquid crystalline phase sequences, despite having very similar molecular structures. Specifically, both mesogens consist of aromatic phenyl and pyrimidine cores in between two flexible alkoxy tails, but they differ in the preferred core conformation. &#xD;
	A multi-site coarse-grained model, in which the aromatic rings are represented by soft quadrupolar ellipsoids and the alkoxy chains are given a united atom representation, is proposed in this thesis. A parameterization route for the intra- and intermolecular potentials appropriate for liquid crystal simulations is developed. The ab initio based derivation of suitable molecular models for the two mesogens is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on capturing proper phenyl-pyrimidine interactions which proved to be essential to correctly represent core-core interactions between neighboring molecules. A systematic determination of suitable Gay-Berne (GB) parameters has been adopted for the aromatic rings of 2PhP and 5PhP. To account for the pi-electron cloud below and above the ring plane, a quadrupole was added perpendicular to the ring. In the end, four parameterizations for aromatic rings have been selected for the simulations. Model characterization via pair interactions proved to be valuable in identifying and analyzing the short range structure in the phases.&#xD;
	Extensive molecular dynamics simulations of these fluids at various temperatures are performed. Intermolecular structure and order, in aromatic core and the flexible tail regions, are analyzed. Intermolecular structure is divided into contributions parallel and perpendicular to the layers, as indicated by a layer normal or by a director, to differentiate smectic A (SmA) from smectic C (SmC).  The presence of a ring quadrupole in the molecular model is shown to be essential to the correct reproduction of the experimentally observed phases. Simulations correctly indicate phases in agreement with experiment:  SmC and SmA phases for 2PhP, and only a SmA phase for 5PhP.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A novel interpretation of leaf mass variation in plants has been recently proposed based on its relationship with variation in leafing intensity – number of leaves produced per unit remaining above-ground dry mass. It is now widely established that between species&#xD;
variation in these two traits is strongly, negatively (and isometrically) correlated&#xD;
for woody and herbaceous species. Possible fitness advantages of higher leafing intensity (requiring smaller leaf size) can be interpreted in terms of the greater concentration of axillary meristems (larger ‘bud bank’), which may provide greater potential deployment flexibility for growth or reproduction. However, no research to date has addressed how these two traits are related at different scales, specifically at the between-individual (within-species) level, or between sexes in dioecious species. For the majority of 24 herbaceous angiosperms studied here, between-individual (within species) co-variation in leaf size and leafing intensity displayed as an isometric trade-off. For the few species with allometric trade-offs, plants with smaller body size produced disproportionately&#xD;
more leaves, indicating a possible mechanism for promoting reproductive economy when&#xD;
plant size is suppressed (e.g. by competition). For two out of three woody dioecious species, and two out of three herbaceous dioecious species, males tended to produce more, smaller leaves than females, possibly promoting pollen dispersal through a more broadly-spaced floral display (developing from more numerous axillary meristems). In contrast, the larger (but fewer) leaves in females may serve to maximize local photosynthetic resources available for axillary fruit and seed maturation. Males and females did not differ in branching rates associated with differences in leafing intensities, but in one herbaceous species, higher leafing intensity in males was associated with higher flower production than in females. In the larger 24-species data set, there was no&#xD;
evidence that species with higher leafing intensity (providing more axillary meristems)&#xD;
was associated with either a greater magnitude or a greater flexibility in branching or flowering intensity. Additional studies are required to explore the possibility that large ‘bud banks’ of axillary meristems (conferred by high leafing intensity) may promote effective mechanisms for tolerating environmental variability, responding to damage (e.g. from herbivory), and/or maximizing reproductive economy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Compared to the general population, individuals with intellectual disabilities have a higher prevalence of health problems, including psychiatric and/or behavioural conditions (dual diagnosis). Research suggests that the proportion of persons with intellectual disabilities who have a dual diagnosis ranges from 14% to 64% depending on the population studied and the diagnostic criteria used. However, there is little population-based information in Canada about people with such a dual diagnosis. &#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric or behavioural conditions among adults with an intellectual disability in Canada, and to estimate the use of mental health services among these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of two cross-sectional, population-based surveys (2005 Canadian Community Health Survey: CCHS and 2006 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey: PALS), and the 2008/09 Survey of Adults with Intellectual Disabilities in South Eastern Ontario: SAID-SEO. Relevant variables were identified in the surveys to answer the study objectives. Confidence intervals were provided for all estimates and the results were compared within subgroups for each survey, as well as between surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The proportion of Canadian adults with an intellectual disability is 0.2% according to the CCHS and 0.5% according to the PALS. The proportion of individuals with a dual diagnosis was found to be 31% in the CCHS, 44% in the PALS, and 33% in the SAID-SEO. These prevalence estimates fall within the ranges reported in the literature. Lastly, the majority of adults with a dual diagnosis reported using health services in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: According to the three surveys examined (CCHS, PALS, SAID-SEO), psychiatric and behavioural conditions are present in about a third of the individuals with intellectual disabilities, which is in accordance with published literature. However, the estimates of the prevalence of intellectual disabilities in the CCHS and PALS were considerably lower when compared to the literature. Among the surveys, the PALS presented the highest quality of data regarding the population with a dual diagnosis. The surveys found that a majority of individuals with a dual diagnosis access some form of health services at least once a year.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Western Regional Climate Action Initiative (WCI) was signed by the governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington, on February 26, 2007. Upon the release of the September 2008 Design Recommendations for the WCI Regional Cap-and-Trade Program, the WCI also included Montana, Utah, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. A WCI goal is to reduce regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. It has previously been recognized that the region’s forests can be important carbon sinks and sources, and it has been suggested that the carbon-storage capacity of forests may have economic value. Here, connections between forests and the developing WCI cap-and-trade system design are examined. Qualitative comparative analysis is used to examine characteristics of US states participating in the WCI. Content analysis is used to identify what advocacy groups promote what forest-related WCI cap-and-trade rules. A combination of low per capita GHG emissions, and strong environmental politics, is found to be related to regional climate initiative participation by US states, with important exceptions among WCI participants. Forest industry presence alone does not obviously influence participation. Electric utility and industry groups, including the forestry sector, are found to support an extensive WCI carbon offset system. Forest industry groups are also found to support the carbon neutrality of forest biomass combustion, and oppose regulating forest carbon emissions. Several environmental non-governmental organizations are found to oppose extensive carbon offset use, and oppose the unconditional consideration of biomass combustion as carbon neutral. Forest related aspects of the WCI Design Recommendations of September 2008 are found to largely agree with forest industry advocated policies. Some WCI provisions may provide incentives for forest carbon loss, or weaken the GHG emissions cap. Three recommendations are made: consideration should be given to appropriately discounting forest offset projects to address carbon emissions leakage; forest carbon emissions from land conversion should be accounted for; combustion of forest biomass from old-growth forests should not be considered carbon neutral.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fountain codes have demonstrated great results for the binary erasure channel and have already been incorporated into several international standards to recover lost packets at the application layer.  These include multimedia broadcast/multicast sessions and digital video broadcasting on global internet-protocol.  The rateless property of Fountain codes holds great promise for noisy channels. These are more sophisticated mathematical models representing errors on communications links rather than only erasures. The practical implementation of Fountain codes for these channels, however, is hampered by high decoding cost and delay.&#xD;
   &#xD;
&#xD;
    In this work we study trapping sets in Fountain codes over noisy channels and their effect on the decoding process. While trapping sets have received much attention for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, to our knowledge they have never been fully explored for Fountain codes. Our study takes into account the different code structure and the dynamic nature of Fountain codes. We show that 'error-free' trapping sets exist for Fountain codes. When the decoder is caught in an error-free trapping set it actually has the correct message estimate, but is unable to detect this is the case. Thus, the decoding process continues, increasing the decoding cost and delay for naught. The decoding process for rateless codes consists of one or more decoding attempts. We show that trapping sets may reappear as part of other trapping sets on subsequent decoding attempts or be defeated by the reception of more symbols. Based on our observations we propose early termination methods that use trapping set detection to obtain improvements in realized rate, latency, and decoding cost for Fountain codes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The concept of ‘risk’ has become one of the main ontological, existential, and epistemological categories in the modern Western world. People are continually confronted with considerable amounts of information concerning what constitutes risks and how they are to be mediated and avoided. Along side this growing concern with risk and risk avoidance, a large segment of the population continues to seek out risk itself. Although substantial sociological research has been undertaken to try and understand why people engage with risk, these theories and subsequent research falls short in ontological, existential, and epistemological breadth. As a response, this thesis presents a new avenue to understanding risk-taking that is based upon Nietzschean aesthetic theory and its conceptualization of the ‘Apollonian’ and ‘Dionysian’ drives that structure human existence. The world of high-risk skiing is the focal point upon which Nietzsche’s theory is applied, with the hope of not only understanding this specific area of social life, but also to demonstrate the importance that risk can play as an ontological, existential, and epistemological emancipatory category. Chapter two provides an overview of the historical inception of the concept of risk and the popular theoretical perspectives used to understand its place within the social whole. Following this, chapter three reviews the dominant theories used within the sociology of sport to understand risk-taking within the world of sport. Finally, chapter four engages Nietzsche’s theory showing how the high-risk skiing community is analogous to pre-Socratic Greek tragedy, in that it enables adherents to properly balance both Apollonian and Dionysian drives allowing them to escape the ‘reactive nihilism’ that defines the modern Western world. It is concluded that such a perspective not only provides researchers with new tools that are based around the social importance of art and aesthetics, but also that risk is an important ontological, existential, and epistemological category that allows risk-takers to experience a more complete level of existence based upon an understanding of life that celebrates both its positive and negative aspects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation studies adaptations of monastic literary culture between the first decades of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the English Reformation. My discussion focuses on the writings of John Whethamstede, John Lydgate, Richard Whitford and Thomas More.  I argue that, while these authors aim to satisfy readers’ desires for elaborate and authoritative forms of piety, they actually provide models of reading and patterns of disciplined living that restrict lay piety within orthodox boundaries.   &#xD;
	&#xD;
I begin with an introductory chapter that situates this adaptation of monastic reading within broader literary and cultural developments, such as the growing popularity of humanist reading and Protestantism, in order to demonstrate that monastic ideals remained culturally relevant throughout this century. This chapter also aims to prompt a further reassessment of the division that is often created between the medieval and early modern periods. &#xD;
	&#xD;
Chapters Two and Three focus on the use of monastic reading practices within a Benedictine context. Chapter Two examines the historiographic poetry and prose of John Whethamstede in which the abbot both positions himself at the forefront of contemporary Latin literature and, at the same time, signals the differences that set the cloistered reader apart from his secular counterpart. Chapter Three examines Lydgate’s incorporation of monastic devotional culture into the Life of Our Lady through the depiction of the Virgin as living out an exemplary religious vocation and through the arrangement of the text to facilitate calculated meditative responses from readers.&#xD;
	&#xD;
Chapters Four and Five then shift to the first decades of the sixteenth century. Chapter Four examines Richard Whitford’s orthodox programme of monastic and social reform that aimed not only to meliorate the individual’s ethical life but also to revitalize Catholicism and engage directly with Protestantism. Finally, Chapter Five looks back two decades to investigate More’s borrowings from different elements of religious life in his Life of Pico and Utopia that seek to manage the spiritual aspirations of the laity and to depict a society in which, much as in a monastery, the desires of the individual are shaped by and subordinated to the ideals of the community.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Canadian government archives have primarily shaped scholars’ analysis of the File Hills farm colony on the Peepeekisis Reserve in south eastern Saskatchewan. While these colonial archives are valuable for research, they emphasise particular points in the government’s telling of the colony story. They focus on the construction, management, and intentions of the colony, but neglect the experiences and perspectives of Peepeekisis community members affected by the colony scheme. My thesis makes use of government archives, and is also based on Aboriginal oral histories about the colony and its long-term consequences. My central argument is that a more critical interpretation of archives and oral histories will enrich the historical and geographical record about the colony. I demonstrate how oral histories and archive documents can converge and diverge, but combining the two is particularly important to nuance the colony narrative. A critical viewing of texts and oral histories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries also reveals that colonialism in the prairie west was highly spatalised and grounded in “betterment” sciences that sought to control and discipline Aboriginal peoples through the manipulation of space, heredity, and environments. Betterment sciences shaped Indian Affairs policy and the farm colony is a remarkable example of how betterment was applied on the ground. Finally, oral histories offer powerful insight into Aboriginal identities that survive in spite of colonial constructs and strategies. Oral histories of Peepeekisis community members are particularly important for highlighting peoples’ everyday geographies and lives only hinted at in colonial archive documents. Part of what makes this thesis original is that it is based on collaborative research. I sought Peepeekisis band permission to conduct this project, and Peepeekisis community members’ oral histories form an important part of this thesis and they have provided guidance on the documenting of their oral histories in this thesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>RdoA, a serine/threonine kinase, is a member of the Cpx regulon, a stress response pathway, in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Phenotypic characterization of rdoA null mutants suggested that RdoA kinase activity affects a wide range of cell functions, which could be the result of both direct and indirect phosphorylation of targets. In a search for RdoA’s target(s), the phosphoproteome profile of wild-type and rdoA null S. enterica was examined through phosphoprotein enrichment followed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with phospho-specific fluorescent stains and western blots using phospho-specific antibodies. Three different phosphoprotein enrichment protocols, all based on metal-ion affinity chromatography, were compared for yield and phosphoprotein specificity to determine which would be the most suitable for S. enterica. This study showed that the Phostag Enrich Phosphoprotein kit (PerkinElmer) gave the highest yield, the majority of which were phosphoproteins. These studies also showed that western blots using phospho-specific antibodies were more sensitive than phosphoprotein-specific fluorescent stain ProQ Diamond in detecting phosphoproteins. The phosphoproteome profile of S. typhimurium cells grown under Cpx activating conditions included phosphoproteins involved in the heat shock response, cellular metabolism and protein synthesis. This work also identified changes in the phosphoproteome that were dependent upon the presence or absence of RdoA. Phosphoproteins that showed a significant change in phosphorylation were identified by mass spectroscopy using peptide mass fingerprinting. Proteins identified included protein foldases (DnaK and GroEL), proteins involved in metabolism (glycerol kinase, enolase and E1 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), and in protein synthesis (elongation factor-Tu). These proteins may be phosphorylated in an RdoA-dependent manner to allow normal cell functioning under envelope stress. Several proteins unlikely to be phosphoproteins were also RdoA-dependent. SrgA, encoded on the virulence plasmid, is a disulfide oxidoreductase specific for the PEF fimbriae that was shown to be repressed by RdoA. This work also showed that integration host factor, previously suggested to be an RdoA target, was not affected in terms of expression or phosphorylation by RdoA. The several RdoA-dependent changes in protein expression levels and phosphorylation that were identified contribute to the elucidation of RdoA’s role in the envelope stress response and provided further insight in determining RdoA target(s).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates the performance of a hybrid turboexpander and fuel cell (HTEFC) system for power recovery at natural gas pressure reduction stations. Simulations were created to predict the performance of various system configurations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Natural gas is transported at high pressure across large distances. The pressure of the natural gas must be reduced before it is delivered to the consumer. Natural gas pressure reduction is typically achieved using pressure reduction throttling valves.  In a limited number of cases pressure reduction is achieved using a turboexpander. This method has the added bonus of power generation. There is a considerable temperature drop associated with the turboexpander process. Preheating is required in many cases to avoid undesirable effects of a low outlet temperature. This preheating is typically done using gas fired boilers. The hybrid system developed by Enbridge and Fuel Cell Energy is a new approach to this problem. In this system a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) running on natural gas is used in conjunction with the turbine to preheat the gas and provide additional low emission electrical power&#xD;
&#xD;
Various system configurations were simulated and factors affecting the overall performance of the systems were investigated. Power outputs, fuel requirements and efficiencies of various system configurations were found using typical gas flow variation data. The simulation was performed using input data from the current city gate pressure reduction station operated by Utilities Kingston. Using the data provided by Utilities Kingston the performance of various potential HTEFC system configurations were compared. This thesis illustrates the benefits of using this type of analysis in a feasibility study of future HTEFC systems for power recovery at natural gas pressure reduction stations. Improvements could be made to the accuracy of the simulation results by increasing the complexity of the individual component models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the relationship between partner aggression enacted against women and victims’ work withdrawal, as well as to investigate the possible moderators of this relationship. To accomplish this, I conducted three studies. The first two studies examined the effects of partner aggression on work withdrawal (i.e., cognitive distraction, neglect, partial absenteeism, frequency of absenteeism, and turnover intentions). The third study examined potential moderators (i.e., supervisor support, coworker support, mental respite, financial need, and partner interference in employment) of the relationship between partner aggression and work withdrawal. &#xD;
In the first study, full-time, post secondary female students in dating relationships (N = 122) reported on psychological aggression, school withdrawal, and performance (i.e., course grades). Multiple regression analyses showed that experiencing psychological aggression from one’s partner is related to cognitive distraction at school, school neglect, and grades but is not related to partial absenteeism, frequency of absenteeism, or thoughts of quitting school. &#xD;
In the second study, physically abused women (abused group; n = 19) were compared with maritally discordant, nonabused women (discordant-only group; n = 12) and a control group of maritally satisfied, nonabused women (control group; n = 19). Abused women reported significantly more cognitive distraction and job neglect compared to women in the control group. They also reported significantly more job neglect compared to women in the discordant-only group; women in the latter group reported more cognitive distraction compared to women in the control group. There were no differences among the groups in partial absenteeism, frequency of absenteeism, or thoughts of quitting work. &#xD;
In the final study, data were collected from a sample of 242 employed women who reported on physical aggression and employment withdrawal. The results revealed that supervisor support buffers the impact of physical aggression on frequency of absenteeism, and partner interference in employment exacerbates the impact of physical aggression on frequency of absenteeism. No other significant interactions were found. I conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of these results, as well as potential directions for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation describes and analyzes the work of the Supreme Court of Canada, emphasizing its internal environment and processes, while situating the institution in its broader governmental and societal context. In addition, it offers an assessment of the behavioural and rational choice models of judicial decision making, which tend to portray judges as primarily motivated by their ideologically-based policy preferences. The dissertation adopts a historical institutionalist approach to demonstrate that judicial decision making is far more complex than is depicted by the dominant approaches within the political science literature. Drawing extensively on 28 research interviews with current and former justices, former law clerks and other staff members, the analysis traces the development of the Court into a full-fledged policy-making institution, particularly under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. &#xD;
This analysis presents new empirical evidence regarding not only the various stages of the Court’s decision-making process but the justices’ views on a host of considerations ranging from questions of collegiality (how the justices should work together) to their involvement in controversial and complex social policy matters and their relationship with the other branches of government. These insights are important because they increase our understanding of how the Court operates as one of the country’s more important policy-making institutions. The findings have significant implications for debates over judicial activism and the relationship between courts and the other branches of government when dealing with the Charter. The project also concludes that the justices’ role perceptions – the ideas, norms and rules that govern their role as judges and that of the institution – both shape and constrain their decision making behaviour. Understanding judicial behaviour with a focus on role perceptions allows for bridge-building between the competing explanations of judicial decision making and for theory-building in the broader judicial politics literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability to control the output for a given input is an important feature of neurons as it allows them to respond to a multitude of inputs via the production of a scalable output.  Using compartmental models of morphologically accurate reconstructions of feline spinal motoneurons, we examined the ability for motoneurons of the feline spinal cord to alter their input-output properties via the variable activation of persistent inward currents (PICs) due to L-type Ca2+ channels located in hotspots on their dendrites. Traditionally, the activation of PICs is thought to be a threshold-dependent event reliant on the response of hotspots of these channels to a depolarization beyond a specific local voltage. Converse to this belief, we have found that the response of spinal motoneuron PICs is not exclusively voltage-dependent but is also reliant on time-varying fluctuations in membrane potential (noise). Moreover, we show that the activation of PICs in motoneurons is dependent on the location of these dendritic hotspots, which is correlated with cell size. Small motoneurons exhibited delayed activation in response to time-varying input and large motoneurons exhibited no change. The activity of the models was measured via discharge frequency which was due to the activation of dendritically located synapses either firing in a time-averaged (tonic) manner or a Poisson-distributed spike train (transient) with the same overall conductance and distribution as the tonic synapses. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for the activation characteristics of PICs in motoneurons and, in turn, the ability for the neuron to intrinsically alter its input-output properties.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Assumption of the Virgin Mary has been regarded as a normative subject of post-Tridentine altarpiece production. Yet it is actually a complex pictorial allegory that comments upon an archaic tradition of Christian narratives and its intersection with Marian devotion. The Assumption of the Virgin Mary belongs to a tradition of devotional images in which the Eucharistic meaning is the preferred means for furthering narrative ideas. The deeper meaning of the Assumption altarpiece becomes apparent in the light of the following points, demonstrated repeatedly throughout the study: 1) altarpieces of the Assumption represent a Marian subject informed by narrative liberty, not views of iconography and Tridentine history 2) their imagery is largely based upon visual narratives associated with the historical imagination of the painter 3) they disallow the pre-eminence of the classical model and incorporate other models derived from a resemblance to Byzantine icons and Northern prints 4) they are analogous to icons, essays praising truthfulness and inwardness which operate to convey complex pictorial ideas in narrative adaptations. &#xD;
The first chapter evaluates the narrative source of El Greco’s altarpieces from Toledo. The medieval past of Toledo fused with the Byzantine tradition in an altarpiece form for which parallels are rare in the modern age. The second chapter examines Annibale Carracci’s main Assumption altarpieces and a selection of related paintings. For Annibale Carracci, the original setting at the high altar safeguards the Eucharistic meaning of his Assumption narrative and in turn shapes the narrative link with the adjoining altarpieces. The third chapter involves the Northern devotional print as a narrative outset of Federico Zuccari’s and Rubens’ altarpieces. Their narrative solutions negotiate complex pictorial allegories and further the claim for truthfulness of representation inherent in the print.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Padthaway Ridge is overlain by a thin veneer (&lt; 20 m) of Oligo-Miocene bioclastic carbonates representing the southern most extent of the Mannum Formation, Murray Supergroup, and Murray Basin limestones.  The Mannum Formation is composed of warm-temperate carbonates rich in irregular echinoids, coralline algae, benthic foraminifers, and relict particles.  The respective lithology are mostly structureless, burrow-mottled, and cross-cut by Thalassinoides burrows.  These sediments are interpreted to have resulted from carbonate production along shallow, illuminated seafloors under high mesotrophic conditions.  The composition and texture is similar to that of modern temperate seagrass accumulations with the exception of the abundant mobile infauna and bioturbation, which are more akin to associated intercalated and adjacent barren sands.  The Mannum Formation is therefore interpreted as an amalgamation of these two environments.  &#xD;
	The ubiquitous relict grains and Fe-stained cements in the lithologies of the Mannum Formation are thought to be the product of Fe redox pumping within the subsurface of seagrass meadows, whereby consolidated sediments endured prolonged and repeated exposure to juxtaposed destructive and constructive diagenetic conditions at the redox boundary.  Fluctuations in the organic carbon and oxygen influx to the subsurface are primarily a function of auto- and allogenic controls on seagrass density (i.e. turbidity, light, depth, hydrodynamics).   &#xD;
	The overlying Glenforslan Formation is interpreted as a seagrass-influenced deposit that accumulated under warm-temperate, low mesotrophic conditions and more rapid rates of sedimentation.   Relict grains, however, are absent from the Glenforslan Formation.  The subtle  change in trophic resources is thought to have caused a significant shift in primary and secondary production, from organic carbon- to carbonate-dominated.  &#xD;
	Assessment of previously described temperate seagrass facies together with this research comprise reliable criteria for identification of temperate seagrass depositional settings.  The signal of multigenerational accumulation, especially prominent in the Mannum Formation,  represents an amalgamation of environments that would be difficult to assess in modern settings.  The key attributes of temperate grass facies proposed herein allow for more accurate reevaluation of seagrass influenced, and relict rich lithologies in the rock record.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Cellulitis is a common skin and soft-tissue infection that often recurs in some patients. Patients with presenting comorbid conditions may require hospitalization which increases the cost of treatment.  However, little is known about comorbid conditions as determinants for a patient’s hospital length-of-stay. &#xD;
Objective: 1) To profile the characteristics of patients admitted to Ontario hospitals with a diagnosis of cellulitis according to key demographic, clinical and geographic factors; 2) To examine, among patients hospitalized with cellulitis, comorbidities as possible determinants of hospital length-of-stay.  &#xD;
Methods:   A retrospective cohort of 7863 patients was identified from the Discharge Abstract Database from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2008.  The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to measure patients’ comorbidities.  Univariate analyses were performed to describe the study population.  The chi-square test was used to assess the association between categorical variables.  The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and log-rank test were used to estimate and to test the difference in the distributions of hospital lengths-of-stay between patients with and without comorbidities.  Cox regression modeling was used to estimate the comorbidities’ effect on hospital length-of-stay while adjusting for confounding factors.  The restricted means of lengths-of-stay were given to estimate and compare the average duration of hospitalization.  The effects of specific Charlson comorbidities on hospital length-of-stay were similarly investigated.        &#xD;
Results:  Forty-six percent (3588/7863) of patients were diagnosed with Charlson comorbidities.  Those patients were significantly older (p&lt;.0001), and more likely to be female (p=.006) and to have lower limb cellulitis (p&lt;.001) and C. difficile infections (p&lt;.0001), compared to patients without comorbidities.  Patients with comorbidities stayed significantly longer in hospital (8.0 vs. 5.3 days, p&lt;.0001).  Comorbidities independently decreased the instantaneous discharge rate by 37% (95% CI, 34% to 40%, p&lt;.001).  Hospital lengths-of-stay increased with increasing index of comorbidity.  The means of hospital lengths-of-stay for patients with a cumulative index of 1, 2, 3, and 4 (or more than 4) were 7.4, 7.6, 8.8, and 9.7 days, respectively.  &#xD;
Conclusion:  The Charlson Comorbidity Index is predictive of longer hospital lengths-of-stay in adult patients diagnosed with cellulitis and may be a useful tool in the decision-making process during clinical management of these patients.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is widely expressed in neuroendocrine tissues and is essential for embryonic development of the kidney and enteric nervous system.  Mutations leading to constitutive activation of the RET protein underlie various tumours of endocrine tissues.  Conversely, loss-of-function mutations of RET lead to Hirschsprung disease, a congenital disorder characterized by a loss of enteric neurons throughout the colon and small intestine.  &#xD;
Intracellular trafficking of RTKs through multiple cellular compartments has been shown to impact on downstream signalling.  To date, the intracellular trafficking of RET has not been investigated.  Here, we show that RET is rapidly internalized after activation and that trafficking to cytoplasmic endosomes plays an important role in downstream signalling. &#xD;
RET is alternatively spliced into multiple isoforms that are co-expressed in cells; therefore, we further investigated RET internalization in an isoform-specific context. This study revealed a number of differences between RET isoforms including differences in sub-cellular localization pre-activation, rate of internalization, and ability to recycle to the plasma membrane.  Differential trafficking of RET isoforms alter their downstream signalling properties, providing an additional mechanism to explain the distinct contributions of RET isoforms to cellular processes.&#xD;
Finally, we investigated the impact of altered sub-cellular localization in the context of thyroid carcinoma.  Activation of RET has been implicated in a number of thyroid tumours that differ in their inherent oncogenicity.  We observed that altered subcellular localization of oncogenic forms of RET, RET/PTCs, enhance their oncogenicity.  Interestingly, RET/PTC tumours are indolent and rarely metastasize compared to other RET-mediated forms of cancer.  Further investigation revealed that RET/PTC oncogenes are expressed off relatively weak promoters, resulting in quantitatively less RET/PTC oncoprotein expression in these tumours compared to mutant RET expression in more aggressive cancers.&#xD;
Together, our results represent the first in-depth study of the trafficking properties of RET and indicate the importance of proper sub-cellular localization and trafficking in the maintenance of normal cell metabolism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is evidence from family studies for the importance of genetic factors in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) but the identification of major genes has not been achieved to date. There are several reports of deletions and duplications in individuals with ASDs, some of which are not unique to an individual. In most cases, the frequencies and relevance of these abnormalities are unknown, as they have been identified serendipitously in one or a few individuals. My overall hypothesis was that such rearrangements would facilitate the identification of “culprit” genes associated with ASDs by identifying a small chromosomal region for candidate gene testing. I molecularly characterized two overlapping 2p15-2p16.1 deletions detected in unrelated individuals with confirmed autistic disorder (Subject 1) or autistic features (Subject 2), a 1.4Mb deletion on chromosome Xp22 (Subject 1) and a duplication of chromosome 7q11.23, reciprocal to the Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) deletion, in one individual with an ASD (Subject 3). Using real-time semi-quantitative PCR, I screened a total of 798 individuals with an ASD and 186 healthy controls for the presence of similar abnormalities. No additional cases were identified in either group. Subsequently, I selected 6 genes [Orthodenticle homolog 1 (OTX1), Variable charge, X-linked (VCX), Neuroligin 4, X-linked (NLGN4X), Syntaxin 1A (STX1A), Cytoplasmic linker 2 (CYLN2) and General transcription factor IIi (GTF2i)], based on their function and localization within or in the vicinity of the rearrangements and tested them for association with ASDs. Although there was no evidence for association for any marker or haplotype in most of the genes tested, this was not so for GTF2i. Haplotype transmission disequilibrium testing revealed an increased transmission, from healthy parents to their affected offspring, of the common alleles of one marker and one haplotype in GTF2i (P = 0.0010 and 0.0005, respectively). This gene encodes a brain-expressed transcription factor previously implicated in the mental retardation associated with WBS. Based on these findings, I propose that, although the genomic rearrangements reported herein are not a common cause of ASDs, the GTF2i gene within the WBS critical region is important in the aetiology of autism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores three questions in empirical public economics: we investigate the impact of social networks on labour market outcomes in the first essay; we explore the determinants of volunteering behaviour and estimate the effect of employment on volunteering in the second essay; and we examine the impact of political and fiscal decentralization on public provision in the third essay. In each case, we provide consistent estimates by utilizing an exogenous source of variation in key economic outcomes introduced by randomized policy experiments in the first two essays and by a natural experiment in the third essay. In the first essay, we find that among social networks, weak ties have a significant effect on labour market outcomes but strong ties do not have. In the second essay, we find that employment has a significant effect on volunteering behaviour, and that the effect varies in different contexts and depends on the precise channels through which the two are connected. In the final essay, we find that decentralization has a big effect on public provision. But we also find that decentralization affects different public goods differently, and that the key to its impact lies in the incentives facing politicians at the local level.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Orthopaedic reconstruction often involves the surgical introduction of structural implants that provide for rigid fixation, skeletal stabilization, and bone integration. The high stresses incurred by these implanted devices have historically limited material choices to metallic and select polymeric formulations. While mechanical requirements are achieved, these non-degradable materials do not participate actively in the remodeling of the skeleton and present the possibility of long-term failure or rejection. This is particularly relevant in cervical fusion, an orthopaedic procedure to treat damaged, degenerative or diseased intervertebral discs. A significant improvement on the available synthetic bone replacement/regeneration options for implants to treat these conditions in the cervical spine may be achieved with the development of primarily mineral biocomposites comprised of a bioactive ceramic matrix reinforced with a biodegradable polymer. Such a biocomposite may be engineered to possess the clinically required mechanical properties of a particular application, while maintaining the ability to be remodeled completely by the body. A biocomposite of Si-doped calcium phosphate (Si-CaP) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was developed for application as such a synthetic bone material for potential use as a fusion device in the cervical spine. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, a method by which high mineral content Si-CaP/PCL biocomposites with interpenetrating matrices of mineral and polymer phases may be prepared will be demonstrated, in addition to the effects of the various preparation parameters on the biocomposite density, porosity and mechanical properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
This new technique by which dense, primarily ceramic Si-CaP/PCL biocomposites were prepared, allowed for the incorporation of mineral contents ranging between 45-97vol%. Polymer infiltration, accomplished solely by passive capillary uptake over several days, was found to be capable of fully infiltrating the microporosity of the sintered calcium phosphate ceramic. After infiltration, these biocomposite materials demonstrated an increase in compressive strength, flexural strength and Young’s modulus with increasing ceramic content and met design targets for use as a cervical fusion prosthesis. The biocomposite was amenable to shaping and drilling and was found to maintain its strength after 30 days immersion in Earle’s Balanced Salt.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The political significance of portraits of Charlotte of Saxe Coburg Gotha (1840-&#xD;
1927) has been obscured by her historical liminality and by romantic myths that have&#xD;
prevailed since the late nineteenth century and influenced interpretations of her visual&#xD;
representations. This thesis reassembles a wide range of images of Charlotte and&#xD;
analyzes these as sequential representations of an individual participating, across diverse&#xD;
cultures, in defining episodes of the nineteenth century. Strategies of allegory,&#xD;
programmatic intertextuality, and revisionism are revealed when these images are read&#xD;
within their political circumstances of production and complicate the dominance of a few&#xD;
late, iconic portraits of Charlotte and their entrenched associations. The use of costume,&#xD;
essential in certain portraits commissioned during Charlotte’s childhood in Belgium, is&#xD;
revisited in images depicting her during a brief position as Vicereine of Lombardy-&#xD;
Venetia and in another dating from her role - of equal brevity but indelible historical&#xD;
resonance - as Empress of Mexico. The significance of dress is explored in relation to&#xD;
agency and political influence and as demonstrating compliance with, or negotiation of,&#xD;
gender conventions. Charlotte’s public life was abruptly terminated upon her 1866 return&#xD;
to Europe by a diagnosis of ‘madness.’ Napoleon III was withdrawing troops supporting&#xD;
the Mexican Empire and her journey was made seeking to reverse this decision. I&#xD;
speculate a painting by French artist Edouard Manet allegorically records this episode of&#xD;
Charlotte’s life and that other factors relating to this episode subsequently influenced the&#xD;
erasure of her imperial images until their reappearance in the twentieth century.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) have been investigated as the basis for a new type of liquid crystal display because of their fast switching times. Commercial FLC materials are mixtures consisting of a small amount of chiral dopant in an achiral liquid crystal host with an isotropic-nematic-smectic A-smectic C (INAC) phase sequence, which is required to achieve proper alignment between glass slides with rubbed polyimide alignment layers. However, the layer contraction occurring at the SmA-SmC phase transition on cooling from isotropic liquid is a severe problem that leads to a buckling of the smectic layers and results in zigzag defects that drastically degrade the optical quality of FLC films. To solve this problem, we are focusing on a new class of liquid crystal molecules with minimal or no smectic layer shrinkage at the SmA-SmC transition which is referred to as ‘de Vries-like.’&#xD;
Previous work in the Lemieux group has shown that combining structural elements promoting SmA and SmC phases in a single molecule increases de Vries-like behavior. Giesselmann et. al. suggest that a correlation exists between the temperature range of the SmA phase and de Vries-like behavior. In the study described herein, two homologous series of molecules with 2-phenylpyrimidine cores with siloxane-terminated side-chain (SmC promoting element) and a chloro-terminated side-chain (SmA promoting element)are synthesized and characterized by polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXS). The reduction factor R for series 1.13 from 0.36 to 0.46 and for series 1.14 from 0.47 to 0.54. Results show that, although there is some correlation between % layer contraction and SmA temperature range, it can be explained primarily by differences in tilt angle θ. When θ is taken into account in the&#xD;
R values, there is no correlation.&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Code clones are duplicated code fragments that are copied to re-use functionality and speed up development. However, due to the duplicate nature of code clones, inconsistent updates can lead to bugs in the software system.  Existing research investigates the inconsistent updates through analysis of the updates to code clones and the bug fixes used to fix the inconsistent updates. We extend the work by investigating other factors that affect clone evolution, such as the number of developers. &#xD;
&#xD;
On two levels of analysis, the method and clone class level, we conduct an empirical study on clone evolution. We analyze the factors affecting bug fixes and co-change (i.e. update cloned methods at the same time) using our new metrics. Our metrics are related to the developers, code complexity, and stages of development. We use these metrics to find ways to improve the maintenance of cloned code. We discover that one way to improve maintenance of code clones is the decrease of code complexity. We find that increased code complexity leads to a decrease in co-change, which can lead to bugs in the software. &#xD;
&#xD;
We perform our study on 6 applications. To maximize the number of clones detected, we use two existing code clone detection tools: SimScan and Simian. SimScan was used to find clones in 5 of the applications due to its versatility in finding code clones. Simian was used to detect clones due to its reliability to find code clones regardless of language or compilation problems. To analyze and determine the significance of the metrics, we use the R Statistical Toolkit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the concept of moral breakdown in Auschwitz to consider what happens to the virtues under extreme circumstances.  The method of exploration applies Alasdair MacIntyre’s virtue theory to the moral experience of Auschwitz inmates.  The application of his theory to the moral landscape of Auschwitz sheds light on the ability of MacIntyre’s virtue ethical approach to make sense of extreme circumstances in terms of his account of the minimal conditions required for the moral life.  I argue that MacIntyre’s account of narrative moral agency as fundamental to the intelligibility of moral life passes the limit test of Auschwitz experience by showing that the intelligibility of moral life is called into question when the narrative nature of moral agency is seriously interrupted and fragmented.  As such, he offers good conceptual resources for understanding the demoralization Auschwitz inmates faced.  This is so because he emphasizes the manner in which any moral theory must be capable of social embodiment, and he takes seriously the notion that every social situation reflects a set of moral standards that can be articulated theoretically.  This allows MacIntyre to spell out the moral theory embodied in the moral landscape of Auschwitz and to judge it deficient in terms of his conceptual framework of a core conception of the virtues.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation investigates the impacts of constraints on optimal government policy.  The first two chapters provide a general introduction and review of the literature. Chapters three and four analyze education spending and institutional structure in an economy with informational asymmetries and employment matching frictions. The fifth investigates the impact of politics on government decisions over taxation and spending programs more generally.&#xD;
Chapter three analyzes the situation where governments can target education funds to specific observable groups (referred to as low and high productivity neighbourhoods/regions). The results suggest that it may be optimal to employ educational transfers, rather than cash transfers amongst individuals, to achieve social welfare objectives.  This is because the former can reduce distortions created by the tax system.  However,  the value of educational spending in mitigating these information frictions may not be that large, and may in fact exacerbate such distortions.  This suggests that an optimal education policy may be more regressive when there is a distortionary tax system in place.  Further, we show that even if ``equalizing opportunities'' is deemed optimal in the static problem, it may not be a reasonable policy goal when we extend the analysis to include dynamics.&#xD;
Chapter four is joint work with Afrasiab Mirza.  We analyze an economy where heterogeneous individuals are uncertain about their endowments. The education system trades off the desire to capitalize on talent through specific skills training with the need to provide individuals with opportunities to learn about&#xD;
their career preferences through a broader education. The results consider the implications of various educational institutions for the income distribution and consequently welfare.&#xD;
Chapter five analyzes the dynamics of public spending, taxation and debt in a political agency model. Choices are made by short-lived politicians who can be only partially controlled through the electoral process. The main focus is to consider the impacts of binding limits on the public budget.  The value of imposing this additional friction depends both on the extent to which politicians' goals deviate from their  constituencies and how effectively the electoral process disciplines them when they misbehave. The results also suggest that the value of such a restriction depends on the fiscal position at the time in which it is imposed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is hard to imagine the modern world without wireless communication. Wireless&#xD;
networks are, however, challenging inasmuch as they are useful. Because of their&#xD;
complexity, wireless networks have introduced a myriad of new problems into the field of algorithms. To tackle the new computational challenges, specific models have been devised to suit wireless networks. Most remarkably, wireless networks can be modelled as geometric graphs. This allows us to address problems in wireless networks using tools from the fields of graph theory, graph algorithms, and computational geometry.&#xD;
Our results have applications to routing, coverage detection, data collection, and fault recovery, among other issues in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
To be more specific, we investigate three major problems: a geometric approach to&#xD;
fault recovery; the distributed computation of Voronoi diagrams; and finding Hamiltonian cycles in hexagonal networks. Our geometric approach to fault recovery has been experimentally proved superior to an existing combinatorial approach. The distributed algorithm we propose for computing Voronoi diagrams of networks is the&#xD;
first non-trivial algorithm that has been proved to perform this task correctly; its efficiency has been demonstrated through simulations. Regarding the Hamiltonian&#xD;
cycle problem of hexagonal networks, we have advanced this topic by providing conditions for the existence of such a cycle, in addition to new insight on its complexity for&#xD;
the "solid" hexagonal grid case. Although we present satisfying solutions to several&#xD;
of the addressed problems, plenty is left to be done. In this regard, we identify a set&#xD;
of open problems that will be subject of research for years to come.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Amiodarone (AM) is a potent antidysrhythmic agent which can cause potentially life-threatening pulmonary fibrosis, and N-desethylamiodarone (DEA) is a metabolite of AM that may contribute to the toxicity of AM in vivo.  Recent evidence has implicated the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the initiation and progression of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.  &#xD;
In cultured HPL1A human peripheral lung epithelial cells, we found AM to be converted to DEA minimally (&lt; 2%) after 24 h of incubation, indicating that the HPL1A cell culture model can be used to study the effects of AM and DEA independently.  Apoptotic cell death was assessed by annexin-V-FITC (ann-V) staining and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2’-deoxyuridine 5’-triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL), while necrotic cell death was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining.  The percentage of PI positive cells increased over six-fold after 24 h treatment with 20 μM AM (80.8%) compared to control (12.0%), and doubled after 24 h treatment with 3.5 μM DEA (20.4%) compared to control (10.8%).  The percentage of ann-V positive cells decreased from 8.26% (control) to 1.56% following 24 h treatment with 10 μM AM and more than doubled after 24 h incubation with 3.5 μM DEA (22.0%) compared to control (9.86%) (p&lt;0.05).  Treatment for 24 h with 5.0 μM DEA caused the percentage of TUNEL positive cells to increase from 4.21% (control) to 26.7% (p&lt;0.05).  Vitamin E (5 – 20 μM) did not protect against AM or DEA cytotoxicity, as determined by ann-V and PI dual staining.  &#xD;
Angiotensin II (100 pM – 1 μM) alone or in combination with AM or DEA did not alter cytotoxicity.  Furthermore, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril did not protect against AM or DEA cytotoxicity.  In conclusion, in vitro, AM activates primarily necrotic pathways, whereas DEA activates both necrotic and apoptotic pathways, and the RAS does not seem to be involved in AM or DEA cytotoxicity in HPL1A cells.  Multiple mechanisms may contribute to the initiation of lung damage observed clinically, due to actions of both AM and its metabolite DEA.  &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Spinal injections for back-pain management are frequently carried out in hospitals and radiological clinics. Currently, these procedures are performed under fluoroscopy or CT guidance in specialized interventional radiology facilities, and thus incur a major financial burden on the healthcare system. Additionally, the current practice exposes patients and surgeons to X-ray radiation.  The use of US for image guided navigation of the spine would greatly reduce the exposure of both the patient and the physician to ionizing radiation and allow the procedure to be performed outside of a specialized facility.  However, US as the sole guidance modality has its own challenges.  In particular, due to the significant level of occlusion in spinal US images, it can be difficult to accurately identify the appropriate injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here, a groupwise US to CT registration algorithm for guiding percutaneous spinal interventions is presented. In our registration methodology, each vertebra in CT is treated as a sub-volume and transformed individually. A biomechanical model is used to constrain the displacement of the vertebrae relative to one another. The sub-volumes are then reconstructed into a single volume. In each iteration of registration, an US image is simulated from the reconstructed CT volume and an intensity-based similarity metric with the real US image is calculated. Validation studies are performed on datasets from a lamb cadaver, five patient-based phantoms designed to preserve realistic curvatures of the spine and a sixth patient-based phantom where the curvature of the spine is changed between preoperative and intraoperative imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
For datasets where the spine curve between two imaging modalities was artificially perturbed, the proposed methodology was able to register initial misalignments of up to 20 mm with a success rate of 95%. For the phantom with a physical change in the curvature of the spine introduced between the US and CT datasets, the registration success rate was 98.5%. Finally, the registration success rate for the lamb cadaver with soft tissue information was 87%. The results demonstrate that our algorithm robustly registers US and CT datasets of the spine, regardless of a change in the patients pose between preoperative and intraoperative image acquisitions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The genomic integrity of a cell is constantly being pressured by both intrinsic and extrinsic forces.  Cell cycle checkpoints exist to protect the cells by arresting cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage or replication stress. It has been shown that the interaction between the checkpoint proteins Rad9A and TopBP1 is a crucial upstream event required for the ATR-dependent checkpoint response to DNA damage, which can be activated throughout different points in the cell cycle. The Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) technique has recently emerged as a simple and effective tool for analyzing protein-protein interactions in live cell cultures. By fusing complementary fragments of fluorescent proteins to proteins of interest, one can visualize protein-protein interactions through the formation of a mature fluorophore from these fragments. In the current work, the BiFC assay system was employed to study the interaction between TopBP1 and Rad9A; the human homologue of fission yeast Rad9. BiFC vectors expressing TopBP1, Rad9A, and the Rad9A-S387 mutant were constructed and optimized for transfection in HeLa cells. It was shown that the BiFC fusion protein of Rad9A lacked phosphorylation on its constitutive S387 site, although it retained its upstream damage dependent S272 phosphorylation after IR treatment. BiFC signals could be detected in cells containing the BiFC fusion proteins of Rad9A and TopBP1 using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry techniques. However, the signals could not be distinguished from that of the negative control samples. Our results suggest a possibility that our BiFC fusion proteins of interest interact in a non-specific manner, although further characterization is required to confirm this. The BiFC assay employed in this project must be further optimized to effectively study the interaction between Rad9A and TopBP1, as well as other checkpoint proteins. However, this study has given us great insight into the implementation of this new BiFC technique for studying protein interactions in the context of cell cycle proteins, and the knowledge gained from this study will be invaluable for future work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inflammatory bowel disease causes structural and functional alterations in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Since the onset of intestinal inflammation involves the activation of resident immune cells as well as rapid influx of infiltrating cells, we proposed that changes in the ENS are a result of the release of toxic inflammatory factors. We hypothesized that early damage to the ENS in inflammation is caused by harmful levels of nitric oxide (NO) generated by the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) found in immune cells. This was assessed in the 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-model of colitis in rats. Large increases in infiltrating granulocytes, particularly neutrophils and blood-derived monocytes were found in the muscularis layers adjacent to the ENS. A rapid increase in iNOS immunoreactivity in the muscularis regions during early stages of inflammation (6 – 24 hr) was observed. Whether high NO levels generated by chemical donors could be toxic to neurons was tested in a co-culture model of myenteric neurons, smooth muscle and glia enzymatically isolated from neonatal rats. Exposure of co-cultures to NO for 48 hr resulted in significant, concentration dependent decrease in neuron survival. &#xD;
We then developed a model that permitted the direct study of immune cell interactions with myenteric neurons. Myenteric neurons were co-cultured with activated peritoneal immune cells that expressed iNOS and generated high NO levels (49 + 6.2µM) for 48 hr. This caused significant neuronal death, reducing neuron number by 19 + 5%, and disruption of axons. Pre-treatment of immune cells with a selective iNOS-inhibitor, L-NIL resulted in neuron numbers that were not significantly different from control (96 + 2%) suggesting that NO played a central role in mediating the damaging effects of immune cells. Lastly, when direct contact between immune cells and neurons was prevented in the previous experiment through use of trans-wells, unanticipated neurotrophic effects were observed. Increased axon outgrowth (282 + 57%) was detected in addition to loss of the neurotoxic effects in spite of similar experimental conditions. We concluded that proximity and contact plays an important role in determining the nature of immune cell mediated alterations in enteric neurons.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The study of visually-guided reaching has been a meaningful tool to investigate sensory-motor coordination in typical development and different clinical paediatric populations. The aim of this study was to characterize the development of multi-joint reaching behaviour in children and youth, from 5 to 16 years of age, allowing us to capture changes that may occur into adolescence. &#xD;
Participants were 68 able-bodied children and youth, with no history of developmental, educational or social problems. A stratified recruitment strategy was used to adequately represent five age groups: I (5-6 years), II (7-8 years), III (9-10 years), IV (11-13 years) and V (14-16 years). A center-out reaching task was used as it allowed us to measure effects of limb mechanics during reaching. Different patterns of inter-segmental motions at the shoulder and elbow joints were needed to reach the different targets: flexion at both joints, extension at both joints, and a mixed-coordination pattern.  Children were asked to reach quickly and accurately to 8 targets located at 45 degree intervals around the perimeter of a circle with a 6 cm radius. &#xD;
The development of reaching was described using non-parametric statistics. The global features of path length and total movement decreased as a function of increasing age, with less variability observed in older participants (p&lt;0.05). This increased accuracy was explained by a significant reduction (p&lt;0.05) in distance and direction error of the first movement component of the reach, indicative of the increasing ability of children to accurately plan movements based on an internal representation of the limb. These older children were also able to respond to the visual target more quickly (p&lt;0.05). In general, initial direction errors and total movement time increased from a minimum for the 2-joint flexion coordination to a maximum for the mixed-coordination pattern. The magnitude of error, however, decreased as a function of age (p&lt;0.05), and in particular for the mixed-coordination pattern (p&lt;0.01). &#xD;
This center-out task is therefore considered to be responsive to observe effects of development and limb mechanics on performance. The established normative data set will provide a reference for the measures of performance in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Shneidman (1993) has theorized that psychache  (i.e., intolerable psychological pain) is the key cause of suicide, and accounts for the effect of all other psychological factors. Two studies are presented that test Shneidman’s theory, and compare the influence of psychache on suicidality relative to that of hopelessness. In the first study, a causal hypothesis was examined using a longitudinal design. Undergraduate students (N = 588) completed measures of psychache, hopelessness, and suicide ideation at two time points four months apart. Results supported the hypothesis that psychache has a causal role in suicidality, as change in suicide ideation was predicted by change in psychache. However, the hypothesis that psychache would fully mediate the effect of hopelessness was not supported, as only a small and partial mediation effect was evidenced, and change in hopelessness also contributed unique variance to the prediction of suicide ideation. In a second study, the hypotheses that psychache is necessary and sufficient for suicide were examined. Undergraduate students (N = 1,333) were prescreened for high and low levels of psychache and hopelessness, and those who met cutoff criteria (N = 184) were selected to make up four groups with combinations of these constructs. Groups were compared with respect to various measures of suicide ideation, motivations, and behaviours using one-way multivariate analyses of variance. In general, dependent measures significantly differed by level of psychache, but not by level of hopelessness. This pattern of group differences supported the hypothesis that psychache is necessary for suicide. However, the claim that psychache is sufficient was not consistently supported, as some suicide criteria were significantly elevated only for groups exhibiting high levels of both psychache and hopelessness. Taken together, the results of this dissertation provide strong support for the key role of psychache in suicide and its parity with hopelessness as a statistical predictor of suicidality. These findings improve understanding of the suicidal state of mind, and have important implications for clinical practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An understanding of individual cognitions that influence both behavioural intentions and the enactment of actual behaviours is provided by the conceptual model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This study used the Theory of Planned Behaviour, with the added variable of perceived risk, to predict Kenyan students’ intention to use HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) centres within the country. We conducted a survey questionnaire with 200 students, aged 13-15 years, within high schools in the Nairobi and Nakuru districts in May 2009. Chi-squared analysis showed no relationships between age, school, school level, knowledge of a VCT centre, or past sexual experience with intention to uptake HIV counselling and testing. Pearson product-moment analysis revealed a small positive correlation between attitude and subjective norm and a medium negative correlation between perceived behavioural control and perceived risk. One-way analysis of variance showed a relationship between perceived behavioural control and intention. Results of block entry logistic regression analysis indicate that perceived behavioural control and perceived risk were significant predictors of intention to use VCT services in the TPB model. The present study suggests that Kenyan teens’ perceived ease/difficulty in performing a specific behaviour is the most influential aspect in predicting their subsequent intention to carry through the behaviour. A theory-based intervention program should focus on reducing practical barriers related to the use of VCT services.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The workplace provides a setting to offer health promotion interventions to a large proportion of adults.  Given the high rates of obesity and chronic disease among this population, it is of public health importance to provide and evaluate these interventions.&#xD;
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to pilot an evaluation of the Motiv8 Workplace Series (MWS) using the RE-AIM framework.  The objectives of this study were 1) to provide measures of adoption, reach, and implementation of the MWS, 2) to provide estimates of the effectiveness of the MWS in changing physical activity and healthy eating behaviours, and in changing theoretical variables from the social cognitive theory and the health action process approach, and 3) to use the data to investigate the role of theoretical variables as mediators in changing these health behaviours.  &#xD;
Methods: This pilot study used a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design.  The study population consisted of employees aged 18 and older, living in Kingston and surrounding area.  The study investigated 1) the participation rate and representativeness of participating workplaces (adoption), 2) the participation rate and representativeness of employees participating in the MWS (reach), 3) the extent to which the MWS was implemented as intended (implementation), and 4) the impact of the MWS on participants through measures of behavioural outcomes (effectiveness).  A questionnaire was administered at baseline and 1-week follow-up.  &#xD;
Results: Objective 1.  The participation rate was low among workplaces.  Participating and non-participating workplaces were similar with respect to all characteristics except past public health programming.  There was also a low rate of participation among employees.  Participants did not appear to be representative of all workplace employees.  Objective 2.  There was a significant difference in healthy eating (p&lt;.05), but no significant difference in physical activity (p&gt;.05) between participants in the intervention and comparison groups at follow-up.  Objective 3.  There was evidence for action planning as a partial mediator of the relationship between the intervention and healthy eating.    &#xD;
Conclusions: The preliminary findings from this evaluation suggest that the MWS had moderately low reach and adoption, good program implementation, and was effective at changing eating behaviour among employed adults.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The versatility of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices stems from the accessibility of the propagation path to modification and detection. This has led to the integration of SAWs in a variety of novel fields, including quantum information processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The development of technologically competitive devices requires the use of gigahertz frequency SAWs. This thesis develops fabrication processes for high frequency interdigital transducers on gallium arsenide. Optically lithography was used to create linear and stepped transducers, with a minimum feature size of 2 um, that were driven at their fifth harmonic. The highest frequency achieved was 1435 MHz, but the power absorbed was less than 3% and insertion losses were greater than -80 dB. Further improvements in the design and fabrication are required if optically fabricated transducers are to be an alternative to transducers with narrower finger widths. Electron-beam lithography techniques were developed and used to create transducers with finger widths of 500 and 400 nm, with fundamental resonance frequencies of 1387 and 1744 MHz, respectively. The power absorbed was 3 to 6% with insertion losses greater than -45 dB. The performance characteristics can be improved by the removal of residual resist on the surface of the transducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
An indispensable tool for the characterization of one-port transducers is an all optical probe to measure the displacement field of a SAW. This work details the design and construction of a scanning Sagnac interferometer, that is capable of measuring the outward displacement of a surface. The spatial resolution of the interferometer was 2.4 +/- 0.2 um and the displacement sensitivity was determined to be 4 +/- 1 pm. The instrument was used to map the SAW displacement field from a 358 MHz transducer, with results showing the resonant cavity behaviour of the fingers due to Bragg reflections. It also allowed for the direct detection of the SAW amplitude as a function of the driving frequency of the transducer. The results showed good agreement with the related S21 scattering parameter. Lastly, the interferometer was used to image the attenuated propagation of SAWs through a phononic crystal. Results showed good agreement with theoretical simulations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the interest in spiritualism of Canada’s tenth Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King. By placing King’s engagement with spiritualism within the context of recent historiography on spiritualism as a progressive form of religion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, this research demonstrates that spiritualism was not a pseudo-religion or parlour game but rather, a religious practice meaningful to King both as a component of his faith and his intellectual pursuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
Within the context of this thesis, spiritualism is treated as a lived religion. Based on the research of Robert Orsi and David D. Hall, whose contention is that religion comes into existence only in a dynamic relationship with the realities of everyday life, particular attention is paid to those parts of King’s world that serve as the building blocks for his first encounters with spiritualism. &#xD;
&#xD;
This research demonstrates that while King remained skeptical of spiritualist claims until later in his life, his eventual acceptance of spiritualism was the result of several factors. Though the deaths within his immediate family in the early 1900s served as a catalyst for King’s desire to seek spirit contact, it was his reading and involvement in social Christianity as early as 1891, when he began his studies at the University of Toronto that provided the scaffolding for King’s incorporation of spiritualism into his later life. It is argued that, ultimately, King’s goals remained consistent throughout his personal evolution: to lead a Christian life in service to the less fortunate and to the people of Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Acquiring knowledge of the morphological, molecular, and functional changes that occur to neurons following axotomy is a key step for a comprehensive understanding of the nervous system and how it reacts to injury. Propriospinal commissural interneurons (PCIs or CINs) are a class of neuron with axons that project through the ventral commissure to the contralateral spinal cord. My goal was to examine the morphological, molecular, and functional changes that occur to adult feline PCIs following a proximal axotomy.&#xD;
	We first determined whether proximally axotomized PCIs develop de novo axons from their dendrites. C3 PCIs were proximally axotomized and several weeks later we stained PCIs and prepared the tissue for histological evaluation. Two primary classes of axotomized PCI were identified: those with a very short axon (called permanently axotomized) and those with an axon that projected across the injury site. Permanently axotomized PCIs had processes with morphological features typical of axons that emerged from their distal dendrites. These axonal processes of the distal dendrites also had GAP-43 (an axonal marker) and lacked MAP2a/b (a dendritic marker). We concluded that permanently axotomized PCIs develop de novo axons from distal dendrites.&#xD;
	We then determined whether the axons that crossed the lesion site were representative of spontaneous functional regeneration. First, we showed that PCI axons regenerate through an environment that is typically highly inhibitory to regenerating axons. Second, we established that the regenerated axons conduct action potentials. Finally, we found that regenerated PCI axons form functional synaptic connections with neurons in the contralateral spinal cord. Collectively, these data indicated that spinal interneurons are capable of spontaneous functional regeneration through an injured spinal cord. &#xD;
	PCI growth cones are complex and unlike growth cones previously described in the literature. The final study of the thesis examines the morphologies of PCI growth cones within spinal cord injury sites. We found that PCI growth cones have a wide range of morphologies that is independent of their location within the lesion site. &#xD;
	 Taken together, these data indicate that PCIs have a remarkable capacity for axonal elongation and contribute to remodelling of spinal circuitry following spinal injury.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Theoretical investigation of the dynamics of adiabatic quantum mechanics in two different, highly polar systems has been made. The systems were chosen for their&#xD;
fundamental scientific interest, as they represent atoms and molecules with exaggerated properties, as well as ease of experimental study as such highly polar systems are easier to manipulate using readily-available electric fields. A model two-level system is used to derive one approach for maximizing the probability of adiabatic passage through an avoided crossing and this is compared with the classic Landau-Zener result, and the commonly encountered spin-flip problem of a particle with spin located in a rotating magnetic field. This approach is applied to the avoided crossing between the n = 13, n1 − n2 = 11 (dipole moment of 532 D) and the n = 14, n1 − n2 = −12 (dipole moment of -657 D) highly polar Stark states of the lithium atom at 447 kV/m. Ion-pair formation from two neutral lithium atoms, one in the 2s ground state and the other in an excited state, is also investigated. The cross section σ(v) for free ion-pairs is calculated for the initial colliding pairs of atomic states located below the ion-pair threshold. Li(2s) + Li(3d) is seen to possess the largest cross section (σ(v0) = 569.2 a.u.) at its threshold velocity. The implications of this for bound ion-pair, i.e. heavy Rydberg system, production are briefly discussed. Furthermore, experimental progress towards the production of these atomic and molecular systems from a beam of lithium is presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the evolution of the bilateral Canadian-American continental air defence operational-level command and control relationship from the 1940 Ogdensburg Agreement to the establishment of the North American Air Defence Command (NORAD) in 1957.  It takes a functional approach, focusing on the efforts of Canadian air force officers in conjunction with their American counterparts to develop efficient command and control arrangements to ensure effective air defence of North America while at the same time safeguarding Canadian sovereignty.  It explores the evolution of certain command and control principles such as cooperation, unity of command, operational command, and operational control, and argues that because Canada was able to avoid having its air defence forces come under American command, Canadian sovereignty was assured.  It also demonstrates that the Canada-U.S. bilateral continental air defence command and control relationship had its origins in Canadian, American, and British joint command and control culture and practice.  Canadian steadfastness, along with compromise and accommodation between the two North American nations, operational and doctrinal factors, and also cordial professional working relationships and personalities, all played important roles in the evolution of this command and control relationship from the “cooperation-unity of command” paradigm of the Second World War towards “operational control” in an air defence context throughout the early Cold War.  This paradigm shift culminated in 1957 with the integration and centralization of combined air defences under an overall NORAD commander exercising operational control.  The thesis also demonstrates that by taking an active role in Canada-U.S. command and control arrangements, Canada was able to avoid a negative “defence against help” situation with the United States and ensure that it secured a proverbial “piece of the action” in the bilateral North American continental air defence mission.  Moreover, through this active functional approach, Canadian officers were able to safeguard Canadian sovereignty and at the same time perform an effective and important operational role in the combined efforts with the United States to defend the continent from aerial attack.  This dissertation therefore makes an important contribution to the study of command and control and the history of North American continental defence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mercury contamination is a global issue due to its neurotoxicity, and China is not an exception due to its increasing industrialization. Fish is of the most concern, in respect to human exposure to mercury, because fish accumulates methylmercury through food chain in aquatic systems. The province of Zhejiang is renowned for its cuisine that incorporates freshwater fish. Qiandao Lake, in Zheijang, was the site of a case study examining the link between the total mercury (THg) concentration in hair samples and fish consumption. A questionnaire survey and hair sampling were carried out on women of childbearing age (17-46 years) from a fishing town by Qiandao Lake. The average hair THg concentration was 0.76±0.51μg/g dw. The most-frequently consumed species included four species of carp (golden, bighead, silver and predatory) and the Mongolian redfin. Hair THg concentrations accumulated rapidly during younger years, reaching a plateau around age 25, implying that the hair mercury concentrations in adult females &gt;25 years can be interpreted by environmental exposure. Hair THg concentrations were positively correlated both with the frequency and the average weekly amount of fish consumption. This indicates that fish consumption is an important contributor to hair mercury concentrations in the absence of occupational or environmental mercury sources. A positive correlation between selenium and mercury in hair samples was also observed, suggesting a possible antagonistic relationship. This is the first study to look at mercury exposure in an eastern China community dependent on freshwater fish.&#xD;
This study also compared element trends (Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Pb) in hair samples from three groups: 50 residents by Qiandao Lake (QD), 17 people from Fudan University, China (FU), and 20 people from Queen’s University, Canada (KI). Trends of mean Mg, Cu, Ca, As concentrations among groups are the same (KI&gt;FU&gt;QD). Mn, Cr, and Hg share the same trends of QD&gt;FU&gt;KI. Se concentrations follow the trend of QD&gt;KI&gt;FU. Strong correlations between Ca and Mg were observed within each group. Relationships between Se and Hg are clear in QD but not in FU and KI, probably due to the different dietary proportion of fish.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Uterine Natural Killer cells are the major lymphocyte population in the pregnant uterus in early gestation; outnumbering both T and B cells. The numerical expansion of uterine Natural Killer cells is thought to result from the expansion of preexisting progenitor cells resident to the uterus, recruitment of Natural Killer cells from the circulation, or a combination of both pathways. Uterine Natural Killer cells are capable of cytotoxic killing and express receptors that can recognize foreign paternal antigens. Therefore, it has been argued that uterine Natural Killer cell activation can lead to killing of fetal cells and abortion. However, fetal rejection by uterine Natural Killer cells does not occur in normal pregnancies and other functions for uterine Natural Killer cells have been proposed. These include: the regulation of maternal blood supply responsible for providing oxygen to the fetus, regulation of maternal blood pressure and, in species with invasive placentation, regulation of decidualization, the process of endometrial cell expansion and transformation during the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy. These cell functions juxtapose the concept that uterine Natural Killer cell activation is harmful to the fetus and offer a new perspective that uterine Natural Killer cells regulate functions unrelated to traditional transplantation immunology. In this dissertation, work is presented showing that uterine Natural Killer cells express molecules which regulate blood pressure and decidualization. Also presented are data supporting the hypothesis that the numerical increase of uterine Natural Killer cells is due to the recruitment of Natural Killer cells from the blood. These results support roles for uterine Natural Killer cells other than cytotoxic killing and advance the understanding of uterine Natural Killer cells as dynamic players that support pregnancy-associated biological processes unrelated to traditional understandings of immune surveillance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to describe the ways in which one elementary teacher included English language learners (ELLs) in her mainstream classroom. A case study design was chosen to obtain an in-depth understanding of this teacher’s beliefs and practices about ELLs and their inclusion. Descriptive data were collected from teacher interviews, classroom observations, and&#xD;
various artefacts. Data from these three sources were found to be highly consistent, indicating a close relationship between the teacher’s beliefs and practices. &#xD;
Two main themes emerged relating to the teacher’s ways of supporting and including young ELLs. The first theme was concerned with the teacher’s beliefs in and employment of broad-based instructional strategies such as differentiating instruction and assessment; emphasizing engagement&#xD;
through the use of a variety of meaningful activities and materials; focusing on oral language; stressing problem solving and cooperative learning; and encouraging students to take the lead. While&#xD;
the literature endorsed these general practices, it also stressed the need for teachers to address ELLs’ distinct language and cultural needs.&#xD;
Appreciating and incorporating diversity to facilitate ELLs’ inclusion was the second theme. Here, the data primarily came from interviews with the teacher who reported the value of exposing children to diversity and examining one’s and others’ biases, as well as utilizing practices that integrate the cultural knowledge of various groups and involve parents of diverse linguistic/cultural backgrounds. An analysis of these data found that many of the teacher’s approaches to incorporating diversity were integral to her program and addressed diversity from a critical standpoint. It was in this way that the findings connected to Dei et al.’s (2000) work–a key component of the study’s theoretical framework.&#xD;
Upon examining the data through the lenses of various theoretical constructs, one main&#xD;
concern regarding this teacher’s views and practices was raised throughout. Although the teacher appeared to recognize the value of students maintaining their home languages, there was little&#xD;
evidence of her promoting first language usage in the classroom. Ramifications of this omission were discussed, pointing to the need for further research to uncover some of the concerns educators may have about supporting ELLs’ first languages in the classroom.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to compare the coach-athlete interaction structures of two competitive youth synchronized swimming teams, one more successful with regard to athletes’ performance and personal development than the other. This comparison was conducted through the first application of state space grid (SSG) observational methodology (Hollenstein, 2007; Lewis, Lamey, &amp; Douglas, 1999) in field-based sport psychology research. Both teams (two head coaches and 17 athletes in total) were observed over multiple training sessions. Both coach and athlete behaviour was coded continuously for the duration of each training session. Measures of coach athlete interaction structure, based on dynamic systems concepts, were derived from these coded behaviours and compared between teams. Results revealed significant differences between the two teams on measures of interaction variability, behavioural content patterns, and the sequencing of coach behaviours. The more successful team was characterized by less variable, more patterned interactions between coaches and athletes. This patterning took the form of more individualized technical and positive reinforcement feedback information and significantly less use of negative feedback by the head coach, interspersed with substantial periods of silent observation. The athletes of the more successful team more actively acknowledged the receipt of this feedback from their coach. The sequencing of coach behaviours was more patterned for the coach of the more successful team, with heavy emphasis on the pairing of technical correction and positive reinforcement statements. The findings suggest that a respectful, deliberate pattern of coach-athlete interaction may be associated with youth sport environments producing more positive performance and personal development outcomes for athletes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health problem with rising incidence and high cardiovascular mortality.  CKD compromises cardiovascular function, in part, characterized by vascular calcification (VC), elevated pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse pressure (PP). Through manipulation of dietary adenine, we produced a model characterized by graded severity of CKD, VC and hyperphosphatemia.  To our knowledge, we are the first to explore the relationship between aortic calcium content and changes in circulatory function in rodents with CKD.  Fourteen-week old Sprague-Dawley rats received a diet containing an adenine concentration (0.25-0.75%) plus high-normal dietary phosphate (1%), for up to 10 weeks. Circulatory changes were determined by arterial radiotelemetry (n=6) and by assessment of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV, n=32).  VC was assessed using the calcium-O-cresophthalein-complexone assay. At sacrifice, kidney function (creatinine (µmol/L)) was worst in the group with VC (251.3±60.2 µmol/L), compared to non-calcifying CKD (200.3±68.8 µmol/L) or control (50.0±16.2 µmol/L).  PWV (cm/s) adjusted for blood pressure (BP) was markedly elevated in animals with VC (3.23±0.33 log(cm/s)) versus non-calcifying CKD (2.85± 0.12 log(cm/s)) or control (2.96±0.08 log(cm/s)). Arterial pressure radiotelemetry revealed that there was an increase in pulse pressure (38±4.7 mmHg to 58 ±15.2 mmHg) during the development of VC. Systolic pressure remained relatively stable throughout (129±8.7 mmHg), diastolic pressure fell during weeks 9 and 10 of the study (91±6.0 mmHg down to 74±9.1 mmHg), a fall that almost fully accounted for the changes in pulse pressure. The calcifying CKD animals also exhibited left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) compared to CKD or control animals (2.32±0.3 vs 2.03±0.2, 1.80±0.1 g/kg respectively). Manipulating dietary adenine produces a graded severity of CKD with calcification which impact circulatory changes (PP and PWV).  These altered circulatory functions are likely to be key factors in the enhanced LVH.  This model appears to be a useful for the study of CKD-associated VC.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study uses a data set on adolescent offending, originally collected by a team of researchers at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York City, to critically examine the role of incarceration in criminal rehabilitation. A theoretical explanation of recidivism is constructed using four criminological theories: life course theory (Sampson &amp; Laub 1993), differential association theory (Sutherland 1939), deterrence theory, and reintegrative shaming theory (Braithwaite 1989). This thesis uses these theories to investigate societal factors that may contribute to young offenders’ recidivism (versus successful rehabilitation). It is argued that youths who: (1) come from unconventional family environments, (2) possess deviant peer associations, (3) receive incarceration as punishment, and (4) undergo a stigmatizing shaming process are more likely to recidivate. The combination of these factors is also expected to be intensified during incarceration. &#xD;
An empirical examination of the effects of these factors on recidivism supports the main hypotheses advanced. Although conventional family environments and deviant peer associations are successful in determining first-time offending, results from this study suggest that these are inadequate as predictors of recidivism. Conversely, an extension of Braithwaite’s (1989) reintegrative shaming concept was found to be a strong predictor of subsequent offending. Medium sentence lengths in prison were associated with increased risk to recidivate. Most importantly, the results gathered some support for restorative justice approaches to criminal rehabilitation. Future considerations for recidivism research are explored.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Waiting times for cancer radiotherapy have been a concern in Ontario for the past 20 years. A recent review of the clinical trials literature shows that waiting is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. Recurrence and the downstream effects thereof (metastatic disease, death) are expensive to treat. If waiting times can be reduced, the health care system could experience a reduced level of expenditure on recurrence. The magnitude and nature of such reduced expenditures is not known in the scientific literature.&#xD;
This study proposed and described a methodology for estimating the net benefit of reduced waiting for radiotherapy. A cost-benefit analysis was chosen, in which costs were measured as the value of resources required to increase the capacity of a cancer centre, and benefits were measured as the value of averted recurrence, metastatic disease and death due to waiting. The association between increased capacity and reduced waiting was explored in a computer simulation model. Benefits were calculated using a Markov chain model (a mathematical model that simulates patient movement between different health states based on underlying probabilities). Costs and benefits for various lengths of waiting were combined into a summary measure: the Incremental Net Present Value of increasing capacity in a cancer centre.&#xD;
A simplified population of postmenopausal (55 years and older) early breast cancer patients who receive adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery was used to illustrate this methodology. Accordingly, a hypothetical example in which a cancer centre treating these breast cancer patients only was presented to illustrate the methodology developed here. Markov modeling was used to compute averted treatment costs due to a decrease in waiting for this population. The costs of operating a cancer centre were calculated based on actual operations data from the Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario. &#xD;
This work provides a useful framework upon which subsequent investigations of this type can be built. Furthermore, this study modernizes the scientific literature regarding the medical care costs of local recurrence. It is our hope that the method proposed herein will be used in subsequent explorations of the issue of the economics of waiting.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates whether disclosures of material weaknesses in a firm’s internal control over financial reporting are associated with lower investor perceived earnings quality. I measure investor perceived earnings quality by a market returns based representation of earnings quality called e-loading developed by Ecker et al. (2006). My empirical tests use sample firms that disclosed at least one material weakness from August 2002 to October 2005. The cross-sectional univariate analysis shows that firms disclosing internal control material weaknesses have lower investor perceived earnings quality than matched firms that disclose no internal control problems. However, further cross-sectional multivariate regression analysis reveals that after controlling for firm characteristics, only disclosures of company-level material weaknesses have an incremental impact on investor perceived earnings quality, while disclosures of the less pervasive account-specific material weaknesses do not have a measurable effect on perceived earnings quality. From intertemporal within-firm analysis, I find no evidence that firms experienced a change in their perceived earnings quality after their first disclosure of internal control material weaknesses as per SOX 302 or 404. In contrast, I find that firms experienced an increase in perceived earnings quality after they received their first unqualified SOX 404 audit report indicating remediation of previously disclosed material weaknesses. This suggests that, although investors did not find the initial SOX disclosures of internal control weaknesses to be incrementally informative, the legislation motivated firms to remediate weak controls; moreover, the SOX-induced improvement in weak internal controls enhanced investors’ perception of the offending firms’ financial reporting quality.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) materials have demonstrated enormous&#xD;
potential as materials for repairing and retrofitting concrete bridges that have deteriorated from factors such as electro-chemical corrosion and increased load requirements. However, concerns associated with fire remain an obstacle to applications of FRP materials in buildings and parking&#xD;
garages due to FRP’s sensitivity to high temperatures as compared with other structural materials&#xD;
and to limited knowledge on their thermal and mechanical behaviour in fire. This thesis presents&#xD;
results from an ongoing study on the fire performance of FRP materials, fire insulation materials&#xD;
and systems, and FRP wrapped reinforced concrete columns. The overall goal of the study is to&#xD;
understand the fire behaviour of FRP materials and FRP strengthened concrete columns and&#xD;
ultimately, provide rational fire safety design recommendations and guidelines for FRP&#xD;
strengthened concrete columns.&#xD;
A combined experimental and numerical investigation was conducted to achieve the&#xD;
goals of this research study. The experimental work consisted of both small-scale FRP material&#xD;
testing at elevated temperatures and full-scale fire tests on FRP strengthened columns. A&#xD;
numerical model was developed to simulate the behaviour of unwrapped reinforced concrete and&#xD;
FRP strengthened reinforced concrete square or rectangular columns in fire. After validating the&#xD;
numerical model against test data available in literature, it was determined that the numerical&#xD;
model can be used to analyze the behaviour of concrete axial compressive members in fire.&#xD;
Results from this study also demonstrated that although FRP materials experience considerable&#xD;
loss of their mechanical and bond properties at temperatures somewhat below the glass transition&#xD;
temperature of the resin matrix, externally-bonded FRP can be used in strengthening concrete&#xD;
structural members in buildings, if appropriate supplemental fire protection system is provided&#xD;
over the FRP strengthening system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is focused on direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible and&#xD;
incompressible fully developed and developing turbulent flows between isothermal&#xD;
walls using a discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM).&#xD;
Three cases (Ma = 0.2, 0.7 and 1.5) of DNS of turbulent channel flows between&#xD;
isothermal walls with Re ~ 2800, based on bulk velocity and half channel width,&#xD;
have been carried out. It is found that a power law seems to scale mean streamwise&#xD;
velocity with Ma slightly better than the more usual log-law. Inner and outer scaling&#xD;
of second-order and higher-order statistics have been analyzed. The linkage between&#xD;
the pressure gradient and vorticity flux on the wall has been theoretically derived&#xD;
and confirmed and they are highly correlated very close to the wall. The correlation&#xD;
coefficients are influenced by Ma, and viscosity when Ma is high. The near-wall&#xD;
spanwise streak spacing increases with Ma. Isosurfaces of the second invariant of the&#xD;
velocity gradient tensor are more sparsely distributed and elongated as Ma increases.&#xD;
DNS of turbulent isothermal-wall bounded flow subjected to favourable and adverse&#xD;
pressure gradient (FPG, APG) at Ma ~ 0.2 and Reref ~ 428000, based on the&#xD;
inlet bulk velocity and the streamwise length of the bottom wall, is also investigated.&#xD;
The FPG/APG is obtained by imposing a concave/convex curvature on the top wall&#xD;
of a plane channel. The flows on the bottom and top walls are tripped turbulent and laminar boundary layers, respectively. It is observed that the first and second order&#xD;
statistics are strongly influenced by the pressure gradients. The cross-correlation&#xD;
coefficients of the pressure gradients and vorticity flux remain constant across the&#xD;
FPG/APG regions of the flat wall. High correlations between the streamwise/wallnormal&#xD;
pressure gradient and the spanwise vorticity are found near the separation&#xD;
region close to the curved top wall. The angle of inclined hairpin structure to streamwise&#xD;
direction of the bottom wall is smaller (flatter) in the FPG region than the APG&#xD;
region.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) are becoming increasingly accepted in structural engineering applications.  In particular, Carbon-FRP (CFRP) tendons are proving to be promising as prestressing reinforcement for concrete structures.  While several studies have been conducted on CFRP-prestressed concrete beams, very little attention has been given to their long-term behaviour at low temperatures.  This thesis investigates the behaviour of CFRP prestressed concrete beams in two studies: (a) under sustained loading at low temperature, and (b) under high-cycle fatigue at low temperature.  Seven 13 year old, 4.4 m long precast concrete T beams were tested, of which five were prestressed to various levels with CFRP tendons and two with conventional steel strands.&#xD;
In the first study, three beams were exposed to −27 °C while being subjected to a sustained load of 25% of their flexural capacity for 163 days.  The sustained load produced cracking in two beams with lower prestress levels.  Results were compared to those obtained from three similar beams subjected to the same sustained load at room temperature.  Deflection increase under sustained load at low temperature was generally small and similar to that at room temperature.  Prestressing strain had a direct relationship with temperature in the CFRP prestressed beams.&#xD;
After being subjected to sustained loading, all seven beams were tested in the second study.  Only three of the five CFRP prestressed beams were subjected to cyclic loading, one at −28 °C and two at room temperature, while only one of the two steel prestressed beams was subjected to cyclic loading, at −28 °C.  Cyclic loading consisted of 3 million cycles at a frequency of 0.85 Hz.  The load range represented 21 to 42% of the flexural capacity of the CFRP prestressed beams and 30 to 60% of that of the steel-prestressed beam.  Monotonic tests were run every 1 million cycles.  Finally, all seven beams were monotonically loaded to failure.  All CFRP prestressed beams survived the 3 million cycles but the steel prestressed beam failed after 185,000 cycles.  However, the CFRP concrete bond was weakened by high prestress levels, cyclic loading, and low temperature during sustained loading and loading to failure.  This resulted in bond failure at loads ranging from 69 to 91% of the full flexural capacity.  Stiffness and camber gradually decreased during cyclic loading.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One major barrier that prevents cartilage integration following mosaic arthroplasty is the presence of a zone of chondrocyte death (ZCD) that is generated upon osteochondral graft harvest, which can extend up to 400 μm into the cartilaginous portion of the graft. In order for cartilage integration to occur, chondrocytes must be present at the graft periphery; however chondrocyte migration through the ZCD to the graft periphery is inhibited by the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for increasing the number of chondrocytes within the ZCD and at the periphery of a cartilage graft. This method used a combination of collagenase treatment (as a means of degrading the ECM within the ZCD) and chondrocyte chemotaxis (as a means of improving chondrocyte migration into the ZCD and to the cartilage periphery). Results indicate that treating bovine articular cartilage with 0.6 % collagenase for 10 min decreased with extent of the ZCD by approximately 35% (collagenase: 109 ± 13 μm; control: 175 ± 13 μm). Each of the chemotactic agents tested (PDGF-bb, bFGF, and IGF-I) were found to induce bovine chondrocyte chemotaxis at concentrations of 25 ng/mL in modified Boyden chamber experiments. However, in bovine articular cartilage samples that were pre-treated with collagenase (0.6% for 10 min), supplementation with 25 ng/mL of either PDGF-bb or bFGF had no apparent effect on the ZCD relative to samples treated only with collagenase (PDGF-bb: 85 ± 10 μm; bFGF: 88 ± 10 μm). Alternatively, bovine articular cartilage samples pre-treated with collagenase (0.6% for 10 min) and supplementation with 25 ng/mL IGF-I resulted in an approximately 65% reduction in the ZCD relative to samples treated only with collagenase (IGF-1: 38 ± 5 μm). Thus, treating osteochondral grafts with collagenase and IGF-1 induces chondrocyte repopulation of the zone of chondrocyte death generated by osteochondral graft harvesting, and could enhance cartilage integration after implantation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I began with an interest in what makes a difference for girls who face challenging circumstances: What helps them to develop sturdy, resilient, and resistant selves? What role does narrative play in this process? &#xD;
I set in motion a process of storytelling and reflecting by inviting girls and women to share stories together—their own stories, fictional narratives, and myths. The participants had faced particular challenges in adolescence, including economic hardship; disrupted social or family circumstances; mental health; abuse; or trauma. The girls and women had differing racialized, class, cultural, social, religious, and ethnic backgrounds.&#xD;
Drawing on the work of biblical scholars who understand Jesus’ parables as poetic metaphor, I identified 11 aspects of parables that helped me to hear and interpret girls’ stories: participation, difficulty, metaphor, fractals, truth, emergence, performance, possibility, power, wisdom, and beauty. Listening with a parabolic ear, I came to experience girls’ storytelling selves as participatory, metaphorical, fractal, truthful, and emergent; I observed girls’ selves as artistic practices that are embodied performances of their wisdom, power, and beauty. And I discovered how such performances of the self create enlarged spaces of possibility for girls in the face of life’s difficulty. &#xD;
I discovered that storytelling selves are girls’ power—power realized as storytelling, participation, mutual relation, meaning-making, enlarging spaces of possibility, disidentification, and embodiment. &#xD;
I identified six elements that seemed to be important in nurturing girls’ parabolic imagination. These are community participation, experienced observation, complexity, care, interpretation, and artmaking. These elements provide a framework for considering how educators might support girls’ selves but they do not provide a methodology. Taken together, they are more like a parable—an opening onto a particular worldview that invites participation in the world of a girl. &#xD;
These six elements may be signs that point to places where parables of the self are already being told. They become questions that make sense only to those who already understand: Is this community? Is anyone listening? Is it complex? Is this a place of compassion and care? Is meaning being shaped and questioned and reimagined here? Is there art? Is there play?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The present work deals with the calculation and the investigation of possible reductions of CO2 emissions in manufacturing a metal formed product. &#xD;
The industrial sector plays a significant role in the recent increase of the oncentration of Greenhouse Gases in the atmosphere, which is responsible for the advancing global warming. As an answer to fiscal and financial intervention of government policies aimed at counteracting this phenomenon, the environmental impact of products became a key aspect of a company’s strategy.&#xD;
However, literature still lacks effective methods and quantitative studies that look into the details of a single manufacturing process, discussing its environmental aspects and how they can be influenced by changes in the technological parameters.&#xD;
In an attempt to do that, an example of quantification and minimization of the carbon emissions occurring during the two manufacturing steps of the fabrication of an Al 6061 disc is provided. Electrical energy consumption occurring during the shearing and the upset forging of a billet was found by means of nonlinear finite element analysis and converted into CO2 emissions with a carbon emission signature value (CES). Environmental impact and frictional properties of both traditional lubrication and two non-conventional ecologically benign lubricants (palm oil ester and used cooking oil ester) were experimentally tested and are included in the study. &#xD;
A gradient-based optimization algorithm was implemented to determine the optimal geometry of the billet before the compression as well as the lubricant that minimize the total carbon emissions, within the proper technological limitations and constraints on the final product quality. &#xD;
A clear and effective method which would represent an auxiliary decision tool for a manufacturer in the metal forming sector is hereby presented. Results show that the selection of the manufacturing options can have an influence of more than 13% on the overall CO2 emission.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The unique frequency range and robustness of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices has been a catalyst for their adoption as integral components in a range of consumer and military electronics. Furthermore, the strain and piezoelectric ﬁelds associated with SAWs are ﬁnding novel applications in nanostructured devices. In this thesis, the interaction of SAWs with periodic elastic structures, such as photonic or phononic crystals (PnCs), is studied both computationally and experimentally. &#xD;
&#xD;
To predict the behaviour of elastic waves in PnCs, a ﬁnite-difference time-domain simulator (PnCSim) was developed using C++. PnCSim was designed to calculate band structures and transmission spectra of elastic waves through two-dimensional PnCs. By developing appropriate boundary conditions, bulk waves, surface acoustic waves, and plate waves can be simulated. Results obtained using PnCSim demonstrate good agreement with theoretical data reported in the literature. &#xD;
&#xD;
To experimentally investigate the behaviour of SAWs in PnCs, fabrication procedures were developed to create interdigitated transducers (IDTs) and PnCs. Using lift-off photolithography, IDTs with ﬁnger widths as low as 1.8 um were fabricated on gallium arsenide (GaAs), corresponding to a SAW frequency of 397 MHz. A citric acid and hydrogen peroxide wet-etching solution was used to create shallow air hole PnCs in square and triangular lattice conﬁgurations, with lattice constants of 8 um and 12 um, respectively. The relative transmission of SAWs through these PnCs as a function of frequency was determined by comparing the insertion losses before and after etching the PnCs. In addition, using a scanning Sagnac interferometer, displacement maps were measured for SAWs incident on square lattice PnCs by Mathew (Creating and Imaging Surface Acoustic Waves on GaAs, Master’s Thesis). Reasonable agreement was found between simulations and measurements. Additional simulations indicate that SAW waveguiding should be possible with a PnC consiting of air holes in GaAs. &#xD;
&#xD;
The phononic properties of a commonly used photonic plate were also determined. Band structure simulations of the plate displayed no complete elastic band gaps. However, transmission simulations indicated that a pseudo-gap may form for elastic waves polarized in the sagittal plane.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The incidence of childhood leukemia is increasing, especially in urbanized areas. It is hypothesised that transplacental exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as benzene, plays a role in the etiology of childhood cancers.  The studies in this thesis investigated mechanisms of transplacental benzene tumourigenesis focusing on the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Initially, we investigated the effect of maternal benzene exposure on fetal erythroid progenitor cell number and the role of ROS in benzene metabolite-induced dysregulation of erythropoiesis. In the CD-1 mouse, in utero benzene exposure caused significant alterations in female fetal liver erythroid progenitor cell numbers at gestational day 16 and postnatal day 2. Using an in vitro chicken erythroblast cell line capable of erythropoiesis, we found that hydroquinone significantly inhibited erythropoiesis and this effect was prevented by pretreatment with PEG-superoxide dismutase. The second objective investigated the role of ROS in dysregulated fetal hematopoietic progenitor cell growth after maternal benzene exposure in C57Bl/6N mice.  In utero exposure to benzene caused changes in fetal hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers, an increase in levels of fetal liver intracellular ROS, and a decrease in IκB-α protein levels, which were all prevented by pretreatment with PEG-catalase. The final objective determined the incidence of cancer in offspring transplacentally exposed to benzene.  This study compared two strains of mice (C57Bl/6N and CD-1), as well as male and female offspring.  This study also measured levels of benzene and benzene metabolites present in maternal blood and fetal liver tissue after maternal benzene exposure. Transplacental exposure to benzene induced hepatic and hematopoietic tumours in male and female CD-1 mice, respectively. Interestingly, there were no significant changes in tumour incidence in C57Bl/6N mice demonstrating a significant strain difference in susceptibility to transplacental benzene carcinogenesis. Levels of fetal liver benzene metabolites also differed between genders and strains of mice suggesting that the gender and strain differences in tumour formation may be dependent on fetal benzene metabolism capability. In conclusion, this thesis supports the hypothesis that benzene exposure to pregnant women contributes to the etiology of childhood cancers and highlights ROS and fetal benzene metabolism as potential mechanisms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Output feedback control design techniques are required in practice due to the limited&#xD;
number of sensors/measurements available for feedback. This thesis focuses on output&#xD;
feedback controller design techniques for nonlinear systems subject to different system&#xD;
restrictions.&#xD;
The problem of controlling the heart dynamics in a real time manner is formulated&#xD;
as an adaptive learning output-tracking problem. For a class of nonlinear dynamic&#xD;
systems with unknown nonlinearities and non-affine control input , a Lyapunov-based&#xD;
technique is used to develop a control law. An adaptive learning algorithm is exploited&#xD;
that guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system and convergence of the output tracking error to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin. In addition, good&#xD;
approximation of the unknown nonlinearities is also achieved by incorporating a per-&#xD;
sistent exciting signal in the parameter update law. The effectiveness of the proposed&#xD;
method is demonstrated by an application to a cardiac conduction system modelled&#xD;
by two coupled driven oscillators.&#xD;
An output feedback design technique is developed to achieve semi-global practical&#xD;
stabilization for a class of non-minimum phase nonlinear systems, subject to param-&#xD;
eter uncertainties. This work provides a constructive controller design method for an&#xD;
auxiliary system, whose existence is crucial, but is only assumed in (Isidori, 2000).&#xD;
The control design technique is used to regulate the benchmark van de Vusse reactor.&#xD;
Simulation results demonstrate satisfactory controller performance.&#xD;
The output feedback control design for a class of non-minimum phase nonlinear&#xD;
systems with unknown nonlinearities is studied. The proposed approach is able to&#xD;
combine the two previous design methods and provide a stabilizing output feedback&#xD;
control law. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Double Deficit Hypothesis of dyslexia posits that students can be grouped into four distinct groups: (a) average readers, (b) students with phonological deficits, (c) students with naming speed deficits, and (d) students with double deficits: those having both (b) and (c). The present study examines the stability of the Double Deficit groups from Kindergarten to Grade 2. 214 children were assessed in Kindergarten and subsequently tested in early Grade 1, late Grade 1, and Grade 2. Tests administered at each time included measures of naming speed, phonological awareness, and a variety of reading measures. Discriminant analyses indicated that approximately 70% of Grade 2 children were successfully classified by Kindergarten measures. Contingency analyses indicated moderate stability from Kindergarten to Grade 2 and more movement between groups between Kindergarten and Grade 1. The Double Deficit groups differed in reading achievement at each testing time, with the Double Deficit group obtaining the lowest scores. Implications for early assessment and intervention are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Kairomones are infochemicals that benefit a heterospecific receiver.  Chaoborus spp. release a kairomone from their gut when feeding on Daphnia spp.  Daphnia respond to kairomone by shifting life history parameters or producing neonates with induced morphological defenses, increasing their chance of survival.  When laboratory-cultured Daphnia are exposed to environmentally-relevant metal concentrations, a kairomone response is not induced, increasing predation vulnerability.&#xD;
Currently Daphnia live in metal-contaminated lakes in Sudbury, ON.  It is possible the extant population is tolerant of relatively high copper (Cu) concentrations and can still induce a kairomone response.  In comparison, it is hypothesized clones found in lakes isolated from anthropogenic sources of metal-contamination would be less tolerant as they have not been exposed to high Cu concentrations.&#xD;
The purpose of this study was to examine how multiple clones of D. pulicaria obtained from lakes along a Cu gradient respond to kairomone in the absence and presence of copper.  Several different clones from Ontario lakes located in the Canadian Shield were exposed to environmentally-relevant Cu concentrations and Chaoborus kairomone.  Neonates were collected and measured to assess predator-induced defenses.&#xD;
Results indicate that kairomone-mediated responses and Cu-tolerance vary among D. pulicaria clones.  Clones from the Sudbury area were able to induce a response to kairomone when exposed to Cu, indicating a Cu-tolerance.  However, this was not true for all Sudbury clones.  In contrast, most clones from clean lakes did not respond to kairomone when exposed to Cu; while some clones exhibited a Cu-tolerance.  Clones that were not tolerant of Cu were affected at concentrations much lower than those predicted by the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) that induce acute toxicity.  Predictions generated by the BLM can be conservative making them useful when creating water quality criteria; however, my results indicate these predictions can also be under-protective.  Chemosensory cues mediate vital life processes that are essential for survival.  Populations may be devastated if metals interfere with chemosensory cues.  Overall, the results of my study suggest that genetic variation is important for population establishment and maintenance, specifically when exposed to multiple stressors, and that directional selection may result in stress tolerance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Due to difficulties associated with formulating complex models and obtaining reliable estimates of unknown model parameters, modellers often use simplified models (SMs) that are structurally imperfect and that contain a smaller number of parameters.  The objectives of this research are: 1) to develop practical and easy-to-use strategies to help modellers select the best SM from a set of candidate models, and 2) to assist modellers in deciding which parameters in complex models should be estimated, and which should be fixed at initial values.  The aim is to select models and parameters so that the best possible predictions can be obtained using the available data and the modeller’s engineering and scientific knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
This research summarizes the extensive qualitative and quantitative results in the statistics literature regarding the use of SMs.  Mean-squared error (MSE) is used to judge the quality of model predictions obtained from different candidate models, and a confidence-interval approach is developed to assess the uncertainties associated with whether a SM or the corresponding extended model will give better predictions.  Nine commonly-applied model-selection criteria (MSC) are reviewed and analyzed for their propensities of preferring SMs.  It is shown that there exist preferential orderings for many MSC that are independent of model structure and the particular data set.  A new MSE-based MSC is developed using univariate linear statistical models.  The effectiveness of this criterion for selecting dynamic nonlinear multivariate models is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically.  The proposed criterion is then applied for determining the optimal number of parameters to estimate in complex models, based on ranked parameter lists obtained from estimability analysis.  This approach makes use of the modeller’s prior knowledge about precision of initial parameter values and is less computationally expensive than comparable methods in the literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
This research sought to answer the question “To what extent do symptoms related to depression, anxiety and stress interfere with the valid measurement of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?”   More specifically, “To what extent do these factors affect the Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS; Conners, Erdhardt, &amp; Sparrow, 1999) and the BADDS (Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale; T. E. Brown, 1996), popular measures of ADHD status?”   I examined the number of people in “higher stress situations” scoring above accepted critical values on the subscales of the CAARS and on the BADDS in comparison to the general population.  Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between the level of depression, anxiety, stress, and ADHD symptomatology and to determine the amount of variance of CAARS and BADDS scores accounted for by each of these other psychological variables.  Three separate groups of people participated in this study: students from a Psychology 100 subject pool; students going to health or counselling services; and a group of nurses employed in a local hospital.  Participants completed questionnaires regarding self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, stress, life experiences, role stress, coping skills, and ADHD symptoms.  Self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and other factors were positively correlated with scores on the measures of ADHD symptomatology.  People who reported more anxiety, more depression, and/or more stress were more likely to score above critical values on the ADHD measures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the past three decades, childhood bullying research has developed. Although bullying was first understood as an individual problem, researchers now understand that bullying is a relationship problem. Children come to a social exchange with their own cognitions and coping strategies, but are also impacted by their peers. Developmental contextualism forms the macro level framework of these studies and states that change occurs reciprocally and across many levels including the individual, interpersonal, community, and society. Social cognitive theory (and social information processing, in particular) helps at the individual and interpersonal levels in understanding the role cognitions play in affecting children’s responses in social exchanges. The series of papers in this dissertation focus on: (1) How attributions and coping styles interact within victimized children and how that affects victimization; (2) How attributions and coping styles are associated in children who bully others and how that interaction affects bullying behaviour; and (3) How children’s friendships protect or put them at risk for victimization. Overall, results suggest that children’s attributions and coping are directly associated with victimization and bullying, but do not work together in a mediational relationship. Rather specific types of attributions and coping strategies are related to involvement in bullying and victimization both within and across time and differences exist between boys and girls. With regards to friendships, the identity and communication skills of one’s friends appear to be important. Findings suggest the need for interventions that teach victimized children and their friends how to cope effectively with victimization and communicate with each other about their needs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study examined motivation, anxiety, global awareness, and linguistic confidence, and their relation to language test performance within the context of Chinese university students taking the College English Test Band 4(CET-4) in China. Using a mixed methods approach, through survey and interview inquiries, this study explored whether and how the selected psychological factors contributed to students’ CET performance. Results from exploratory factor analysis revealed that Chinese university students displayed three types of instrumental motivation (i.e., mark orientation, further-education orientation, and job orientation), two types of anxiety (i.e., language anxiety and test anxiety), and two types of confidence (i.e., linguistic confidence and test confidence). The results of confirmatory factor analysis led to a modified socio-educational model of motivation with some context-specific concepts (i.e., new instrumental orientations, global awareness, and linguistic confidence) that more accurately represented the characteristics of the Chinese university students. The results of structural equation modelling confirmed that attitude toward the learning situation and integrative orientation were two strong indicators of motivation, which in turn influenced language achievement and confidence. The negative impact of anxiety on language achievement was confirmed. Certain group differences were found in comparing male students with female students, high achievers with low achievers, students from the Arts programs with those from the Science programs, and students who started to learn English before Grade 7 with those&#xD;
iii&#xD;
who did so after Grade 7. The interview findings indicated stronger instrumental orientations than integrative orientations. External influences, including influences from society, teachers, and peers, were also identified. Students expressed their mixed feelings toward the CET-4, indicating that this test had both positive and negative influences in promoting their English learning. Testing well-developed motivation and anxiety models in the Chinese context enriched and expanded our knowledge in theory development in English language education in China. The implications of this study point to the importance of understanding language test-takers’ characteristics in their macro and micro learning contexts, as well as the importance of establishing the relevance of English language learning to language teaching, and testing in English as Foreign Language contexts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are electrochemical devices that can convert a variety of fuels directly into electricity. Their commercialization requires efficient operation of its components. The sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the SOFC cathode contributes to the loss in the fuel cell efficiency. In this work, the ORR was investigated for the strontium-doped lanthanum manganite cathode (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte (YSZ) system. A combined mathematical modelling and experimental framework was developed to estimate, for the first time, the kinetics of the elementary processes of the ORR for porous LSM cathodes. The kinetics of each process was then analyzed to identify the contribution to the cathode resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The steady state and impedance response for polarized and unpolarized LSM cathodes was collected over a temperature range between 750C and 850C and two different oxygen partial pressure (pO2) ranges: (i) between 0.0001atm and 0.001atm, where LSM is considered to be stoichiometric with respect to oxygen and (ii) between 0.01atm and 0.21atm, where LSM is considered to be superstoichiometric with respect to oxygen. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
A mathematical model was developed to analyze both the steady state and impedance data. Two pathways for the ORR were considered: one where oxygen is transported in the gas phase and one where oxygen is transported along the surface of the LSM cathode. Rate constants, transport coefficients and their respective activation energies were obtained for the adsorption/desorption, surface diffusion and charge transfer processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The experimental results indicated different polarization behavior between low and high pO2. It is hypothesized that the concentration of cation vacancies on the LSM surface changes with both pO2 and extent of polarization and that cation vacancies on the LSM surface can promote the ORR. Modelling results at low pO2 suggested that the adsorption reaction was slow and that thermodynamic limitations resulting in low equilibrium oxygen surface coverage can play an important role at both low and high polarizations. Modelling in high pO2 was complicated by the nature of the LSM surface in these conditions and suggests an electrochemical reaction at the gas/LSM interface and the transport of charged adsorbed oxygen atoms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Impaired attention can hinder information processing at multiple levels and may explain some aspects of the cognitive decline in aging.  An inefficient inhibitory system can lead to deficits in focused attention (FA).  FA deficits are observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  The Stroop task was applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of FA in cognitively normal older adults (NC), patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and patients with mild AD.&#xD;
Twenty-one NC, seven aMCI and fifteen mild AD patients performed a verbal Stroop- fMRI paradigm.  Both structural and T2*-weighted functional scans were acquired.  In Series 0, subjects were presented with colour words printed in black ink and were asked to read the word.  In Series 1 and 2, subjects were presented with colour words printed in an incongruent ink colour.  Series 1 had four blocks of the ‘Read the word’ condition followed by four blocks of the ‘Say the colour of the ink’ condition. Series 2 had eight blocks of alternating ‘Read the word’ and ‘Say the colour of the ink’ conditions.  SPM5 was used to detect anatomical areas with significant signal intensity differences between the two conditions.&#xD;
The NC group performed significantly better in the Stroop-fMRI task than the aMCI and mild AD groups.  The percentage of errors on incongruent trials was significantly lower in the NC group (2%) than the aMCI (14%) and mild AD (13%) groups.  The ‘Say the colour of the ink’ minus ‘Read the word’ contrast for the NC and mild AD groups yielded common areas of activation in the supplementary motor area, precentral gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus.  aMCI patients also showed activation in the precuneus, temporal and postcentral gyri.  &#xD;
 Worse performance on the Stroop-fMRI task by the aMCI and mild AD groups suggests deficits in FA.  This is the first study to investigate the neural correlates of FA using the Stroop task in aMCI and AD patients.  The verbal Stroop-fMRI paradigm employed in the current study provides a means to study the neural correlates of FA in older adult and patient populations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Phytoremediation is a viable technology that provides a cost-effective and aesthetically pleasing alternative to traditional remediation technologies. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Salix nigra and Populus balsamifera in the phytovolatilization of 1,4-dioxane. In the growth studies, P. balsamifera had a significantly decreased growth rate in high concentrations of both 1,4-dioxane and ethylene glycol, while S. nigra showed no significant difference. No significant change in growth was noted between the amended and non-amended soil treatments; however S. nigra trees had a significantly larger size in the amended treatment. S. nigra had a higher survival rate than P. balsamifera with survival rates of 71% and 19% respectively. Total tree evapotranspiration rates were significantly higher in S. nigra than P. balsamifera whereas evapotranspiration rates per m2 of leaf surface area showed the opposite trend. Variations in seasonal precipitation were seen to affect evapotranspiration rates. During the dry 2007 season evapotranspiration rates were significantly higher in P. balsamifera and significantly lower in S. nigra. The opposite trend in evapotranspiration rates was observed in the wet 2008 season. Amendment of the soil was seen to significantly increase rates of evapotranspiration in S. nigra. Total tree dioxane removal was significantly greater in S. nigra than P. balsamifera, while the opposite was observed when removal was calculated per m2 of leaf surface area. Seasonal variations in precipitation exhibited the same trend on dioxane removal as was observed with evapotranspiration. Laboratory studies confirmed S. nigra as an effective species at the phytovolatilization of both dioxane and MTBE. In conclusion, S. nigra was a more effective species in field trials than P. balsamifera for both phytocontainment and phytovolatilization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates the possibility of using electrokinetic effects, induced when a colloidal system is subjected to an electric field, to produce deterministic structure in the catalyst layer of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. The susceptibility of the catalyst ink system to electrokinetic effects is clearly demonstrated. A novel apparatus and procedure is developed to allow for the formation of continuous films between two electrode surfaces through solvent evaporation. Characterization of the resulting layers is done through imaging and rotating disc electrode measurements. While the images show some possibility of structure formation, no clear increase in the oxygen reduction rate is observed. Recommendations for extending this work are provided.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cell migration and invasion are essential physiological processes required for the growth and development of all multicellular organisms. However, they have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain vascular system diseases and invasive cancers. In this study, we investigate two proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival signaling, p53 and Stat3, which have been found misregulated in atherosclerosis and cancer, to establish what effect they have on the development of Src-induced invasive phenotypes in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.  &#xD;
 	In the first stage of this experiment, we investigated the tumor suppressor p53. Once believed to act primarily as a regulator of the cell cycle, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis, current evidence suggests that p53 can also regulate cell migration and invasion. For our study, we stably transduced VSMC and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with constitutively active Src (SrcY527F) to generate invasive cell lines with pronounced podosome and rosette formation. We established for the first time that p53 suppresses Src-induced podosome and rosette formation, extracellular matrix degradation, cell migration and invasion in these cells. We also present novel data showing that p53 suppresses these invasive phenotypes, at least in part, by up-regulating the expression of caldesmon, an actin binding protein which stabilizes stress fibers and inhibits podosome and rosette formation.  &#xD;
 	In the second part of this study, we show that Stat3, a pro-survival and pro-metastatic transcription factor, is required downstream of Src for the promotion of invasive phenotypes in VSMC and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Interestingly we have also shown for the first time that Stat3 can localize to podosomes and rosettes in these cells. The exact physiological reasoning for this localization, however, remains to be determined.   &#xD;
 	This study provides strong evidence suggesting that mutual antagonism between the anti-invasive ‘p53-caldesmon’ and pro-invasive ‘Src-Stat3’ pathways dictates the outcome of Src-induced invasive phenotypes in VSMC and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.</dcterms:abstract>
