      <dcterms:abstract>Due to their complementary characteristics, Global Positioning System (GPS) is usually integrated with standalone navigation devices like odometers and inertial measurement units (IMU). Recently, intensive research has focused on utilizing Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) grade inertial sensors in the integration because of their low cost. In this study, a reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) is considered. It comprises a MEMS grade single axis gyroscope, the vehicle built-in odometer, and two optional MEMS grade accelerometers. Estimation technique is needed to allow the data fusion of RISS and GPS. With adequate accuracy, Kalman filter (KF) fulfills this requirement if high-end inertial sensors are used. However, due to the inherent error characteristics of MEMS devices, MEMS-based RISS suffers from the non-stationary stochastic sensor errors and nonlinear inertial errors, which cannot be suppressed by KF alone. To solve the problem, Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS), a nonlinear system identification algorithm, is suggested in this research for modeling higher order RISS errors. FOS algorithm has the ability to figure out the system nonlinearity with a tolerance of arbitrary stochastic system noise. Its modeling results can then be used to predict the system dynamics. Motivated by the above merits, a KF/FOS module is proposed. By handling both linear and nonlinear RISS errors, this module targets substantial enhancement of positioning accuracy.&#xD;
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed technique, KF/FOS module is applied on RISS with GPS in a land vehicle for several road test trajectories. Its performance is compared to KF-only method, both assessed with respect to a high-end reference. To evaluate navigation algorithm in real-time vehicle application, a multi-sensor data logger is designed in this research to collect online RISS/GPS data. KF/FOS module is transplanted on an embedded digital signal processor as well. Both the off-line and online results confirm that KF/FOS module outperforms KF-only approach in positioning accuracy. They also demonstrate reliable real-time performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Temporary Agricultural Worker to Canada (TAWC) project was introduced in 2003 with the purpose of recruiting Guatemalan migrants to fill seasonal labour voids in Canada.  Workers contracted through TAWC directives have received minimal scholarly attention, given the infancy of the program and the substantial focus on Mexican migrants recruited through the Canadian Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program.  This dissertation illuminates the transnational political realities of Guatemalans by examining the impact that circular migration has on the subaltern migrant body.&#xD;
Fieldwork was conducted in two sites, the first St. Rémi in Québec, the second Santiago Sacatepéquez in Guatemala.  Research findings underscore the transnational nature of the flow of hegemonic (discipline, insecurity, oppression, exploitation) and counter hegemonic (empowerment, liberation, collectiveness, security) political ideas and activities between the spaces traversed by migrants.  The study engages a multi-faceted ethnographic design in order to explore the spatiality of political consciousness, assessing Guatemalan migrant responses to a range of ideas and activities imparted by agencies of power.  These include both the Canadian and Guatemalan governments, the International Organization for Migration, and le Fondation des entreprises pour le recrutement de la main-d'oeuvre étrangère (FERME) along with a range of transnational supporting allies.  Nevertheless, the decision to (dis)engage in certain politicized conduct is largely dependent on the human agency of Guatemalan migrants, as they find the means to cope with the mounting pressures of seasonal migration.&#xD;
A political economy perspective allows me to engage three debates that theoretically frame the transnational political identity of Guatemalan migrants.  These are: (1) processes of political transnationalism; (2) neoliberal agenda and mindsets; and (3) migrant political consciousness, with a particular emphasis on Foucauldian concepts of governmentality and Gramscian notions of hegemony and consciousness.  By engaging the (re)shaping of transnational political identity as a phenomenon influenced by agencies of power, and more importantly, the human agency of subaltern migrants, my dissertation emphasizes migrant (un)willingness to embrace and/or suppress certain resources that restructure political consciousness and political action.  The versatility and fluidity of transmigrant political identity reveal that the distinct realities of individuals are constructed by travelling back and forth, as seasonal labourers, between Guatemala and Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents topologies and control methods to improve the efficiency and dynamic response of Electric Vehicle (EV) power converters. There are three main converters in an EV power conditioning system: a plug-in AC/DC converter, a low-voltage DC/DC converter, and a three-phase inverter. The focus of this thesis is to improve the plug-in AC/DC converter and the low-voltage DC/DC converter. &#xD;
A new topology is proposed to improve the efficiency and increase the reliability of the plug-in AC/DC converter. The plug-in AC/DC converter consists of a Power Factor Correction (PFC) stage, which is followed by a high voltage DC/DC converter for galvanic isolation. The proposed approach includes a simple and effective auxiliary circuit for the PFC stage, which guarantees soft-switching for the power switches.  Next, a current-driven full-bridge topology is proposed for the high-voltage DC/DC conversion stage, which guarantees soft-switching and eliminates voltage spikes across the output diodes. Also, two control approaches are proposed in order to improve the dynamic response of the AC/DC converter. The first controller is based on nonlinear differential flatness theory, which can be used to improve the transient response of the AC/DC converter. The second controller is based on an optimized stabilizing control-Lyapunov function, which extends the stability margins and improves reliability. &#xD;
An optimized variable-frequency phase-shift controller is proposed for the low voltage DC/DC converter, which adaptively controls the amount of reactive current required to maintain soft-switching throughout the whole range of operation and minimizes the switching and conduction losses of the converter.&#xD;
Mathematical analysis, simulation, and experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Discrete-Event systems (DES) is a framework in which problems are modelled as finite-state automata and a solution in the form of a supervisory control scheme can be automatically synthesized via an exhaustive search through the state space of the system. Various extensions to the standard DES framework have been introduced to allow it to be applied to a greater variety of problems. When the system in question is very large or varies with time, a limited lookahead policy can be adopted, in which control decisions are made on-the-fly by looking at finite-step projections of the behaviour of the system's underlying automata. This work presents a new approach to limited lookahead supervision which incorporates many of the extensions to DES that are already present in the literature, such as event probability and string desirability. When dealing with a limited lookahead technique, the projected system behaviour is represented as a lookahead tree with some depth limit decided on by the user. It can be difficult to strike a balance between the complexities associated with storing and analyzing the trees and the amount of information available to make decisions, both of which increase with depth. This work also presents a set of methods which are designed to aid in accurately estimating the state space of lookahead trees with the intent of simplifying the process of determining a favourable depth to use. Finally, the approaches introduced herein are applied to a simulation of an infectious disease outbreak, primarily to showcase them in action, but also for the possibility of illuminating any useful information for real-world health units.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zirconium alloys are susceptible to engineering problems associated with the uptake of hydrogen throughout their design lifetime in nuclear reactors. Understanding of hydrogen embrittlement associated with the precipitation of brittle hydride phases and a sub-critical crack growth mechanism known as Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC) is required to provide the engineering justifications for safe reactor operation. &#xD;
&#xD;
The nature of bulk zirconium hydrides at low concentrations (&lt; 100 wt. ppm) is subject to several contradictory descriptions in the literature associated with the stability and metastability of γ-phase zirconium hydride. Due to the differing volume expansions (12-17%) and crystallography between γ and δ hydride phases, it is suggested that the matrix yield strength may have an effect on the phase stability. The present work indicated that although yield strength can shift the phase stability, other factors such as microstructure and phase distribution can be as or more important. This suggests that small material differences are the reason for the literature discrepancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
DHC is characterised by the repeated precipitation, growth, fracture of brittle hydride phases and subsequent crack arrest in the ductile metal. DHC growth is associated primarily the ability of hydrogen to diffuse under a stress induced chemical potential towards a stress raiser. Knowledge of the factors controlling DHC are paramount in being able to appropriately describe DHC for engineering purposes. Most studies characterise DHC upon cooling to the test temperature. DHC upon heating has not been extensively studied and the mechanism by which it occurs is somewhat controversial in the literature. This work shows that previous thermo-mechanical processing of hydrided zirconium can have a significant effect on the dissolution behaviour of the bulk hydride upon heating. DHC tests with γ-quenched, furnace cooled-δ and reoriented bulk hydrides upon heating and DHC upon cooling suggest that the amount of hydrogen in solution is the primary factor controlling the occurrence of DHC and consistent with the postulation that the stress induced chemical potential is the driving force for DHC.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Exercise is widely recognized as the cornerstone of management of type II diabetes (T2D). However, it is also known that people with T2D have poor adherence to exercise regimens, which is largely thought to be because of poor exercise tolerance. Recent studies have suggested that this exercise intolerance may be caused by a reduction in exercising muscle blood flow. One physiological mechanism which could potentially contribute is the muscle metaboreflex (MMR). This mechanism is thought to be a pressure-based flow-improving mechanism, but as a result of reduced efficacy of vasodilators and sympatholytic agents, might in fact be restraining the flow-improvement in persons with T2D. &#xD;
&#xD;
Hypothesis: Persons with T2D would not improve exercising muscle blood flow upon MMR activation. This absence of flow-improvement will be due to an augmented vasoconstriction in the exercising muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: T2D (n=7) and CTL (n=6) participants performed rhythmic forearm handgrip exercise at an intensity equivalent to 20% MVC for 9 minutes with and without the application of ischemic plantar flexion (IPF).  Forearm blood flow (FBF), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and forearm vascular conductance (FVK) were quantified for the last thirty seconds of each of four time points during the protocol. Plasma norepinephrine was measured via deep venous and arterialized venous blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Steady state exercising FBF was increased in CTL but not in T2D during MMR activation (mean ± SE mL/min: CTLControl 161.16 ± 5.95, CTLMMR 212.72 ± 9.49, T2DControl 156.71 ± 13.08, T2DMMR 144.22 ± 10.55). This occurred despite similar increases in MAP, CO, HR, and TPR (across groups and treatment conditions, NS). FVK increased in CTL during the MMR protocol compared to the Control protocol, but decreased in the T2D group using the same comparison (mean ± SE mL/min/100 mm Hg: CTLControl 144.74 ± 5.63, CTLMMR 176.76 ± 11.99, T2DControl 143.29 ± 13.44, T2DMMR 103.53 ± 8.44).&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: In the exercise model utilized, persons with T2D do not demonstrate the MMR-induced flow improvement seen in CTL. This impaired muscle blood flow in T2D is the result of MMR induced exercising limb vasoconstriction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the failure to achieve a final agreement for the Free Trade Area of the Americas(FTAA)at the 2005 Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas. The predominant explanation for this outcome highlights the economic asymmetries and the lack of economic interdependence between the participating states. In view of these structural impediments, based on original field interviews and extensive document analysis, the author goes a step further and argues that these factors were exacerbated by an ideological shift that took place during the decade that the FTAA was negotiated. Specifically, it is argued that the emerging consensus in the hemisphere that was in place at the launching of the FTAA negotiations in 1994 centered on the desirability of economic liberalization; this began to unravel in view of growing political challenges to neo-liberalism in many of the Americas’ social formations. This particular political challenge of economic liberalization emerged against the background of the failure of neo-liberal reforms to achieve their promised results, and the resultant socio-economic polarization. In many social formations, this polarization led to crises of authority, which sometimes opened the political arena to social forces that articulated, to different degrees, alternatives to neo-liberalism. In two countries of import for the FTAA, Venezuela and Brazil, governments were elected which challenged the United States’ leadership within the FTAA negotiations, based on a discourse of state sovereignty. In broader terms, the growing de-legitimization of neo-liberalism in the Americas engendered crises of authority in certain countries, notably in Venezuela and Brazil. This in turn brought forth political dynamics that constrained the United States’ hegemony in the hemisphere, which would have been consolidated by the FTAA. As such, this dissertation draws upon a Gramscian analysis to examine the manner in which crises of authority, rooted in the social formations of the hemisphere, came to be manifested within the institutional framework of the FTAA. Consequently, this work further demonstrates that global governance structures are not only mechanisms through which hegemony is disseminated and counter-hegemony is absorbed, but that they can serve as spaces where hegemony can be confronted and counter-hegemony articulated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Film is an integral part of the everyday cultural experience of millions of Canadians (Ewoudou, 2005). Though we have enjoyed film as a society for close to a century, we have been reluctant to regard it as art.  The literature on the use of film in education shows that it is predominantly employed as a pedagogical aid and not studied for its intrinsic aesthetic value. This paper will demonstrate that film is a legitimate art form that edifies students and thus merits serious study in the secondary school curriculum.  It will discuss how film conveys meaning through a visual narrative.  Fundamental cinematic techniques will be examined to show how they communicate ideas, create mood and evoke empathy in the viewer.  It will demonstrate how film has evolved aesthetically by looking at the stylistic innovations of the French New Wave movement.  An exemplar film from this period, The 400 Blows (1959), will then be analyzed to illustrate the beauty of the medium and its power to express the essence of the human condition.  The paper will conclude by advocating for the inclusion of film in the existing Ontario secondary school curriculum and giving recommendations for its study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction:&#xD;
Women possess characteristics and experiences unique and different from men. Menstruation, pregnancy, puberty and menopause may present challenges for self-management, a prerequisite for those living with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The meaning and experiences of self-management have not been adequately explored from a young woman’s perspective within the diabetes literature.&#xD;
                                       Purpose of the Study: &#xD;
Blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values are keys for determining success in self-management among individuals living with T1DM; however, the values may enable feelings of vulnerability and worthlessness in individuals living with T1DM. Through learning about the experiences of young women, it was hoped that the meaning of self-management would be uncovered. The research question was: What are the experiences of self-management among young women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus?&#xD;
                                        Methods and Methodology:&#xD;
Descriptive phenomenology was used to uncover the experiences of self-management. Unstructured interviews with nine young women aged 22-30 years were conducted to uncover their lived experience. Data collection and analysis followed the methodical structure outlined by van Manen (1997). &#xD;
                                       Findings:&#xD;
Data analysis revealed five themes, and the essence of participants’ self-management experiences. Identified themes included: 1) elusiveness of control; 2) the dualism of technology; 3) forecasting and establishing routines; 4) dealing with the “ups and downs”; and, 5) interface with the health care team. The essence that emerged from the data was “being in balance”.&#xD;
                                     Conclusions:&#xD;
Self-management encompassed the desire and need to be in balance with one’s life and blood glucose levels. Self-management was something that evolved over time, and grew in complexity as phases progressed; it was something participants were still trying to grasp. Individual attitudes, goals, and self-management strategies dominated participants’ discourse in describing their hope of achieving and sustaining balance in their day-to-day lives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a perennial C4 grass species, has the capacity to not only improve the quality of the soil in which it grows but also promote soil carbon storage to offset rising atmospheric CO2.  This research investigated soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics beneath switchgrass using natural abundance 13C and soil carbon fractionation following the establishment of this crop in a native and predominantly C3 plant region in southeastern Ontario.  I investigated SOC dynamics by sampling adjacent commercial switchgrass fields and appropriate paired control fields at sites where the time since switchgrass establishment varied from 4-11 years.  SOC and natural 13C abundance were measured in paired fields to assess management-induced changes in the quantity, source, and turnover time of soil carbon.  To better elucidate carbon cycling dynamics over a relatively short time since switchgrass establishment, multiple soil fractionation techniques were applied to better understand carbon dynamics of soil organic matter with various mean residence times.  Establishment of switchgrass results in marginal increases in SOC, primarily at sites where intensive soil management (i.e. tillage) practices preceded switchgrass establishment.  Changes were observed in some of the more labile SOC pools, as well as in the δ13C values of the bulk soil and soil carbon fractions, indicating that growing switchgrass was causing the incorporation of switchgrass-derived carbon into the soil.  Even resistant SOC pools, with turnover times of over 100 years, incorporated significant quantities of switchgrass carbon in 11 years.  Annual increases in SOC, however, were less than values reported elsewhere.  The potential for soil carbon storage exists, likely due to longer mean residence times of the carbon in soils beneath switchgrass compared with other cultivation systems.   Changes in SOC following switchgrass establishment related strongly to the amount of root biomass, time since establishment and prior soil management practices.  The decomposition rates derived in this research should be integrated into soil carbon modeling applications intended to support the emergence of switchgrass in southeastern Ontario.  The results of my research can advance soil carbon models and be used to make regional assessment of the potential impact of growing switchgrass for bioenergy in southeastern Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A number of international research studies have explored the benefits and challenges for post-secondary students who have experienced an international co-operative education  assignment (e.g., Bentley &amp; Broons, 1998; Coll &amp; Chapman, 2000; Coll, Pinyonatthagarn &amp; Pramoolsook, 2003; Ward &amp; Laslett, 2004; Wong &amp; Coll, 2001). A small number of studies in this field have suggested that a well organized program includes pre-departure planning, focused orientation programs, and opportunities for reflection (Bentley &amp; Broons, 1998; Ward &amp; Laslett, 2004). Mentoring relationships have also been shown to support the success of workplace opportunities (Collins, 1993; Thuynsma, 1997; Van Gyn &amp; Ricks, 1998). However, the results of the research that highlight the development of various traits during the international experience do not distinguish between pre-placement and post-placement student characteristics that contributed to the students’ success in the international experiences. Therefore more research is required.&#xD;
	The purpose of this study was to understand and report on specific factors that contribute to successful international co-operative education experiences from the perspective of college students and the program co-ordinator.  The students and co-ordinator were all associated with a work integrated learning opportunity in an international business college program that requires students to complete an international co-operative experience. Three fundamental questions I set out to answer were:  (a) What role does the pre-placement program play in students’ success in the international co-operative experience? (b) What characteristics of students and workplace supervisors as perceived by the students contribute to successful international co-operative education experiences? (c) What role, if any, does mentoring by a workplace supervisor play in students’ successful international co-operative education experience?  &#xD;
	The study findings emphasized the importance of understanding the characteristics that support a successful experience and discuss the implementation of goals for program design and delivery. The findings within the first theme focused on What Helped Students Succeed in the International Placement, the second theme highlighted What Impeded Students’ Success in the International Placement and the final theme outlined Goals Achieved.  Most of the categories within the themes were anticipated in the research questions but what was surprising was there was little data on mentoring.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>South Africa faces among the world's highest burdens of both HIV and TB. These diseases affect not only the same populations, but often the same patient; HIV/TB co-infection has a compounding effect that creates a greater public health problem than the sum of its parts. In recognition of the need to address HIV/TB co-infection, South Africa is integrating the responses to both diseases under the National Strategic Plan for HIV, STIs and TB, 2012-2016. However, the two diseases have previously been addressed in very different ways, particularly when it comes to human rights considerations. Rather than a reconciliation of these two approaches, the NSP more closely resembles the ongoing response to HIV; while this approach may yield some benefits when applied to TB, it also risks undermining the unique characteristics of TB as well as its overall role in the co-epidemic, with potential repercussions for the effectiveness of the NSP. Through examining the historical roots of these approaches, both in South Africa and internationally, this paper explores how different factors, including the way different stakeholders have engaged with each, have influenced the development of the NSP, and what the implications are for its effective implementation. It is hoped that by focusing attention on TB, the stakeholders charged with monitoring and implementing the NSP will recognize the necessity of giving due consideration to both diseases in enacting a unified response to the co-epidemic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sex-differences in phenotype, development, and life-history can alter the strength of selection experienced by males and females. In particular, theoretical models have demonstrated that differences in the strength of selection between the sexes can influence the deleterious mutation load of populations. Stronger selection acting on males, via the action of sexual selection, could lower the mutation load for females if deleterious mutations tend to be harmful for both sexes. The necessary data to evaluate these models have been lacking, however, as most empirical studies of mutations have overlooked the fundamental differences between the sexes. Using the IV laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster, I have measured the sex-specific impact of mutations in both sexes. This was done both for mutations naturally segregating in IV and for new mutations occurring on the X-chromosome. For both classes of mutations, males suffered a greater selective cost than females, and the mutations responsible were deleterious in both sexes. Further characterization of the male fitness phenotype revealed widespread decline in sexually selected characters combined with an increase in the correlation between sexually selected traits and viability, indicative of pleiotropy between new mutations. My work establishes the necessary conditions for sexual selection to reduce the mutation load of females, and helps fill a crucial gap in our understanding of the consequences of deleterious mutations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The following study has been designed to address gaps in the volunteer abroad literature with respect to this growing phenomenon within Ontario’s secondary school system.  Volunteer abroad programs at the secondary school level reflect a combination of attributes from study abroad, international service learning and volunteer tourism and are influenced by the rhetoric of global citizenship.  As studies have shown that educators play an important role in shaping the volunteer abroad experience for their students, specifically in relation to how they choose sending and host organizations, integrate pre-departure training and facilitate reflection during and after the time abroad, this study includes an interpretive analysis of ten semi-structured interviews conducted with Ontario secondary school teachers who have facilitated volunteer abroad programs between the years 2006 and 2011.  Interview responses have been critically analyzed through the lens of the global citizenship discourse, post-colonial studies and critical pedagogy theory in order to make sense of the nuances involved in how teachers conceptualize the volunteer abroad experience they provide for their students.  Throughout this thesis I argue that teachers must engage in self-reflexive and collaborative practices in order to challenge their assumptions regarding the impacts of these programs on their students and host communities in the Global South.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The analysis of survival data with a possible cure fraction has attracted much interest in the last two decades. Various models and estimating methods have been proposed for such data and they have been applied in many fields, especially in cancer clinical trials. In the thesis, we consider some new general cure models, which include existing survival models as their special cases. We also consider a nonparametric estimation of cure rate. The estimator is proved consistent and asymptotically normal. We also consider the application of proportional density for cure data and the analysis of length-biased cure data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The goal of this study was to improve upon methodological limitations of previous studies to determine the existence and source of differences in the cardiac care of individuals with a history of depression or schizophrenia. The selected outcomes were three cardiac procedures: catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG); and three cardiac pharmaceuticals: beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins.&#xD;
Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study consisted of 309, 790 individuals diagnosed with an AMI and admitted to an acute care hospital in Ontario between April 1, 1995 and March 31, 2009. The time-to-intervention for the depression and schizophrenia was estimated and compared to those without a mental disorder using Cox Proportional Hazards regression. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the interaction between well-established confounders and the receipt of a cardiac intervention.&#xD;
Results: Persons with a history of depression were found to be more likely to receive a catheterization (HR=1.42, 95% CI=1.34-1.50) or PTCA (HR=1.48, 95% CI=1.40-1.57) if they had no previous CVD history, but were less likely to receive a catheterization (HR=0.71, 95% CI=0.51-0.99) or PTCA (HR=0.64, 95% CI=0.39-1.06) if they had a CVD history. In addition individuals with depression were less likely to receive a CABG, especially if they had a history of CVD (HR=0.38, 95% CI=0.24-0.60). Persons with a history of schizophrenia were found to be just as likely to receive a catheterization (HR=0.90, 95% CI=0.70-1.15) or a PTCA (HR=0.83, 95% CI=0.62-1.11). The likelihood of receiving a beta-blocker or statin was comparable or higher for persons with a history of depression (HR=1.07, 95% CI=1.03-1.11; 1.27, 95%&#xD;
ii i&#xD;
CI=1.22-1.32, respectively) and comparable for persons with a history of schizophrenia (HR=0.90, 95% CI=0.79-1.02; HR=0.97, 95% CI=0.83-1.14, respectively), with a small but significant prior drug use effect modification.&#xD;
Interpretation: Persons with depression or schizophrenia with no CVD history are just as likely to receive most recommended cardiac care interventions compared to those without a mental disorder. The source of the differences in care for individuals with a CVD history with depression and schizophrenia needs to be further explored.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In Canada, writers of long fiction have recently begun to employ representations of science and to use scientific theories to construct narratives that investigate issues of class, race, sexuality, faith, truth and the ontological understanding of human existence. This turn towards science in creative works of art suggests that scientific discourse in the early twenty-first century has become a space from which to respond to questions about the search for truth after the rise of poststructuralist theory and postmodern culture. My work investigates this recent turn towards science in contemporary Canadian literature as a way of reevaluating the idea that science is associated with a teleological movement towards human progress, and to analyze how scientific representations re-imagine faith and ethics from a secular perspective. The recent shift towards science in the literature of Canada in English suggests a questioning of social conditions which place the human within epistemological spectrums between truth and fiction, faith and reason, and the individual and the universal. In my dissertation questions related to belief and truth are bound up in a cross-textual study that looks at how Canadian literature reevaluates important debates among theology, art, and science in order to access a humanist interpretation of different possible realities. My dissertation investigates: The Bone Sharps (2007) by Tim Bowling; Curiosity: A Love Story (2010) by Joan Thomas; The Origin of Species (2008) by Nino Ricci; The Memory Artists (2004) by Jeffrey Moore; Player One: What is to Become of Us (2010) by Douglas Coupland; Atmospheric Disturbances (2008) by Rivka Galchen, and  The Evolution of Inanimate Objects: The Life and Collected Works of Thomas Darwin (1857-1879) (2010) by Harry Karlinsky.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines how the liberalization of United States agriculture has affected the everyday experiences of labor, and laborers. Centered on a case study of mushroom production in Southern Chester County, Pennsylvania, this thesis explores the role of governmentality in shaping the daily work experience of labor employed in the industry. &#xD;
Situated within feminist geographic debates regarding gender and work, this thesis argues that normalized and stereotypical understandings of gender, ethnicity, and immigrant status have become tools of discipline that encourage particular performances of work within mushroom houses. The disciplinary strategies explored in this thesis are comprised of rules, procedures, regulations, and dispositions, and are deployed in a  complementarily manner to maximize profit generated by laborers. Ultimately these disciplinary measures have become integral for Southern Chester County to both maximize profits and maintain its prominent location as the largest mushroom cultivating region in the United States.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Most rotary blasthole drills used in the mining industry today are equipped with automatic control systems. However, few, if any, implement closed-loop feedback control of the drilling process itself. This thesis investigates the potential for such control on a large rotary electric blasthole drill. The control strategy examined is Proportional-Integral-Velocity (PIV) control. The drill was successfully equipped with a data logger, and a comprehensive set of drilling data was gathered at an open pit taconite mine in northern Minnesota. This data set was used to model the dynamics of both the feed and rotary actuators.&#xD;
A drilling process software simulator, based on hydraulic blasthole drill data originally developed in previous work [Aboujaoude 1991], was successfully replicated in Simulink, and thoroughly documented, overcoming a major shortcoming in Aboujaoude’s work which provided incomplete information on the simulator implementation. The control strategy from the previous work was successfully integrated with the new process simulator, and its performance validated by comparison with the results presented in the previous work.&#xD;
The drilling process simulator was then modified by replacing the actuator dynamics with the models identified for the electric drill. The modified simulator was validated, and the behaviour of the system with the new actuator models while under feedback control was observed. The controller gains were re-tuned to achieve acceptable drilling performance with the new actuator models. This resulted in a prototype controller ready for field testing on the large rotary electric blasthole drill. In addition, this thesis has produced a fully documented drilling process simulator, suitable as a platform for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis concerns the nature and time-scale of bed morphological adjustments towards equilibrium in alluvial meandering streams. Following the prevailing approach, the stream centrelines are assumed to follow sine-generated curves, the banks are fixed, and the flow is turbulent and sub-critical. The movable bed is flat at time t = 0; at t = Tb, the bed reaches its equilibrium or developed state. &#xD;
	The specific objectives of this thesis are: 1) to develop a predictive equation for the bed development time Tb; 2) to determine the rate of growth of pool-bar complexes in meandering streams; and 3) to determine whether or not the large-scale, curvature-induced erosion-deposition zones of developing beds migrate upstream or downstream throughout their development. This thesis builds on the preliminary work and experimental tests by Binns (2006).&#xD;
The duration of bed development is found to be proportional to the square of the flow width B and inversely proportional to the channel-averaged bed-load rate (qsb)av, the proportionality factor being a function of the initial deflection angle (i.e., stream sinuosity). The form of this function is revealed on the basis of an extensive series of experimental runs carried out in meandering channels of varying values of the initial deflection angle (i.e., 20, 45, 70 and 95 degrees). &#xD;
In the present tests, the temporal development of the bed from time t = 0 to t = Tb was monitored by periodically stopping the flow in order to measure changes in bed surface elevation. In all runs the bed was observed to deform rapidly during the early stages of the run and slow down considerably as the bed approached equilibrium conditions. Once formed, the location of the erosion-deposition zones remained invariant in flow plan with the passage of time. Results from the runs are used to provide insight into the nature of the deformed bed in meandering streams. An expression describing the temporal rate of growth of pool-bar complexes in meandering streams of varying sinuosity is also proposed. The practical application of the equation for Tb is illustrated with available field data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) is the most widely used non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for operating gas and oil transmission pipelines. The Queen’s Applied Magnetics Group (AMG) has been studying MFL signals from dents for the past 5 years, and recently began considering MFL signals from gouges, and gouge/dent combinations.  &#xD;
It is believed that MFL signals from gouges may arise from three factors: the gouge geometry, residual stresses, and a severe plastically deformed layer that is often present at the base of the gouge. The last factor has been studied by another MSc student, Kris Marble.  The present thesis work primarily considers the effects of the first two factors – gouge geometry in combination with residual stress.  &#xD;
Samples containing realistic gouges, produced under field-like conditions, were obtained from two sources - Stress Engineering Services (SES) in Houston, Texas and GdF Suez in St. Denis, France.  At SES, ten different gouges on five pipes (two on each pipe) with increasing severity were produced for the current thesis project. Three gouged pipe samples were obtained from GdF Suez.   &#xD;
	The bulk of the thesis study involved experimental MFL measurements made for each of the gouges and gouge/dents of SES samples in the study, on both the outer and inner surface, and in some cases when the pipe wall was under pressure.  The experimentally obtained MFL signals were interpreted by comparison with the expected MFL geometry-only signals (obtained using magnetic modeling) along with the knowledge of the residual stress information obtained from the neutron diffraction measurements.  Various results were obtained and concluded.&#xD;
	The neutron diffraction was also done on three GdF Suez samples. The results from one sample were used to model the residual stress distribution around the sample and the modeled MFL signals were compared with the experimental MFL signals. The modeled signals are able to account for most features in the experimental results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Within the middle McMurray exposures along the Steepbank River (Steepbank River Outcrops 3 and 4), nine recognized facies can be divided into three genetically related groups: sand-dominated facies, inclined heterolithic stratification (IHS) facies and mixed heterolithic facies.  Together, these facies are interpreted to represent a fluvially dominated, tidally influenced point bar that experienced strong seasonal variation in river discharge.  Annual fluctuations between river-flood stage and low-flow stage are responsible for the deposition of fluvially dominated sand beds alternating with brackish, tidally influenced mud beds that cover the point-bar surface as members of the various IHS facies.  The dichotomy of fluvially dominated sand deposition and brackish-water ichnology of the mud beds represents the annual migration in position of the tidal and salinity nodes caused by fluctuations in fluvial discharge.  &#xD;
Recognition of metre-scale cycles (MSCs) of alternating sandier and muddier intervals within the IHS facies imply that decadal climate cycles, likely caused by fluctuations in ocean and/or solar dynamics, influenced point-bar deposition.  These MSC packages are defined by an upward decrease in sand-bed thickness, an upward increase in mud-bed frequency, and an upward increase in bioturbation intensity, all occurring on a metre scale.  MSCs are an important architectural element of these large-scale tidal-fluvial point bars because they are predictable, repeatable and continuous around the point bar. &#xD;
Analysis of paleocurrents relative to inclined-heterolithic-stratification bedding planes indicates that bend-flow modifications (BFMs) were effective in redistributing flow around the point bar. Furthermore, this suggests that Outcrop 3 is representative of an upstream-to-bend-apex transition within a large-scale point-bar planform.     &#xD;
Recognition of multiple channels at Outcrop 4 was based on large-scale erosional truncation, IHS bed-orientation changes, large cumulative thicknesses of the middle McMurray, thick sand-package thicknesses, changes in relative scale of sedimentary structures, and the occurrence of large mud clasts.  Similarities in depositional expression between channels suggest autogenic channel stacking (within-valley stacking), rather than the stacking of separate valleys. Finally, discordant paleocurrents within the basal sand-dominated facies are likely representative of amalgamated channel-bottom facies from several generations of channel. This suggests that only the upper intervals of basal sand-dominated facies are genetically linked to the overlying IHS facies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, three speciﬁc research contributions to the use of non-uniform electric ﬁeld driven colloidal assembly are described. The ﬁrst relates to experimental work using dielectrophoretic and electrohydrodynamic forces (electroosmosis) to shape three-dimensional colloidal structures. Formation and stabilization of close-packed three-dimensional structures from colloidal silica was demonstrated, using gelation of pluronic F-127 to preserve medium structure against suspension evaporation. Stabilization of ordered structures was shown to be a signiﬁcant challenge, with many of the conventional techniques for immobilizing colloidal crystals being ineﬀective. Secondly, the signiﬁcance of electrohydrodynamic ﬂows resulting from electric and particle concentration (entropic) gradients during the assembly process was demonstrated using numerical simulations based on a thermodynamic framework. These simulations, as well as experimental validation of assembly and the presence of ﬂuid ﬂows, showed that assuming equilibrium behavior (stationary ﬂuid ﬂow), a common assumption for most modelling work to date in these systems, is inappropriate at all but the most dilute concentration cases. Finally, the relevance of multiparticle eﬀects on electric-ﬁeld induced phase transitions of dielectric colloids was demonstrated. The eﬀect of multiparticle/multiscattering eﬀects on the suspension permittivity were accounted for using semi-empirical continuum permittivity formulations which have been previously shown to describe a wide variety of solid packing structures, including face-centered cubic and other colloidal crystal structures. It was shown that multiparticle eﬀects have a signiﬁcant impact on both the coexistence (slow phase separation) and spinodal (fast phase separation) behavior of dielectric suspensions, which has not been demonstrated to date using a continuum framework.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Oxygen can be limited at the environmental (e.g. flood-prone burrows) or cellular (e.g. stroke, heart attack) levels. O2 deprivation in nervous tissue depolarizes cell membranes, incrementing extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o). Consequently, [K+]o can be used to assess neural failure during anoxia. The effect of temperature on the maintenance of brain [K+]o homeostasis in male and female Drosophila melanogaster (W1118) was assessed during repeated anoxic comas induced by N2 gas. Brain [K+]o was continuously monitored using K+-sensitive microelectrodes while body temperature was gradually increased/decreased using a Peltier plate. Once the desired temperature was reached (16°C/17°C, 23°C or 29°C/30°C), it was maintained for the rest of the experiment and the fly was subjected to repeated anoxic bouts. Repetitive anoxia resulted in a loss of the ability to maintain [K+]o baseline at ~10 mM. In both sexes, the total [K+]o baseline variation (D[K+]o) was augmented at 30°C (D[K+]o male = 119.2 ± 21.9 mM; D[K+]o female = 51.2 ± 8.1 mM), whereas 16°C stabilized [K+]o baseline for the duration of the experiment (D[K+]o male = 17.5 ± 4.1 mM; D[K+]o female = 16.9 ± 6.8 mM). Additionally, D[K+]o in males was significantly greater (114.3 ± 10.5 mM ) than in females (36.1 ± 10.5 mM) at 23°C. Under reduced dehydration, experiments performed only in males showed the same trends although the D[K+]o values where considerably reduced at 17°C (D[K+]o male = -1.0 ± 1.3 mM) and 23°C (D[K+]o male = 17.3 ± 1.5 mM) and increased at 29°C (D[K+]o male = 332.7 ± 83.0 mM). It was concluded that 1) N2-delivery patterns consisting of long anoxia, short normoxia and high cycle frequency increased disruption of brain [K+]o baseline maintenance, 2) males were more susceptible to repeated anoxia than females at room temperature, and 3) hypothermia had a protective effect on brain K+ homeostasis during repetitive anoxia. Male flies are suggested as a useful model for examining deleterious consequences of O2 reperfusion with extensive application on therapeutical treatment of stroke or heart attack.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cancer is a global problem, and many people in low-income countries do not have access to the treatment options, such as radiation therapy, that are available in wealthy countries. Where radiation therapy is available, it is often delivered using older Co-60 equipment that has not been updated to modern standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
Previous research has indicated that an updated Co-60 radiation therapy machine could deliver treatments that are equivalent to those performed with modern linear accelerators. Among the key features of these modern treatments is a tightly conformal dose distribution-- the radiation dose is shaped in three dimensions to closely match the tumour, with minimal irradiation of surrounding normal tissues. Very accurate alignment of the patient in the beam is therefore necessary to avoid missing the tumour, so all modern radiotherapy machines include imaging systems to verify the patient's position before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Imaging with the treatment beam is relatively cost-effective, as it avoids the need for a second radiation source and the associated control systems. The dose rate from a Co-60 therapy source, though, is more than an order of magnitude too high to use for computed tomography (CT) imaging of a patient. Digital tomosynthesis (DT), a limited-arc imaging method that can be thought of as a hybrid of CT and conventional radiography, allows some of the three-dimensional selectivity of CT but with shorter imaging times and a five- to fifteen-fold reduction in dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the present work, a prototype Co-60 DT imaging system was developed and characterized. A class of clinically useful Co-60 DT protocols has been identified, based on the filtered backprojection algorithm originally designed for CT, with images acquired over a relatively small arc. Parts of the reconstruction algorithm must be modified for the DT case, and a way to reduce the beam intensity will be necessary to reduce the imaging dose to acceptable levels. Some additional study is required to determine whether improvements made to the DT imaging protocol translate to improvements in the accuracy of the image guidance process, but it is clear that Co-60 DT is feasible and will probably be practical for clinical use.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ottawa/Gatineau region has significant deposits of sensitive glacial marine clay. As these deposits have risen due to isostatic rebound, these materials have been incised by various watercourses, carving river valleys throughout the region. The slopes of these river banks are susceptible to retrogressive slides with significant travel distances. A novel method of monitoring changes in these landslides has been developed and is explained in this thesis. Using a tethered blimp as an aerial photo platform, high resolution digital elevations models (DEM) with accuracies of ±0.49m on vegetated slopes have been created using photogrammetry. These DEMs have been created for a several photos sets taken over time. This allows changes over time to be monitored. The use of ground control points (GCP) allows for the complete three dimensional movement of discrete points to be monitored over time. The photogrammetric DEM have been compared to similar DEM derived from LiDAR surveying. By complimenting these surveys with historical aerial photos it is possible to develop better models of landslide failure processes, which will ultimately provide better predictions of movements and failure. When movements and failures can accurately be predicted it will then be possible to better manage the risk associated with these landslides events.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objectives of this thesis were to examine the relationship between the built environment and obesity-related behaviours in Canadian youth, and to address measurement issues relevant for studying these relationships. The thesis is comprised of four manuscripts. &#xD;
The first manuscript determined the accuracy of the food retailer locations surrounding 34 schools in Ontario as provided by two geographic information system (GIS) databases. The GIS locations of 25% of the food retailers were located within 15 m of their actual location, 50% were within 25 m, and 75% were within 50 m. These values did not differ by GIS database source. &#xD;
The second manuscript examined the association between the presence of food retailers surrounding schools and students’ lunchtime eating behaviours. It also determined whether a circular or road network buffer provided a better geographic boundary of the food retail environment surrounding schools. It was carried out in 6,971 9th and 10th grades students from 158 schools. The presence of food retailers near schools was strongly associated with students regularly eating their lunch at a snack-bar, fast-food restaurant or café.  The road network buffers provided the better measure of the food retail environment. &#xD;
The third manuscript determined the optimal buffer size of the food retail environment surrounding schools. Six road network buffers were created around 158 schools.  These ranged in size from 500 m to 5000 m. Results indicated that the 1000 m buffer was the optimal size. &#xD;
The fourth manuscript explored associations between urban sprawl and active transportation, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and overweight/obesity in 7,017 youth aged 12 to 19 who resided in one of Canada's 33 Census Metropolitan Areas. Increasing levels of sprawl were modestly associated with increased active transportation (only among 12 to 15 year olds) and MVPA. No associations were found for overweight/obesity. &#xD;
Taken together, the results from this thesis provide a better understanding of the role of the built environment on obesity-related behaviours in Canadian youth. Important measurement issues in this topic area were also addressed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Established techniques for the detection of pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, require long timeframes for culturing. State of the art biosensors rely on the diffusion of the target analyte to the sensor surface. AC electric fields can be exploited to enhance the sampling of pathogens and concentrate them at specific locations on the sensor surface, thus overcoming these bottlenecks. AC electrokinetic effects like the dielectrophoretic force and electrothermal flows apply forces on the particle and the bulk fluid, respectively. While dielectrophoresis forces pathogens towards a target location, electrothermal flows circulates the fluid, thus replenishing the local concentration. Numerical simulations and experimental proof of principle demonstrate how AC electrokinetics can be used to collect model bioparticles on an antibody functionalized selective surface from a heterogeneous solution having physiologically relevant conductivity. The presence of parallel channels in a quadrupolar microelectrode design is identified as detrimental during the negative dielectrophoretic collection of bioparticles at the centre of the design while simultaneously providing secondary concentration points. These microelectrodes were incorporated onto the surface of a novel cantilever design for the rapid positive dielectrophoretic collection of Escherichia coli bacteria and enabled the subsequent detection of the bacteria by measuring the shift in the resonance frequency of the cantilever. Finally, a proof of principle setup for a Raman coupled, AC electrokinetically enhanced sampling and detection of viruses is shown where the presence of M13 phages are identified on a selective antibody functionalized surface using Raman spectroscopy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Due to an increase in environmental consciousness in the construction industry there has been increasing interest in using natural building materials like rammed earth construction, straw bale construction and hempcrete construction. These materials have very small embodied energy and are carbon negative or carbon neutral. Hempcrete is a bio-composite mix made up of hemp shive, lime, cement and water. There has been extensive research undertaken on the thermal, acoustic, and mechanical properties of hempcrete. It has low density, good thermal and acoustic insulation properties, and can passively regulate humidity in a built environment. However it also has low compressive strength and modulus of elasticity. Thus hempcrete cannot be used as a direct load bearing material but can used as an infill material in timber stud walls. This thesis investigates how hempcrete can have beneficial structural effects by preventing buckling of timber (increasing the buckling load) columns when used as an infill in between columns in a timber stud wall. Eight timber walls were constructed (both half scale -1200mm high; and full scale – up to 2133mm high) with varying column dimensions. Six of the walls were infilled with hempcrete of varying density. Two walls were not infilled and were baseline tests. All walls were tested in compression. It was found that high density hempcrete (715 kg/m3) not only prevented weak axis buckling of columns but also carried some direct load. Low density hempcrete was also successful in preventing weak axis buckling of the infilled walls. In-filled walls failed in strong axis buckling at a load twice (for half scale walls with 38x89mm columns) or 4 times(full scale walls with 38x235mm columns) that of the unfilled walls. An analytical model based on buckling of a strut on an elastic foundation was proposed to predict the maximum strength hempcrete can add to a wall by preventing buckling. The timber column strength equations from CSA –O86-01 closely predicted the buckling load of the walls from the experiments. The results from the model were also put in design equations from CSA –O86-01 to predict practical failure loads if the walls failed by buckling into hempcrete. Although only a single test result was available, it was in good agreement with the model predictions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Long-term applicability of current surgical interventions for the repair of articular cartilage is jeopardized by the formation of mechanically inferior repair tissue. Cartilage tissue engineering offers the possibility of developing functional repair tissue, similar to that of native cartilage, enabling long-lasting repair of cartilage defects. Current techniques, however, rely on the need for a large number of cells, requiring substantial harvesting of donor tissue or a separate cell expansion phase. As routine cell expansion methods tend to elicit negative effects on cell function, the following study describes an approach to generate large-sized engineered cartilage constructs (≥ 3 cm2) directly from a small number of immature rabbit chondrocytes (approximately 20,000), without the use of a scaffold. After characterizing the hyaline-like engineered constructs, the in vivo repair capacity was assessed in a chondral defect model in the patellar groove of rabbits.&#xD;
&#xD;
In vitro remodeling of the constructs developed in the bioreactor occurred as early as 3 weeks, with the histological staining exhibiting zonal differences throughout the depth of the tissue. With culturing parameters optimized (3 weeks growth under 15 mM NaHCO3), constructs were grown and implanted into critical-sized 4 mm chondral defects. Assessed after 1, 3 and 6 months (n=6), implants were scored macroscopically to evaluate integration and survival of the implants. Out of 18 rabbits, 16 received normal or nearly normal over-all repair assessment. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation showed good integration with surrounding cartilage and underlying subchondral bone. Architectural remodeling of the constructs was present at each time point, with the presence of flattened chondrocytes at the implant surface and columnar arrangement of chondrocytes in deeper zones. The observation of in vivo remodeling was also supported by the changes in biochemical composition of the constructs. At each time point, constructs had a collagen to proteoglycan ratio similar to that of native cartilage (3:1 collagen to proteoglycan). In contrast, the repair tissue for each control group was inferior to that produced with treated defects. These initial results hold promise for the generation of engineered articular cartilage for the clinical repair of cartilage defects without the limitations of current surgical repair strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Two identical or similar code fragments form a clone pair. Previous studies have identified cloning as a risky practice. Therefore, a developer needs to be aware of any clone pairs so as to properly propagate any changes between clones. A clone pair experiences many changes during the creation and maintenance of software systems. A change can either maintain or remove the similarity between clones in a clone pair. If a change maintains the similarity between clones, the clone pair is left in a consistent state. However, if a change makes the clones no longer similar, the clone pair is left in an inconsistent state. The set of states and changes experienced by clone pairs over time form an evolution history known as a clone genealogy. In this thesis, we provide a formal definition of clone genealogies, and perform two case studies to examine clone genealogies. In the first study, we examine clone genealogies to identify fault-prone “patterns” of states and changes. We also build prediction models using clone metrics from one snapshot and compare them to models that include historical evolutionary information about code clones. We examine three long-lived software systems and identify clones using Simian and CCFinder clone detection tools. The results show that there is a relationship between the size of the clone and the time interval between changes and fault-proneness of a clone pair. Additionally, we show that adding evolutionary information increases the precision, recall, and F-Measure of fault prediction models by up to 26%. In our second study, we define 8 types of late propagation and compare them to other forms of clone evolution. Our results not only verify that late propagation is more harmful to software systems, but also establish that some specific cases of late propagations are more harmful than others. Specifically, two cases are most risky: (1) when a clone experiences inconsistent changes and then a re-synchronizing change without any modification to the other clone in a clone pair; and (2) when two clones undergo an inconsistent modification followed by a re-synchronizing change that modifies both the clones in a clone pair.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The amount of data we are dealing with is being generated at an astronomical pace. With the rapid technological advances in the field of data storage techniques, storing and transmitting copious amounts of data has become very easy and hassle-free. However, exploring those abundant data and finding the interesting ones has always been a huge integral challenge and cumbersome process to people in all industrial sectors. A model to rank data by interest will help in saving the time spent on the large amount of data. In this research we concentrate specifically on ranking the text documents in corpora according to ``interestingness''&#xD;
&#xD;
We design a state-of-the-art empirical model to rank documents according to ``interestingness''. The model is cost-efficient, fast and automated to an extent which requires minimal human intervention. We identify different categories of documents based on the word-usage pattern which in turn classifies them as being interesting, mundane or anomalous documents. The model is a novel approach which does not depend on the semantics of the words used in the document but is based on the repetition of words and rate of introduction of new words in the document. The model is a generic design which can be applied to a document corpus of any size from any domain. The model can be used to rank new documents introduced into the corpus. We formulate a couple of normalization techniques which can be used to neutralize the impact of variable document length. &#xD;
&#xD;
We use three approaches, namely dictionary-based data compression, analysis of the rate of new word occurrences and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To test the model we use a variety of corpora namely: US Diplomatic Cable releases by Wikileaks, US Presidents State of Union Addresses, Open American National Corpus and 20 Newsgroups articles. The techniques have various pre-processing steps which are totally automated. We compare the results of the three techniques and examine the level of  agreement between pair of techniques using a statistical method called the Jaccard coefficient. This approach can also be used to detect the unusual and anomalous documents within the corpus. &#xD;
&#xD;
The results also contradict the assumptions made by Simon and Yule in deriving an equation for a general text generation model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A procedure is presented to analyze select geometric and effective properties of the porous transport layer (PTL) of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) in com- pressed and uncompressed states using micro-computed X-ray tomography (Micro CT). A method of compression using a novel device design was employed to mimic the non-homogeneous compression conditions found in functioning fuel cells. The process also features open source image processing and CFD analysis through the use of software packages Fiji and OpenFOAM (proprietary software is also used such as Matlab). Tomographic images of a PTL sample in different compressive states are first analyzed by measuring local porosity values in the through-plane and both in- plane directions. The objective of this study was to develop a method for imaging the PTL structure to show directionality within its properties using relatively inexpensive and non-destructional means. Three different PTL types were tested, one without any additives, one with Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and one with PTFE and a microporous layer (MPL). Non-homogeneous porosity was shown to exist with the highest and least variable porosity values obtained from the in-plane direction that was in-line with the direction of fibres. Porosity values compared well with values obtained from the literature. The profile of the PTL with MPL added was unattainable using this procedure as the resolution of the Micro CT was too low to resolve its pore space.&#xD;
The next stage involved the effective properties analysis which included effective electronic conductivity and effective diffusivity. It was found that the through-plane values for the effective electronic conductivity study were higher than expected. The ratio between through-plane and in-plane was found to be much higher than expected from literature. Lack of sufficient resolution of fibre contacts has been shown to play a role in this discrepancy. These contact problems were shown not too affect measurements of diffusivity in the pore phase. The in-plane direction parallel to the direction of fibres was found to have the highest values of effective transport properties. Effective diffusivity ratios of between 0.1 and 0.37 were found to be reasonable with the limited experimental evidence found in literature. The it was found that the Bruggeman relation for calculating diffusivity and percolation theory by Tomadakis and Sotirchos over predicted the values for diffusion within the PTL and it is suggested that these theories are not suitable for predicting diffusivity for this material.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This qualitative case study examined a researcher-designed professional development intervention focused on improving teachers’ understanding of the interactions among students and between students and teachers in the teachers’ own classrooms. Participating teachers collaborated with the researcher in determining what they would observe and collaborated with each other in making sense of what they saw. The study analyzed participants’ discourse to characterize what they saw, how they worked together, what they found helpful in the intervention, and how they benefited.&#xD;
The study took place over a three-month period at a Canadian Community College in Qatar committed to guiding its faculty in adopting a learner-centred approach. Four participants worked in pairs to share and discuss video of their own classes in action as they sought to adopt the desired learner-centred approach. After a Group Training Session led by the researcher to develop a Video Analysis Framework, the pairs worked through two iterations of individual video recording and selection of a ten-minute clip for sharing, followed by paired analysis of the clips. The researcher recorded the training session, the paired discussions, interviews, and focus group discussion. Data from transcriptions and researcher field notes were analyzed inductively and connected closely with findings from the literature on the benefits of video analysis in enhancing the effectiveness of teacher-directed professional development.&#xD;
Faculty participants benefited from the intervention in a variety of ways. Production, selection, and discussion of video of participants' own class sessions drew participants into focused reflection on student interactions, which led to heightened awareness of phenomena important to participants in becoming learner-centred teachers. Sharing perspectives with their peers generated consensus in interpretation. Iterations led to higher levels of inference and the emergence of a problem-solving approach in making sense of phenomena. Motivated by video analysis, participants experimented with what they considered to be improved teaching techniques. Participants demonstrated significant risk-taking, enhanced peer professional relationships, and ownership and autonomy in professional development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Polar codes, recently invented by Arikan, are the first class of codes known to achieve the symmetric capacity for a large class of channels. The symmetric capacity is the highest achievable rate subject to using the binary input letters of the channel with equal probability. Polar code construction is based on a phenomenon called channel polarization. The encoding as well as the decoding operation of polar codes can be implemented with O(N logN) complexity, where N is the blocklength of the code.&#xD;
In this work, we study the factor graph representation of finite-length polar codes and their effect on the belief propagation (BP) decoding process over Binary Erasure Channel (BEC). Particularly, we study the parity-check-based (H-Based) as well as the generator based (G-based) factor graphs of polar codes. As these factor graphs are not unique for a code, we study and compare the performance of Belief Propagation (BP) decoders on number of well-known graphs. Error rates and complexities are reported for a number of cases. Comparisons are also made with the Successive Cancellation (SC) decoder.&#xD;
High errors are related to the so-called stopping sets of the underlying graphs. we discuss the pros and cons of BP decoder over SC decoder for various code lengths.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits have a characteristic geochemical suite of enriched metals, mineralization and related hydrothermal alteration minerals; however, very little research has been carried out to determine which of these minerals may be useful for exploration in glaciated terrains and there are very few case studies in the public realm that document down-ice dispersal of these from known volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits. In response to these needs and to refine and optimize surficial exploration methods in northern Canada, this study was conducted to examine the mineralogical signature of the Izok Lake Zn-Cu-Pb-Ag VMS deposit, Nunavut and its glacial till dispersal.&#xD;
Glacial sediments were deposited in the Izok Lake region by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Detailed ice flow mapping indicates four stages of ice flow (oldest to youngest): 1) southwest (255 ̊); 2) weak flow to the northwest (315 ̊); a dominant ice flow and landform trend to the west-northwest (292 ̊), and 4) northwest (318 ̊) that was only observed east of the Iznogoudh Lake area (Hicken et al., 2011).&#xD;
The till geochemical signature (aqua regia digestion ICP-MS analysis) for the &lt;0.063 mm fraction of the till matrix is defined by elevated (above the 95th percentile) contents of Zn, Cu, Pb, Fe, Ag, Cd, Bi, Hg, Se, In and Tl. These element signatures in till can be detected up to 8 km down-ice from the deposit. Till geochemical data is used to evaluate which till samples are metal-rich and may contain indicator minerals. Indicator minerals for the amphibolite metamorphic grade Izok Lake VMS deposit includes: gahnite, staurolite, axinite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and pyrite. Sulphide minerals are present at lower abundances than gahnite and staurolite as they are not physically and chemically as robust/resistant during postglacial weathering. Gahnite is the most useful VMS indicator mineral in the postglaciated Izok Lake area, as it was readily identified in till heavy mineral concentrates, it is abundant (100 of grains), its chemically stable in the surficial weathering environment, and can be detected up to 40 km down-ice. This study is one of the first to document indicator minerals down-ice from a VMS deposit in a postglaciated terrain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines a series of problems with the goal of better understanding the fundamental dilemma of whether to invest effort in obtaining information that may lead to better opportunities in the future versus exploiting immediately available opportunities. In particular this work investigates how this dilemma is affected by competition in an evolutionary setting. To achieve this requires both the use of evolutionary game theory, and Markov decision procesess or stochastic dynamic programming. This thesis grows directly out of earlier work on the Social Learning Strategies Tournament. Although I cast the problem in the biological setting of optimal foraging theory, where it fills an obvious gap, this fundamental dilemma should also be of some interest to economists, operations researchers, as well as those working in ecology, evolution and behaviour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The bleaching of paper is an important and controversial treatment employed in the conservation of art. The use of a bleach may greatly enhance the quality of an image but at a cost of lost structural integrity. In order to fully consider the ramifications of bleaching a paper artifact, a historical study of early European paper and its manufacture was conducted. The structure of paper was also studied in order to understand the finer points of early European paper manufacture and to draw conclusions from the bleaching comparison.&#xD;
Results: A comparison of the commonly used ClO2 bleaching with a previously proposed chlorous acid treatment was conducted. The two different bleaching techniques were evaluated on their impact on the colour of artificially aged and unaged Whatman chromatography 1 paper. The results of the bleaching were analyzed with a colourimeter and it was determined that there was a significant change in colour as a result of the bleaching. The ClO2 and chlorous acid bleaching treatments did not produce results that were significantly different from one another, visually and statistically. The bleaching treatments were also tested with the viscometry of the paper in cadoxen and it was determined that ClO2 is a more degradative bleach than chlorous acid. The research also demonstrated that bleaching has a greater degradative impact on previously degraded samples. The quantitative results of the viscometry were accompanied by a qualitative look at the paper samples with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the SEM images there were slight visible differences in the samples that could correlate to aging.&#xD;
Conclusions: Chlorous acid is a gentle effective bleaching technique that was as effective as ClO2 and less degrading to the paper samples. Bleaching has an increased impact on previously degraded samples, and conservators should be wary of this. Further research involving this bleaching technique is suggested. The use of an SEM in imaging damage to paper is a viable option but more work is needed with this technique to ensure conclusive results.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to propose an alternative type of interface for mobile software being used while walking or running.&#xD;
Our work addresses the problem of visual user interfaces for mobile software be- ing potentially unsafe for pedestrians, and not being very immersive when used for location-based games. In addition, location-based games and applications can be dif- ficult to develop when directly interfacing with the sensors used to track the user’s location.&#xD;
These problems need to be addressed because portable computing devices are be- coming a popular tool for navigation, playing games, and accessing the internet while walking. This poses a safety problem for mobile users, who may be paying too much attention to their device to notice and react to hazards in their environment. The difficulty of developing location-based games and other location-aware applications may significantly hinder the prevalence of applications that explore new interaction techniques for ubiquitous computing.&#xD;
We created the TREC toolkit to address the issues with tracking sensors while developing location-based games and applications. We have developed functional location-based applications with TREC to demonstrate the amount of work that can be saved by using this toolkit.In order to have a safer and more immersive alternative to visual interfaces, we have developed ambient audio interfaces for use with mobile applications. Ambient audio uses continuous streams of sound over headphones to present information to mobile users without distracting them from walking safely.&#xD;
In order to test the effectiveness of ambient audio, we ran a study to compare ambient audio with handheld visual interfaces in a location-based game. We compared players’ ability to safely navigate the environment, their sense of immersion in the game, and their performance at the in-game tasks.&#xD;
We found that ambient audio was able to significantly increase players’ safety and sense of immersion compared to a visual interface, while players performed signifi- cantly better at the game tasks when using the visual interface. This makes ambient audio a legitimate alternative to visual interfaces for mobile users when safety and immersion are a priority.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis addresses the perennial difficulties faced by Queen’s University’s administration in its failings to recognize the importance of an adequate contemporary First Nations presence within any twenty-first century Canadian institution of higher learning. Paying attention to the requests and demands of the immediate First Nations campus and community population over the last twenty years, I re-visit university attempts to manage issues of ‘equity’ and ‘diversity’ through non-organic solutions. &#xD;
Using Edward Soja’s theory of Thirdspace, and his concept of a ‘trialectics of space’ I analyze a range of historical and contemporary cultural practices that include macro and micro governance and policy issues. I review the how the space of Queen’s is perceived; I follow how space is conceived in recommendations and requests made to Queen’s administration by First Nations university and community members; and finally I write about how transformations of lived space can bring about institutional change. By pairing feminist and Indigenous methodologies, I suggest that until the Thirdspace is recognized as part of an important cycle of educational and cultural change, the University space will remain inaccessible for many First Nations students, staff and faculty. &#xD;
I also include a background of legislation in Canada; the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Indian Act of 1876, and the Canadian Multiculturalism Act of 1988. These legal documents each served to define, restrict or contain the space in which First Nations live and work, and they need to be included as further background to what Toby Miller refers to as the structural limits of legislating difference in cultural-capitalist nation-state spaces.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives. The transformation of the mental health system toward a recovery-orientation has created a growing demand for training and education to equip providers with recovery competencies. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a recovery competency framework addressing the most salient components of recovery competencies required for providers practicing in in-patient contexts and to construct and test an education program accordingly.&#xD;
Methods. This thesis involved three phases. Phase One used competency development strategies to develop a recovery competency framework. Data collection methods included a literature review and 15 key informant interviews. In Phase Two, based on the recovery competency framework, a recovery education program was constructed and validated. In Phase Three, a pilot study with a pre-test/post-test design was used to examine the effectiveness of the education program. Twenty-six in-patient providers from three hospitals were recruited. Outcome measures included the Recovery Knowledge Inventory, two investigator-developed questionnaires rating participants’ sense of recovery knowledge application and perceived recovery-related dilemmas, and a group evaluation. &#xD;
Results. Two conceptual models were developed in Phase One to address key tensions and enabling processes for in-patient providers. Derived from these two models, a recovery competency framework consisting of eight core competencies was developed. Phase Two was comprised of a two-part education program. Part One was a self-learning program introducing recovery concepts in the in-patient context and the recovery competency framework. Part Two was a group learning program focusing on real-life dilemmas relevant to the in-patient context and applying the Appreciative Inquiry approach to address these dilemmas. In Phase Three, providers who participated in the education program showed improvement in recovery knowledge and sense of recovery knowledge application after the self-learning program. Participant evaluations of the group learning program were positive. The results indicated that in-patient providers may benefit from this education program.&#xD;
Conclusions. This thesis addressed tensions related to recovery and highlighted the important role providers play in promoting recovery through the development and validation of the context-specific competency framework and education program. The broad dissemination of the study results will be an important step in promoting recovery in in-patient settings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A model is developed to describe the bulk thermally-initiated free-radical polymerization of styrene between 100 °C and 170 °C. This model incorporates a comprehensive thermal initiation mechanism including generation and consumption of a Diels-Alder adduct intermediate species. A semi-empirical break-point treatment of diffusion control on reaction kinetics is used to account for autoacceleration behaviour. Using recently-developed statistical techniques, parameters are ranked based on their influence on model predictions, uncertainty in their initial values and correlation between their effects. The four top-ranked parameters (of the 40 total model parameters) are chosen for estimation to improve the fit between model predictions and literature data. After estimation of these four parameters, and hand-tuning of two additional autoacceleration parameters, the model predicts conversion data with a standard error of 5 %. The model also provides an excellent fit to a single MWD curve obtained from a literature experiment performed at 100 °C. Simulations are used to show that chain-end degradation reactions are not important in the temperature range of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
The model is then extended to include industrially-relevant dicumyl peroxide and biphenyl peroxide chemical initiation. Additional peroxide-induced mid-chain scission reactions are considered as they may have an important influence on the molecular weight of polystyrene. To improve trends in predictions of Mn and Mw, the stationary-state hypothesis is applied to the initial adduct concentration. Parameters are then ranked, and selected for estimation using recently-developed statistical techniques. While significant improvements in predictions of conversion data are obtained, it is necessary to manually tune several parameters and scrutinize the reaction scheme in detail. To improve trends in predictions of Mn and Mw, mid-chain scission reactions are turned off and chain-transfer to monomer is implemented. Nine of the 48 total parameters are selected for estimation, resulting in a 73 % decrease in the objective function value compared with predictions using literature values. The final step of this work will be to estimate parameters using a large, proprietary industrial data set. Using this data set, it may be possible to estimate additional parameters which may lead to improved model predictions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Upon marriage, women in early modern England became subject to the common law doctrine of coverture. Coverture had a number of consequences, all of which stemmed from a married woman’s lack of independent legal identity. These consequences largely manifested themselves in a married woman’s complete lack of property rights, but the lack of an independent legal identity created complications for assigning criminal responsibility to married women in the early modern criminal justice system. Coverture largely manifested itself in the criminal law through the defence of marital coercion, which held that a married woman who committed a crime – with the exceptions of murder and treason – was assumed to be acting under her husband’s coercion and was therefore not liable for her actions. &#xD;
This study examines the perceptions, treatment, and experiences of married women in the northern assize circuit and London between 1640 and 1760, with particular attention to the defence of marital coercion. This thesis discovered that the household ideal, not the defence of marital coercion, was the most important factor in determining the perceptions, treatment, and experiences of married women with the criminal justice system. People in early modern England did not see coverture as the loss of rights, but rather the means through which to create a unified household.  The household ideal manifested itself in various ways, including understandings of women’s household role, the tendency of people to treat husband and wife as a criminal unit rather than two separate individuals, the “suitability” of victims in murder trials, and the unique treatment of married women in the execution pamphlets.&#xD;
The married women of this study were subject to the common law doctrine of coverture. While they did not feel its effects in their daily lives, their lack of an independent legal identity created complications in the criminal justice system. Above all, married women were both criminals and wives. Criminal actions may have removed these women from their husbands’ cover, but their experiences with the criminal law were still shaped by coverture and the corresponding household ideal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Tissue engineering is a promising approach for repairing focal defects in articular cartilage. However, using current technologies tissue engineered cartilage displays insufficient biochemical, mechanical and structural properties which compromise the efficacy of implantable material.  Researchers have utilized mechanical stimulation as a means to enhance these shortcomings, but few studies have applied mechanical stimulation in a complex manner similar to forces experienced by the tissue in vitro.  It is hypothesized that application of simulated joint loading (SJL), a small moving contact area over the surface of tissue engineered constructs, will affect the expression and accumulation of superficial zone specific constituents, leading to improvements in construct functionality. &#xD;
&#xD;
Optimal factors of SJL (i.e. compressive load, frequency and duration) were determined via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). The optimal combination of factors, chosen via peak levels of superficial zone genes, was discovered to be 9.81 mN, 1 Hz and 15 minutes.  A study to determine spatial expression of select superficial zone genes stimulated at optimal factors was investigated via ISH, and contrasted with a finite element model (FEM) of constructs stimulated at optimal parameters displayed a correlation between gene expression and surface and sub-surface stress and strain.  SJL at optimal factors (9.81 mN, 1 Hz, 15 minutes) was applied to chondrocyte-agarose hydrogel cultures in long-term studies over a period of four weeks and protein accumulation, expression and mechanical properties was investigated.  Intermittent long-term application of SJL enhanced the expression and accumulation of structural proteins and enhanced the compressive and shear properties of tissue engineered constructs over a period of three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
Combined, the results illustrate the effectiveness of SJL as a method to affect the short-term expression, long-term accumulation and mechanical properties of superficial zone constituents.  Both short and long term experiments illustrated a strain dependent behavior.  The mechanism behind these results is unclear, but transduction of strain events by mechanoreceptive elements of integrins, ion channels and the pericellular matrix are potential mediators.  This study demonstrated the effectiveness of SJL as a stimulation method, and demonstrated the potential to affect regional expression through alterations of SJL contact mechanics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The plant cell wall contains significant quantities of renewable polymers in the form of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These three renewable polymers have the potential to complement or replace synthetic polymers in a variety of applications. Rapidly determining the quantities of these polysaccharides in lignocellulosic biomass is important yet difficult since plant biomass is recalcitrant and highly variable in composition.&#xD;
Part of this contribution outlines a novel compositional analysis protocol using infrared spectroscopy and multivariate regression techniques that is rapid and inexpensive. Multivariate regression models based on calibration mixtures can be used to discern between populations of lignocellulosic biomass or to predict cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin quantities. Thus, the compositional analysis step can be expedited so that other processes, like fractionation of the lignocellulose polymers, can be tuned accordingly to maximize the value of the final product.&#xD;
Hybrid materials were also generated using a variety of polymerization techniques and post-polymerization modifications. A novel controlled/living radical polymerization initiator was synthesized (2-bromo-2-methylpropane hydrazide) containing a hydrazide functionality that was covalently linked to the reducing-end of dextran. Despite the rapid coupling of the hydrazide- based initiator to the reducing-end of dextran, the instability of the alkyl bromide bond resulted in several unsuccessful attempts at Cu(0)-mediated controlled/living radical polymerization. Recommendations were given to improve the stability of this compound; however, an alternative approach to synthesizing hybrid copolymers was also investigated in parallel.&#xD;
Hyperbranched polymers were synthesized using commercially available vinyl and divinyl monomers in the presence of a cobalt(II) complex that enabled control over the size, architecture, and mol% of pendant vinyl groups amenable to post-polymerization modification. Modifying the ratio of divinyl monomer to cobalt(II) complex provided a series of hyperbranched polymers with variable morphology and mol% pendant vinyl groups. The pendant vinyl bonds were subsequently converted to amines via thiol additions with cysteamine. These amine functionalized hyperbranched polymers were then used in a subsequent reductive amination reaction with the reducing-end of dextran to produce the amphiphilic core-shell copolymer poly(methyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate)-b-dextran. These amphiphilic copolymers mimicked the colloidal behaviour of conventional block copolymer micelles without requiring difficult syntheses or tedious self-assembly steps.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This is a study of the politics of language in Canada from the perspective of francophone minority communities – the close to one million French-speakers living in provinces and territories outside Québec. The analysis proceeds in two main parts. The first part examines and engages with the literature in political theory on the respect and recognition of ethnocultural minorities in liberal democracies. It reconstructs Will Kymlicka’s approach to normative theorizing on ethnocultural justice and defends it against recent important works emphasizing the deliberative resolution of issues of ethnocultural diversity. It shows how the Kymlickan approach to multiculturalism and minority rights requires uncovering and articulating the normative logic that underpins both group claims and state measures. The second part of the thesis carries out the Kymlickan approach with respect to the status and treatment of francophone minorities outside Québec. It begins by showing how Kymlicka and his main critics have failed to fully apply, as it were, the Kymlickan approach to the status and treatment of Canada’s Francophone minority communities. It then analyzes these communities’ political claims for justice and equality as well as the rights and accommodations put in place by the state in an effort to come to terms with their claims. It finds that the failure of the federal language regime to respond adequately to their claims for a combination of participation and autonomy lies with its given administrative application of legislative commitments not within commitments themselves. In summary, weaving the political theory of multiculturalism together with l’étude des minorités francophones hors Québec, this thesis incorporates Canada’s Francophone minority communities into a scholarship that has ignored or rendered them invisible and it also shows how the federal government could go about ensuring their just recognition and equal treatment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Thermal and fatigue cracking are pavement distresses that deteriorate asphalt pavements in Canada. However, the current AASHTO M320 standard specification protocol does not give satisfactory correlation between the properties measured in the laboratory to thermal and fatigue cracking performance of the asphalt in service. This thesis is aimed at validating the newly developed MTO LS-299 and LS-308 specification test methods for predicting pavement distress. A secondary objective is to determine how well laboratory-aged and field-aged binders correlate with each other in terms of their chemical and physical properties. Chemical testing using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), as well as physical and mechanical testing using the regular bending beam rheometer (BBR), extended BBR (eBBR), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and double edge notched tension (DENT) tests were performed on laboratory-aged and recovered binders from Highway 417.&#xD;
 Asphalt cements with significant amounts of waste engine oil residues as determined by XRF data were found to have cracked severely due to their high tendency for chemical aging. Western Canadian binders modified with styrene-butadiene-styrene polymer showed low affinity for both chemical and physical aging as determined from their carbonyl indices. Asphalt binders with smaller paraffinic structures exhibited insignificant pavement deterioration while the opposite occurred to those with low aromatic indices according to their IR data. The DSR data show that chemical aging occurs much faster in the laboratory-aged binders than the field-aged binders. The DENT test is able to separate superior performing binders from inferior ones with 86% accuracy according to their CTOD data. The regular BBR gave poor correlation between the laboratory test methods and the performance of the pavements. Good correlation exists between the laboratory test methods and the performance of the pavements in service according to the eBBR data. Pavements without any cracks showed lower grade losses, while pavements with severe thermal cracking recorded higher grade losses after three days of conditioning prior to testing. The study has shown that the eBBR and DENT tests are better tools for predicting pavement performance and provide good specification tests for the control of thermal and fatigue cracking in modern pavements.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the main risks that exposed and unvegetated tailings pose to the environment and human health is airborne dust that may be inhaled or ingested. In the case of Pb-bearing dust, both particle size and the identity of the Pb-hosting minerals affect the degree of risk. Finer dusts (&lt;5µm diameter) have a higher potential of being ingested deeper into the human lung causing possible tissue damage and toxic effects. We have collected size-fractionated airborne dust and near-surface pH-neutral tailings at New Calumet Mine, Quebec, Canada, a former Pb-Zn mine. Bioaccessibility describes how much of a substance can be dissolved by body fluids and become available for absorption by the body. The most bioaccessible Pb compounds are PbCO3 (cerussite), Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2 (hydrocerussite) and PbO, followed by PbSO4 (anglesite), PbS (galena) and Pb5(PO4)3Cl (pyromorphite). Airborne dust samples were collected on the tailings piles using a PIXE Cascade Impactor which separates aerosol fractions onto nine impactor stages ranging from 16µm to 0.06µm. These stages were then analyzed by PIXE to obtain elemental concentrations. Samples of non-vegetated and vegetated near-surface tailings were collected for bioaccessibility tests as well as for total metal content, grain size distribution, and Pb speciation using ESEM and synchrotron techniques. Both airborne dust and near-surface tailings samples underwent synchrotron microanalysis including microXRD for identification of microcrystalline compounds and microXRF for element mapping and metal ratio evaluation. Despite extensive oxidation of iron sulfide minerals in the near-surface tailings, galena persists as the most abundant Pb-bearing phase in the pH-neutral tailings. However, rims of cerussite and hydrocerussite forming alteration rims on galena grains have been identified throughout the tailings. In vitro bioaccessibility testing of Pb in the tailings resulted in 0-0.05% bioaccessible Pb in lung fluid and 23-69% bioaccessible Pb in the gastric fluid.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper investigates two distinct, but related, topics in machine vision. The first is the effect of lighting on the performance of a 2D vision-based inspection system. The lighting component of machine vision has often been overlooked; an attempt was made to quantify the impact on existing machine vision algorithms. The second topic explores the applications of a data-rich 3D vision sensor that is capable of providing depth data in a wide range of ambient lightning conditions for industrial applications. A focus is placed on inspection systems with the depth data provided by the sensor.&#xD;
Three basic lighting geometries were compared quantitatively based on discriminant analysis in an inspection task that checked for the presence of J-clips on an aluminum carrier. Two different LabVIEW® machine vision algorithms were used to evaluate backlight, bright field and dark field illumination on their ability to minimize the span of the pass (clip present) and fail (clip absent) sample sets, as well as maximize the separation between these sample sets. Results showed that there were clear differences in performance with the different lighting geometries, with over a 30% change in performance. Although it has long been accepted that the choice of lighting for machine vision systems is not a trivial exercise, this paper provides a quantitative measure of the impact lighting has on the performance of feature-based machine vision.&#xD;
The Microsoft Kinect® is a commercial vision sensor that can simultaneously provide a colour video stream, comparable to current webcam technologies, in addition to a depth stream that provides three-dimensional information of the camera’s field of view and is invariant to environmental lighting. An experiment was carried out to characterize the sensor’s accuracy and precision, and to evaluate its performance as an inspection system to determine the orientation of a wheel. Tests were also conducted to determine the effect that changes in the physical environment had on performance. These changes included camera height, lighting and surface material. Results of the experiment have shown that the sensor has an average precision of ±0.12 cm and average accuracy of 0.5 cm, both with less than a 30% change when varying physical features. A discriminant analysis was performed to measure inspection performance, which showed less than 30% change with set separation, but not for set span. No trends were apparent with the change in set span relating to the change in physical features.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Vazante Northern Extension is a continuation of the structurally controlled, hypogene nonsulfide zinc deposit from the Vazante Mine, Minas Gerais, Brazil.  The deposit is hosted in Neoproterozoic carbonates of the Serra do Poço Verde Formation located in the Brasília Fold Belt along the western margin of the São Francisco Craton. The Northern Extension deposit is hosted within a shear zone that strikes 200 to 225 and dips 30º-70º NW and is associated with substantial folding that occurred in the same deformation (D2) event and later transcurrent faulting. The shear zone is composed of a tectonic-hydrothermal breccia that can be subdivided into four types:  Type 1 Breccia– distally located from the willemite (Zn2SiO4) ore, weakly brecciated dolostone with some Fe-carbonate alteration; Type 2 Breccia–Strong Fe-carbonate alteration, intense brecciation; Type 3 Breccia–hematite replacement breccia, usually proximal to the Type 4 Breccia; Type 4 Breccia–willemite ore breccia, containing three generations of hypogene willemite (Zn2SiO4) as well as hematite (Fe2O3), and franklinite (ZnFe2O4). In the southern part of the deposit, late sulfide-rich veinlets are observed cutting the hypogene zinc silicate mineralization, and contain galena, sphalerite, native silver, covellite, and stromeyerite (Cu1-xAg1-xS). Geochemical studies conducted on the tectonic-hydrothermal breccia showed a strong regional signature enriched in Ag, Cd, Pb, and Zn. The presence of willemite as opposed to sphalerite and the ubiquity of hematite suggest that the zinc silicate mineralization has formed from the mixing between a low sulfur, acid, oxidizing metalliferous basinal brine similar to the fluids found in MVT deposits with a cooler, more oxidizing, meteoric fluid.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Kinesins are molecular motors that transport intracellular cargos along microtubules (MTs) and influence the organization and dynamics of the MT cytoskeleton. Their force-generating functions arise from conformational changes in their motor domain as ATP is bound and hydrolyzed, and products are released. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Kar3 kinesin forms heterodimers with one of two non-catalytic kinesin-like proteins, Cik1 and Vik1, which lack the ability to bind ATP, and yet they retain the capacity to bind MTs. Cik1 and Vik1 also influence and respond to the MT-binding and nucleotide states of Kar3, and differentially regulate the functions of Kar3 during yeast mating and mitosis. The mechanism by which Kar3/Cik1 and Kar3/Vik1 dimers operate remains unknown, but has important implications for understanding mechanical coordination between subunits of motor complexes that traverse cytoskeletal tracks. In this study, we show that the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans (Ca) harbors a single version of this unique form of heterodimeric kinesin and we present the first in vitro characterization of this motor. Like its budding yeast counterpart, the Vik1-like subunit binds directly to MTs and strengthens the MT-binding affinity of the heterodimer. However, in contrast to ScKar3/Cik1 and ScKar3/Vik1, CaKar3/Vik1 exhibits weaker overall MT-binding affinity and lower ATPase activity. Preliminary investigations using a multiple motor motility assay indicate CaKar3/Vik1 may not be motile. Using a maltose binding protein tagging system, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the CaKar3 motor domain and observed notable differences in its nucleotide-binding pocket relative to ScKar3 that appear to represent a previously unobserved state of the active site. Together, these studies broaden our knowledge of novel kinesin motor assemblies and shed new light on structurally dynamic regions of Kar3/Vik1-like motor complexes that help mediate mechanical coordination of its subunits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cette thèse étudie l’esthétique et l’éthique du témoignage dans le nouveau africain d’expression française voire le roman de la guerre. Au centre est l’enfant comme une catégorie sociale menacée et menaçante. &#xD;
L’enfant africain reste « l’arme » et le « soldat » de choix dans la littérature postcoloniale tout comme il était à l’époque coloniale. Cependant, sa mission est devenue encore plus meurtrière car il est maintenant recruté pour mener des combats militaires soutenus par des idéologies dépourvues de logique. &#xD;
Nous examinons donc les enjeux esthétiques et éthiques du choix de donner la parole à l’enfant pour témoigner de la violence postcoloniale dans les romans d’Emmanuel Dongala, de Tierno Monénembo, et d’Ahmadou Kourouma. Que ce soit par le biais d’une confrontation qui imite la scène judiciaire (Dongala), un débat philosophique, religieux et socio-politique autours du sujet de génocide (Monénembo), ou encore de l’emploi du rire carnavalesque pour témoigner de la tragédie personnelle et collective (Kourouma), nos auteurs font de l’enfant le point de référence à partir duquel l’Afrique pense le présent et l’avenir. Ce faisant, ils démontrent une diversité conceptuelle du témoignage littéraire tant sur le plan esthétique qu’éthique, que nous qualifions de changement paradigmatique dans la littérature d’Afrique noire d’expression française.&#xD;
Ce qui émerge est un double témoignage, d’une part, de l’auteur en tant que témoin des traces, d’autre part, de l’enfant (personnage) comme témoin-victime et/ou comme témoin-bourreau de la violence dans la « postcolonie ». &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>The law of Blockade is derived from customary law that developed during the height of eighteenth and nineteenth century naval warfare.  As a method of warfare that has the goal of crippling an adversary’s economy, blockade can devastate not only the military apparatus of a country, but the civilian population as well.  In this manner, it is a method of warfare that cannot distinguish in its effects between civilians and military objectives. &#xD;
The existing IHL framework governing blockade does not provide satisfactory protections to the civilian populations of affected states.  Starvation, malnutrition and disease are the consequential effects of a lengthy and effective blockade. &#xD;
A new approach to the law of blockade is required, one that will codify contemporary practice and obligate those engaging in blockade operations to ensure that humanitarian relief cannot be denied to affected civilian populations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The role of information is central to the study of corporate finance. In the real world where one party usually has more and better information, information asymmetry forms the basis of analysis in many key aspects of modern economics including contract theory and principle-agent problems. Although technology facilitates information flow, information continues to play an important role because we live in an environment in which there is more information and information that is more complex. Moreover, we are experiencing a fundamental shift towards a knowledge-based economy in which ideas and concepts, both in the form of information, gain importance.  This thesis examines the role of information as we make this transition in two separate settings: First in a “real impact” setting where knowledge generated at leading research universities spills over into firms nearby, and second, in a "traditional market" setting where analysts help disseminate information. &#xD;
In the post-industrial economy of the 21st century, innovation is the engine of economic growth. As a result, we increasingly value human capital and knowledge. Chapter 2 looks at the location of firms relative to knowledge centers and its impact on stock volatility. I argue that knowledge spillovers foster firm R&amp;D and find supporting evidence. My evidence is consistent with the classic models on the impact of human capital on economic growth (Nelson and Phelps, 1966).&#xD;
Chapter 3 examines the impact of knowledge and innovation on firms’ cash management policies. Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009) find that the average cash-to-assets ratio for firms more than doubles in the past decades and attribute it to changing firm characteristics. I identify innovation as a driving force behind these changes, resulting in firms holding more cash as a precaution.&#xD;
In Chapter 4, I study the investment value of information from analysts, or more specifically, analyst target prices. Due to potential conflicts of interest problems, the value that analysts provide to investors remains controversial. Moreover, since the information age is characterized by information overload, it is harder for investors to identify relevant information. I find that institutions trade in the same direction as the consensus target price movement.</dcterms:abstract>

The results of the study encompassed parent experiences regarding identification, programming, and perceptions of what it means to be gifted. Regarding the identification process itself, all the parents wanted a more transparent process, as all two were not told of what was happening during testing and had to rely on their children’s memories of what had happened. &#xD;
The research revealed two results regarding gifted programming. In Peggy’s case, the gifted program seemed disorganized and unstructured for her son, Darren. However, both Carrie and Sharon found the gifted program beneficial for their daughters, with Jenn (Carrie’s daughter) newly entering the program and Rachel (Sharon’s daughter) having experienced the gifted program (Enhanced Learning Class) for two years. Sharon also noticed differences between the two classes regarding increased communication with Rachel’s teacher in the gifted program. In previous years, Sharon remembered only being able to speak to teachers during rushed and generally uninformative parent-teacher interview nights.&#xD;
Both Sharon and Carrie saw more positives than negatives in the gifted program and believed that the program had benefitted their daughters. In contrast, Peggy chose not to enter her son into the gifted program and still stands by her decision. She believed not being in the program had helped mold her son into the man he was today. &#xD;
I was afforded the chance to listen to parents share with me their hopes, fears, and worries about their children. The research granted me a glimpse into the world of adolescents through their parents’ perspectives. Ultimately, this study reminded me that it is vital that we listen to parents and try to see things from their point of view. Listening to these parents’ stories has allowed me to see their views more clearly and has reinforced the need to ensure that we never underestimate the value of listening to people. &#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores how gay men make migration decisions through the life course. Recent studies of queer migration fall into two categories: (1) the role of the state and its heteronormative policies (e.g., family reunification-based immigration policy or criminalized homosexuality) and (2) queer migrations within countries, which employ narrative approaches but often presume a linear, usually rural-to-urban trajectory of migration among young queer people fleeing one place and emancipating themselves elsewhere. This study nuances the dynamics of migration decision-making among gay men, adopting a life course approach that examines how historical and social contexts, institutions, and individual circumstances and subjectivities convene to shape migration trajectories. For this research, I use the migration narratives gay men living in two cities—Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and Washington, D.C., U.S.A.—to capture the dynamics of migration decision-making in two different locational contexts. 48 interviews with Self-identified gay men (24 in each city) ground this study. Respondents were asked about their reasons for migrating, the community, home, and family environments in sending and receiving places, changes in aspects of health, well-being, and relationships before and after migrating, and aspects of everyday life after moving to Ottawa or Washington, D.C. The focus on two capital cities was adopted not only to examine places that draw internal migrants from a variety of places, but also to elaborate on the dynamics of gay life in two mid-sized cities overlooked in sexuality and space literature, and on the ways in which the institutions of these two “government towns” have simultaneously attracted and regulated gay men and other sexual minorities. I advance several findings in this study. First, coming-out migrations are both much less linear than traditionally conceived and are influenced more by the internal social dynamics of places than flat characterizations of places as homophobic or backward. Second, the dynamics of the places that gay men leave and come to are often quite literally embodied in terms of health and well-being. Third, the government town is a paradoxical place that has been queered by the emergence of gay rights-seeking and advocacy regimes, yet continues to regulate gay men’s lives in diffuse ways.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cost reduction is driving the development of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology for operations at lower temperatures (500 °C -700 °C) so as to allow the usage of cheaper balance-of-plant components and enhance the durability of the stack. However, lower temperatures adversely affect the overall performance of the cell and most notably that of the cathode. Development of cathode material exhibiting high performance at lower temperature is one of the goals of SOFC research and development. This thesis work is concerned with two distinct aspects of SOFC cathode development – one concerned with the stability of a recently studied cathode material, La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ (LBC), in CO2 containing atmosphere and another concerned with the development of methods for fabrication of reproducible electrodes and rapid electrochemical testing thereof. &#xD;
&#xD;
The study of reaction between LBC and CO2 was carried using a combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), ex-situ X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) of products from TGA experiments and in-situ high-temperature XRD of LBC-CO2 mixtures. The mass change observed during TGA was combined with ex-situ XRD analyses of solid material phases to deduce the overall reactions. In-situ XRD measurements allowed for studying the intermediate reaction products. Isothermal studies at different temperatures in pure CO2 yielded kinetics for the reaction between LBC and CO2. Overall reaction pathway was proposed from these data. In addition, experiments were carried out to determine the thermodynamic carbonate formation temperature at a fixed CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). From the thermodynamic analysis of carbonate formation temperature at three different pCO2, the standard state enthalpy and entropy for the carbonate formation reaction were determined. This work is the first known in-depth study of reaction between LBC and CO2. The second distinct contribution of this thesis is the demonstration of a test system framework for fabricating reproducible miniature electrodes and rapid testing thereof. In particular, inkjet printing method was used to create well defined geometry of porous electrode and micro-contact impedance spectroscopy setup (MICS) was used to study the electrode electrochemical kinetics. The feasibility with electrode fabrication and electrochemical testing methods were demonstrated through the study of multiple silver miniature electrodes printed on single chip made of yttria-stabilized zirconia single crystal wafer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In what follows, I engage in a wide-ranging discussion that captures the components of a metric of egalitarian justice (that is, the nature of the principles that specify what we aim to distribute equally) best designed to promote a minimally just state of affairs for not only, but principally, people with disabilities.  &#xD;
First, I examine precisely what it is we mean when we refer to “disability”.  I do this to ensure we have adequately deliberated over, and subsequently identified, the particular group of individuals for whom we aim to promote justice.  I conclude this section by endorsing the so-called ‘interactional model’ of disability, and denying the accuracy of the ‘social model’.  &#xD;
Second, I argue that while a focus on the capabilities approach can help provide us with an answer to the currency question that most closely approximates justice for the disabled, a minimally just state of affairs would nevertheless, fail to materialize should we opt to endorse such a conception of egalitarian justice.  I point to the inability of the capabilities approach to: i) accurately identify and calculate degrees of need or injustice; ii) be adequately sensitive to the diverse natural endowments when assessing need; iii) acknowledge the special moral importance of health as well as various other functionings.&#xD;
Finally, I conclude that a focus on first and foremost, condition, rather than opportunity, can better weather the challenges I present against a capabilities framework. More specifically, I suspect that a focus on both material conditions, and substantive freedoms or opportunities, is necessary to provide an adequate minimal conception of justice.  I will argue that there are a set of material conditions that are lexically prior to a group of opportunities that must also be afforded within a conception of justice, and that merely providing the opportunities for these conditions is inadequate.  &#xD;
In other words, I suggest that there are indeed, some functionings that must be assured within a minimal conception of justice, regardless of the choices exercised surrounding the securing of those functionings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis discusses a power electronics module (PEM) that is used to extract power from a human energy harvesting generator according to the user’s desired input power, and stores all of the extracted energy into an appropriately sized battery while staying within the charging limitations of the battery. The PEM can temporarily store the peak power produced by the generator allowing the reduction in the size of the battery required to the average power production level of the generator. The battery’s safety and longevity is maintained by charging them at the constant current and constant voltage rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
The design of the two-stage PEM, the requirements of the Energy Storage Capacitor (ESC) and battery size are discussed. The two controllers that control the PEM are explained and the different operating modes of the controllers are reviewed. A two-stage prototype digitally controlled average current mode control Boost converter and average current mode controlled Buck converter were designed and experimental waveforms were captured to test and validate the control theories used in the PEM. A Voltage Adaptive Gain compensator was used to optimize the closed loop response of both the Boost and Buck converters over their respective output and input voltage ranges. The DC efficiency of the prototype was measured with the peak efficiency of the Boost converter equal to 93% and the peak efficiency of the Buck converter measured at 93.7%. The total PEM system efficiency was measured at 87.9% at an input power level of 10 watts. The AC efficiency of the PEM was also measured with a peak efficiency of 91% with Vin = 15 V at Rin = 60 Ω.&#xD;
&#xD;
The software considerations for an embedded system, including power consumption and timing of real time events are reviewed. A software flow chart and timing diagram are provided to help visualize the sequence of the code.  A design chart for selection of the size and voltage rating of the ESC was created. An experimental comparison of a single stage design without energy storage capability and the current PEM design was performed, with a power limited source, in order to show the effectiveness of the PEM and controllers at maximizing the power extraction from the generator. The PEM design was able to extract 50% more power than the single stage converter without energy storage capability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from a “contractile/quiescent” to an “activated/synthetic” phenotype, with increased proliferative and migratory potential, is critical for the formation of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Agents that regulate intracellular levels of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) have been shown to reduce VSMC migration and proliferation, and to reduce intimal thickening in response to vascular damage. Interestingly, expression of a specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, namely PDE1C that is not expressed in contractile VSMCs is induced in activated human VSMCs and this directly impacts human VSMC phenotypic modulation. This study was undertaken to identify potential mechanism(s) by which PDE1C could impact VSMC phenotypic modulation and associated cellular functions. Overall, my data indicate that PDE1C controls store operated calcium (Ca2+) channel (SOCC) activity in activated human VSMCs. Indeed, expression of PDE1C increases store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which in turn activates PDE1C. This linkage between PDE1C and the SOCC complex increases cytosolic [Ca2+] and activates cell proliferation. A potential human VSMC SOCC, the Transient receptor potential channel 1 (TrpC1), was shown to physically associate with PDE1C in HEK293T cells expressing these proteins heterologously, as well as in human aortic Smooth Muscle Cells (HASMCs), which natively express these proteins. In HEK293T cells, I also identified association of adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6) and of the inositol-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)&#xD;
iii&#xD;
with TrpC1. Interaction between TrpC1 and PDE1C in HASMCs is decreased upon activation of SOCE, suggesting PDE1C is activated after release from TrpC1-PDE1C complex. From these studies I have established a potential mechanism by which PDE1C signaling impacts SOCE and shown that a TrpC1-PDE1C complex may be important.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The present thesis is devoted to an analysis of the possibility of Bose condensates&#xD;
supporting persistent currents in the ring geometry. Our analysis is based on an&#xD;
approach developed by F. Bloch which focuses on the ground state energy of the&#xD;

persistent currents are stable if the energy exhibits a local minimum at some nonzero&#xD;

a mean- eld approximation to show that persistent currents are stable at integral&#xD;
multiples of N*hbar, where N is the number of atoms in the system, provided a certain&#xD;
interaction parameter exceeds some critical value. These results are extended to a&#xD;
binary mixture of bosonic atoms and we show that the system is still capable of&#xD;
supporting persistent currents under certain conditions. Some of our conclusions&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>In a multi‐agent environment, animals must often adopt a stochastic mixed‐strategy approach to maximize reward and minimize costs; otherwise, competitive opponents can exploit predictable choice patterns. This thesis tested the hypothesis that the frontal eye field (FEF) are involved in selecting mixed‐strategy saccades. To this end, I recorded preparatory activity of single FEF neurons and manipulated the preparatory activity of neuronal ensembles within the FEF while a monkey played an oculomotor version of the mixed­‐strategy game ‘matching­‐pennies’. Each trial began with fixation on a central visual stimulus which was extinguished for a predetermined warning period before two targets were presented; one in the center and the other opposite the neuron’s response field. If both the monkey and the adaptive computer opponent chose the same target, the monkey received a liquid reward; otherwise the monkey received no reward for that trial. Like humans, monkeys chose each target in equal proportions but showed a ‘win‐stay’ bias in their choice patterns. Signal detection theory was used to analyze how accurately FEF preparatory activity predicted upcoming saccade choices. My data demonstrates that the accuracy by which FEF preparatory activity predicted upcoming strategic choices gradually increased as the time of saccade execution approached. This pattern of preparatory activity is consistent with an accumulation of evidence for each potential option towards a decision threshold. Subthreshold micro­‐stimulation biased mixed‐strategy saccadic choices, further suggesting a role for the FEF in choosing mixed­‐strategy saccades, albeit unexpectedly, in favor of saccades opposite the stimulation sites. Lastly, a particular advantage of my experiment is that the same monkey performed this task using neurophysiological experimentation in the FEF and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SCi). This allowed me to compare the timing and magnitude of neuronal selectivity and effects of subthreshold microstimulation across these two structures, during strategic decision‐making. My results indicate that the selection of mixed­‐strategy saccades occurred earlier and was greater in magnitude in the FEF compared to the SC, indicative of a decision process that occurs earlier in the frontal cortex before being relayed on to premotor regions in the midbrain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ultrasound-based tissue characterization has been an active field of cancer detection in the past decades. The main concept behind various techniques is that the returning ultrasound echoes carry tissue-dependent information that can be used to distinguish tissue types. Recently, a new paradigm for tissue typing has been proposed which uses ultrasound Radio Frequency (RF) echoes, recorded continuously from a fixed location of the tissue, to extract tissue-dependent information. This is hereafter referred to as RF time series.&#xD;
The source of tissue typing information in RF time series is not a well known concept in the literature. However, there are two main hypotheses that describe the informativeness of variations in RF time series. Such information could be partly due to heat induction as a result of consistent eradiation of tissue with ultrasound beams which results in a virtual displacement in RF echoes, and partly due to the acoustic radiation force of ultrasound beams resulting in micro-vibration inside tissue.&#xD;
In this thesis, we further investigate RF time series signals, collected at high frequencies, by analyzing the properties of the RF displacements. It will be shown that such displacements exhibit oscillatory behavior, emphasizing on the possible&#xD;
micro-vibrations inside tissue, as well as linear incremental trend, indicating the effect of heat absorbtion of tissue.&#xD;
The main focus of this thesis is to study the oscillatory behavior of RF displacements in order to extract tissue-dependent features based on which tissue classification is performed. Using various linear and nonlinear tools, we study the properties of such displacements in both frequency and time domain. Nonlinear analysis, based on the theory of dynamical systems, is used to study the dynamical and geometrical&#xD;
properties of RF displacements in the time domain.&#xD;
Using Support Vector Machine (SVM), different tissue typing experiments are performed to investigate the capability of the proposed features in tissue classification. It will be shown that the combination of such features can distinguish between different tissue types almost perfectly. In addition, a feature reduction algorithm, based on principle component analysis (PCA), is performed to reduce the number of features required for a successful tissue classification.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Greenstone belts have been recognized as highly prospective settings for high grade gold mineralization, and are host to a number of world class quartz-carbonate vein deposits, which account for approximately 13% of the cumulative global gold production.  In Canada, the Archean Red Lake Greenstone Belt hosts one of Canada’s richest gold districts (cumulative production to 2008 of over 24 M oz at 0.461 oz/t). Recently, there have been many discoveries in the district including the Gold Eagle occurrence (also referred to as the Bruce Channel Deposit and Cochenour project), which has an inferred resource of 2.7 million ounces of gold at an average grade of 11.04 g/t Au. The auriferous ore zones in the Gold Eagle Deposit are hosted in volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Balmer Assemblage (2.99-2.96 Ga), which is controlled by a major north trending, west dipping deformation corridor sub-parallel to the Balmer Assemblage-Bruce Channel Assemblage contact. The vertical extent of the mineralization is controlled by the “Cochenour Thrust” that extends into the adjacent Cochenour-Willans Mine.  The four main ore zones are structurally controlled within a NS, west dipping fault corridor and consist of: 1) the quartz-actinolite zone; 2) banded iron formations, 3) sulphide replacement zones and 4) footwall ore zones. The deposit has undergone pervasive pre-ore biotite and carbonate alteration, two gold events with the first associated with silicification and late actinolite-tremolite and the second associated with arsenopyrite sulphidation and iron-rich biotite and post-ore quartz and carbonate veinlets. Late faults (including black line faults) have contributed to the complexity and discontinuity of the ore bodies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Alto Chicama district, Central Andean Cordillera Occidental, La Libertad, northern Perú, hosts the 14 M oz, Miocene Lagunas Norte high-sulphidation epithermal Au-(Ag) deposit (Latitude 7° 56ʹ30ʺ S; Longitude 78°14ʹ50ʺ W), in addition to several important, epithermal and mesothermal precious ± base-metal vein systems and porphyry Cu-Au-(Mo) deposits and prospects. The district is underlain by lower Oligocene-to-Middle Miocene, subaerial, Calipuy Supergroup volcanic rocks, unconformably overlying Upper Jurassic – Lower Cretaceous marine sedimentary strata affected by late Eocene-early Oligocene thin-skinned fold and thrust deformation. Mineralization at Lagunas Norte is largely hosted by intensely-folded Valanginian Chimú Formation quartz arenite, but extends into overlying, weakly-deformed, Lower Miocene dacitic volcaniclastic deposits. Fold- and thrust-related deformation at the deposit, and subsequent magmatic and hydrothermal activity, were localized along a long-lived, crustal-scale cross-strike discontinuity. Hydrothermal activity at Lagunas Norte was associated with local extension within an overall regional compressive regime. Ore formation occurred during the terminal stages of andesitic-to-dacitic magmatism in the deposit area, immediately following the sector collapse of an adjacent volcanic centre, and during eruption of late-stage peripheral dacitic domes. Intense advanced-argillic alteration occurred in at least two major pulses over a ~ 0.9 m.y. period, implying repeated magma influx in a shallow subjacent chamber. The ensuing Au-(Ag)-pyrite-enargite deposition resulted from mixing of magmatic vapour with oxidized groundwaters, a process stimulated by the contiguous incision of a steep-walled valley-pediment. The local volcanic rocks record a transition from “normal arc” to higher-pressure “adakitic” magmatism, initiated during ore deposition at Lagunas Norte, but exhibited by the entire Calipuy arc in northern Perú, and interpreted to reflect the destabilization of plagioclase and stabilization of garnet in inferred lower-crustal magmas. The progressive depletion of 18O and D in meteoric water recorded in late Oligocene-to-Late Miocene hypogene and supergene minerals is in permissive agreement with major uplift from ~ 1000 m to over 3000 m a.s.l. during hydrothermal activity. Hydrothermal activity and related ore deposition at Lagunas Norte unambiguously predated, by at least 2 m.y., the impingement of the aseismic Nazca Ridge at the Perú Trench and the ensuing flattening of the subducting slab</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The evolution of Mobile Internet has led to the growth of bandwidth demanding applications like video streaming and social networking. The required data rates projected for such applications cannot be sustained by current cellular networks. New network architectures like Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE Advanced have been carefully engineered and introduced to fulfill such large data rates.&#xD;
The recent introduction of femtocells enabled high data rates and better coverage indoors, without the need for site establishment or upgrading the network infrastructure. Femtocells, however, will potentially suffer from major interference problems due to their expected dense and ad hoc deployment. The main contribution in this thesis is the introduction of a new and a very promising direction in deriving capable and efficient interference mitigation schemes, and comparing this direction to current techniques in the literature. Several works have studied the effect of interference on networks employing femtocells. In this thesis, we also survey such works and provide an overview of the elements considered in mitigating interference.&#xD;
We introduce a new scheme known for its optimality, and use it for frequency assignment in downlink femtocell networks. The algorithm is based on optimization search rather than greedy or heuristic methods. Experimental simulations will be shown to evaluate the proposed scheme against other schemes from the literature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ionomers bearing reactive ion-pair functionality are a novel class of materials that have been prepared.  The N-alkylation of N-vinylimidazole by poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) produced the reactive ionomer product in good yield, through a solvent-borne process.  Solvent-free conditions can also be used to produce reactive ionomers by the N-alkylation of N-vinylimidazole by poly(isobutylene-co-para-methylstyrene).  Characterization of these derivatives was carried out with the assistance of model compounds, and showed excellent agreement with 1H NMR spectra.  &#xD;
&#xD;
These reactive ionomers readily crosslink with peroxide at elevated temperatures and in the absence of peroxide they have excellent thermal stability.  The amount of crosslinking can be altered based on the vinyl content of the material, to target various applications.  N-alkylation of N-vinylimidazole can be carried out concurrently with a non-reactive N-alkylimidazole to achieve desired vinyl contents and tailor the physical properties of these materials.  These materials contain both ionic and covalent crosslink networks, and this hybrid network structure provides these materials with unique crosslink structures and stress relaxation properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conventional rubber fillers are compatible with these novel reactive ionomers.  Carbon black and precipitated silica have no adverse effects on the peroxide crosslinking of the elastomers and a constant peroxide loading can be used regardless of the filler loading.  Payne analysis shows good filler dispersion at low filler loading; however, there is some evidence of reticulate filler network formation at high filler loadings.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My goal in the present work is to add to our understanding of Socratic protreptic. I do so by focussing on psychological traits and qualities of character in Socrates’ young associates.   There are a number of candidates throughout the dialogues whose colourful depiction and careful psychological rendering offer us ample material for study.  In this study, I focus on two characters in particular.  First, I look at the presentation of Alcibiades in the final scene of Symposium.  Here I explore how Plato uses hubris and shame to explain the failure of protreptic in this gifted Socratic associate. Next, I look at Theaetetus as presented in the eponymously named dialogue.  His characterization as an able, intelligent and model candidate for philosophy gives us a penetrating insight into the Socratic ideal. Finally, I offer a reading of Eros in Phaedrus that examines the psychological dynamic between the lover and his beloved.  While a number of types of lovers are envisioned in this dialogue, I argue that if a beloved is to succeed in turning toward philosophy his lover must be a philosophical lover motivated by other-regarding care for his beloved’s soul.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It has been hypothesized that a reduction in the awareness of food skills in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox &amp; Addington (KFL&amp;A) community may be contributing to the increasing rates of overweight and obesity. To date, a valid and reliable tool for examining the level of food skills among a population has not been created. This study sought to create such a tool through achieving face validity from key stakeholders, content validity from an expert panel and construct validity through factor analysis. Upon ethics approval, the validated tool was piloted among a selected number of residents in the KFL&amp;A County through a telephone survey company, CCI Research. Results were examined and a Cronbach’s alpha was used to measure the internal consistency of the tool. This tool will contribute to subsequent studies that aim to identify gaps in food skills among targeted populations. Future studies may also use the data to guide individualized food skills education programs for residents.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: Body Mass Index (BMI) is a relative measure of whether an individual’s weight is at a healthy level for their height. A higher BMI is associated with an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the biologic mechanisms are not well understood. One proposed mechanism is through changes in global DNA methylation levels, particularly global DNA hypomethylation. Global DNA hypomethylation refers to lower levels of DNA methylation across the entire genome and hypermethylation refers to higher levels of DNA methylation across the entire genome. Changes in methylation levels can affect gene expression, genomic stability, and chromosomal structure. The methylation status of repetitive sequences in the DNA, such as LINE-1, is commonly used to represent a surrogate measure of global DNA methylation levels.&#xD;
Objectives: 1. Quantify and describe LINE-1 DNA methylation in leukocytes in a large sample of healthy volunteers. 2. Examine the relationship between BMI and LINE-1 DNA methylation levels. 3. Assess if sex is an effect modifier of the relationship between BMI and LINE-1 DNA methylation levels.&#xD;
Methods: A nested cross-sectional study was composed of 502 healthy volunteers between the ages of 20 and 50. Subjects completed a study questionnaire and provided blood samples for laboratory analyses. For each subject, DNA was isolated, underwent bisulfite conversion, and LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were measured by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) High-Resolution Melting Curve analysis. For the main analysis, a multivariate linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between BMI and LINE-1 DNA methylation levels, while controlling for confounders.&#xD;
Results: LINE-1 DNA methylation was normally distributed with a mean of 84.52% and a standard deviation of 3.19%. BMI (normal, overweight, and obese categories) was not significantly associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation levels in the adjusted linear regression model (p=0.41) and the interaction term between BMI and sex was not significant (p=0.50).&#xD;
Conclusions: LINE-1 DNA methylation was measured with a high degree of reliability in a sample of healthy volunteers. This research provided a description of LINE-1 DNA methylation levels in a large healthy population and showed that BMI was not associated with global DNA methylation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Antipredator defenses are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems. In the widely studied Chaoborus-Daphnia predator-prey system, Daphnia elicit a variety of phenotypically plastic responses to Chaoborus including: morphological, life history, and behavioral responses. While these inducible defenses benefit the prey, metal contaminants have been shown to interfere with chemosensory functions, thereby inhibiting antipredator defenses and decreasing survivorship. However, in lakes with a history of metal contamination, such as Kelly Lake in Sudbury, Ontario, there is evidence to suggest that Daphnia may have adapted to high, ambient copper concentrations. Using seven distinct Daphnia clones that were hatched from resting eggs from Kelly Lake, we examined morphological and life history traits when clones were exposed to either a nominal concentration of copper, kairomone, or a combination of both. As expected, clones displayed a variety of inducible responses in both kairomone-control and kairomone-copper treatments, which was attributed to genetic variability. Expected trade-offs in life history traits were not always observed, suggesting that inducible traits may be coupled. Furthermore, in contradiction to life history theory, one clone exhibited both increased somatic growth and increased reproductive output, indicating that clones likely adopted adaptive strategies to stressors rather than elicitng trade-offs in traditional traits. Our results indicate that environmentally relevant copper concentrations do not inhibit the induction of antipredator defenses in Daphnia from Kelly Lake, and we conclude that Kelly Lake Daphnia have developed an adaptive tolerance to copper. Adaptation to copper contamination may have implications for resilience in natural Kelly Lake populations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Species invasions are regarded as one of the most serious threats to biodiversity and native ecosystems and our ability to predict and quantify the impacts of invasive species has been an arduous task. Since the 1840s, the Laurentian Great Lakes have experienced an exponential increase in the number of identified invasive species. The most recent, Hemimysis anomala, is a littoral freshwater mysid native to the Ponto-Caspian region of Eastern Europe. They have been identified in all of the Great Lakes (except Lake Superior), the St. Lawrence River downstream to Québec City, and inland lakes in New York State and have the potential to destabilize energy flow in aquatic food webs. &#xD;
Using stable isotopes of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N), I evaluated nearshore food web structure at four sites along Lake Ontario’s north shore spanning a gradient of Hemimysis density to determine: 1) if dominant nearshore food web pathways change seasonally, and 2) whether fish exhibit a dietary shift towards consumption of Hemimysis. Also, the effects of Hemimysis consumption on the growth of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were quantified using bioenergetics modeling and four predictive feeding scenarios simulating Hemimysis incorporation into yellow perch diets.&#xD;
My results suggest Hemimysis are being incorporated into diets of round gobies, alewife and small yellow perch, which has resulted in a trophic lengthening of the food web. As Hemimysis populations continue to establish and stabilize, fish may incorporate this species into their diets at a higher rate. Based on the bioenergetic modeling, the incorporation of Hemimysis into the diets of yellow perch will have a negative impact on their growth. These negative impacts on fish growth will likely be exacerbated when the limited seasonal availability of Hemimysis, patchy distribution and predator avoidance behaviours, are considered. These results have implications surrounding the sustainability of the Great Lakes fishery as Hemimysis will likely increase competition with young fish for food and fish consumption of this new invasive may lead to reduced fish growth.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Childhood and youth obesity is a global public health issue. International studies can provide research findings and training opportunities to expand knowledge and initiate action on this issue. This manuscript-based thesis is composed of three studies that aim to better address cross-national differences in the determinants of childhood and youth obesity and the effectiveness of an obesity research capacity building initiative.     &#xD;
The first manuscript examined cross-national differences in the chain food retail environment surrounding schools, student lunchtime eating behaviours, and the relations between these variables in 13-15 year old youth from Canada, Scotland, and the US. More chain food retailers were located within 1 km from schools in the US than in the other countries, yet fewer American students ate their lunch at a food retailer. An increase in the number of food retailers located close to schools was related to eating behaviours in Canadian students only.  &#xD;
The second manuscript examined differences in the relationship between physical fitness and obesity measures within 10-13 year old children from three countries that sit at the early (Kenya), mid (Mexico), and end (Canada) stages of the nutrition and physical activity transitions. Negative relationships between aerobic fitness and obesity were observed in children from all three countries. Mexican children with low aerobic fitness levels had higher obesity values than did Canadian and Kenyan children. &#xD;
The third manuscript evaluated an obesity research capacity building initiative. This initiative consisted of a short course on obesity research developed by Canadians for early career researchers from Mexico. Student attendance and feedback demonstrated excellent reach. Dose delivered was high with all 21 course sections taught as planned. In the year following the course, students used a diversity of skills learned in the course suggesting that dose received was good. Barriers to research identified by participants included a lack of devoted research time and money to conduct research. &#xD;
The findings from this thesis contribute to an improved understanding of the determinants of obesity in children and how these determinants vary across countries. These findings also provide evidence that researchers from developed countries can help develop obesity research capacity in developing countries.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Si seulement j’avais plus de pouvoir (Faust de Goethe), le pacte que j’ai conclu était réversible (Raphaël de La Peau de chagrin), je faisais une grande découverte (Balthazar de La Recherche de l’absolu), j’avais obtenu ce que je souhaitais (Heathcliff des Hauts de Hurlevent), je tuais Moby Dick (le capitaine Achab), mon époux était à la hauteur (Madame Bovary), je pouvais établir avec certitude que j’étais un grand homme comme Napoléon (Raskolnikov de Crime et châtiment), j’agirais différemment. La question que posent, entre autres, ces romans est de savoir si les raisons invoquées sont légitimes ou si elles représentent, pour le sujet, une excuse pour échapper à une réalité déprimante. Le fait que les écrivains ci-dessus fassent s’autodétruire, ou presque, leur héros incline à pencher pour la seconde alternative et à conclure que les moyens employés par ces derniers pour améliorer leur condition ne sont pas viables. Ils nous amènent à identifier dans la « nature humaine » des cercles vicieux et vertueux : tarder à employer tous les moyens défendables possibles pour améliorer son existence incite à refuser d’accepter que tout ne dépend pas de soi – l’origine, semble-t-il, de ce que Balzac appelle les « idées tyranniques » – et vice versa, mais ne pas laisser les problèmes présents nous empêcher d’être la personne que l’on veut vraiment être incite à bien résoudre les problèmes auxquels on fait face, et vice versa. En d’autres termes, une vision large des choses ne peut se maintenir à long terme sans une volonté forte, et vice versa. Ce dernier cercle est en essence le principe de l’éternel retour tel que l’a exposé Nietzsche. La psychologie cognitive et comportementale qui traite avec un certain succès les comportements à caractère obsessionnel comme les pensées envahissantes, l’anorexie mentale et le jeu compulsif fait appel aux mêmes moyens que préconisaient déjà à leur façon les philosophes comme Descartes, Spinoza, Hume et Nietzsche pour atteindre une vie bonne, nommément la perspicacité, l’habituation et l’action à bon escient, ceux-là même dont les romanciers cités plus haut ont privé leur héros. La pulsion autodestructrice qui anime les sujets obsessionnels semble ainsi mieux s’expliquer par une double incapacité, qui s’alimente elle-même, à tolérer la situation présente et à employer des moyens raisonnablement réfléchis de la modifier que par une tendance vers la réduction absolue des tensions que Freud a postulée pour rendre compte de la répétition sans fin de comportements irrationnels que le principe de plaisir ne peut adéquatement expliquer. Dans ce qui suit, nous montrerons comment le phénomène des idées tyranniques met en lumière les rapports étroits qui existent entre l’humeur et le jugement, et comment ces rapports pourraient expliquer en partie des troubles mentaux comme l’anorexie mentale, le jeu compulsif ou les ruminations mentales.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Project work has gained a prominent place in research for its significant educational potential (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Fallik et al., 2008). Teachers, however, have not been providing project work with a prominent place in the elementary classroom (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Fallik et al., 2008; Rogers et al., 2010; Tse, Lam, Lam, &amp; Loh, 2005). To encourage and support teachers in practicing Project-Based Learning (PBL), we need to understand what motivates teachers to enact PBL, the challenges they face in doing so, and ways to support teachers in overcoming these challenges. To examine teachers’ lived experiences in enacting student-centered project work, the current study used the method of participatory action research (PAR). This method included the active participation of a teacher (Megan) and me (the principal researcher) in the design, enactment, and reflection upon a constructivist, whole-class project in an eastern Ontario Grade 5 classroom. The study was structured around two research questions: (1) what did we perceive as challenges and benefits of organizing and enacting a student-centered project, and (2) how did we perceive that our collaboration in organizing, enacting, and reflecting upon this project impacted our thinking and practices with regard to project work? Megan’s and my reflections were collected over the course of the project through two semi-structured interviews, diary writings, a pre-structured planning journal, and three semi-structured discussions. Megan and I perceived project work as beneficial to students’ engagement and learning. Enacting the project was challenging, as we lacked the management and organizational skills to enact project work efficiently, and we possessed a strong desire to control the direction of the project. Megan and I were further challenged by students’ lack of skills and comfort with the project’s demands and the lack of school support and time we needed for the project. Collaboratively experiencing and reflecting upon the project demonstrated how essential these challenges were in increasing Megan’s and my comfort, appreciation, understanding, and skills in enacting project work. Based on these findings, the study encourages teachers to collaboratively design, experience, and reflect upon project work in the context of their classrooms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
Isobaric (200 MPa) experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of H2O alone or in combination with P, S, F or Cl on the phase relations and elemental and oxygen isotopic partitioning between immiscible silicate melts in the systems Fe2SiO4-Fe3O4-KAlSi2O6-SiO2, Fe3O4-KAlSi2O6-SiO2 and Fe3O4-Fe2O3-KAlSi2O6-SiO2 +/- plagioclase (An50).  Experiments were heated in a newly-designed rapid-quench internally-heated pressure vessel at 1075, 1150 or 1200 oC for 2 hours.  Water alone or in combination with P, S, or F significantly increases the temperature and composition range of two-liquid fields at fO2= NNO and MH buffers.  Water-induced suppression of liquidus temperatures, considered with the effects of pressure on  two-liquid fields stability in silicate melts, suggests that liquid phase separation may occur in some volatile-rich silicate magmas at pressures up to 2GPa. Two-liquid partition coefficients for Fe, Si, P and S correlate well with the degree of polymerization of the SiO2-rich conjugate melts and the data can be applied to assess the involvement of  liquid-phase separation in the genesis of coexisting volatile-rich magmas.&#xD;
The partitioning of  trace concentrations of selected HFSE, REE and transition elements between immiscible experimental volatile-rich melts at 1200 oC, 200 MPa has been determined at QFM, NNO and MH oxygen buffers.  Water generally increases the partitioning of HFSE, REE and transition elements into the Fe-rich melt.  Water alone, or combined with P or S, produces nearly parallel partitioning trends for HFSE and REE.  Absolute partitioning values of transition elements are strongly dependent on the network-modifier composition of the melt.&#xD;
18O in experimental immiscible melts with H2O or H2O and P or S partitions preferentially into the felsic conjugate melt (δ18O felsic melt- δ18O mafic melt values range from 0.4 to 0.8 permil) consistent with observations in anhydrous immiscible silicate melts. &#xD;
The expansion of the P-T-X-fO2 stability ranges of two- or three-liquid fields observed in the experimental melts demonstrates that liquid-immiscibility may be an important process in the evolution of some volatile-rich natural magmas.  The results support an immiscible petrogenetic origin for some iron-oxide dominated, Kiruna-type, ore-deposits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The heterogeneous metallocene catalyst is becoming a very competitive industrially due to its ability to produce tailor-made polymers. The main advantage of the metallocene polymer product is the narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD) and the systematic comonomer distribution along the polymer chains. Therefore, the metallocene polymer product has well-defined mechanical and optical properties. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effects of the silica support on the reaction kinetics and micro properties of the heterogeneous metallocene catalyst system. These investigations include studying the influence of the pore volume, surface area, particle size distribution, and the surface chemical characteristics of silica support on the catalyst performance.&#xD;
The experiments showed that the silica type has an influence on the kinetic behavior. For instance, silica with a lower pore volume shows an induction period when compared with higher pore volume silicas. Moreover, the silica type has a clear influence on catalyst activity and polymer morphology. The smallest silica particles produced the highest activity among the other sizes regardless of silica type. The supported catalysts were characterized and linked to the silica type and size in terms of catalyst activity and polymer morphology. Each catalyst in terms of silica type behaved similarly regardless of type of alkylaluminum used in the formulation.&#xD;
The micro properties of the produced polymers, such as MWD and chemical composition distribution (CCD), were studied to understand the effects of the type and size of silica support and co-catalyst on these properties. The silica types showed no effect on the MWD, but had a slight effect on the CCD. Silica with a high pore volume had a stronger more comonomer response. However, the silica particle size had an influence on the CCD, with less comonomer incorporation observed with smaller silica particles. Finally, triethylauminum was observed to produce polymer with a different MWD when compared with other alkylaluminums. However, all alkylaluminums used in this work had no effect on the CCD of the produced polymer regardless of silica type.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates the following research questions: (1) What is open source project governance and how can it be conceptualized? (2) What is the relationship between the dimensions of OSS governance and the specific purposes that governance is hypothesized to serve in open source projects? (3) How do the major configurations of governance dimensions affect the performance of open source projects?&#xD;
&#xD;
Two studies were conducted to answer these questions: an exploratory qualitative study and a survey study. In the qualitative study, we clearly defined, developed, and validated the various dimensions of OSS governance. This allowed for the identification of a limited number of configurations of governance dimensions that most frequently occur in open source projects. We found that a patterning in governance dimensions takes place because dimensions are in fact interdependent. Therefore, only a fraction of the theoretically conceivable configurations of governance dimensions appear to be viable and were observed among a range of open source projects. This provided us with a preliminary understanding of how these dimensions configure to create three distinct configurations of project governance which were labeled as follows: Open Communities, Managed Communities, and Defined Communities. &#xD;
&#xD;
In the quantitative survey, we first validated these configurations of governance using cluster analysis and then tested the relationships between these configurations (clusters) and the specific purposes that governance is hypothesized to serve in open source projects, namely solve collective action dilemmas, solve coordination problems, and create a climate for project excellence, while assessing their influence on the performance of projects. The results confirmed the presence of three main governance configurations (clusters) and also showed that open source projects that adopt a Defined Community approach to governance were the most successful. In these types of projects, the combination of a tightly managed software development process with a decentralized community management structure was found to create a balance between anarchy and control that allows these projects to benefit from one of the virtues of open source development, the open contribution and participation of a wide variety of talented developers, while avoiding the pitfalls of an uncontrolled and scattered development process.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Motherhood is a contemporary topic that affects the majority of women in Germany, and yet the experiences and struggles of working mothers often remain taboo or are in conflict with social conventions and established traditions. If one adds to this mothers’ wishes or needs to pursue a career, challenges occur: conflicting priorities, the family structure, social perceptions and pressures, and reconciling and balancing the multi-faceted demands on a woman’s life. „Eine Poetik der Mutterschaft“ breaks the silence around these concern and explores the poeticity of motherhood in German literature and the artwork of two female authors, who pursued their personal and career goals and did not conform to the ideal image of motherhood in Germany: Else Lasker-Schüler (1869-1945) and Marie Luise Kaschnitz (1901-1974). Both women were working mothers, who had different motherhood experiences and challenges. The dissertation begins with a close look at these authors’ biographies, their personal experiences of pregnancy, birth, and motherhood. Next comes an analysis of the literary and artistic works with examples of how motherhood informs their works and creative process, how images of maternity are utilized to communicate a message, and some metaphorical meanings of motherhood in the selected works. &#xD;
I argue that the creative process is a parallel to motherhood itself, and I show how this is connected to the metapoeticity of the works. This dissertation highlights the ways in which Lasker-Schüler and Kaschnitz, like other historical working mother-artists such as Käthe Kollwitz, become role models and inspire women in contemporary times, enabling women to draw strength from each other and to continue to stretch the boundaries of traditional and ideal perceptions of mothers and motherhood.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this dissertation, I investigate the impact of institutional investors on security prices and corporate policies, and offer a new perspective on the vital role that institutional investors play in the modern capital market. Specifically, on the impact on security price movements, I design a new measure of stock-level sentiment based on mutual fund publically disclosed portfolio information and provide a new dimension to better predict stock returns. A trading strategy based on the new sentiment metrics can generate an annualized alpha of 21.27%.  The abnormal returns cannot be explained by the time-varying expected returns and transaction costs, and can be best explained by mutual fund overreactions. Hence, my findings can be interpreted as a new anomaly in a new era-when institutional investors are the marginal traders. On the impact on corporate policy side, I document two pieces of new empirical evidence on the importance of long-term institutional holdings: the entrenchment effect of long-term institutional holdings in the context of corporate financing decisions and the active monitoring role of long-term institutional investors in the context of international firms’ accounting qualities. Combined with previous studies which favour a long-term institutional investor, the evidence on the cost side of long-term holding I document here can serve as the first call for an optimal investment horizon for firms operating in the U.S.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Interleukins, cytokines secreted by leukocytes, are predominant messengers modulating immune responses. Interleukin-27 (IL-27), a key immunomodulatory cytokine, functions to induce both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in various immune cells. IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine, composed of IL-27p28 and Epstein-Bar virus induced gene 3 (EBI3) subunits, and binds to a receptor composed of IL-27Rα (WSX-1) and gp130. Initial studies focused on describing IL-27 functions in skewing T helper cell development to a Th1 response, with few reports on functions in monocytes. Thus, in this thesis, I aimed to characterize novel functions of IL-27 in innate immune responses of monocytes. I initially established that IL-27 induced a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile (IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNF-α) mediated via STAT1/3 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Further investigation led to the discovery that IL-27 could enhance LPS responses via upregulation of TLR4 expression and NF-κB signaling. Together, these studies described novel signaling mechanisms (NF-κB and JAK/STAT crosstalk) and gene targets (cytokines and TLR4) of IL-27 that drive inflammatory responses. In continuing the quest for novel IL-27 functions in innate immunity, I reported IL-27 can upregulate expression of the IFN-responsive, antiviral protein called BST-2. My results showing IL-27-induced expression of BST-2 mRNA and cell surface protein were supported by previous studies reporting IL-27-induced expression of other antiviral molecules. Furthermore, previous studies showed IL-27 could inhibit HIV replication via antiviral gene induction, pointing to potential for IL-27 immunotherapies. In light of the posited role for IL-27 in therapeutics, it became inherently critical to describe how IL-27 functions in the setting of HIV infection. Thus, in my final thesis chapters, I described the effect of HIV infection on IL-27 expression and functions, addressing a substantial void in literature. Interestingly, a trend of decreased IL-27 expression and significant impairment of IL-27-induced gene expression was observed in HIV infection. Therefore, decreased circulating IL-27 and decreased IL-27 responsiveness may collectively dysregulate IL-27 function in HIV. This thesis describes novel, IL-27-driven, proinflammatory responses, and highlights impairment of IL-27 function in HIV infection. This work bridged a gap in knowledge of IL-27 functions in monocytes and highlighted multifaceted mechanisms underlying immunoregulation by IL-27.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 1974, H. Ruderman posed the following question: If $(2^m-2^n)|(3^m-3^n)$, then does it follow that $(2^m-2^n)|(x^m-x^n)$ for every integer $x$? This problem is still open. However, in 2011, M. R. Murty and V. K. Murty showed that there are only finitely many $(m,n)$ for which the hypothesis holds. In this thesis, we examine two generalizations of this problem.  The first is replacing 2 and 3 with arbitrary integers $a$ and $b$.  The second is to replace 2 and 3 with arbitrary algebraic integers from an imaginary quadratic field.  In both of these cases we have shown that there are only finitely many $(m,n)$ for which the hypothesis holds.  To get the second result we also generalized a result by Bugeaud, Corvaja and Zannier from the integers to imaginary quadratic fields.  In the last half of the thesis we use the abc conjecture and some related conjectures to study some exponential Diophantine equations.  We study the Pillai conjecture and the Erd\"{o}s-Woods conjecture and show that they are implied by the abc conjecture and that when we use an effective version, very clean bounds for the conjectures are implied.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis presents a parallel-series two-bridge DC/DC converter topology with the ability to operate with ZVS over a wide input and load range. The intended application is power conditioning systems (PCS) of photovoltaic (PV) arrays used in hybrid renewable energy system architectures. The proposed topology provides two degrees of freedom which allows the PV-PCS to regulate the DC-link voltage, while tracking the maximum power point (MPP) of the PV array. This topology distributes the main power into two bridges and the phase-shift between the two bridges and provides another degree of freedom for the PCS to track the MPP. The proposed topology is also able to achieve soft-switching over a wide range. The power conditioning system shows a modular structure to efficiently transfer the power to the load as the main power is divided between two bridges. In addition, the proposed control scheme provides complete decoupling between the input side controller from the output side controller in order to perform MPPT and regulate the the DC-link voltage simultaneously. A 2kW Experimental prototype has been provided to validate the feasibility and performance of the converter. Experimental results prove that the converter is able to regulate the DC-link voltage and track the maximum power extracted from the PV array simultaneously.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A steady-state simulation of a diesel-fuelled SOFC system was developed using a process simulation software package (VMGSim).  The system was studied by conducting a sensitivity analysis of six independent variables (steam to carbon ratio, oxygen to carbon ratio, fuel utilization, air utilization, reformer pre-heater approach temperature and cathode temperature to the SOFC) and their effect on three response variables (net system efficiency, stack efficiency, system exhaust temperature).  The steam to carbon ratio, fuel utilization and air utilization were the most influential independent variables and thus affected the greatest change in the performance metrics.  Secondly, a multi-variable study was carried out on the most influential variables and constrained optima for the efficiencies (45% net system, 47% stack) and system exhaust temperature (78 degrees Celsius) were obtained.      &#xD;
For the second part of this work, a steam reforming heat-exchange reactor was modeled using COMSOL.  The reactor performance was assessed on the basis of selectivity and residence time for a given conversion.  Both the kinetic models of Parmar et al. (2010) and Shi et al. (2009) for catalytic diesel steam reforming were applied and compared.  Differences in performance were attributed to differences in the catalyst support and the reaction mechanisms used for deriving the reforming rate expressions.  Finally, a proof of concept multi-scale modeling and design tool was developed by integrating the CFD model with the process simulation.  Two-way communication between four different software components; COMSOL, VMGSim, Matlab and Microsoft Excel was achieved.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>I hypothesize that specific aspects of education are central to the revitalization of culture amongst Aboriginal peoples in Ontario, and that this revitalization is integral to cultural continuity. I will show the relationship between key aspects of education and cultural revitalization as I track and assess the impacts of Ontario's high school Native Studies suite of courses. The key aspects are: the ability to generate and control content, the content itself (who it targets and serves and how it is applied) and how innovative ideas are implemented, through what processes and with whose help. &#xD;
 	Recent trends emerging from the analysis of Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) data on the implementation of its suite of ten Native Studies high school courses suggest that the consistent efforts of several generations of First Nations, Métis and Inuit educators working behind the scenes since the late 1960s have resulted in significant and meaningful increases in the number of Native Studies courses offered, the number of schools and school boards offering them, and the number of students enrolling.  &#xD;
	Considering the context of Aboriginal education in Ontario since the 1960s these general results may certainly be interpreted as progressive. I discuss seven catalysts that have had an indisputable influence over the ability of Indigenous educators to exercise an increasing degree of control over the Ontario Ministry of Education Native Studies curricula.  While acknowledging the perspectives of scholars such as Taiaiake Albert, Maria Battiste, Pamela Palmater and Marie Brant-Castellano who argue for “Indian control of Indian education” based on the inherent right of Indigenous peoples to self-government - enshrined in Canada’s “Constitution Act” (1982) - my findings indicate that, given the resources and opportunity to lead the creation of Native Studies courses in Ontario, many Indigenous educators, leaders and communities have opted to take proactive roles in the process, all the while participating in the struggle for the Indigenous constitutionally-inherent right to control all aspects of their education. I argue that we are seeing a resurgence of Indigenous cultures in Canada, and more particularly in Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for assessing the efficacy of a medical treatment.  However, the efficacy demonstrated by trials does not automatically translate into a comparable level of effectiveness in the real world.  RCTs may vary from routine clinical practice in several ways; the patients themselves, the delivery of the treatment, and the collateral care provided during treatment.  Phase IV studies that assess outcomes of a treatment in the real-world provide a mechanism for assessing treatment effectiveness. &#xD;
Objectives:  The objectives of this study were to: describe the characteristics of patients receiving standard, first-line, palliative, platinum-doublet chemotherapy (PPDC) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in routine care; describe the effectiveness of PPDC in terms of wellbeing and symptom control; identify patient characteristics associated with change in wellbeing with treatment; and compare reported treatment efficacy to the effectiveness observed in the current study. &#xD;
Methods:  This study was a retrospective cohort study of patients treated at Ontario’s Regional Cancer Centres (RCCs).  Patients’ Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) scores were used to describe patients’ symptomatic status and wellbeing.  The proportions of patients whose wellbeing improved, remained stable or deteriorated at two months were calculated.  Using logistic regression, patient and disease characteristics were assessed for association with change in wellbeing at two months (dichotomized as improved/stable and deteriorated).  In comparing trial results to this study, adjustments were made for differences in case mix. &#xD;
Results:  Patients’ median age was 65, 55% were male and the majority had stage IV disease and adenocarcinoma histology.  Patients’ baseline wellbeing and symptomatic status varied widely.  61.3% (95% CI: 55.8 – 66.6%) of patients had improved or stable wellbeing at two months.  Histology and baseline wellbeing score were associated with change in wellbeing at two months. &#xD;
The case mix adjusted estimates of the proportion of improved/stable patients (60.0% (95% CI 54.5 – 65.3) and 60.5% (95% CI 54.9 – 65.6)) were consistent with the proportion of patients achieving general quality of life improvement or stabilization in RCTs (55% and 63%).  &#xD;
Conclusion:  The effectiveness of PPDC delivered in Ontario’s RCCs is consistent with that expected based on the results of RCTs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many Indigenous leaders and public figures, as well as scholars of Indigenous culture and history, assert that non-Indigenous ignorance of Indigenous realities has systematically disadvantaged Indigenous peoples in Canada, weakened Canadian society, and makes it impossible to address the conditions of life for Indigenous people in Canada in a sustained or coherent way. Additionally, for many scholars silence and unawareness are deeply linked to colonialism and are implicated in the maintenance of unequal social relations. Drawing from this literature, I contend that in Canada, silence around Indigenous peoples and issues works as a spatial tactic of exclusion. I argue that unawareness is bound up in interests that work to render Indigenous peoples absent from the concerns of modern Canada, and that these interests are deeply intertwined with national and provincial identities such that silences around Indigenous peoples and issues are expressed differently in each Canadian province and territory. This thesis explores the nature of public unawareness of Indigenous realities in Québec. Using the remarkable public voice resource generated by the 2007 Reasonable Accommodation Commission in Québec, a public inquiry into Québec citizens’ opinions about the nature of Québec identity and its relationship to the integration of minorities in the province, I analyze the Commission’s mandate and geographical movements, as well as over 750 written briefs submitted to the Commission. I argue that unawareness of Indigenous realities is widespread in Québec and is unconstrained by participants’ social positions, interests, arguments, or level of engagement with the question of indigeneity in Québec. Though the Commission worked to exclude Indigenous content (and perhaps peoples) from its activities from the outset, eight Indigenous leaders submitted briefs and spoke powerfully and critically of the Commission’s exclusion. These authors point out that the question of Indigenous rights is far from settled, that the Commission’s and Quebecers’ unawareness of Indigenous realities is complicit in a long history of exclusion in Québec and in Canada, and assert that Quebecers will not be able to address their anxiety around immigration in any meaningful or coherent way until Indigenous rights are respected. In my focus on the Reasonable Accommodation Commission, I suggest the particular nature of exclusion in Québec. While exclusion of Indigenous peoples is a Canadian universal, its flavour varies. In this case, the provincial jurisdiction is important.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zirconium and its alloys have been extensively used in both heavy and light water nuclear reactors. Like other Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) materials, e.g. magnesium, zirconium alloys develop different textures during manufacturing process which result in highly anisotropic materials with different responses under different loading conditions. Slip and twinning are two major deformation mechanisms during plastic deformation of zirconium. This dissertation uses various experimental techniques and a crystal plasticity scheme in the finite element framework to study deformation mechanisms in HCP materials with an emphasis on twinning in Zircaloy-2. The current study is presented as a manuscript format dissertation comprised of four manuscript chapters. After a literature review in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 reports steps in developing a crystal plasticity finite element user material subroutine for modeling deformation in Zircaloy-2 at room temperature. It is shown in Chapter 3 that the developed rate dependent equations are capable of capturing evolution of key features, e.g., texture, lattice strains, and twin volume fractions, during deformation by twinning and slip. Chapter 4 reports various assumptions and approaches in modeling twinning where results are compared against neutron diffraction measurements from the literature. It is shown in Chapter 4 that the predominant twin reorientation scheme can explain texture development more precisely than the other schemes discussed. Chapter 5 and 6 are two connected chapters where in the first one the formation of twins is studied statistically and in the second one, local inception and propagation of twins is studied. Numerical results of these two chapters are compared with 2D electron backscattered diffraction measurements, both carried out by the author and from the literature. Results from these two connected chapters emphasize the important role of grain boundary geometry and stress concentration sites on twin nucleation and growth. The four manuscript chapters are followed by summarizing conclusions and suggestions for future work in Chapter 7.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis argues that the honour of the Crown and the reconciliation agenda are engaged in the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders, given grossly disproportionate Aboriginal incarceration rates and their underlying causes, including socio-economic problems, community breakdown and cultural dislocation that arise at least partly from the history of Crown-Aboriginal interaction.   Such an interpretation facilitates a new relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples and will contribute to the rehabilitation of the rule of law.  I address not only the underlying legal questions pertaining to the engagement of the honour of the Crown and the reconciliation agenda in sentencing Aboriginal offenders, but also interrogatories relating to the role of morality in the law and the rule of law for Aboriginal peoples in the sentencing context.  Fundamentally, the honour of the Crown and reconciliation principles are interpreted and applied such that the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders can accommodate and attempt to ameliorate colonialist history.  This distinctive history produces a legal requirement of reconciliation and honour-based governance if the rule of law is to be a reality for Aboriginal peoples in Canada.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code and Gladue analysis provide a vehicle for the courts to inject the honour of the Crown into the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders, albeit at one remove.  However, the honour of the Crown requires a vigorous Gladue type analysis by judges sentencing Aboriginal offenders regardless of the existence of section 718.2(e).   Canada must be prepared to accept responsibility and directly address some of the fallout in the criminal justice system from the history of Crown / Aboriginal relations.   The honour of the Crown requires a different sentencing approach for Aboriginal offenders independent of section 718.2(e) and reconciliation is an interpretive normative principle underlying the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders, shaping the honour of the Crown and infusing the rule of law for Aboriginal peoples.  Aboriginal offender rehabilitation needs to go hand in hand with the rehabiltation of the rule of law for Aboriginal peoples as a pivotal component of reconciliation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The conflict in Afghanistan which has predominated much of the first decade of the new millennium has resulted in the creation of a new generation of Canadian war veterans. This veteran culture will include Canadian military personnel who were either directly or indirectly involved in active peacekeeping duty during their careers. Some of these men and women choose retirement to pursue other interests or second careers in the civilian world. Others are facing involuntary early retirement due to permanent medical or combat-related stress factors, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Medical release, in combination with age and socioeconomic circumstances can result in adjustment difficulties (Sweet, Stoler, Kelter, &amp; Thurrell, 1989; Westwood, Black &amp; McLean, 2002).&#xD;
	 A qualitative study of the experiences of ten Canadian soldiers in transition from military life to civilian education environments over a three-month period from November, 2011 to February, 2012 was carried out. The following themes emerged as major areas of discussion: transition issues, unanticipated transitions and non-events, camaraderie and the veteran identity, transferable skills, and support and resources. The transition model developed by Schlossberg and presented by Goodman, Schlossberg, and Anderson (2006) was used as a guiding theory to develop an understanding of the transition experience in reference to this new population of Canadian military veterans. Theories of cross-cultural transition were used as a framework for discussion. Recommendations for facilitating transition through education for Canadian soldiers are included.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ce mémoire explore l’identité fragmentée dont souffrent les héroïnes dans Le ciel de Bay City, de Catherine Mavrikakis, et dans Le livre d’Emma, de Marie-Célie Agnant et établit que cette fragmentation prend source dans un legs traumatique, soit la Shoah et l’esclavagisme transatlantique. Dans la famille ou la collectivité des héroïnes, et durant des générations, ces traumatismes ont été passés sous silence ou n’ont pas été intégrés au discours dominant. Par conséquent, l’histoire éclipsée hante le présent des protagonistes. Ce mémoire explore les différents bris dans la filiation symbolique. En tenant compte de théories féministes, postcoloniales et psychanalytiques, il s’intéresse aux façons dont les héroïnes composent avec ce passé inscrit dans l’horreur, entre autres à l’utilisation du corps ainsi qu’à la récupération de ce passé. Nous examinons l’utilisation du passé dans la reconstruction identitaire et déterminons si les héroïnes parviennent à surmonter les horreurs qu’elles ont découvertes. Nous estimons que malgré ce passé difficile, la découverte de celui-ci s’avère essentielle pour leur construction identitaire, car une fois que leur passé est recouvré, les protagonistes sont en mesure de le léguer à leur progéniture. Nous tenons compte du rôle de la transmission dans la réinsertion de leur filiation symbolique, car ce processus narratif produit une certaine catharsis : nous démontrons qu’en se racontant, les héroïnes parviennent à renouer leur filiation ascendante à leur descendance, se réinscrivant ainsi dans une logique historique. Finalement, nous mesurons l’impact mitigeant qu’exerce cette récupération identitaire sur la génération suivante.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Belonging is a fundamental human need and this need is universal (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). How a student perceives their own belonging within a school and classroom can be predictive of their future engagement, motivation, achievement, and success of their interpersonal relationships. Students who feel connected are found to be less likely to engage in risky behaviours, be absent from school, or drop out of school entirely (Nichols, 2006; Anderman, 2003). Recent research on belonging has sought to examine the relationship between belonging and its outcomes on student behaviour (Anderman, 2003; Clegg, 2006; Goodenow, 1993; Ma, 2003; Osterman, 2000). There is an increasing need for belonging research to examine the development and incidence of belonging in children at school (Johnson, 2009; Osterman, 2000). This study has three research questions: a) What are students’ experiences with belonging in the school? b) What are teachers’ perceptions of students’ belonging in the school? c) How do the students’ experiences and teachers’ perceptions of student belonging in the school compare? The comparison of teachers’ and students’ responses will provide more information as to whether the students’ experiences and teachers’ perceptions of student belonging are aligned or if they are disparate. This data will make it possible to begin to target specific belonging factors in school programs and teacher practices.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is a policy tool for creating environmentally and socially responsible policies, plans and programs.  This unconventional policy development tool presents challenges to governing bodies accustomed to traditional EIA-based processes of policy creation.  Obstacles to the implementation of SEA-type policy frameworks at the level of municipalities in the province of Ontario, Canada are examined through analysis of two case studies.  The Regional Municipality of York’s experiences with implementing SEA are used to present a generally positive example of policy development and implementation, while the City of Ottawa’s concurrent efforts in creating a sustainability-based policy environment serve to illustrate the pitfalls of developing unconventional policy using conventional methods.  A forward-thinking and open-minded municipal government, such as is found in the York Region case, is found to be essential to the implementation of progressive policy measures such as SEA.  It is also found that, in the Ottawa case study, failure to fully integrate the principles of SEA into all tiers of the City’s governance structure may have contributed to policy failure.   Finally, the York Region case demonstrates the vital role played by both internal government figures and external players in driving policy implementation and ensuring the success of SEA-type policy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This heuristic inquiry outlines the chronology of my own theory-building, developing awareness and understanding of my educational development practice; I define my practice as learning&amp;assessment-focused educational development. The inquiry maps the ways in which my early doctoral work shaped both my thinking and my practice as an educational developer eventually leading me to undertake a collaborative empirical study with the post-secondary teachers with whom I work. The purpose of the qualitative study we undertook together was to better understand how learning&amp;assessment-focused educational development might facilitate transformative professional learning.&#xD;
Sixteen college and university faculty members with whom I had engaged in learning&amp;assessment-focused educational development, and who were familiar with the ICE (Ideas, Connections and Extensions) model of learning and assessment (Wilson, 1996; Fostaty Young &amp; Wilson, 2000), collaborated with me as part of my heuristic inquiry. The study of our lived experience of learning&amp;assessment-focused educational development became the next logical step of the investigation of practice that I had already begun to question and to write about. Together we set out to identify and name the instructional content, processes, approaches and relationships that supported significant professional learning. Findings indicated that the adoption of a framework, preferably one that is congruent with teachers’ emerging conceptions of teaching and learning, helps post-secondary teachers’ organize their thinking about learning and enables improved communication about their expectations for students’ learning. The&#xD;
collaboration led to the identification of six essential characteristic features of learning&amp;assessment-focused educational development.&#xD;
Overall, this research contributes to the evidence-based literature on effective educational development practice and to the discussion on the scholarship of educational development research and on the scholarship of teaching in general.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2004 the Ontario Ministry of Education created the Safe Schools Action Team (SSAT) to advise on the development of a comprehensive approach to bullying prevention. When four years later in 2008 the SSAT re-engaged in order to review the issues of gender-based violence, homophobia, sexual harassment, and inappropriate sexual behaviour, recommendations were made for addressing these issues (Ministry of Education, 2008). One of the most significant dimensions of the SSAT report was their statement that the most effective method to learn about healthy relationships is through school curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2008). Taking the SSAT recommendation that the most effective method for educating adolescents on healthy relationships is through curriculum, the current study seeks to describe, from the teacher’s perspective, experiences with and motivations for using curriculum advocating healthy relationships, specifically dating violence prevention programming. The purpose of this thesis is to examine four female Ontario Physical and Health Education teachers’ personal and professional experience with teen dating violence and their knowledge about and use of dating violence prevention curriculum that has been approved by the Ontario Ministry of Education. &#xD;
	The participants related their experiences with dating violence within their school communities and discussed how they approached these issues within their own classroom. The results of this study indicate that dating violence continues to be a prevalent issue for Ontario secondary schools, and there is a need for continued research into how to teach dating violence prevention in meaningful ways.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Future electric grid will evolve from the current centralized and radial model toward a more distributed one. In recent years, distributed generation (DG) units have been playing an important role in electric generation due to their promising advantages in reducing air pollution, improving power system efficiency, and relieving stress on power transmission and delivery systems. Despite the increased penetration of DG systems, the application of individual DG system always has its limitation such as high cost/W, limited capacity and reliability, and safety concerns. A better way to utilize the emerging potential of DG is to take a system approach viewing generation and associated loads as a subsystem called a “microgrid”. &#xD;
Forming an electric island, the microgrid can work autonomously following a disturbance. In the islanded microgrid, micro sources are responsible for maintaining the voltage and the frequency of the microgrid system within their speciﬁed limits and sharing the load between the generators in a stable manner. However, a robust and stable operation of a microgrid depends on a robust control scheme of the microgrid sources. &#xD;
The most common technique to control microgrid sources is based on conventional droop characteristics. Although the conventional frequency/voltage droop technique properly shares a common active load, the reactive power sharing accuracy can be strongly affected by system parameter and active power control. In addition, frequency variations of different sources in transient mode can cause poor active power sharing. &#xD;
To override the above-mentioned problems, a novel frequency/voltage droop scheme is proposed in this thesis. The proposed scheme improves the performance of the microgrid in terms of power sharing and voltage regulation and smooths the system’s dynamic and transient responses.&#xD;
This work has developed the modeling, control parameters design, and power-sharing control starting from a single voltage source inverter to a number of interconnected DG units forming a flexible microgrid. Specifically, this thesis presents:&#xD;
•	A control-oriented modeling based on active and reactive power analysis. &#xD;
•	A control synthesis based on enhanced droop control technique. &#xD;
•	A small signal stability study to give guidelines for properly adjusting the control system parameters according to the desired dynamic response.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>More than ever before, two imperatives, ‘the right to know’ and ‘the need to keep secret’, find themselves in a contest for a position of primacy in the contemporary legal system. The need to keep secret is antipathetic to the right to know. The Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms has entrenched a person’s right to disclosure of both exculpatory and inculpatory material in possession of the prosecution. Moreover, the common law has placed the additional responsibility on the prosecution to inquire of third parties as to the existence and production of material relevant to the defence.  Despite the entrenchment of the right to disclosure the demands by the state have steadily grown for more evidence to be withheld from defendants, parties to proceedings and the public in general. The applications for in camera or ex parte hearings are common place and frequently acceded to.  &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis seeks to examine the clash of the two imperatives from the Canadian perspective. By using a comparative analysis of other jurisdictions throughout the thesis, it examines the various legislative instruments and common law employed in the Canadian Courts in respect of ‘ordinary’ criminal trials as well as trials of suspected terrorists, specifically, in respect of disclosure and the ability to withhold material from other parties and refrain from the obligation to disclose. The thesis includes a full analysis of disclosure options, public interest immunity, informer privilege, special advocates and other regimes, and claims of privilege in the interests of national security. &#xD;
 &#xD;
The thesis provides a number of detailed recommendations as to how Canada can better balance rights of accused against the public  interest and the needs of those who enforce the law.. The recommendations call for legal reforms, some new institutions for better accountability and new internal standards for those engaged in the investigation of crimes and national security matters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A numerical model (BioClog) is developed to examine changes in key municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate characteristics and the porosity of porous media (clogging) as the leachate passes through the drainage layer of a leachate collection system (LCS). The model considers multiple-species reactive leachate transport through porous media. It simulates biofilm growth and loss, deposition of suspended particles, and precipitation of minerals on the surface of porous media. It is used to examine the long-term performance of both the granular porous media and nonwoven geotextiles in LCSs. Modelling of laboratory mesocosm cells filled with gravel usually used in landfills and permeated by landfill leachate shows encouraging agreement between the observed and measured effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and calcium concentrations as well as the gravel porosity within the saturated drainage layers. Studies of early generation LCSs involving finger (French) drain systems show that the finger drains are not effective at controlling leachate mounding within the landfill and the calculated leachate mound thicknesses agree well with observed field data. A numerical examination of the recent generation of LCSs, comprised of the granular drainage blanket and perforated drainage pipes, shows that an increase in grain size increases the service life and that increasing the spacing between collection pipes (i.e., the drainage path) decreases the service life of LCSs. Filter-separator layers between the waste and granular drainage layers are shown to increase the service life of LCSs. The modelling results indicate that the calculated clog mass within the saturated drainage layer is dominated by the inorganic material and the calculated service life of LCSs is dependent on the leachate strength examined. Finally, a new practical model for estimating the service life of LCSs is developed and calibrated against the data from the BioClog model. The simplified model could be used by the practicing engineers for estimating the service life and optimizing the design of LCSs in MSW landfills.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  A significant number of laryngeal cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease.  Since stage at diagnosis is an important prognostic factor, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of individuals at risk of being diagnosed at an advanced stage.&#xD;
Objectives:  (1) Compare usual health care utilization between laryngeal cancer patients and the general population.  (2) Evaluate the association between usual health care utilization and stage at diagnosis in laryngeal cancer.&#xD;
Methods:  The study population included 1,702 laryngeal cancer patients diagnosed from 2005–2008, and 8,510 matched-controls from the general population.  Demographic, clinical, and health administrative data from Ontario were used to measure usual health care utilization in a two-year period (i.e. frequency of encounters, continuity of care, primary care model enrolment, and preventive services use), stage at diagnosis, and covariates.&#xD;
Results:  Laryngeal cancer patients had fewer health care encounters and a greater propensity for using preventive services than the general population.  Comparisons of usual health care utilization among laryngeal cancer patients showed significant trends across Stage I–IV for the frequency of encounters (p=0.002), continuity of care (p=0.02), and preventive services use (p&lt;0.0001).  Stage I patients were less likely than Stage II–IV patients to have a low frequency of encounters (10%), low continuity of care (28%), and no preventive services use (28%).  In adjusted multivariable analyses, low continuity of care was marginally associated with an increased risk of advanced-stage laryngeal cancer (RR [95% CI]: 1.17 [1.01, 1.34]).  Stratification by subsite showed a marginally significant association between continuity of care and stage in glottic cancer (RR [95% CI]: 1.25 [0.98, 1.58]), but no association in supraglottic cancer (RR [95% CI]: 1.01 [0.89, 1.15]).&#xD;
Conclusions:  Laryngeal cancer patients’ patterns of usual health care utilization differ from the general population.  There was little evidence of an effect of usual health care use on the risk of advanced-stage laryngeal cancer in multivariable analyses adjusting for confounders.  Multinomial regression may be needed to fully elucidate the effects of health care utilization across Stage I–IV.  Understanding health care utilization among laryngeal cancer patients is important for improving early detection and warrants further research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the effects of spatial location, Reynolds number and near exit flow modification on the development region of a round, free, turbulent jet. It is based on the publications generated by the author. The experiments were carried out over the range of Reynolds numbers between 10000 &lt; ReD &lt; 50000, where ReD is calculated based on the jet exit mean velocity and the nozzle exit diameter. The measurements were performed in the near- to intermediate-field region of a free jet defined between 0 ≤ x/D ≤ 30. In order to control the flow near the exit, two wire rings, with square cross-sections, of sides h = 1.5 mm, and outer diameter Dwire = 71.6 mm (positioned in the shear layer and called Rsl) and Dwire = 60 mm (positioned in the potential core and called Rpc) were placed at a stand-off distance downstream of the jet nozzle exit plane x/D = 0.03. Both stationary and flying hot wires were used to investigate the jet flow field. The results showed a considerable reduction in the jet spread rate and turbulence intensity using the passive rings. The reduction in the velocity decay rate was more obvious in the case of Rsl in lower Re; however, it was observed that as Re increases, the velocity decay rate became nearly the same for both cases of Rsl and Rpc.&#xD;
The axial velocity spectra showed the initial shear layer instability (shear layer mode) was suppressed while the jet preferred instability (preferred mode) remained active as the shear layer and potential core were modified. This shows the separation of these modes and is at variance with ideas that appeared in the literature that claimed the dependency of these two modes.</dcterms:abstract>
