      <dcterms:abstract>Increased demand for reliable public transit is motivating new and innovative transportation solutions. Monorail trains are quickly being established as transportation solutions for dense urban areas, due to their unobtrusive infrastructure. To obtain maximum value from investments made, the infrastructure is required to last longer than typical reinforced concrete. This thesis will explore the use of glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars as reinforcement in concrete guideway beams as a means of avoiding the deterioration problems that plague steel-reinforced concrete.&#xD;
This thesis includes a two part investigation: a full-scale field application of a GFRP-reinforced concrete guideway beam (690 mm x 1,500 mm x 11,600 mm), compared to a typical steel-reinforced beam (both installed on a 1.86 km long monorail test track); and a laboratory study of a scaled-down version of the GFRP-reinforced beam to better predict behaviour beyond typical service load levels.&#xD;
A total of 450 test passes of a two-car monorail train were observed over the two instrumented beams on the track. These passes were performed at vehicle loads ranging from fully unloaded for the first testing phase, up to the maximum allowable design service load. At each stage of testing, vehicle speeds ranged from as low as 5 km/h to as high as 90 km/h, allowing for the dynamic behaviour of the guideway to be observed and quantified. Deflections, strains, and cracks were recorded and compared with code/guideline limitations as well as to numerical predictions to determine which design tools were most effective and could predict behaviour accurately. In the laboratory, the half-scale GFRP-reinforced beam was tested statically to failure, and the behaviour was compared to the same modelling tools used in the field study. &#xD;
Based on the testing performed, the GFRP-reinforced concrete beams performed satisfactorily and met all serviceability requirements, but did not perform as well as the steel-reinforced beam (as a result of the reduced stiffness of GFRP). The use of non-prestressed GFRP-reinforced beams should be limited to applications where spans are of comparable length to the field study. To maintain satisfactory performance, guideway spans significantly longer will need to continue to be design as prestressed beams.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Due to recent concerns regarding energy conservation and dependence on fossil fuels, the efficient integration of electric vehicle populations’ in the future smart grid has become a significant area of research.  Despite the heavy penetration of smart meters throughout North America and Europe a lack of research exists utilizing real consumption data.   &#xD;
&#xD;
Making use of smart meter data, a model of a prototypical residential feeder was created to observe the effects of increased electric vehicle penetration on the selected feeder.  Simulations of the current operation of the feeder were performed along with modeled uncoordinated, coordinated, and coordinated vehicle to grid charging of electric vehicles. &#xD;
&#xD;
As expected, it was found that the normal operation of the feeder is subject to several inefficiencies which are made worse by uncoordinated charging of electric vehicles.  Significant improvements in the considered operational parameters were found as a result of the coordinated charging of vehicles using a quadratic programming based control algorithm.  Further it was found, that the use of coordinated vehicle to grid connections only produces marginal benefits over standard connections.  Leading to the conclusion that development of charging controls is more significant to the mitigation of electric vehicle charging effects than the integration of vehicle to grid connections.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Tracking recovery in disturbed environments requires the consideration of many spatial and temporal scales. A sensitive indicator organism, Hyalella azteca, was used to assess lake recovery at multiple scales in the region of Sudbury, Canada. A 40-lake presence-absence survey was conducted over a period of 23 years to track colonization history and chemical factors that limit this typically ubiquitous organism. A six-lake study was used to investigate the importance of spatially varying watershed characteristics within lakes, which could provide habitat hot spots for colonization during early stages of recovery. An intensive single-lake study examined the effects of local-scale chemistry (e.g., bioavailable metals, waterborne organic matter) and adjacent subcatchment terrestrial features on the availability of suitable habitat for colonizing amphipods. At the regional scale, presence-absence models suggested that colonization probability increased with lake water conductivity and alkalinity. Within lakes, subcatchment confluence sites appeared to be important habitats in the early stages of colonization. Site-specific features, such as macrophyte and woody debris cover, increased and decreased H. azteca abundance, respectively, and yet these relationships were influenced by adjacent terrestrial subcatchment characteristics. For example, with more terrestrial vegetation, the relative increase in abundance due to macrophyte cover was further increased. Within the intensively-studied lake, larger subcatchments with more terrestrially-derived waterborne organic matter had higher abundances of H. azteca. Using H. azteca as an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health, these relationships suggest that as lakes recover, subcatchment confluence sites can be hot-spots for colonization, and their suitability improves with interactions between local habitat characteristics and terrestrial characteristics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prostate cancer is a worldwide health concern for men. Needle biopsy is the most definitive form of cancer diagnosis. Target-specific biopsies can be performed under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. However, needle placements are often inaccurate due to intra-operative prostate motion and the lack of motion compensation techniques. As a result, malignant tumors can be missed, which in turn will lead to an increased number of repeated biopsies and delaying of treatment. To increase the needle targeting accuracy, intra-operative prostate motion and deformation need to be studied so that motion compensation techniques can be developed accordingly. This thesis intends to make three main contributions:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. A comprehensive survey of the state-of-art in image-guided prostate needle placement interventions.&#xD;
2. Retrospective clinical accuracy validation of a MRI-guided robotic prostate biopsy system that was used in the U.S. National Cancer Institute for over 6 years. A 3D-3D registration algorithm consists of an initial two-step rigid alignment followed by a B-spline deformable transform was developed to align the pre- and post-needle insertion images. A total of 90 biopsies from 24 patients were studied. The mean target displacement, needle placement error, and clinical biopsy error were 5.2, 2.5, and 4.3 mm, respectively.&#xD;
3. Development of a multi-slice-to-volume registration for intra-operative target localization. The algorithm aligns the planning volume with three orthogonal image slices of the prostate acquired immediately before needle insertion. It consists of a rigid registration followed by a deformable step using only the prostate region. The algorithm was validated on 14 clinical images sets from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. All registration errors were well below the radius of a clinically significant tumour (5 mm), and are considered clinically acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
The results show that there was a substantial amount of biopsy error caused by prostate motion and deformation during MRI-guided biopsy. This error can be reduced by using quantitative imaging techniques for prostate registration and motion compensation. In particular, the multi-slice-to-volume registration algorithm demonstrated the feasibility of intra-operative target localization and motion compensation; which in turn may improve the quality of MRI-guided prostate interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The estimation or modeling of biophysical variables such as surface roughness, vegetation phytomass, and soil moisture in the Arctic is an important step towards understanding arctic energy fluxes, effects of changing climate, and hydrological patterns. This research uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, along with ancillary optical and environmental data, to create models that estimate these biophysical variables across different High Arctic landscapes, with the goal of applying the models across even larger areas. &#xD;
Field work was conducted at two High Arctic locations on Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada. At each location, surface roughness values were measured at a number of randomized plot locations using a pin meter. Soil moisture values were measured using a time domain reflectometry (TDR) instrument within six hours of multiple overpasses of the RADARSAT-2 SAR sensor.&#xD;
Surface roughness models were generated with multi-incidence angle and fully polarimetric SAR data, with resulting R2 values ranging between 0.39 and 0.66, and normalized root mean squared error (N_RMSE) values of 14% - 22%. The output from the final surface roughness model was used as an input to the soil moisture models. &#xD;
Vegetation phytomass was modeled with multi-angular SAR data, using a soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) derived from optical data across the study area as a measure of verification. The resulting model had a significant (p &lt;0.05) relationship to the SAVI values, with an R2 of 0.60. This model was then compared to field-collected above-ground phytomass values, and a model was derived that related SAR data directly to phytomass. This model again showed a strong relationship, with an R2 value of 0.87.&#xD;
The final biophysical variable that was modeled, soil moisture, showed moderate agreement to field-measured soil moisture values (R2 = 0.46, N_RMSE = 0.15%), but much stronger relationships were found for relative moisture values at fine scales across the landscape.&#xD;
These models, when taken together, demonstrate that SAR data is capable of modeling biophysical variables across high latitude environments. These models will help address larger questions, such as how SAR can be used to better understand moisture and energy exchanges over regional areas in high arctic environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In today’s neoliberal climate, a burgeoning health consciousness pervades American society. Health and fitness discourses are increasingly framed through neoliberal ideologies, contributing to the rise of “healthism”. This theory prescribes that health should be taken up as an individual responsibility and moral obligation. Healthism, coupled with societal pressure to adhere to certain cultural bodily ideals, propels individuals to take ownership of their health and well-being. More specifically, Americans are encouraged to strive towards cultivating a “healthy” body, which is a fit body, because the physical body has come to symbolize health and morality. &#xD;
	With the phenomenal growth of the health and fitness industry, gyms have become an increasingly popular venues where individuals go to address their health and fitness needs. However, class status plays a critical role in Americans’ capacity to pursue health-promoting knowledge and resources. Structural barriers related to economic inequalities alienate individuals of low-socioeconomic status from mainstream health practices, including gym participation. &#xD;
	The current project draws upon ethnographic fieldwork in a commercial gym in the Boston, Massachusetts area. Through a qualitative investigation of Planet Fitness, I seek to contribute to the empirical base of knowledge surrounding gyms, specifically, and health and fitness discourses, at large. Planet Fitness, a hugely successful gym franchise across the United States, has developed a unique brand that recognizes the various economic and social barriers that prevent and discourage gym participation. Findings reveal that by dramatically lowering the price of memberships, developing an inclusive environment, called the “Judgment Free Zone”, and offering the convenience of nearly 700 locations nationwide, Planet Fitness makes health and wellness more affordable and accessible for Americans.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation investigates the impact of central banks' asset purchase programs on the economy and the role of frictions in the corporate loan markets. It builds a series of models with trading and information frictions in goods market and credit market. Chapter 1 introduces the main idea in this thesis and presents a review on central banks' asset purchase programs and unconventional monetary policies. &#xD;
Chapter 2 constructs a model of the monetary economy with multiple nominal assets. Assets differ in terms of the liquidity services they provide. I show that the central bank can control the overall liquidity and welfare of the economy by changing the relative supply of assets. A liquidity trap exists away from the Friedman rule that has a positive real interest rate; the central bank's asset purchase/sale programs may be ineffective in instances of low enough inflation rates. My model also enables me to study the welfare effects of a restriction on trading with government bonds.  &#xD;
Chapter 3 investigates the effects of open-market operations on the distributions of assets and prices. It offers a theoretical framework to incorporate multiple asset holdings in a tractable heterogeneous-agent model. This model features competitive search, which produces distributions of money and bond holdings as well as price dispersion among submarkets. At a high enough bond supply, the equilibrium shows segmentation in the asset market; only households with good income shocks participate in the bond market. Segmentation in the asset market is generated endogenously without assuming any rigidities or frictions in the asset market. Numerical exercises show that when the asset market is segmented, the central bank can improve welfare by purchasing bonds and supplying money.&#xD;
Chapter 4 develops a model of loan markets in which lenders post an array of heterogeneous contracts, then borrowers tradeoff terms of loan contracts and matching probability between themselves. I show that a unique separating equilibrium exists where each type of borrower applies to a certain type of contract. Chapter 4 also provides empirical evidence of both price dispersion and credit rationing in the corporate loan market. Chapter 5 offers concluding remarks and possible extensions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This qualitative research study investigates teaching and learning in an international school, and asks: (1) What are the stories of principle, practice, and mindset that foster internationally-minded teaching and learning in an international school context?; and (2) How might those stories inform the practices of teachers in increasingly culturally diverse domestic schools? A trifold conceptual framework of principle, practice, and mindset (Guo &amp; Jamal, 2007) was used to design the process for data collection: (1) document analysis to examine principles such as intercultural competency; (2) classroom observations to identify elements of internationally-minded teaching practices; and (3) interviews to address the mindset of educators and administrators. The data collected from 25 documents, 60 hours of classroom observations, and 8 interviews were subsequently analyzed using van Manen’s (1997) three steps for hermeneutic phenomenological reflection, and were guided by Fowler’s (2006) approach to understanding narrative. Four resulting themes have been established: (1) personalized learning; (2) creative professionalism; (3) (con)temporary community; and (4) international-mindedness. These themes indicate a complex interconnectedness between stories of principle, practice, and mindset in an international school context, and highlight the significant role that teachers as intercontextual inquirers play in enhancing internationally-minded approaches to teaching and learning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The science of human origins, known formally as ‘paleoanthropology’, was effectively born in the fierce late nineteenth century debate as to the human status of Neanderthal.  Critical social theory on ‘scientism’ has generated a wealth of research on the ways the various human sciences contribute to the structuring and organizing of social relations.  This includes Foucault’s well-known genealogical studies of clinical medicine, which have provided sociologists with crucial insight into how classifying and ordering practices actually create ‘Man’ in the way they operate as a field – or “technology” – of power (Foucault 1970).  However, as yet there has been very little produced by sociologists interested in the impacts of science on society with regards to paleoanthropology specifically.  This is especially surprising considering that Neanderthal, the quintessential ‘missing link’ and the hub of paleoanthropology’s speculative and explanatory universe, clearly occupies a central place in the socio-historical emergence of ‘humanness’ as an ontological category.  Moving forward from the basic observation that the original 1856 discovery of fossilized Neanderthal remains in a cave in Germany’s Neander Valley generally coincided with the end of the colonial period, my dissertation seeks to fill a void in sociology via a genealogical study of paleoanthropological science.  Drawing largely upon the insight of Foucault but also that of Saïd, I undertake a discourse analysis of the early debates surrounding Neanderthal with an aim toward shedding light upon the ways in which Neanderthal propagated or concealed certain anxieties, particularly as they relate to biological kinships.  This is then applied to an exploration of how the debates surrounding Neanderthal were in turn pivotal to the emergence of today’s prevailing paleoanthropological models of human origins.  The profound ontological and epistemological tensions embodied by these models, I argue, wholly reflect the inherently ambiguous nature of the missing link as both concept and metaphor.  The result is that missing links, because of the discursive field in which they function, are a powerful source of normativity and stratification.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A dynamic model is developed and presented that predicts the voltage response for a Severinghaus electrode-based point-of-care pCO2 sensor. Eight partial differential equations are derived to describe the diffusion and reaction phenomena in the sensor. The model is able to predict the potential response versus time behaviour from different CO2 concentrations in the calibration fluid and control fluids. &#xD;
&#xD;
The two most influential and uncertain parameters in the model are determined to be the forward rate constant for benzoquinone consumption at the gold surface ( k_(f_Au ) ), and the partition coefficient for CO2 between the membrane and the electrolyte (κ_(〖CO〗_(2_m ) )). These parameters were adjusted heuristically to obtain a good fit (within 2 mV) between the dynamic voltage response data and the model predictions during a critical 4 second period.  The model predictions are sufficient for design sensitivity studies, however an improved fit might be possible using a formal least-squares parameter estimation approach, or if additional parameters were estimated.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Several design parameters are varied to study the influence of the electrolyte concentration and the sensor geometry on the voltage response. The most influential design parameter studied is the amount of water present in the electrolyte during sensor operation. This can be affected by the amount of water evaporated during manufacturing and storage, and by the amount of water present when the sensor “wets up” again during operation. The amount of water picked up by the sensor in turn is affected by design parameters such as component/membrane dimensions and thicknesses. The initial buffer concentration in the electrolyte is the second most influential parameter. The resulting model can be used to perform “what if” analyses in order to understand the impact of design decisions on the sensor performance, and to potentially improve the sensor from performance and manufacturing cost perspectives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A numerical model was utilized to assess the effects of elevated temperature on the application of in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) and enhanced in situ bioremediation (EISB) for the subsurface remediation of trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). Temperature adjustment of the contaminant physicochemical properties as well as the chemical/biological reactions associated with ISCO and EISB were accounted for in the model domain. ISCO reaction rates were estimated using Arrhenius principles; microbial growth rates for EISB were estimated using non-linear fits to published literature data. The results from this study showed that temperature did provide remedial benefits to ISCO and EISB treatment during the short-term timeframe of oxidant/substrate injection. During these time periods, heated ISCO and EISB treatment exhibited greater DNAPL mass removal and mass flux reduction compared to heated abiotic dissolution. In the long term, after oxidant/substrate injection was terminated, the treatment enhancements achieved by ISCO and EISB were negated. Permeability (k) reduction due to rind formation (ISCO) and bioclogging (EISB) inhibited DNAPL dissolution and contributed to greater dissolution tailing effects. Tailing effects caused by ISCO were more severe compared to EISB since rind formation contributed to permanent k reduction; partial k recovery was observed in the EISB scenarios due to biomass decay. Even though higher temperatures were beneficial to ISCO and EISB during the short-term oxidant/substrate injection period, treatment efficacy was ultimately controlled by the detrimental by-products (rind from ISCO and biomass from EISB) formed as a result of the associative chemical/biological reactions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hypertension is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular, renal and nervous system pathologies. Refractory hypertension is prevalent at approximately 30% despite diet, lifestyle and multiple pharmacologic interventions. Blood pressure can be influenced at the level of the nervous system, at the level of the kidney, and at the level of the vasculature. This document describes investigations performed into each of these systems during the development of hypertension using a model of human essential hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), by a proteomic approach of 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. A transgenic mouse model with deficits in p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR), which has been implicated in hypertension, was similarly investigated.  Proteomics is a scientific strategy that is not entirely hypothesis driven, rather it has the hypothesis that functional and phenotypic changes in pathophysiology are reflected at the protein level. Proteomics compares the proteome of a disease state, treatment, temporal state, to an appropriate control to determine changes in the level of protein present and its biochemical properties. &#xD;
	Proteome changes in the SHR mesenteric arteries included the novel observation of  increased CLIC1 association with the adventitia in the SHR, the decreased expression of HSP90 alpha and beta in the SHR, and the presence of an additional protein spot for tropomyosin beta and MLC20 in the SHR.  These proteome changes are suggestive of an increased contractile state in the mesenteric resistance arteries of SHR. In the renal proteome, there was a decrease of alpha-2μ globulin and a decrease in MAWDBP in the SHR demonstrating molecular changes in the kidney before known pathological changes. In superior cervical ganglia, sstereological measurement showed significant increases in the number of sympathetic neurons in both lines of p75NTR-deficient mice, relative to wild type mice with an enhanced survival of sympathetic neurons associated with shifts toward the more basic isoforms of Annexin V in the proteomes of p75NTR-deficient mice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Effective communication in the doctor-patient relationship is an essential component to proper diagnosis and treatment (Gordon &amp; Gerber, 2010). While a greater focus on improving doctor-patient communication needs to be addressed, nowhere is it more important than in interactions between geriatric patients and general practitioners. This study analyzes and synthesizes the findings of 16 selected socio-medical journal articles that report on the views of geriatric patients’ needs and desires when interacting with general practitioners. The findings of this study contribute a geriatric perspective to the current debate regarding patient-centred care and also identify communication barriers and facilitators that can be avoided or used by physicians when interacting with geriatric patients. By bringing together multiple socio-medical qualitative studies that look at geriatric patients’ perspectives, this research seeks to create an evidence base that is valued by both medical practitioners and policy-makers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cross-correlation is often used as the primary technique to compare two biological signals. The cross-correlation technique is an effective means to measure the synchronization of two signals if the relative phases at all frequencies are distributed linearly, that is, there is a group delay. The group delay assumption of cross-correlation analysis imposes an unfavourable restriction on signals with relative phase correlation which varies at different frequencies. Traditional Fourier analysis applied to a short data segments, namely the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), provides phase information for each frequency component, but it is not suitable for biological signals with non-stationary statistics for which the ideal segment length is unknown. The application of a wavelet based phase analysis technique is discussed in this study. The frequency decomposition and temporally localized nature of the wavelet transform provides localized phase-frequency information for two signals. A wavelet frequency temporal relative phase pattern (WFT-RPP) technique to extract relative phase information at specific frequencies over the time course of a time-varying signal was developed. The technique was tested on simulated data and surface electromyographic (sEMG) data recorded from upper limb muscles in human subjects as they performed a series of dynamic push and pull tasks. Selected sEMG channel pairs are compared against each other using the WFT-RPP technique to extract the relative phase information and repetitive relative phase patterns for certain muscle pairs were observed. The properties of the WFT-RPP and the merits and weaknesses of using the technique for determining intermuscular sEMG synchronization is discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Climate change is a serious global issue that poses one of the greatest challenges facing human kind (Kazdin, 2009; Stern, 2011; Swim et al., 2011). Given that organizations are often cited as the largest contributors to climate change (Trudeau and Canada West Foundation, 2007), research needs to investigate how organizations can positively affect climate change. Accordingly, the purpose of this dissertation is to investigate how organizations can positively affect climate change through workplace pro-environmental behaviors. To this end, three studies were conducted. The first study investigated the influence of leaders’ environmentally-specific transformational leadership and their own workplace pro-environmental behaviors on employees’ workplace pro-environmental behaviors. The second study examined if environmentally-specific and general transformational leadership are empirically distinct but related, whether environmentally-specific transformational leadership evokes higher levels of workplace pro-environmental behaviors than general transformational leadership, and if so, examined through mediation why this is the case. The third and final study conceptualizes and defines workplace pro-environmental behaviors as a form of organizational citizenship behaviors that are targeted at benefiting the natural environment (OCBE), and subsequently, developed and refined a measure of OCBE and assessed the measure’s psychometric validity. This dissertation concludes with a general discussion and highlights areas for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation investigates the role of black African slaves and servants in relation to Italian Renaissance anxieties about them as ‘domestic enemies.’ Three case studies form the basis of this investigation, and include late Renaissance paintings of Judith and Holofernes, the Rape of Lucretia, and Bathsheba at her Bath. Virtually none of the biblical or classical textual accounts of these subjects ascribes an ethnicity to the servile figures. Artists, by depicting black African men, women and children as participants in scenes of threatened or enacted sexual violence, added tension to the iconography. To uncover contemporary cultural attitudes about domestic slaves and servants, documents and textual sources, such as poems and short stories, are examined. These sources provide insight about the types of fears and prejudices that people had about black domestics as potentially insidious, or even nefarious. By including such figures in their paintings, artists were able to exploit the contemporary fascination that people had with the potentially threatening nature of black slaves and servants, thereby adding a degree of titillation to their artworks. The presence of black Africans in narrative paintings evoked deeply ambivalent attitudes about these figures as both faithful and potentially threatening.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Healthcare professionals are expected to know their role in patient safety.  In a rural hospital, they may have different roles along with their professional role.  Staff and services are fewer and the community is often part of the hospital. This can influence patient safety culture.  Researchers and governing bodies have focused on developing processes to assist healthcare leaders developing their patient safety culture. Researchers and governing bodies have tended to focus on urban hospitals and then implement the same processes in rural hospitals. This strategy has not always been successful. The purpose of this study is to explore the roles and responsibilities in patient safety culture of health care professionals in rural hospitals.  &#xD;
A systematic review, using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) review process, was completed to discover how patient safety culture and rural hospitals are described and measured.  Some common elements in the literature were unique characteristics of rural hospitals, leadership, error reporting and the use of patient safety culture surveys. &#xD;
Ethnographic methods were used to explore healthcare professional’s roles in patient safety culture in a rural hospital. Healthcare professionals describe their roles differently than described in the literature. A patient safety culture model was developed from the literature and refined with the study findings. The affinity model was developed based on the study findings from the small rural hospital and the literature.  Everything they do is how rural hospital practitioners described their role in patient safety.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cloud services are Internet-based IT services. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) are three representative examples. As the cloud market becomes more open and competitive, Quality of Service (QoS) will be more important. However, cloud providers and cloud consumers have different and sometimes opposite preferences. If such a conflict occurs, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) cannot be established without negotiation. &#xD;
&#xD;
To allow service consumers to express their QoS requirements, and negotiate them with service providers, we argue for cloud service negotiation. It aims to establish and enforce SLAs for cloud services. Specifically, we study how to measure, negotiate, and enforce QoS requirements for cloud services, and so formulate three research problems, i.e., QoS measurement, QoS negotiation, and QoS assurance. In terms of its scope, the topic covers business side automated negotiation and technical side resource allocation techniques. As a result, it has a potential impact on cloud service adoption. &#xD;
&#xD;
To address QoS measurement, we initiate a quality model named CLOUDQUAL for cloud services. It is a model with quality dimensions and metrics that targets general cloud services. CLOUDQUAL contains six quality dimensions, i.e., usability, availability, reliability, responsiveness, security, and elasticity, of which usability is subjective, whereas the others are objective. &#xD;
&#xD;
To address QoS negotiation, we present a mixed negotiation approach for cloud services, which is based on the “game of chicken”. In particular, if a party is uncertain about the strategy of its counterpart, it is best to mix concession and tradeoff strategies in negotiation. In fact, the mixed approach, which exhibits a certain degree of intelligence, can achieve a higher utility than a concession approach, while incurring fewer failures than a tradeoff approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
To address QoS assurance, we propose a QoS-driven resource allocation method for cloud services. It can meet users’ QoS requirements while minimizing resources consumed. Especially, to honor a QoS specified in a SLA, we develop QoS assurance mechanisms, and determine the minimum resources that should be allocated. As a result, the method makes both technical and economic sense for cloud providers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study focuses on the Mexican-American community in the US, the American and Mexican governments, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and trade in general between the US and Mexico.  The empirical focus of this study is the influence of the Mexican-American diaspora on US policy, specifically with respect to trade.  I attempt to trace the influence of the diaspora in the political debates over NAFTA, and in the post-NAFTA debates.  I pose the following questions: 1-Does the Mexican-American diaspora have influence in US domestic politics and the US-Mexico relationship? 2-Does the diaspora use what influence it has to achieve its interests?  3-If so, is it generally successful?  These questions will be explored in the context of American trade policy.  The Mexican-American diaspora has the resources and characteristics needed to exert influence, but is it so inclined?  In order to measure its influence, it must first be asked whether the diaspora attempts to use it in pursuing specific interests. &#xD;
An important component of this analysis will be to determine whether Mexican-Americans are able- and perceived as able- to influence decision-making in the US government through the vote.  Other important questions therefore include: Do Mexican-Americans vote?  If so, whom do they vote for?  And, are Mexican-Americans politically active?  The answers to these questions will help us paint a more accurate picture of Mexican-Americans and their influence on US trade policy.  This study will reveal that the Mexican-American community has played an increasingly important role in American politics.  It will show that the Mexican-American diaspora has an impact on domestic issues such as immigration, but that it is also interested and influential in foreign policy, particularly trade.  I intend to demonstrate this influence by exploring its role in the establishment of NAFTA and in the ensuing American debates on hemispheric trade policy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Inuit have experienced significant cultural changes since initial contact with European settlers and explorers in the 17th Century, changes that accelerated in the mid-20th century. Basing their relationships to the Inuit in imperialism (the policy and practice of empire expansion), Europeans used political, economic and cultural tactics to swiftly establish a cultural hierarchy and solidify the Inuit’s position as ‘The Other’ – an ‘out-group’ viewed as inherently inferior to the ‘in-group’. The Arctic has remained hierarchized because of implicit settler colonial processes that permeate political and cultural relations and underpin modern policy development. An examination of the nutrition transition – the shift away from traditional foods to commercialized market options – brings these implicit settler colonial processes into focus. The transition to a Western diet has accompanied chronic poverty and provoked high levels of food insecurity, resulting in numerous negative health outcomes among Inuit. Current health promotion initiatives employ an ineffective downstream approach to reduce Nunavut food insecurity – which is approximately three times greater than the Canadian average – when the issue is a result of rampant poverty. Disproportionately high rates of food insecurity are a manifestation of settler  colonialism and fuel a covertly racist national attitude toward the Inuit, maintaining their marginalized position. This study examines national coverage of Nunavut food insecurity as presented in two of Canada’s most widely read newspapers: The Globe and Mail and National Post. A critical discourse analysis (CDA) was employed to analyze 24 articles, 19 from The Globe and Mail and 5 from National Post. Analysis suggests national print media propagates the Inuit’s position as The Other by selectively reporting on social issues such as hunger, poverty and income. Terms such as “Northerners” and “Southerners” are frequently used to categorically separate Nunavut from the rest of Canada and Inuit-driven efforts to resolve their own issues are widely ignored. This effectively portrays the Inuit as helpless and the territory as a failure, and allows Canadians to maintain colonialist views of Inuit inferiority and erroneously assume Federal initiatives effectively address Northern food insecurity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
The detection of biologically infectious agents, such as bacteria, in water is often a cumbersome process that can only be performed by trained personnel in a well-equipped laboratory and may require sufficient time (sometimes days) until detectable concentration levels of the pathogen are reached. “Surface-based biosensors” enable efficient detection of bacteria. Their operation relies on the selective capture of the target pathogen from a liquid sample onto the detection surface (a process called “sampling”) and their subsequent detection via signal transduction. Sampling currently presents a major bottleneck in the successful operation of these sensors as it relies on the extremely slow diffusive transport of the target particle from the bulk of the sample to the capture surface. &#xD;
The present work investigates how alternating current (AC) electric field effects produced by planar microelectrode arrays embedded into a solid surface can improve capture of bacteria at concentrations as low as 104 particles/mL. Specifically, numerical and experimental work is combined toward the analysis of a host of electric field generated phenomena (electrophoresis, electroosmosis, and electrothermal fluid flow) that can potentially guide and enhance the transport of K12 E. coli bacteria to the capture surface inside an electric field to find the effective frequency/voltage combination for an efficient capture. Proof of principle demonstrations on how antibody-functionalized microelectrode arrays can accelerate and selectively capture K12 E. coli bacteria (target pathogens) from samples containing debris or mixed bacteria populations are demonstrated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sleep is an evolutionary conserved behaviour which in most species is essential for survival. However, the mechanisms involved in the genetic regulation of sleep remain poorly understood. C. elegans exhibit a number of sleep-like behaviours: a) lethargus which is a developmental period between moults, b) satiety which occurs after feeding and c) after long durations of thrashing in liquid media.  We have isolated a C. elegans G-protein coupled receptor, named NPR-14,that is most similar to the human orexin receptor 2 and is involved in the above behaviours and functions through a protein kinase G - dependent and independent pathways. NPR-14 works together with other signalling pathways that have been implicated in sleep regulation including Notch, GABA, and insulin signalling. A null mutation in npr-14 results in anachronistic quiescence especially in the presence of food. It also results in egg-laying defects, episodic swimming behaviour, asynchronicity during development and despite feeding less these mutants appear to accumulate more fat than N2 worms.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The use of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) as (i) covers for arsenic-rich gold mine tailings and landfills, (ii) subsurface barrier for migration of hydrocarbons in the Arctic, and (iii) basal liner for sewage treatment lagoons were examined. &#xD;
After 4 years in field and laboratory experiments, it was found that best cover configuration above gold mine tailings might include a layer of GCL product with polymer-enhanced bentonite and a geofilm-coated carrier geotextile serving above the tailings under ≥ 0.7 m overburden. However, acceptable performance could be achieved with using a standard GCL with untreated bentonite provided that there is a minimum of 0.7 m of cover soil above the GCL. &#xD;
When GCL samples were exhumed from experimental landfill test cover with complete replacement of sodium in the bentonite with divalent cations in the adjacent soil, it was observed that the (i) hydraulic head across the GCLs, (ii) size of the needle-punched bundles, and (iii) structure of the bentonite can all significantly affect the value of the inferred in-situ hydraulic conductivity measured at the laboratory. The higher the hydraulic head and the larger the size of the needle-punched bundles, the higher the likelihood of internal erosion/structural change of bentonite at bundles that will cause a preferential flow for liquids to occur. A key practical implication was that GCLs can perform effectively as a single hydraulic barrier in covers provided that the water head above the GCL kept low.&#xD;
The hydraulic performance of a GCL in the Arctic was most affected by the location within the soil profile relative to the typical groundwater level with the highest increase in the hydraulic conductivity (by 1-4 orders of magnitude) for GCL below the water table. However, because the head required for jet fuel to pass through the GCL was higher than that present under field conditions, there was no evidence of jet fuel leakage through the barrier system.&#xD;
The leakage through GCLs below concrete lined sewage treatment lagoons was within acceptable limits, in large part, due to the low interface transmissivity between GCLs and the overlying poured concrete.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With sufficient time, a high density polyethylene geomembrane will degrade and lose its engineering properties until ruptures signal the end of its service-life. This thesis examines the longevity of nine different geomembranes; five of them were of different thickness manufactured from the same resin. The degradation of properties and time to failure are investigated for geomembranes: in immersion tests; as a part of a landfill composite liner; and, exposed to the elements. The different thermal and stress histories associated with manufacturing geomembranes of different thickness are shown to affect their morphological structure; consequently, their stress crack resistance.    &#xD;
When immersed in synthetic leachate, it was found that: (a) thicker geomembranes have a longer antioxidants depletion time but the effect of thickness decreases with temperature and is less than expected; (b) inferences of geomembrane’s longevity based on its initial properties may be misleading because a geomembrane may chemically degrade (as manifested by the change in melt index) despite the presence of a significant amount of stabilizers (as manifested by the measured high pressure oxidative induction time); and, (c) stress crack resistance may change before antioxidant depletion or chemical degradation takes place, likely, due to changes in geomembrane morphological structure with the maximum decrease being observed at 55oC. Reductions also were measured for geomembrane immersed in air and water at 55oC.&#xD;
The geomembrane aged in a simulated landfill liner at 85oC is shown to have service-life as little as three years with 30,000 to &gt;2.0 million ruptures/hectare at failure. For exposed geomembranes in Alumbrera (Argentina), samples were exhumed from two mine facilities after ~16 years of exposure. The antioxidants in exposed samples depleted to residual and the stress crack resistance had dropped to as low as 70 hours. Samples were exhumed from a different exposed geomembrane in a test site in Godfrey (Canada) after six years of exposure. The antioxidants were partially depleted, with depletion to residual projected to take at least 20 years; however, despite no evidence of chemical ageing, the stress crack resistance had decreased from 330 to 190 hours, likely due to changes in the morphological structure of the geomembrane.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the interplay of queer sexuality, theology, and transatlantic modernism in the oeuvres and critical receptions of T.S. Eliot (1888-1965), Hart Crane (1899-1932), and W.H. Auden (1907-1973). As an interdisciplinary study in literary criticism and of each author’s reception history, this thesis reads the poetry, critical prose, and correspondence of Eliot, Crane, and Auden with focused reference to queer theory and continental philosophies of religion extending from Immanuel Kant’s Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone and Søren Kierkegaard’s pseudonymous authorship to Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction of aesthetics, ethics, and politics in the post-Kantian legacy. &#xD;
Gauging the “post-secular turn” in cultural criticism, the dissertation develops a critique of “epistemic secularism,” which constitutes a normative framework for scholarship in many branches of the humanities. To examine “the secular limits of discipline” at the junction of queer theory and modernist studies, it examines how literary critics and queer theorists define modernity and conceptualize subjectivity at the secular limits (or limitations) of their fields. Imbrications of theology and queerness in the works of Eliot, Crane, and Auden occasion this study’s response to epistemic secularism and prompt its recalibration of secularism in the ethical terms of “mere reason,” rather than as an episteme rife with antireligious politics.&#xD;
Research undertaken for this thesis is guided by two foundational questions: 1) Do extant models for the study of queer sexualities presuppose secularism or enforce secularization as a benchmark for the “achievement of modernity”? 2) Are religious foundations conceivable for queer subjects to whom secularism remains a key factor in the emancipatory history of sexual cultures? The dissertation argues that, for better and for worse, secularism has become a blueprint in the metropolitan West for thinking sexual modernity as progressive and achievable. Notwithstanding such provisos, this study finds that the “proper” subject in queer-modernist studies is in essence neither nonreligious nor antireligious. Rather, reading with and against the grain of secularism’s episteme, it uncovers in the corpuses of Eliot, Crane, and Auden a radical conception of theology as a positively queer endeavour in an era of “liberated” secularist polities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, we present an approach for identifying near-miss interaction clones in reverse-engineered UML behavioural models. Our goal is to identify patterns of interaction ("conversations") that can be used to characterize and abstract the run-time behaviour of web applications and other interactive systems. In order to leverage robust near-miss code clone technology, our approach is text-based, working on the level of XMI, the standard interchange serialization for UML. Behavioural model clone detection presents several challenges - first, it is not clear how to break a continuous stream of interaction between lifelines (lifelines represent the objects or actors in the system) into meaningful conversational units. Second, unlike programming languages, the XMI text representation for UML is highly non-local, using attributes to reference information in the model file remotely.&#xD;
In this work we use a set of contextualizing source transformations on the XMI text representation to reveal the hidden hierarchical structure of the model and granularize behavioural interactions into conversational units. Then we adapt NiCad, a near-miss code clone detection tool, to help us identify conversational clones in reverse-engineered behavioural models. These conversational clones are then analysed to find worrisome patterns of security access violations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sperm senescence, a decline in sperm quality caused by male ageing and by sperm ageing before or after copulation, may have fitness costs manifested as infertility or lowered genetic quality of offspring. This thesis tested the distinct evolutionary roles of sperm senescence using a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster. We developed a practical approach to avoid confounding male age with sperm age by standardizing pre-copulatory sperm age and mating history in young and old male age groups. Applying this approach, we documented sperm senescence in D. melanogaster and discussed its potential evolutionary importance. First, ageing males declined in fitness as evidenced by the reduction in fertilization potential of their ejaculates but not by decreased offspring fitness (the ability that a fly can survive to adulthood, successfully mate and produce viable offspring). This suggests a decline in the quality or quantity of seminal fluid or spermatozoa, with no decline in the genetic quality of sperm that actually fertilized ova. Second, post-copulatory sperm senescence has significant negative impacts on offspring fitness, indicating degraded genetic integrity of the spermatozoa stored in females. In both cases, male ageing and sperm ageing had similar fitness impact on male and female offspring, different from what has been suggested by previous work. In addition, We demonstrated that female fecundity, fertility, and length of the fertile period after a single mating were positively associated with the concentration of yeast in their food, and were negatively associated with the duration of yeast restriction in their diet, which suggested that sperm storage is affected by the nutritional status of the females. By revealing the significance of sperm senescence on male and female fertilization success and the fitness of the next generation, this thesis sheds light on a number of evolutionary and applied issues, and provokes new questions for future research on sperm senescence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A failure recovery methodology based on decomposing the platform task space into the major and secondary subtasks is proposed which enables the manipulator to minimize the least-squares error of the major subtasks and to optimize the secondary criterion. A methodology for wrench recovery of parallel manipulators is proposed so that the platform task is divided into the recoverable and non-recoverable subtasks based on the number and type of actuator failures, manipulator configuration and task/application purposes. &#xD;
It is investigated that when the Jacobian matrix of the manipulator is of full row-rank and the minimum 2-norm of the joint velocity vector satisfies the velocity limits of the joints, the full recovery of the platform twist will be provided. If the full recovery of the platform twist cannot be achieved, the optimization method followed by the partitioned Jacobian matrix is used to deal with the failure recovery. It is verified that the optimization method recovers as many as possible components of the platform velocity vector when the objective function, 2-norm of the overall velocity vector of the healthy joints, is minimized. &#xD;
To model uncertainty in the kinematic parameters, the interval analysis is proposed. Different interval-based algorithms to enclose the solution set to the interval linear systems are applied and the solution sets are compared. A novel approach in characterizing the exact solution of the interval linear system is proposed to deal with the failure recovery of parallel manipulators with velocity limits of the joints and uncertainty in the kinematic parameters. Simulation results show how the solution sets of the joint velocity vector are characterized by introducing uncertainties in the kinematic parameters. The calculation of the exact solution takes more computation time compared to the interval-based algorithms. However, the interval-based algorithms give the wider solution box with less computation time. &#xD;
The effect of variations and/or uncertainties in design parameters on the workspace of wire-actuated parallel manipulators without and with gravity is investigated. Simulation results show how the workspace size and shape are changed under variations in design parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Video I: Time-lapse video of GFP-expressing cell migration in HASMC. GFP expressing cells did not differ in cell migration or morphology compared to non-injected control cells. HASMCs were microinjected with GFP construct. Representative images of micoinjected GFP cells were taken 24 h post-injection overnight at 30min intervals using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope and processed as described in Materials &amp; Methods. (10X) -- Video II: Time-lapse video of NT-PDE4D7/GFP-expressing cell migration in HASMC. NT-PDE4D7/GFP expressing cells exhibit elongated tail and decrease in cell migration compared to non-injected control cells. HASMCs were microinjected with NT-PDE4D7/GFP construct. Particle tracking of NT-PDE4D7 cells showed cleaving and full detachment of elongated tail. Representative images of micoinjected NT-PDE4D7 cells were taken 24 h post-injection overnight at 30min intervals using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope and processed as described in Materials &amp; Methods. (10X) -- During the development of atherosclerosis, contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) change to cells capable of migrating and proliferating to mediate repair, where the responses may be adaptive or mal-adaptive in effect. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating agents have been shown to inhibit migration of VSMC. cAMP activity within the cell is known to be ubiquitous and dynamic, requiring control through signal termination mechanisms for cellular homeostasis. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes are central to this critical regulatory process catalyzing the hydrolysis of cAMP. A great deal of insight into the role of PDEs in defining compartmentalization of cAMP signaling has arisen predominately from recent studies on the cAMP-specific PDE4 family. Compartmentalization of PDE4 is mediated by their unique N-terminal domains, which have been proposed to provide the “postcodes/zipcodes” for cellular localization. PDE4D isoforms vary widely, yet their conservation over evolutionary time suggests important non-redundant roles in distinct cellular processes. To study the potential role of individual PDE4D isoforms we seek to utilize the unique N-terminal targeting domains that are proposed to be responsible for their protein-protein interactions and site-directed localization. Herein, we report on the expression, targeting and localization of five “long” PDE4D isoforms and the impact on cell morphology of certain amino-terminal domains of individual PDE4D constructs expressing green fluorescent protein (NT-PDE4D/GFP) in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Through the development of engineered NT-PDE4D/GFP expression plasmids, we were able to study the cell biological impacts associated with the overexpression of individual PDE4D amino-terminal variants in HASMCs. We show that NT-PDE4D5/GFP and NT-PDE4D7/GFP expressing cells exhibited an elongated cell morphology, where this effect was much more marked in NT-PDE4D7/GFP expressing cells, exhibiting multiple leading edge structures and highly elongated “tails”. We identify a potential role for PDE4D7 targeting in the regulation of cell polarity and migration. Our results suggest the novel idea that PDE4D7, rather than the four other long PDE4D isoforms (PDE4D3, PDE4D5, PDE4D8, or PDE4D9), represents the dominant PDE4D variant involved in controlling cAMP-mediated effects on cell tail retraction dynamics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This qualitative study was guided by the framework of Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC). In Canada, although researchers recognize that learning French through a cultural context will promote understanding and acceptance of cultural diversity, as well as the learning of the target language, there is little evidence to support the ways in which this methodology may influence the learning of elementary Core French students. &#xD;
The purpose of this study was to investigate the ways in which a group of Grade 4 students, from an English community, perceived their peers from a French community, and to describe any changes in their attitudes toward learning French as a Second Language in response to the opportunity to learn through a cultural context. This action research study used a questionnaire, an observation checklist of task-related behaviour, and semi-structured group photo-interviews to explore 15 Grade 4 students’ perceptions and attitudes in response to a new research-based teaching approach.&#xD;
As the cultural exchange unfolded, I sought evidence of the three savoirs (that according to the ICC model, primary students have the ability to develop), in order to promote interculturality: savoir être (related to students’ attitudes towards the other students), savoirs (related to knowledge of the other culture), and savoir apprendre/faire (related to behaviour toward the other culture). Results indicated that students showed evidence of two savoirs: savoir être and savoirs. Savoir apprendre/faire, however, was not shown. In addition to the two savoirs, the exchange promoted the learning of French in the classroom, and supported the development of students’ confidence in communicating in French.  &#xD;
The findings of this study contribute to the teaching of Elementary Core French in Ontario, by providing valuable insights into the possible ways that learning French through an intercultural experience holds potential in developing students’ communication abilities as well as awareness and acceptance of otherness, which is the bedrock upon one can develop effective communicators in the target language.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is threefold: to catalogue the black gloss ceramics excavated by the Vigna Marini project in Cerveteri in 2012; to understand the relationship between Rome and Caere in terms of ceramic production, especially in the third century BCE; and to highlight the importance of archaeometric analysis in ceramic studies. Using a firmly established typology of black gloss ceramics, a qualitative analysis of the ceramics of this type recovered in Cerveteri, and archaeometric studies, I show that black gloss production remained relatively stable in Caere during Rome’s expansion into Italy. This is significant for the understanding of Caere’s economy during this period: it has been commonly held that Caere suffered an economic crisis in the third century BCE, but this thesis strongly argues for economic stability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over 12 million incidents of intimate partner victimization (IPV) occur each year in the U.S (Black et al. 2010). Moreover, approximately 363 per 100,000 Canadians are victims of IPV each year (Statistics Canada 2010). Due to these high victimization rates, many scholars have turned their attention to IPV research. However, there is still some debate as to what are the strongest correlates of IPV. This thesis examines risk factors (gender, geographic location, presence of children, Aboriginal status, and minority status) and theories (self-control, routine activities, social disorganization, and collective efficacy) as predictors of IPV. I use Statistics Canada’s 2009 General Social Survey (GSS) to develop our understanding of IPV. More specifically, this thesis examines how these theoretical perspectives help to explain three particular forms of IPV: physical, sexual, and financial.  In order to help policy creation, this thesis explores differences between the explanatory power of risk factors, self-control, routine activities, social disorganization, and collective efficacy on IPV and general victimization (e.g., abuse carried out by someone not necessarily known to the victim).  &#xD;
	Overall, the findings provided some support for the theoretical expectations.  With regard to the risk factor variables, women were more likely to experience sexual and financial IPV. Aboriginals were more likely to experience sexual IPV. Self-control theory worked in the opposite direction than was expected. Low self-control decreased the risk of financial IPV. Routine activities theory explained physical IPV to some degree in that routinely going out to a bar at night decreased the odds of physical IPV. Moreover, the findings revealed that low collective efficacy increased the odds of physical IPV and mediated the effects of routine activities theory. Finally, this thesis provided policy suggestions to reduce IPV and victimization in general.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research is an attempt at understanding the value of higher education with respect to police officer performance.  This study used a sample of 331 Canadian Forces Military Police (CFMP) recruits who attended the Canadian Forces Military Police Academy (CFMPA) from January 2012 to April 2013 for the six month Military Police Qualification Level 3 (MP QL3) course.  It examines between group differences in performance, among MP recruits with higher education – a college diploma or higher – and those with previous work experience – five years experience in another branch of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) or another police agency.&#xD;
The study used demographic and performance data obtained from the recruits’ CFMPA files.  Descriptive statistics described central tendencies, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness.  This was used to assist in the description of recruits between groups and in order to determine distribution characteristics.  Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted on 34 tests – 14 percentage and 20 pass/fail – administered during the course to determine their factor structure.  Chi-squared was used to explore between group differences in course completion.  Finally Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) analyses were used to explore between group differences in performance based on the factor structure determined during EFA and the recruits overall course average.  &#xD;
No significant between group difference with respect to performance were discovered, however, it is hoped that the results of this study will be used to inform the debate of the requirement for higher education in the field of policing and what factors contribute to police professionalization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis proposes a novel synergy of the classical scenario and robust approaches used for strategic supply chain optimization under uncertainty. Two novel formulations, namely the naïve robust scenario formulation and the affinely adjustable robust scenario formulation, are developed, which can be reformulated into tractable deterministic optimization problems if the uncertainty is bounded by the infinity-norm. The two formulations are applied to a classical farm planning problem and an energy and bioproduct supply chain problem. The case study results demonstrate that, compared to the scenario formulation, the proposed formulations can achieve the optimal expected economic performance with smaller number of scenarios, and they can correctly indicate the feasibility of a problem. The results also show that the affinely adjustable robust scenario formulation can better address uncertainties than the naïve robust scenario formulation. &#xD;
&#xD;
Next, a strategic optimization problem for an industrial chemical supply chain from DuPont was studied. The supply chain involves one materials warehouse, five manufacturing plants, five regional product warehouses and five market locations. Each manufacturing plant produces up to 23 grades of final products from 55 grades of primary raw materials. The goal of the strategic optimization is to determine the capacities of the five plants to maximize the total profits of the supply chain system while satisfying uncertain customer demands at the different market locations. A mathematical model is developed to relate the material and product flows in the supply chain, based on which the classical scenario approach and the affinely adjustable robust scenario formulation were developed to address the uncertainty in the demands. The case study results show the advantages of the affinely robust scenario formulation over the scenario formulation. &#xD;
Using the affinely adjustable robust scenario formulation often results in problems with very large sizes, which cannot be solved by regular optimization solvers efficiently. In order to exploit the decomposable structure of the formulation, Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is studied in the thesis. Two approaches to implement Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition are developed, and both approaches involve the solution of a sequence of linear programming (LP) and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) subproblems. The computational study of the industrial chemical supply chain shows that a combination of the two Dantzig-Wolfe approaches can achieve an optimal or a near-optimal solution much more quickly than a state-of-the-art commercial LP/MILP solver, and the computational advantage increases with the increase of number of scenarios involved in the problem.</dcterms:abstract>

     Polymer photodetectors that are made from R- and S-limonene induced achiral polymers are fabricated. A “hot spin-coating” process is introduced to cast uniform limonene induced polymer films. As a result of chirality transfer, Cotton effects are also observed in these photodetectors’ CD spectra.&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>A dynamic mathematical model was developed to simulate the response of polyacrylamide gel (PAG) dosimeters to a single spherical radioactive brachytherapy seed. Simulations were conducted for a high dose-rate (HDR) seed using 192Ir and a low dose-rate (LDR) seed using 125I. The model is able to predict the amount of polymer formed, the crosslink density, and the volume fraction of aqueous phase as a function of radial distance and time. Results show that PAG dosimeters can provide accurate HDR brachytherapy dosimetry at distances larger than 4 mm from the centre of the seed but will give poor results for LDR due to monomer diffusion.&#xD;
Experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential for using pentacosa-10,12-diynoic acid (PCDA) as the reporter molecule in micelle gel dosimeters for optical computed tomography (CT) readout. Several gels containing PCDA that was solubilized using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) responded to radiation by changing from colourless to blue. Unfortunately, all phantoms that showed colour changes were turbid, making them unsuitable for optical CT scanning. Several techniques were used to produce transparent gels containing PCDA but none of these gels responded noticeably to radiation. Only turbid gels with precipitated PCDA responded, indicating that the colour change was due to oligomerization within PCDA crystals and that PCDA molecules solubilized in micelles did not undergo oligomerization. As a result, PCDA is not suitable for use in radiochromic micelle gel dosimeters.&#xD;
A new recipe for a radiochromic leuco crystal violet (LCV) micelle gel dosimeters with enhanced dose sensitivity was developed for optical CT readout. The recipe contains LCV, trichloro acetic acid (TCAA), Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB), 2,2,2-Trichloroethanol (TCE), and gelatin. Experiments were conducted to improve understanding about interactions between the different components of LCV micelle gel, highlighting the importance of pH on dose sensitivity and transparency. Results also showed the effectiveness of chlorinated compounds in improving dose sensitivity. Statistical techniques were used to build empirical models that were used to optimize the gel recipe. Additional testing in larger phantoms will be required to assess the effectiveness of the proposed gel for clinical dosimetry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Exploration for large zinc silicate deposits is more challenging than zinc sulfide deposits, as they do not exhibit similar geophysical anomalies. The Vazante deposit, which is the world’s largest zinc silicate deposit, occurs in brecciated dolomite and comprises mainly willemite with various proportions of hematite, and minor franklinite and sphalerite. In the Vazante region, the exploration challenge is enhanced as outcrops are rare, bedrock generally sits below 10s of metres of laterite cover and barren hematite-rich breccias have a similar geophysical signature to willemite ore bodies. In order to evaluate the applications of geophysical surveys in the exploration of this type of deposit, data from 475 samples were investigated from drill holes representative of the various types of ore, host rocks and zones of known geophysical anomalies in the Vazante District. Geochemical (ICP-MS and XRF) and mineralogical (optical, EMPA, SEM and MLA) data were integrated with physical rock properties (density, magnetic susceptibility and K-U-Th gamma ray spectrometry) to assist in finding new ore zones. The most distinct physical property of the ore is density (3.0-4.3 g/cm3), compared with the host rocks (2.7-3.0 g/cm3). This is due to high proportion of denser minerals (hematite and willemite) in the ore. However, barren hematite breccias also have high densities (3.0-4.5 g/cm3). The zinc ore and hematite breccias yielded higher magnetic susceptibilities (0.1-38 x10-3 SI) than the surrounding host rocks, with the highest values associated with greater proportions of franklinite and magnetite (7-38 x10-3 SI). The zinc ore has an elevated U concentration (up to 33ppm) relative to the various host rocks (up to 7 ppm), yielding higher gamma spectrometric values. The results of this investigation indicate that an integration of magnetic, gravimetric and radiometric surveys would be required to identify zinc silicate ore zones and potentially differentiate them from barren hematite breccias and host rocks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In situ thermal treatment (ISTT) applications require successful gas capture for the effective remediation of chlorinated solvent dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones.  Gas production and transport mechanisms during bench-scale electrical resistance heating (ERH) experiments were examined in this study using a quantitative light transmission visualization method.  Processed images during water boiling indicated that gas bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence into a connected steam phase occurred at critical gas saturations of Sgc = 0.233 ± 0.017, which allowed for continuous gas transport out of the heated zone.  Critical gas saturations were lower than air-water emergence gas saturations of Sgm = 0.285 ± 0.025, derived from the inflection point of ambient temperature capillary pressure-saturation curves.  Coupled electrical current and temperature measurements were identified as a metric to assess gas phase development.  Processed images during co-boiling of pooled trichloroethene (TCE) DNAPL and water indicated that discontinuous gas transport occurred above the DNAPL pool.  When colder zones were introduced, condensation prevented the development of continuous steam channels and caused redistribution of DNAPL along the vapour front.  These results suggest that water boiling temperatures should be targeted throughout the subsurface (i.e., from specific locations of DNAPL to extraction points) during ERH applications.  Because convective heat loss and non-uniform power distributions have the potential to prevent the achievement of boiling temperatures, a thermal enhancement was developed where dissolved gas delivered to the target heated zone liberates from solution at elevated temperatures and increases gas production.  Processed images of ERH-activated carbon dioxide (CO2) exsolution indicated that discontinuous gas transport occurred above saturations of  Sg = 0.070 ± 0.022.  Maximum exsolved gas saturations of Sg = 0.118 ± 0.005 were sustained during continuous injection of the saturated CO2 solution into the heated zone.  Estimated groundwater relative permeabilities of krw = 0.642 ± 0.009 at these saturations are expected to decrease convective heat loss.  Discontinuous transport of exsolved gas at sub-boiling temperatures also demonstrated the potential of the enhancement to bridge vertical gas transport through colder zones.  In conclusion, sustained gas saturations and transport mechanisms were dependent on the mechanism of gas production and effects of condensation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Family life in North America has changed dramatically over the past five decades. This rapid transformation of the household has serious implications for children, ranging from emotional and behavioural problems, to delinquency. This study investigates how certain family transitions affect children differently with regards to delinquency. This thesis uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth conducted in 1995 by Statistics Canada to update our knowledge of the impact that broken homes can have on children’s engagement in delinquent activities. Prior research has established that there is a positive association between family structure and delinquency. However, prior research has failed to explain why this relationship exists. Hence, one of the goals of this study is to investigate if variables representing social control, self-control, social learning, and strain theories can help to explain the association between family structure and crime. Another goal of this study is to determine if the broken homes effect is predominantly a function of parental absence or if the gender of the absent parent matters. Results indicate that in some circumstances certain forms of broken homes are directly associated with specific types of crime, while in other types of broken homes, after taking into account differences in parental attachment, self-control, associations with deviant peers, and strain, they are not. Avenues for future research are discussed, including ways to help establish the causal ordering linking broken homes to delinquency.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Michael Della Rocca has provided an influential interpretation of Spinoza relying heavily on the principle of sufficient reason. In order to challenge this interpretation, I identify three assumptions Della Rocca makes about the PSR and demonstrate that it is not clear Spinoza shares them. First, Della Rocca contends that the PSR is unlimited in scope. I show that the scope of Spinoza’s version of the PSR is ambiguous. While it is clear that substances and modes are included, it is unclear just how widely the scope extends. Second, Della Rocca argues that the PSR demands there are no illegitimate bifurcations. I argue that Della Rocca’s account of illegitimate bifurcations is too strong. I show that Spinoza offers a distinction in explanatory types that should be considered illegitimate and inexplicable according to Della Rocca’s definition of illegitimate bifurcations. Third, Della Rocca argues that explanations which satisfy the demands of the PSR must be in terms of the concepts involved. I show that Spinoza does not use conceptual explanations. Instead, in almost all cases, the explanations Spinoza relies on to satisfy the demands of the PSR are in terms of a thing’s cause.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis concerns the development of alternate bars under steady state flows. The movable bed is flat at the beginning of the experiment; the bars reach their equilibrium or developed state at the time Td. The thesis has two objectives. The first is to introduce new equations for the geometric characteristics, namely height and length, of alternate bars at the fully developed stage, and to evaluate them against the existing equations. The second objective is to present the results of two series of experiments carried out to characterize the process of development of alternate bars and obtain estimates of their time of development. The data resulting from these experiments are intended as a foundation for future work towards the establishment of a predictive equation for the development time of alternate bars.&#xD;
The new equations for bar height and length rest on dimensional considerations and all the available data. Bars produced under rough turbulent and transitional flows are treated separately. The proposed equations are found to consistently give more accurate estimates of alternate bar dimensions than existing equations.&#xD;
The experiments to quantify the time of development of alternate bars are carried out in the 21 m long, 0.76 m wide sediment transport flume of the Queen’s Coastal Engineering Laboratory. In addition to providing estimates of the time of development of alternate bars, these experiments reveal aspects of the process of development of alternate bars that had not been reported previously. In particular, they show that, all other conditions being the same (including the sediment transport capacity of the initial flow), the more pronounced alternate bars formed under shallower flows develop faster than less pronounced bars formed under deeper flows.&#xD;
 The findings of this study highlight the fact that the previously unexplained wide variation in alternate bar dimensions is related to the plotting position of the data point in the alternate bar existence region of Ahmari and da Silva (2011). This study also sheds light on the evolution and development of alternate bars, which establishes a strong foundation for future studies on the topic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Life history theory assumes that correlations among fitness-related life history traits should be negative among individuals, reflecting resource allocation constraints among traits such as growth and reproduction. These traits trade off because they cannot be simultaneously maximized in individuals facing finite resource acquisition. Positive correlations among traits that are expected to be negative (e.g. between energetically costly traits) have been regularly observed, however, and have usually been ascribed to genetic or resource acquisition differences. In the freshwater zooplankton Cladoceran Daphnia, positive correlations have been particularly well documented even when genetic and environmental variation have been controlled. The sign of these correlations represent a problem for life history theory, which is underpinned by the notion of universal and unavoidable costs associated with investing in a given trait. It has been suggested, however, that costs vary with environment and thus can change the sign of a correlation. A change in correlation sign over an environmental gradient may indicate that the assumed universality of costs and constraints are not as universal as expected by life history theory. Few life history experiments have examined traits in multiple environments, and fewer have done so while controlling resource acquisition and genetic variation. Here I ask whether the positive genetic correlations among somatic growth rate, egg production rate, and longevity are present in the face of equal ingestion, clonal individuals, and a finely resolved gradient of food quality, an environmental factor that frequently affects Daphnia. I partition trait covariation into genetic and residual, or environmental, sources. All resulting genetic correlations were non-significant. Residual correlations trended from significantly positive to negative between longevity and growth rate and remained near zero between longevity and egg rate. The residual correlation between growth and reproduction, two expensive traits, displayed significantly positive residual correlations across the food quality gradient remained significantly positive. Given the experimental controls in place, I suggest that differences in individual ontogeny may give rise to differential resource utilization or assimilation efficiency. This may be a mechanism for differential resource acquisition in the absence of ingestion variation. Additionally, the different ways genetic and residual correlations change over an environmental gradient may provide insight on one manner by which genotypes might coexist and provide a candidate explanation for the second paradox of the plankton.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Vitamin D may be important in the causal pathway to breast cancer (BC) by influencing mammographic breast density (MD). However, previous study results in postmenopausal women are inconsistent. Study objectives were to prospectively examine the relationship between biomarkers of vitamin D (25-OH-D) and percent MD in postmenopausal women at northern latitudes. Potential effect modification by exemestane therapy, calcium or genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway was also examined. &#xD;
Methods: This study evaluated a sub-cohort of postmenopausal women at elevated BC risk who participated in the NCIC Clinical Trials Group placebo-controlled MAP.3 trial with exemestane. Levels of 25-OH-D were measured using LC-MS/MS from serum samples collected at baseline and year 1, averaged and adjusted for month of collection. Baseline and follow-up (≥ 3 year) percent MD was centrally assessed from film and digital mammograms with Cumulus software. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the effect of 25-OH-D on log transformed percent MD at follow-up and on the change in percent MD from baseline.  Percent MD was also dichotomized and multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate 25-OH-D levels between 1) women with lower (&lt;25%) compared with higher (≥25%) percent MD and 2) women with a decrease compared with no change or an increase in percent MD over time.&#xD;
Results: Percent MD was measured for 568 participants with a follow-up mammogram and for 388 participants with a baseline mammogram in the same format as the follow-up.  The geometric mean percent MD of the follow-up mammograms was 4.3% and few women (13.4%) had percent MD ≥ 25%. The unadjusted mean 25-OH-D concentration was 36.5 ng/mL (SD=10.6) based on pooled baseline and year one samples. After controlling for age, month of sampling and potential confounders, 25-OH-D was not predictive of log transformed percent MD at follow-up (p=0.36) or with annual mean changes from baseline (p=0.33).  Similarly, results from the logistic regression analyses were not statistically significant and no interactions with exemestane, calcium or genetic polymorphisms were detected.  &#xD;
Conclusion: No association was observed between vitamin D levels and percent MD at ≥3 year follow-up or change in percent MD from baseline.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>"'The Burden of the Image:' Jane Morris in Art and Life" examines the work and life of Pre-Raphaelite model Jane Burden Morris (1839-1914). Burden Morris, an embroiderer and wife of the arts and crafts designer William Morris (1834-96), became famous in her own lifetime as the model for a number of Pre-Raphaelite works, particularly the paintings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-82). Although she was not considered conventionally beautiful by Victorian standards, artists drew heavily upon Burden Morris’s appearance, particularly her striking features and unusual artistic dress, in order to heighten the exoticism of their works and to suggest moments outside contemporary Victorian time and place. Burden Morris’s features became synonymous with the Pre-Raphaelite ideal in female beauty and several contemporaries reflected upon the surreal experience of meeting the enigmatic woman thought only to exist in paintings.&#xD;
	Borrowing from a material culture approach which views images as both reflective and formative of identity, this work considers the relationship between Jane Burden Morris and her painted representation, and focuses in particular on the works produced through Burden Morris’s long-standing collaboration with Rossetti. Through an examination of Burden Morris’s appearance, activities, and demeanour, this dissertation considers the aspects of Burden Morris’s identity which contributed to her use in numerous Pre-Raphaelite images, and further explores the way in which these paintings may have altered how Burden Morris conceived of her own identity. “The Burden of the Image” examines three dominant modes of representing Burden Morris, including depictions of Burden Morris as medieval damsel, myth, and monster. It also considers Jane Burden Morris’s role within the broader context of aestheticism, and explores her relationship to the artistic dress movement and the aesthetic interior.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>On sandy coastlines dunes provide a barrier of protection from strong environmental forces that can naturally occur during storm events including storm surges that expose the dunes to large waves. A set of laboratory experiments were used to investigate the morphological processes during the erosion of a steep dune face under bichromatic wave conditions for two different mean water level elevations, corresponding to storm surges and waves that collide with or overwash the dune. In the collision regime, episodic slumping due to the undercutting of the dune resulted in sudden erosional events followed by long periods of wave-driven reshaping at the dune toe. In the overwash regime, dune erosion was faster and occurred at a more consistent rate. Small scale bedforms (ripples) measured during the overwash test evolved in height faster and to greater overall heights than collision test while bedform lengths were not affected by the change in water level. &#xD;
A numerical model, XBeach, was calibrated to examine the ability to predict erosion of the steep dune due to waves in the two water level regimes. XBeach was not able to recreate the spatial variability of the significant wave height profile from the laboratory measurements; however, mean velocities were in good agreement with observations suggesting that bed shear stress is well estimated. During mobile bed simulations of erosion in the two regimes, the model was in agreement with measured dune erosion after initial adjustment. XBeach was very sensitive to several parameters that control the rate of erosion including the critical avalanching slope under water, the threshold water depth and the sediment transport formulation. The model did not perform well at predicting erosion rates until these parameters had been modified. Overall, XBeach performed better when simulating dune erosion in the overwash regime than the collision regime.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The role of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) in regulating longevity and dauer formation in C. elegans is well defined. However, the role of IIS in stress responses such as L1 arrest is less studied and poorly understood. One of the regulators of longevity and lifespan in the worm is the homolog of the human tumour suppressor PTEN, called DAF- 18 in C. elegans. DAF-18 is known to act through the IIS pathway to regulate longevity, lifespan, dauer formation and also control germline proliferation during L1 arrest. I show that daf-18 mutants cannot properly L1 arrest and that the arrest phenotype is only partially rescued by IIS genes, indicating regulation of L1 arrest independent of the IIS pathway. Additionally, I identify a germline role for DAF-18/PTEN during L1 arrest. EMS mutagenesis screens were performed to find unbiased suppressors and worm homologs of candidate human cancer genes were tested for suppression of the L1 arrest phenotype. Finally, I show that in addition to controlling germline proliferation during arrest, DAF-18/PTEN controls divisions of some somatic tissues during L1 arrest, including in the muscle cell lineage and the mechanosensory neuron cell lineage.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is a joint replacement procedure used mainly to treat patients with severe shoulder osteoarthritis combined with massive rotator cuff tears. It involves reversing the `ball and socket' orientation of the glenohumeral joint in the shoulder. While RSA has been largely successful in treating pain and improving function in these patients, complication rates remain high. Many of these complications, including joint instability and scapular notching (excessive bone wear), are caused or exacerbated by impingement of the humerus or the humeral component against the scapula. Adduction deficit refers to a patient's inability to fully adduct the arm due to impingement. Minimizing adduction deficit may improve RSA patients' functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
An existing mechanical shoulder simulator was further developed to model glenohumeral range of motion in RSA. The three heads of the deltoid were modelled using polyethylene cable and electric linear actuators with inline load cells. RSA components were implanted in Sawbones scapula and humerus bone models. The scapula was fixed in the frame of the simulator. Triads of optical tracking markers were attached to the humerus and simulator frame and used to track segment motion. &#xD;
&#xD;
A data analysis technique was developed to determine when joint impingement occurred. The convex and concave surfaces of the glenoid and humeral components were digitized, and a least-squares sphere fit was used to find their centres. The distance between these centres was then calculated during passive abduction and adduction of the humerus, and labeled d_GH. Impingement onset was defined as the point where d_GH was five standard deviations above its baseline value, indicating that the components were no longer concentric. This technique was used to determine the effects of humeral neck-shaft angle, socket depth, glenosphere diameter and eccentricity on range of motion and adduction deficit.&#xD;
A retentive humeral cup depth increased adduction deficit by 14 degrees and reduced range of motion by 26 degrees. A decreased neck-shaft angle reduced adduction deficit by 10 degrees but had little effect on overall range of motion. Diameter and eccentricity had no effect on either measure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Following the First World War, colonial policy in West Africa underwent a transition as British administrators began to adopt indirect rule reforms to help usher in peasant-driven agricultural development in Northern Ghana.  This thesis addresses the impact of these important policy changes on women and children through a study of local colonial and indigenous responses to four bodily practices: female circumcision, human trafficking (female pawning and illicit adoption), nudity and prostitution. Although much has been written about colonial and post-independence legislation of the female body, especially the female circumcision controversy in Kenya and prostitution in the mines and cities of east and southern Africa, few historical studies have fully considered the role of West African development doctrine, or the importance of ‘tradition’ and ‘community’, in colonial policies affecting women and children in Northern Ghana. Through a Parliamentary inquiry in 1930, West African departments came to reluctantly engage with questions of women and children’s status. Collectively, they decided that a gradualist path which sought to preserve community or ‘tribal’ cohesion was preferable to legislation promoting individual rights and civil society. This thesis situates this reluctance to introduce potentially destabilizing legislation in the context of development doctrine in northern Ghana. &#xD;
This thesis focusses on the north-eastern borderland corridor of northern Ghana where in the 1930s anthropologists and district officials investigated questions of female circumcision and as a solution to Parliamentary inquiry, sought to encourage a milder form practiced in infancy, rather than adolescence. The refusal to legislate reflected West African officials’ privileging of ‘community’ over the ‘individual’ and was repeated in their responses to ‘undesirable practices’, including nudity, pawning, and in post-independence times, illicit adoption and prostitution. In exploring state officials’ handling of these practices in a gradualist manner, this thesis illuminates the connections between development doctrine and the role of the male colonial gaze in managing undesirable practices in north-eastern Ghana, West Africa.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This archivally-based dissertation re-contextualizes Robert Louis Stevenson’s South Pacific photographic collection (1888-1894), situating it in relation to his incomplete and posthumously published anthropological study of the Pacific, In the South Seas (1896); his unpublished pamphlet about Samoan colonial conflict, “A Samoan Scrapbook”; and his wife Fanny Stevenson’s diary The Cruise of the ‘Janet Nichol.’ Despite the recent and ample scholarship on Stevenson, few critics have engaged significantly with his photography. These (usually) anonymous photographs, taken by different members of the Stevenson family, were intended as illustrations for a projected book entitled The South Seas. Although this literary project was never completed, a dense photographic archive remains and discloses the many functions of photography during Stevenson’s Pacific career. In this truly interdisciplinary dissertation, I recognize the interdependent relationship between Stevenson’s Pacific non-fiction and his family’s photographic practice and stress that the photographic project was more important to Stevenson’s Pacific writing than has been acknowledged previously. This dissertation addresses the relationship between Stevenson’s photography and non-fiction writing, and demonstrates the important and underlying ways in which Stevenson’s photographs are related to his written accounts of Pacific Islanders and their societies. Furthermore, I contribute a series of close readings of individual (and previously unpublished) photographs, which I contextualize in their appropriate literary, cultural, and historical milieu. This dissertation contributes to a limited body of work that addresses the intersections of Pacific photography, anthropology, and Stevenson’s non-fiction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Freshwater lake ecosystems often exhibit strong oxygen, and temperature gradients across which many zooplankton species live. Daphnia sp. vary in their ability to up-regulate hemoglobin in response to low oxygen environments. However; the role that hemoglobin up-regulation plays in diel vertical migration, and how it might mediate coexistence of Daphnia within lakes is still unclear. Using an oligotrophic lake in Ontario, I studied three distinct phenotypes of Daphnia pulicaria, which differed in the ability to up-regulate hemoglobin (classified as red, pink, and pale). Twenty-four hour surveys were conducted during the fall of 2012 and samples were drawn at 1m intervals to monitor changes in diel vertical migration. At each 1m interval Daphnia were color indexed, photographed, and preserved for genetic analysis using cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Red and pink Daphnia showed little change in distribution over the water column through time, suggesting individuals experienced little vertical migration. Pale individuals showed strong changes in vertical distribution through time suggesting vertical migration. The phenotypes are strongly correlated with multi-locus genotypes, suggesting genetic differences in migration behavior. Mesocosm experiments were used to manipulate migration over heterogeneous environments to test the hypothesis that vertical migration impacts genetic and phenotypic diversity in Daphnia pulicaria. The first mesocosm experiment contained two treatment groups; a migrating and non-migrating treatment containing the three phenotypes. The migrating treatment permitted unrestricted movement throughout the water column, and the non-migrating treatment restricted Daphnia to discrete 1m intervals. The second mesocosm experiment comprised two non-migrating treatments; red non-migrating and pale non-migrating. Results from the first set of mesocosm experiments indicate decreased genetic and phenotypic diversity in the migrating treatment. Shifts in hemoglobin up-regulation between pales and reds in the second mesocosm experiments suggest hemoglobin up-regulation is plastic, whereby pale, pink, and red individuals have the ability to up and down regulate hemoglobin. The differences in Daphnia migration patterns and the plastic response in hemoglobin up-regulation permits migrating genotypes to withstand low oxygen conditions. Overall implications of this study suggest that migration over a strong environmental gradient plays a key role in fostering phenotypic plasticity and genetic diversity in organisms living in heterogeneous environments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Studies of human relationships in anthropology, religion, community studies and psychology have determined that willingness to sacrifice plays an important role in reinforcing and strengthening social bonds. It is remarkable that given the increasing prominence of the relationship marketing paradigm, marketers have spent little time investigating willingness to sacrifice as a potential variable of interest. This dissertation extends relationship marketing theory by defining, developing and testing the willingness to sacrifice construct in the context of brand communities. It not only establishes a role for willingness to sacrifice in the nomological network of relationship marketing, but also develops a typology of sacrifices members make in brand communities. Results from two experiments and a field study of two brand communities suggest there are significant relationships between willingness to sacrifice and established constructs in relationship marketing research, such as identification, satisfaction with peers, and norms of reciprocity. Moreover, these findings indicate that willingness to sacrifice is positively associated with beneficial marketing outcomes such as word of mouth, purchase intentions and brand community longevity. By integrating literature from personal psychology, sociology anthropology–all of which discuss sacrifice in terms of how it can benefit and strengthen relationships– this research challenges the conventional marketing assumption that sacrifice is merely “the price one pays.” Taken together, these studies enrich our understanding of willingness to sacrifice in a marketing context, and more specifically, identify a process through which it contributes to brand community success and related marketing outcomes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a study of G.W. Leibniz’s views on compossibility. Leibniz calls substances that can be brought into existence together “compossible,” and he says that substances that cannot be brought into existence together are “incompossible.” Incompossibility and compossibility together divide substances into sets of individual substances that make up possible worlds. God then chooses from these possible worlds the best one to bring into existence. Thus without compossibility, the contingency of the world, and even God’s choice could have no rational basis. It is on these grounds that Leibniz thought compossibility was the most powerful—and perhaps, only—defense against the position that the actual world is the only possible world. This is a position that was powerfully argued for by Benedict de Spinoza. For largely theological reasons Spinoza’s position was unacceptable to Leibniz.&#xD;
        Since Leibniz’s own time thinkers have found it difficult to see why all the substances are not compossible with one another given certain other philosophical and theological claims Leibniz is committed to. This state of affairs has been exacerbated by the fact that Leibniz himself seems not to have been concerned with providing a clear answer to this conundrum. In an attempt to fill in this omission, and to justify Leibniz’s intuition philosophers have proposed varying accounts of compossibility. Unfortunately, all of these accounts fall short of upholding a comprehensive rational explanation of the world’s contingency based on the objective rational choice of God. My dissertation presents a picture that is multi-faceted in its sensitivity to Leibniz’s theological, physical and logical concerns while nevertheless harmonizing with other tenets of Leibniz’s overall philosophy. I seek to achieve this end by defending the view that compossibility is based on the logical properties of the complete concepts of substances understood as embedded within networks of mutual intelligibility.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
Many young children, including toddlers are using the Internet. By the time, children are eight years old, 98% of them will have accessed the Internet independently, some with digital devices of their own (Katherine, 2013). During childhood and adolescence, our youth develop particular habits while learning how and where to navigate on the Internet. What do parents and educators know about these habits and how they develop? Accordino &amp; Accordino (2011) found that 44% of children who reported participating in cyber-bullying also had poor parent-child relationships. According to some researchers (Endicott-Popovsky, 2013; Weeden, Cooke, &amp; McVey, 2013), some parents and teachers have a limited understanding of the Internet habits of children and adolescents. When parents and teachers lack knowledge of what their children and students are doing online, it greatly restricts their ability to help children learn and develop healthy Internet habits.&#xD;
	Drawing from academic literature, journal articles, books, media sources, and blogs, this project develops an information guide for parents and teachers containing information about the Internet practices of children and adolescents from 2-18 years of age. This guide addresses strategies for communicating with children and adolescents about their Internet practices, discussing and creating Internet boundaries, working with children and youth on becoming mindful contributors to the Internet, and incorporating practices that help maintain their safety online. The project will to be a useful tool for improving Internet education for parent, teachers and youth.&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Feature-based spectrum sensing techniques have emerged as good balance between energy-based techniques and coherent-based techniques, where the former require minimal prior information of the observed signal, and the latter have robust detection performance when the observed signal is very weak. In this thesis, we focus on pilot tone-aided detection as a feature-based detection class. We propose an improved pilot tone-aided spectrum sensor that utilizes the presence of the pilot tone and the overall energy of the received signal. We show that the optimal Neyman-Pearson detector is a weighted summation of a feature-based component and an energy-based component. The former provides coherent gains at the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, whereas the latter provides non-coherent gains at moderate SNR levels. The proposed detector intelligently adapts its weights based on the SNR of the observed signal and the power allocation factor of the pilot tone. This helps it attain significant performance gains compared with the conventional pilot tone-aided detectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, we present suboptimal detectors that reduce the computational complexity. For instance, we demonstrate that moment estimators are effective techniques for spectrum sensing. Motivated by insights gained from the derivations of these moment estimators, we present a selective mean-variance estimator that performs well in the absence of the prior knowledge about the pilot tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Moreover, we analyze the impact of two model uncertainties on the detection performance of the proposed detector: Noise uncertainty and imperfect pilot-matching. We show that unlike the energy detector, the proposed detector does not suffer from the SNR wall under the noise uncertainty model due to the coherent gains embedded in the feature-based component. Also, unlike existing pilot tone-aided detectors, the proposed detector is resilient against imperfect synchronization due to the non-coherent gains embedded in computing the overall energy of the signal. Also, we show that the proposed detector achieves the lowest sample complexity, leading to tangible improvements to the aggregate throughput of the secondary user. Extensive simulation and analytical results are provided to verify these conclusions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cold in-place recycling with expanded asphalt mix (CIREAM) has become an accepted road rehabilitation technique in Ontario and other parts of the world given its advantages over regular cold in-place recycling (CIR) and other methods. Although CIREAM offers early strength advantages and extended paving periods among other benefits, late season CIREAM can be burdened by distresses such as ravelling, potholing and other moisture-induced damage. Limited information on the behaviour and failure mechanisms of CIREAM has also hindered its utilization in spite of the numerous benefits. &#xD;
This research investigated effects of additives on foam properties of roofing asphalt flux (RAF) binder in order to evaluate the suitability of the binder for CIREAM. The study also investigated how mixture variables and test protocols affect performance properties that relate to early strength and moisture resistance of CIREAM versus CIR. Indirect tensile strength testing with moisture conditioning was used to assess the effects of asphalt cement type (80, 300 pen grades and polymer modified asphalt), conditioning time, and additives such as Portland cement, foam stabilizers, polymers and fibers. Uniaxial cyclic compression with partial confinement was used to assess effect of additives on deformation resistance of recycled mixes. Although a siloxane-based stabilizer significantly improved the stability of RAF foam, the binder may not be suitable for CIREAM due to its limited expansion. The optimum binder content was found to be around 2 percent, which is significantly higher than the minimum 1 percent currently used in Ontario. Both Portland cement and the siloxane additive exerted significant positive effects on strength behaviour and moisture resistance of the recycled mixes. In regular CIR mixes, 2 percent binder content gave desirable early strength and strain performance compared to 1 percent.&#xD;
Application of controlled amounts of additives (e.g. Portland cement, foam stabilizers) and case-by-case evaluation can improve the performance properties of CIREAM and address the associated problems. The entire research effort described in this thesis was designed to provide advice on potential improvements in the CIREAM process as it is currently carried out in Ontario, and also help in developing quality control standards in CIREAM and other cold mix processes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The qHPV vaccine has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of HPV-related diseases, including cervical cancer. However, a recent systematic review of clinical trials has suggested that the risk of bronchospasm may be increased by this vaccine, and a large observational study has reported an increased risk of anaphylaxis.&#xD;
Objectives: To determine whether qHPV vaccination increases the risk of incident asthma, asthma exacerbation, and anaphylaxis.&#xD;
Methods: A population-based retrospective cohort of grade 8 girls eligible for Ontario’s HPV immunization program between 2007 and 2011 was identified using the province’s administrative health and immunization databases. Cohort members were followed from September 1st of their grade 8 year until their date of death or end of study (March 31st, 2012). The self-controlled case series method, a self-matched, case-based analysis was used to assess the effect of qHPV vaccination on the risk of SRREs, and rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome was estimated using conditional Poisson regression.&#xD;
Results: The cohort consisted of 125,575 girls with a mean age of 13.2 years, 57.7% of whom received at least one dose of the qHPV vaccine. During an average of 2.5 years of follow-up, 1473 cases of incident asthma, 901 of asthma exacerbation and 38 of anaphylaxis were identified. HPV vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of incident asthma or asthma exacerbation (RRadj 0.76, 95% CI 0.37-1.54 and RRadj 0.74, 95% CI 0.27-2.00, respectively), and these associations were unchanged by the presence of risk factors and time since vaccination. There was also no evidence of an increased risk of anaphylaxis following qHPV vaccination as demonstrated by an absence of cases of anaphylaxis occurring on the day of vaccination. &#xD;
Conclusions: This large, population-based study provides strong evidence that the qHPV vaccine does not increase the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma, and additional evidence for the lack of an increased risk of anaphylaxis in the younger populations targeted by HPV immunization programs. These findings add to the growing body of evidence on the safety of the qHPV vaccine.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To help organizations better understand and improve the management of information systems development (ISD) projects, this dissertation aims to understand what ISD project knowledge and beliefs ISD professionals work with and how the knowledge and beliefs are organized in their minds. Drawing on the cognitive perspective using a mental model approach, I define a new construct, ISD Project (ISDP) mental model, which refers to ISD professionals’ knowledge and belief structures that help them understand, conduct, and manage ISD projects. Particularly, two essential elements of ISDP mental models - content and structure – were explored. Regarding the content, forty fundamental concepts were derived from literature reviews and cognitive interviews with 19 ISD experts. Analysis of 95 ISD professionals’ cognitive responses using Multidimensional Scaling revealed four types of evaluative beliefs - customer-, team-, enterprise-, and product-oriented beliefs. This new construct, along with its assessment procedures, provides a useful starting point for academics and organizations to explore the people factor in ISD.&#xD;
     To investigate the impact of ISDP mental models, I examined work relationships between project managers and developers where effective work relationships are crucial to project success. Specifically, I explored how the similarity of mental models and an understanding of others’ mental models influence work relationships. Through a multiple case study on 6 project manager-developer pairs in different case conditions (i.e., similarity of mental models x accuracy of understanding), the results provide preliminary support that the project manager-developer pairs who hold accurate understanding have more effective implicit coordination - they are sensitive to one another’s knowledge, beliefs, and preferences and they adjust their task and interpersonal coordination accordingly. Accurate understanding also stimulates the process of knowledge integration in which the dyad builds upon one another’s knowledge to resolve project challenges.  &#xD;
     This dissertation contributes to the literature on ISD project management by capturing the organization of ISDP knowledge in ISD professionals’ minds and identifying underlying beliefs. Furthermore, it contributes to an understanding of how project managers and developers can coordinate effectively when they have high cross-understanding, despite dissimilarities of knowledge and beliefs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Pattern discovery in protein structures is a fundamental task in computational biology, with important applications in protein structure prediction, profiling and alignment. We propose a novel approach for pattern discovery in protein structures using Particle Swarm-based flying windows over potentially promising regions of the search space. Using a heuristic search, based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is, however, easily trapped in local optima due to the sparse nature of the problem search space. Thus, we introduce a novel fitness-based stagnation detection technique that effectively and efficiently restarts the search process to escape potential local optima. &#xD;
The proposed fitness-based method significantly outperforms the commonly-used distance-based method when tested on eight classical and advanced (shifted/rotated) benchmark functions, as well as on two other applications for proteomic pattern matching and discovery. The main idea is to make use of the already-calculated fitness values of swarm particles, instead of their pairwise distance values, to predict an imminent stagnation situation. That is, the proposed fitness-based method does not require any computational overhead of repeatedly calculating pairwise distances between all particles at each iteration. Moreover, the fitness-based method is less dependent on the problem search space, compared with the distance-based method.   &#xD;
The proposed pattern discovery algorithms are first applied to protein contact maps, which are the 2D compact representation of protein structures. Then, they are extended to work on actual protein 3D structures and interaction networks, offering a novel and low-cost approach to protein structure classification and interaction prediction.  Concerning protein structure classification, the proposed PSO-based approach correctly distinguishes between the positive and negative examples in two protein datasets over 50 trials. As for protein interaction prediction, the proposed approach works effectively on complex, mostly sparse protein interaction networks, and predicts high-confidence protein-protein interactions — validated by more than one computational and experimental source — through knowledge transfer between topologically-similar interaction patterns of close proximity.&#xD;
Such encouraging results demonstrate that pattern discovery in protein structures and interaction networks are promising new applications of the fast-growing and far-reaching PSO algorithms, which is the main argument of this thesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of my dissertation was to examine whether adult romantic attachment and interpersonal threat bias people’s perceptions of physical distance within a social context. Across three separate studies, I assessed the interactive effects of attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and threat on perceptions of distance. In the baseline (control) condition, I predicted that people higher in attachment anxiety would perceive greater interpersonal closeness than people lower in attachment anxiety. However, in the threat condition, I predicted that this perceptual difference would disappear or, alternatively, that people higher in attachment anxiety would perceive greater interpersonal distance than people lower in attachment anxiety. Furthermore, I hypothesized that higher levels of attachment avoidance would be associated with greater perceptions of physical distance regardless of condition. In Study One, I used a loneliness prime and measured attachment orientation to examine their influence on the strength of the tendency to perceive an ambiguous, computerized figure as walking toward oneself. In Study Two, I investigated how attachment and the threat of separation affected estimations of physical distance from one’s romantic partner who was standing relatively close by. In the third and final study, I examined the impact of attachment and separation threat on perceptions of physical distance from one’s romantic partner when the partner was absent and imagined to be in another city. A meta-analysis of the experiments revealed that the influence of attachment anxiety on distance perception was not only dependent on condition, but also on attachment avoidance. Specifically, for people high in attachment avoidance in the control condition, higher attachment anxiety was associated with smaller perceptions of distance. In contrast, for people high in attachment avoidance in the threat condition, higher attachment anxiety was associated with greater perceptions of distance. For people low in attachment avoidance in both conditions, attachment anxiety did not predict distance perception. This pattern is partially consistent with, but also more complicated than, my original predictions. Explanations for the findings are discussed as well as future directions for investigation. Additionally, the important implications of this research for real-life interactions and, ultimately, the development and maintenance of attachment orientation are explored.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: In 2007 Ontario implemented a grade 8 quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination program targeting the virus that causes cervical cancer. Despite being 6 years post-implementation, few post-licensure studies have assessed the safety of the qHPV vaccine in this adolescent population. Since autoimmune disorders are often targeted for post-marketing surveillance by regulatory agencies, it is important to assess the risk of developing an autoimmune disorder post-qHPV vaccination. &#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: The objectives of this thesis were to assess the risk for developing an autoimmune disorder following qHPV vaccination, assess for effect modification by the presence of predisposing risk factors, identify the period of highest risk and explore the risk for individual autoimmune disorders. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: A population-based retrospective cohort of girls eligible for Ontario’s qHPV vaccination program was identified using population-based databases. The risk of autoimmune disorders following qHPV vaccination was ascertained using the self-controlled case series method.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The risk of developing a new autoimmune disorder, adjusted for age, seasonality, concurrent vaccines and infections was 1.28 (95% CI: 0.87 – 1.89), and this association was independent of a history of immune-mediated disorders (p=0.39). The risk was not increased during days 7-24 post-vaccination (adjusted RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.43 – 1.74), but appeared to increase thereafter (adjusted RR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.77 – 2.41 and RR = 1.62, 95% CI 0.94 – 2.78 respectively, for days 25 – 42 and days 43 – 60), although these differences were non-significant. The risk may be increased for certain disorders including Bell’s palsy (RR = 2.30, 95% CI: 0.67 – 7.95), systemic autoimmune rheumatic disorders (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 0.42 – 8.02), Hashimoto’s disease (RR = 1.39, 95% CI: 0.46 – 4.22), and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.83 – 2.08), although none of these associations were statistically significant. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: This thesis demonstrated that no statistically significant increased risk for autoimmune disorders following qHPV vaccination was detected. However, there remains some uncertainty about the safety of the qHPV vaccine for a subset of the autoimmune disorders. The results from this analysis need to be pooled with those of other studies to confirm whether these are true safety signals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation studies the concept of “love” in Algernon Charles Swinburne’s "Poems and Ballads" [1866]. As I argue in Chapter One, there has been surprisingly little critical discussion of the concept of love in "Poems and Ballads," and what there has been is flawed in that it inadvertently reinforces the longstanding charge of Swinburne’s “meaninglessness,” obscures the ways in which the love of "Poems and Ballads" is an informed critical response to the culture of the time, and tends to render the poems and their dramatic speakers interchangeable. In Chapter Two, I attempt to redress the ahistoricism that has dominated these discussions by explaining how the love of "Poems and Ballads" arose in response to the “cult of love” of Swinburne’s contemporaries, which he, informed by ideas that he inherited from his Romantic forbearers, viewed as an impoverishment of sensual experience, and consequently of humankind’s creative capacities—as dramatized through his speakers’ “refusals” of love and its imaginative possibilities. In Chapter Three, I explore two such “refusals,” expressed through the voices of the very different speakers of the “Hymn to Proserpine” and “The Triumph of Time.” After clarifying some sources of confusion, I trace how both of these characters, by means of different philosophical and psychological pathways, come to turn away from love and (in doing so) their own poetic potential. In Chapter Four, I turn to “Dolores,” in which the speaker’s rejection of love drives him to the “perverse spiritualism” that Swinburne identifies with the Marquis de Sade. Although the speaker succumbs to creative impotence, I argue that he is capable of recognizing his own inadequacies, and to welcome a poet who can “kiss” and “sing” like Catullus once did (340-42). Finally, in Chapter Five, I argue that, in the Sappho of “Anactoria,” Swinburne provides a dramatic model of (the development of) the kind of poet who could “see love,” in all of its volatility and violence, and still “choose him.” In concluding the chapter, I also claim that Swinburne suggests, in Sappho’s relation to her future readers, how such a poet might inspire others to “choose” love.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study was to explore the case, organizational, decision maker, and external factors that influence teaching professionals when deciding to report children suspected to be in need of protection. Teachers report 24%, or 175,920 cases to Children’s Aid Societies annually in Canada; researchers who have examined teacher reporting practices, speculate that teachers fail to report between 50 to 84%, or 87,960–147,773 cases of suspected cases to authorities.The conceptual framework for the study came from Baumann, Dalgleish, Fluke, and Kern’s (2011) decision-making ecology framework which claims that individuals consider case, organizational, external, and decision-maker factors when making a decision.  Phase one included an analysis of 64 policies on reporting children suspected to be in need of protection from English speaking, public and Catholic school districts and geographically isolated school authorities.  Crosson-Tower’s (2013) policy analysis framework was used to analyze education factors, the legal system, document properties, procedures, support systems, training opportunities, and community relationships.  Phase two consisted of one hour, semi-structured interviews (n = 7) with individuals who are mandated to report, and who had made at least one report.  Interview questions were based on the conceptual framework and from the findings from phase one. Results revealed that many school districts omitted information that could have been beneficial to teachers who were required to report. Throughout the province it also appeared that training opportunities were minimal. This study did not explore whether training actually took place in school districts.  Interview data, although not generalizable due to the sample size, appeared to suggest a lack of communication between school districts and parents, and teachers and Children’s Aid Societies (CAS).  &#xD;
Conclusion: More research is needed to see how much of the supports listed in school district policies, such as training opportunities and support systems, are actually implemented and the subsequent effect of these actions on teacher’s reporting practices.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The present study investigated the key determinants of Chinese students’ academic success in terms of GPA and the number of credit hours earned. The determinants investigated included gender, age, prior academic performance, academic self-efficacy, the TOPIK score, self-perceived Korean and English proficiency, and the previous length of Korean and English study. This study specifically focused on three research questions concerning the prediction of Chinese students’ academic success in Korean universities, the additional contribution of Korean and English language proficiency, and the examination of prediction patterns for undergraduate and graduate students.&#xD;
   A questionnaire was issued and collected from 138 undergraduate and 63 graduate Chinese students studying in 27 different Korean universities. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: demographic information, academic background, language proficiency and psychological factors. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were conducted to address the proposed research questions.&#xD;
   The findings demonstrated that traditional factors, including gender and prior academic performance, were effective predictors of academic success. However, academic self-efficacy did not play an influential role in participants’ academic success. Language proficiency had a moderate effect on Chinese students’ academic success, which is consistent with previous studies that reported a positive statistically significant relationship between language proficiency and academic success. In this study’s context, Korean proficiency contributed to undergraduate GPA and graduate credit hours whereas both Korean and English proficiency contributed to graduate GPA. The different natures of undergraduate and graduate studies determined that the predictors of undergraduate and graduate students’ academic success were different.&#xD;
   The determinants of international students’ academic success are complex and not yet completely understood, and language proficiency is only one of the factors contributing to international students’ academic success. The present study addressed the research gap by integrating theoretical constructs from both psychology and language education, and also by exploring the relationships between language proficiency and academic success in a less researched test, TOPIK, and in two second languages, Korean and English, at the same time. The findings contribute to the overall understanding of international students’ academic success, in particular the success of Chinese students studying in Korean universities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vocabulary development is of the utmost importance for pre-school aged children as vocabulary has long-term effects (Cunningham &amp; Stanovich, 1997). Research however has displayed that children often do not enter Kindergarten with a sufficient vocabulary and therefore encounter the Matthew Effect, which is the idea that “the rich get richer, while the poor become poorer,” in the effect that good readers continue to read well, while poor readers continue to deteriorate in their skills (Stanovich, 1986). &#xD;
Current research suggests that properly designed curriculums and family literacy programs can have a positive effect on children’s vocabulary development (Christ &amp; Wang, 2010; McKeown &amp; Beck, 2011). Read-alouds coupled with explicit instruction, specifically targeted vocabulary words, conversation with children, and authoritative instruction tend to promote emergent literacy (Neuman, Newman, &amp; Dwyer, 2011; Nitecki &amp; Chung, 2013; Shedd &amp; Duke, 2008). With family literacy having such an impact on children’s emergent literacy and vocabulary, it is important to put into place programs and resources for parents and children to reap these benefits. A pre-school setting is an ideal place where children can come and benefit from family literacy programs through interactions with early childhood educators. Therefore, providing a guide for educating adults, coupled with lessons on how they can work with their children, is what is provided in this project. The lessons included with the workshop are modelled after McKeown and Beck’s (2011) tier approach and weekly plans,  as well as adapted from Giorgis and Glazer’s (2013) teaching tools and book lists.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A novel approach is proposed for real-time retrieval of images from a large database of overlapping images of an indoor environment. The procedure extracts visual features from images using selected computer vision techniques, and processes the extracted features to create a reduced list of features annotated with the frame numbers they appear in. This method is named landmark indexing. Unlike some state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method does not need to consider large image adjacency graphs because the overlap of the images in the map sufficiently increases information gain, and mapping of similar features to the same landmark reduces the search space to improve search efficiency. Empirical evidence from experiments on real datasets shows high (90-100%) accuracy in image retrieval, and improvement in search time from the order of 100-200 milliseconds to the order of 10-30 milliseconds. The image retrieval technique is also demonstrated by integrating it into a 3D real-time navigation system. This system is tested in several indoor environments and all experiments show accurate localization results in large indoor areas with errors in the order of 15-20 centimeters only.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) represent a new generation of engineered systems that tightly integrates computations, communications (cyber) and physics. Simulation plays a considerable role in validating CPSs as it substantially reduces the costs and risks in the design-testing cycles. Reliable simulations, however, mandate realistic modeling for both the cyber and the physical aspects. This is especially the case in various networked mobile CPSs (e.g., excavation robots and vehicular networks), where cost and risk may become substantial. Current CPS modeling tools lack complete models of communication. Co-simulation attempts to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple modeling and simulation tools to offer complete models of all aspects of CPSs. In this thesis, we design and implement a co-simulation environment for modeling and simulating networked CPSs. The environment is called AcumenNS3 and it integrates Acumen, a language for modeling hybrid physical systems, with NS-3, a discrete-event network simulator. This environment allows users to augment network simulations with physical models using an easy-to-use modeling language. It provides a seamless integration between network and physics models by providing mobility based on the physical simulation in addition to generic access to the physical state. Using the AcumenNS3 environment, we demonstrate and model example simulation scenarios of networked CPSs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vulvodynia, a common form of chronic vulvovaginal pain, is conceptualized as a multifactorial chronic pain condition. Research has examined the role of numerous physiological, psychological, and social factors in the development and maintenance of vulvodynia, however, health care experiences have not been closely examined in this clinical population. Three online studies were conducted to investigate the health care experiences of women with chronic vulvovaginal pain. Study 1 examined pelvic examination (PE) experiences in women with and without chronic pain during intercourse. During their last PE, women with pelvic and vulvovaginal pain reported significantly more pain and anxiety compared to women without pain during intercourse. Various predisposing (first PE experience), examination (quality of patient- physician interaction, physician gender), and psychological factors (vaginal penetration cognitions, body image) predicted PE ratings in women with and without pain during intercourse. Study 2 more broadly examined pain and adjustment in women with vulvovaginal pain. Pain-related beliefs (i.e., attributional style, perceived control) were related to health care variables and predicted adjustment. First, global attributions predicted depressive symptoms and pain-related cognitions/responses after controlling for pain severity and interference. Second, chance beliefs moderated the relationship between pain-related cognitions/responses and internal attributions. Third, women with higher chance and lower physician pain beliefs reported lower social support. Study 3 investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and comfort of Canadian medical residents in Family Medicine and Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) about vulvodynia. OBGYN residents later in their training reported greater knowledge and comfort with vulvodynia and its symptoms than their more junior counterparts; ratings did not significantly differ between specialties. Residents did report significantly more positive attitudes toward patients with&#xD;
ii&#xD;
vulvovaginal pain of identifiable pathology in comparison to patients with no physical findings. Comfort discussing sexuality in medical practice was a significant predictor of knowledge, attitudes, and comfort with vulvodynia after controlling for demographics/training variables. These findings offer a multidimensional perspective on the role of health care in biopsychosocial models of vulvovaginal pain, and have implications for the assessment and treatment of vulvodynia and Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Maternal ethanol consumption during pregnancy can produce teratogenic outcomes in offspring, which are collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction is a debilitating and permanent manifestation of FASD.  Recent studies indicate that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure (CPEE), via maternal ethanol administration, also impairs metabolic function in offspring. The mechanism of ethanol teratogenicity is multi-faceted and could involve alterations in insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways. These pathways are not only important for metabolism, but are also involved in CNS neuronal survival and plasticity, which are impaired by CPEE. The overall goal of this thesis research was to study, in the guinea pig, neurobehavioural and metabolic effects of CPEE and to investigate whether these effects were associated with altered CNS and peripheral insulin/IGF signaling pathways. In postnatal offspring, CPEE decreased brain weight and altered performance of the modified Biel-maze task, which was a sensitive measure of apparent cognitive dysfunction and executive function deficits. Furthermore, CPEE produced various manifestations of metabolic teratogenicity in offspring, including decreased birth weight, postnatal catch-up body growth, increased whole-body adiposity, disrupted pancreatic morphology, dysregulation of blood glucose concentration and increased liver weight in adulthood. The CPEE-induced neurobehavioural and metabolic effects were associated with alterations of the insulin/IGF signaling pathways in the CNS and periphery. In the liver, CPEE decreased mRNA expression of IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor, and IGF-2 in male and female offspring, and increased mRNA expression of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 in male offspring only compared with nutritional control. Female CPEE offspring had decreased hepatic mRNA expression of insulin receptor compared with male CPEE offspring. In the prefrontal cortex, IRS-2 mRNA expression was increased in male and female CPEE offspring compared with nutritional control. The studies of this thesis have contributed to the understanding of the neurobehavioural and metabolic consequences of CPEE in offspring, which are associated with impairment of the insulin/IGF signaling pathways.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Meat consumption is associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC); exposure to heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), carcinogens produced when meat is cooked at high temperatures, is one hypothesized explanation for this relationship.  HAAs form adducts with DNA; left unrepaired, DNA adducts can induce mutations which may initiate and/or promote the development of colorectal adenomas, precursors to the vast majority of CRCs.  Along this continuum, genetic differences in the ability to biotransform or metabolize HAAs and repair DNA is postulated to modify the HAA-CRC relationship.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: This thesis examined the HAA-CRC relationship in two studies (Phase 1 and 2).  In a cross-sectional study of 99 healthy volunteers, Phase 1 investigated the relationship between dietary exposure to HAAs and the levels of bulky DNA adducts in blood leukocytes.  In Phase 2, a cross-sectional study examined the relationships between dietary exposures to: a) HAAs and; b) meat mutagenicity, and the prevalence of colorectal adenomas among 342 patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy.  Both Phase 1 and 2 examined potential gene-diet interactions between dietary HAAs and genetic factors relevant to the biotransformation of HAAs and DNA repair.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: In Phase 1, an interaction was observed for dietary HAAs and NAT1 polymorphisms where a positive association between HAA intakes and bulky DNA adduct levels was found among those with the NAT1 slow acetylator genotype, hypothesized to confer a lower ability to biotransform HAAs.  In Phase 2, polymorphisms in genes involved in the biotransformation of HAAs (CYP1B1 rs10012 and rs1056827) and DNA repair (XPC rs2228001) were found to determine colorectal adenoma risk.  As well, gene-diet interactions were observed for dietary HAAs/meat mutagenicity exposures and polymorphisms in CYP1B1 and XPD (rs13181 and rs1799793).  Overall, a higher risk of colorectal adenoma was observed with higher HAA and/or meat mutagenicity exposures among those with polymorphisms which confer a greater activity to biotransform HAAs and/or a lower ability to repair DNA.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: This research supports the contribution of dietary HAAs and genetic susceptibility to the risk of developing colorectal adenomas and highlighted bulky DNA adduct formation as a potential biologic pathway through which HAAs may influence cancer risk.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The quality of machinery liquids plays a critical role in ensuring safe and cost-effective operation of engines. Especially in the aviation industry, there is a great need for real-time and online monitoring of the purity, lubricity and age of machinery fluids. &#xD;
In this work, two optical techniques, excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) and cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), are used for monitoring of degradation and contamination of aero-turbine lubricants and jet fuels using optical fiber probes. &#xD;
We implement EEMS combined with a modified fiber probe design to characterize lubricant quality through the characteristic fluorescence of antioxidant additives. Multi-way analysis procedures, such as parallel factor analysis, are applied to correlate spectral features to antioxidant concentration, oxidative stability, and lubricant age. The spectroscopic data are then correlated to commonly used, off-line parameters such as the induction time and the breakdown number. &#xD;
It is shown that the decrease in fluorescence intensities of antioxidants coincides with the decomposition of the oil base stock. The induction times of synthetic jet turbine oil degraded at 150ºC, 195ºC and 215ºC are found to be at about 10,000, 3,500 and 400 min respectively. Simple kinetic models are developed that are capable of describing antioxidant reactions as pseudo first-order processes. &#xD;
We also demonstrate that with fluorescence detection it is possible to determine the concentration of oil contamination in jet fuel from about 10 to 1000 ppmv. &#xD;
In addition, a fiber-loop cavity ring-down spectrometer has been developed to quantitatively identify oil contamination of jet fuel by measuring optical absorption in the UV region. CRDS is a very sensitive, path-enhanced absorption technique that may be used for trace-species measurements in gas and liquids. The absorption measurements on samples with small volumes are characterized by measuring the concentration of turbine oil in jet fuel from 100 000 ppmv to a limit of detection of 400 ppmv. &#xD;
In summary, the obtained results permit us to specify the life time of lubrication oil and to determine the contamination of jet fuel with turbine oil qualitatively and quantitatively. In a simple optical configuration the fiber-coupled EEM and CRD methods permit in situ sampling of the machinery fluids.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Audio editing environments, geared towards touch screens and mobile computing form factors, are prevalent, predominant and continue to gain in popularity. However, touch-based gestures on mobile devices are typically singlehanded tasks and limited to 2D interaction space, which is less intuitive and efficient for music manipulation. Also, with the constraint of limited screen assets, a user has to frequently switch between different audio sample contexts while editing.&#xD;
We present PaperMusic, a novel audio manipulation interface, for enabling simple and intuitive audio manipulation for novice musicians. PaperMusic uses multiple flexible displays, 3D tracking system, bend sensors, and a set of tangible audio interaction techniques, which take advantage of Organic User Interface and bimanual interactions, to enable users to tangibly and collaboratively create and edit audio.&#xD;
PaperMusic draws from both the traditional music editing environment and novel audio interfaces. During making our first prototype, we consider the following design goals: (1) Low learning Curve; (2) Consistent Metaphor; (3) Lightweight &amp; portability; (4) Spatial awareness; (5) Multimodal with richer forms of tactile and visual feedback; (6) Bimanual tasking and multi- display interaction; (7) Collaborative music editing. Based on this, we have designed and explored five interaction techniques: (1) Layering; (2) Collocation; (3) Pointing; (4) 3D spatial awareness; (5) Bending &amp; discrete touching.&#xD;
We performed a qualitative user experiment to obtain feedback from participants who were amateur musicians. Our user study indicates that, compared with traditional music editing software, our tangible prototype had a lower mental demand and facilitates bimanual asymmetric tasks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Suicide takes the lives of over 3,500 Canadians each year, making prevention an important public health concern. Identifying psychological predictors of suicide risk is essential because these variables may be amenable to change in treatment, unlike demographic or historical factors. Although past research reveals that both hopelessness and depression are moderately strong predictors of suicidal outcomes, neither one of these constructs alone, or combined, is able to fully account for suicidality. Shneidman postulated that a different psychological construct, termed psychache, is a unique predictor of suicide when controlling for depression and hopelessness, and research has supported this assertion. Although evidence for psychache as a predictor of suicidal outcomes is accumulating, previous research has limitations, namely the use of cross-sectional research and a focus on healthy student populations. In addition, it has been suggested that because scales measuring depression, hopelessness, and psychache correlate highly, they are not distinct constructs, but instead represent a single syndrome. &#xD;
The general purpose of the current studies is to establish the importance of psychache as a predictor of suicidal ideation. In order to address past limitations in the literature on psychache, three related studies were conducted. The first study was cross-sectional and examined a general group of undergraduate students. Factor analysis showed that psychache, depression, and hopelessness are three correlated, but distinct, variables. The second study was a longitudinal study where self-report measures were administered to high-risk undergraduate students. A two-year follow-up revealed that psychache was the only significant predictor of suicidal ideation at follow-up, and that its inclusion rendered the predictive value of depression and hopelessness to nonsignificant levels. The final study involved two groups of undergraduates and was a longitudinal study with a five-month follow-up. One group was a general university sample, and the other was a group of high-risk students. The two groups were analyzed separately, but showed almost identical results, lending support to the generalization of results from university samples to clinical samples. In addition, for each group, psychache was a unique predictor of suicidal ideation and suicide preparation, after controlling for depression and hopelessness. Overall, these studies suggest that psychache is distinct from depression and hopelessness, and is a better predictor of suicidality than depression or hopelessness when studied longitudinally in both general and high-risk undergraduate students. The findings also indicate congruence between low and high-risk samples, highlighting the generalizability of psychache as a predictor. This research has implications for the assessment of suicide risk and treatment for individuals experiencing suicidal ideation. It is hoped that these studies will help bring psychache forward as a pre-eminent risk factor alongside depression and hopelessness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, I examine the use of Twitter by NHL athletes to determine how and in what ways professional hockey players’ personal and professional identities are shaped by their use of this medium. I explore the current cultural moment surrounding the lives of NHL athletes, focusing on the increasingly blurred line between their private and professional identities. By grounding my analysis of their Twitter use in a new labour context that is academically situated betwixt the literatures on media studies, celebrity culture and identity presentation, I show that participation in this medium allows both athletes and fans to actively reshape their own and each others’ identities, constructing a new set of standards for professional hockey players that takes into consideration the heightened demand for access to the behind-the-scenes of their lives. The ability of professional hockey players to interact with fans and media on Twitter is also creating new types relationships and producing new discourses for the typical hockey player identity, and the labour this career involves. Finally, through interviews with NHL players, I draw out their motives for using Twitter, their understanding of the impact of their interaction with fans on the perceptions those fans have of their professional identity, and their desire for work-life balance as their professional and personal identities seemingly merge on Twitter in a postmodern labour context fuelled by heightened celebrity culture.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: To compare psychological work and life stress indicators among female hospital employees in both shift work (SW) and non-shift work (NSW) positions, and determine associations with demographic and vocational factors, and indicators of cardiovascular risk (CVR).  &#xD;
Methods: Female employees from one Southeastern Ontario acute care hospital (n=212) provided fasting blood samples, demographic and work related data, and completed a physical assessment and questionnaires.  Work stress was measured with the Job Content Questionnaire and Effort-Reward Balance Index (ERI).  Life stress was assessed with the Derogatis Stress Profile. Metabolic Syndrome (MS) was determined based on Interim Societies Joint Guidelines.  &#xD;
Results: SW in comparison to NSW employees reported higher mean scores in: global ERI (.70 (SD .4) vs. .58 (SD.29) p&lt;.05), psychological job demands (21.2 (SD 4.8) vs. 19.2 (5.7) p&lt;.01), physical job demands (13.8 (SD 2.6) vs. 10.2 (SD 3.8), skill discretion (36.5 (SD 4.4) vs. 34.7 (SD 5.4) p&lt;.01), lower decision authority (31.6 (SD 5.8) vs. 33.5 (SD 6.5) p&lt;.05), and lower total life stress scores (39.2 (SD 7.3) vs. 42.1 (SD 9.4) p&lt;.05). There were no significant differences between SW and NSW group for MS or CVR factors. MS was present among 17% of all employees, 18.5% of SW, and 15.5% of NSW. In logistic regression analysis MS occurrence was associated with chronic SW exposure of 6 or more years  (AOR 5.41 (95% CI, 1.84 – 15.87), decisional authority (AOR 1.09 (95% CI, 1.00 – 1.18), skill discretion (AOR 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01 – 1.26), and depression (AOR 1.26 (95% CI 1.08 – 1.46).  &#xD;
Conclusions:  Women working in SW positions experience more psychological and physical work stress, and effort-reward imbalance.  The interplay between effort and reward aspects of the work environment may significantly contribute to psychological work stress and persist with increasing age among female hospital employees regardless of SW status.  Among female hospital employees SW status and psychological stress measures do not appear to have an immediate effect upon CVR, as measured by the MS, but may contribute to its development with prolonged exposure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The main theme in this thesis is the ABC conjecture. We prove some partial results towards it and we find new applications of this conjecture, mainly in the context of B\"uchi's n squares problem (which has consequences in logic related to Hilbert's tenth problem) and squarefree values of polynomials. We also study related topics, such as arithmetic properties of additive subgroups of Hecke algebras, function field and meromorphic value distribution, and undecidability of the positive existential theories over languages of arithmetic interest.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this research project is to describe how existing communication technologies are used to foster scientific literacy for secondary students. This study develops a new framework as an analytic tool to categorize the activities of teachers and students involved in scientific literacy to describe what elements of scientific literacy are facilitated by such technologies. Four case studies are analyzed using the framework to describe the scientific literacy initiatives.&#xD;
Data collection at each site included interviews with the teacher, student focus groups, student surveys, and classroom observations. Qualitative analysis of the data provided insight into the learning activities and student experiences in the four cases.&#xD;
This study intentionally provides a platform for student voice. Very few previous empirical studies in the area of scientific literacy include the student experience. This represents a significant gap in the current literature on scientific literacy. An interpretation of scientific literacy that promotes student engagement, interaction, and initiative corresponds to a need to listen to students’ perspectives on these experiences. &#xD;
Findings of the study indicated that the classroom activities depended on the teacher’s philosophy regarding scientific literacy. Communication technology was ubiquitous; where the teacher did not initiate the use of social media in the classroom, the students did.  The goal of supporting scientific literacy in students is an objective that extends beyond the boundaries of classroom walls, and it can be facilitated by technologies that seem both abundant and underutilized. Technology-enhanced pedagogy altered the classroom practices and resulted in more student participation and engagement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lakes near Sudbury, Ontario, experienced widespread acidification and metal-contamination beginning in the late-19th century. These stressors caused extreme damage to regional aquatic systems and their catchments, with aquatic biota experiencing reduced species richness and, in some cases, extirpations. Emission control measures markedly improved pH, however biotic recovery continues to lag water quality improvements, prompting investigation into mechanisms leading to this phenomenon. Due to the lack of long-term monitoring data, I use paleolimnological approaches to examine temporal trends in cladoceran zooplankton, from pre-impact conditions, through the period of acidification/metal contamination, and following the implementation of emission controls. I assess the degree of biotic recovery that has taken place in these lakes, and review the mechanisms that continue to structure cladoceran assemblages. Lakes closest to Sudbury recorded increases of ~15-65% relative abundance of Chydorus brevilabris, concurrent with the late-1800s industrial development. The relative abundance of C. brevilabris remains elevated above pre-impact levels in two Sudbury lakes; however, in Middle Lake, which was neutralized with calcium carbonate, declines in C. brevilabris (to ~pre-impact levels) occurred following neutralization. Conversely, lakes located ~60 km southwest of Sudbury, in Killarney Provincial Park, experienced muted assemblage change, with minor (&lt; ~5%) increases in grazers (e.g., Daphnia spp., Holopedium glacialis) occurring within the past ~40 years. Lakes in Sudbury and Killarney acidified to pH &lt; ~5, however those in Sudbury additionally received high inputs of nickel and copper, which have toxic effects on aquatic organisms, including some Cladocera. Contamination with these metals may have been a primary driver of cladoceran assemblage change. Elevated metal concentrations likely continue to structure the cladoceran assemblages in the Sudbury lakes. In addition, many of the lakes contain altered food webs (e.g., large populations of yellow perch) as a legacy of the acid and metal contamination, acting as a potential barrier to recovery. Finally, warming air temperatures over the past ~40 years, which I link to increases in primary production, may alter the composition of cladoceran species found in these lakes, and therefore prevent a return to pre-impact conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Us3, a serine/threonine kinase encoded by all alphaherpesviruses, plays diverse roles&#xD;
during virus infection. Recently, work done in our laboratory determined that Us3 orthologues from herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are capable of disrupting promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein nuclear bodies (-NBs). PML-NBs are discrete, dynamic nuclear bodies named for PML, their essential structural component and one that plays a key role in diverse cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and cellular antiviral defense. In infected cells, PML-NBs exert transcriptional silencing on the viral genome to prevent viral gene expression and virus replication.&#xD;
Based on this finding, my studies were aimed to understand the mechanism and physiological function of Us3-mediated PML-NB disruption. The degradation of one or more cellular proteins seems necessary for this Us3 activity, as the proteasome inhibitor, MG132,&#xD;
dramatically reduced Us3-mediated PML-NB disruption. The target of this proteasome activity is not likely PML protein, as Us3 expression did not lead to detectable PML protein degradation. Nonetheless, the involvement of proteasome activity suggests that Us3 may utilize the host ubiquitylation pathway to disrupt PML-NBs. Supporting this hypothesis, PRV and HSV-2 Us3 orthologues were shown to interact with KLHL21, a substrate adaptor protein for cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase. PRV and HSV-2 Us3 were re-localized to PML-NBs when co-expressed with KLHL21, and knock-down of KLHL21 prevented Us3-mediated PML-NB disruption. Taken together, these findings suggest that Us3-KLHL21 complex recruits the cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase to PML-NBs, where subsequent ubiquitylation of unknown target(s) leads to PML-NB disassembly.&#xD;
Since it is well established that PML is an important antiviral effector induced by&#xD;
interferon (IFN), Us3 may contribute to viral resistance to IFN by disrupting PML-NBs.&#xD;
Favoring this hypothesis, virus yield and viral gene transcription were dramatically reduced in IFN-exposed cells in the absence of Us3. These reductions were associated with an increased number of PML-NBs in the absence of Us3, and were partially recovered in cells knocked down for PML. Therefore, by disrupting PML-NBs, Us3 may alleviate IFN-induced, host-mediated transcriptional silencing of the viral genome, allowing efficient viral gene transcription and replication in cells exposed to IFN.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Phosphonium indenylides (PHIN) are a promising, yet relatively unexplored class of transition metal ligands. The ylidic resonance structure b of this compound is isoelectronic with the cyclopentadienyl ligand which is ubiquitous throughout organometallic chemistry. Phosphonium indenylides have been found to have electron donating properties between those of η6-benzene and η5-cyclopentadienyl ligands and are tuneable based on the nature of the phosphine used. In addition, upon coordination, phosphonium indenylides exhibit planar chirality. These properties may potentially lead to interesting coordination chemistry and applications in catalysis.The phosphonium indenylides 1-C9H6PPh3 (I), 1-C9H6PMePh2 (II) and1-C9H6PMe2Ph (III) have been synthesized and reacted with [CpRu(MeCN)3]PF6 to form complexes of the type [CpRu(I-III)]PF6 (V-VII) which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI MS and X-ray crystallography. In an attempt to synthesize Ru-PHIN complexes with labile ligands attached to the metal centre, an arene exchange reaction between a PHIN ligand and RuCl2(η6-ethylbenzoate)(PPh3) was employed to produce RuCl2(II)(PPh3) which was characterized by extensive NMR spectroscopy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The SNO+ experiment is a multi-purpose neutrino detector which is under construction in the SNOLAB facility in Sudbury, Ontario. SNO+ will search for neutrinoless double beta decay, and will measure low energy solar neutrinos. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis will describe three main development activities for the SNO+ experiment: the measurement of the timing parameters for the liquid scintillator cocktail, using those timing parameters to estimate the ability of SNO+ to discriminate&#xD;
alpha and beta events in the detector, and a sensitivity study that examines how solar neutrino data can constrain a light sterile neutrino model. &#xD;
&#xD;
Characterizing the timing parameters of the emission light due to charged-particle excitation in the scintillator is necessary for proper reconstruction of events in the detector. Using data obtained from a bench-top setup, the timing profile was modelled as three exponential components with distinct timing coefficients. Also investigated was the feasibility of using the timing profiles as a means to separate alpha and beta excitation events in the scintillator. The bench-top study suggested that using the peak-to-total method of analyzing the timing profiles could remove &gt;$99.9% of alpha events while retaining &gt;$99.9% of beta events. The timing parameters measured in the test set-up were then implemented in a Monte Carlo code which simulated the SNO+ detector conditions. The&#xD;
simulation results suggested that detector effects reduce the effectiveness of discriminating between alpha and beta events using the peak-to-total method. Using a more optimal method of analyzing the timing profile differences, specifically using a Gatti filter, improved the discrimination capability back to the levels determined&#xD;
in the bench-top setup. &#xD;
&#xD;
One of the physics goals of SNO+ is the first precision measurement of the pep solar neutrino flux at the level of about 5% uncertainty. A study was performed to investigate how current solar neutrino data constrains the allowed parameters of a light 3+1 sterile neutrino model. The impact of adding a SNO+ pep solar neutrino measurement on the allowed parameters of the sterile model was then examined.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Self-regulated learning (SRL) is associated with academic and clinical achievement. Using Zimmerman’s (2002) framework, SRL includes a cycle of forethought, performance, and reflection. To support SRL, a web-based portfolio (e-Portfolio), in the context of the intrinsic CanMEDS Roles, was introduced for undergraduate medical students at a Canadian Medical School.&#xD;
This exploratory, qualitative study was designed to capture students’ descriptions of their behaviours using the e-Portfolio, to examine the extent to which these were consistent with SRL processes, and to analyze the gaps between intended and actual use.&#xD;
Data were collected using both semi-structured interviews and a 20-item, 5-point Likert-type instrument to prompt discussion. Second-year medical student volunteers were recruited for data collection until saturation of information was reached (n=14). Thematic and content analysis were used; data were interpreted using constructivist grounded theory (Creswell, 2007). Use of one interviewer, a standardized protocol, and member checking assured consistency and trustworthiness of the data.&#xD;
Students explicitly described the value of the e-Portfolio as an organizational tool, and as a form of assessment. Participants identified some elements of forethought and reflection but seldom described plans to achieve and measure outcomes. During the process of uploading materials to their e-Portfolio many of the students were able to make connections between the intrinsic CanMEDS Roles they are to assume as practicing physicians and the behaviours that operationalize these roles. Students viewed the e-Portfolio as a working folder compared to the faculty goal of a cumulative portfolio. Students endorsed self-selection of artifacts and faculty mentorship to improve relevance and future motivation for learning. Limitations included privacy concerns.  &#xD;
Participants described a goal-oriented, in contrast to a process- or learning-oriented, approach to keeping their portfolios. The gap between students’ descriptions of portfolio use and SRL were most significant for the performance phase. The dual use of a portfolio for learning and assessment resulted in some compromises to the students’ use of the portfolio for learning.  Strategies to improve SRL could include specific instruction on the nature and value of SRL, faculty mentorship during the learning process, and assessment of students’ learning processes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purpose: The aim of this study is to model the impact of needle exchange interventions on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).&#xD;
Methods: In order to model the impact of needle exchange interventions, behavioural effects (sexual and drug use) were translated into estimates of the number of HIV and HCV cases averted by the programs through a mathematical model.  Behavioural effects data on 63 clients had been collected previously by two Health Units in Ontario. The secondary data were analyzed to estimate the number of HIV and HCV cases averted while accounting for co-infection. A Bernoulli process model was used to estimate the number of averted cases for the condom distribution and counselling aspects of the needle exchange intervention. A modification of the Bernoulli process model was used for needle exchange interventions to account for drug use behaviours. Furthermore, this model estimated the number of cases averted while also accounting for the clients’ partner’s co-infection status. Once the number of HIV and HCV cases averted was determined, a cost analysis was conducted to estimate the net medical savings of the interventions. Costs were converted to 2011 Canadian dollars.&#xD;
Results: Of the 63 clients, 21.40 HIV and 5.18 HCV cases were directly averted by the needle exchange intervention when HIV/HCV co-infection status of the partner was not taken into account. When the clients’ partners’ co-infection status was taken into account, lesser numbers were directly averted by the needle exchange intervention. The discounted medical savings averted were $6,950,028 and $6,741,331 when co-infection was and was not accounted for, respectively, for the 63 individuals. &#xD;
Conclusion: The study demonstrated a different modeling method to account for HIV and HCV cases averted in the context of needle exchange. This study provides a foundation for future large scale cost-effectiveness studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prostate cancer is a clinically heterogeneous disease, with manifestations ranging from a rapid and often fatal progression, to indolent disease. Unfortunately, current clinicopathological criteria cannot differentiate men whose tumours require immediate and aggressive therapy from those in which active surveillance may be more appropriate.&#xD;
Both PTEN deletion and ETS gene fusions are biomarkers with potential to aid in prostate cancer clinical management. In this thesis, I postulate that PTEN and fusion gene rearrangements may be associated with specific genomic changes, and might also have general impact on the genomic landscape of prostate cancer. &#xD;
A meta-analysis of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) examined 662 unique prostate cancer patient samples consisting of 546 primary and 116 advanced tumours derived from eleven publications. Normalization, segmentation and identification of corresponding CNAs for meta-analysis were achieved using established commercial software. The CNA distribution in primary disease was characterized by losses at 2q, 3p, 5q, 6q, 8p, 12p, 13q, 16q, 17p, 18q and 10q (PTEN), and acquisition of 21q deletions associated with the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion rearrangement. Unsupervised analysis identified five genomic subgroups. Parallel analysis of advanced and primary tumours indicated that PTEN genomic deletions and the gene fusion were enriched in advanced disease. A supervised analysis of PTEN deletions and gene fusions demonstrated that PTEN deletion was sufficient to impose higher levels of CNA. Moreover, the overall percentage of the genome altered was significantly higher when PTEN was deleted, suggesting that this important genomic subgroup was likely characterized by intrinsic chromosomal instability. Candidate genes in each of the recurrent CNA regions characteristic of each subgroup showed that signalling networks associated with cancer progression and genome stability were likely to be perturbed at the highest level in the PTEN deleted genomic subgroup.&#xD;
Therefore classification of primary prostate cancer according to PTEN deletions, but not the gene fusion, was associated with greatly increased levels of CNA.  Collectively, the impact of PTEN loss resulted in a significantly greater frequency and extent of alteration, and heightened genomic instability with concomitant pathway disruptions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Everyday movements, such as reaching for a drink of water or typing on a keyboard highlight the relative ease with which we move and interact with our surroundings. However, the success of these skilled movements depends on the motor system’s ability to consider a variety of factors, such as the goal of the behavioral task, the surrounding environment and the physical properties of the musculoskeletal system. Recent theories of voluntary motor control, namely optimal feedback control, suggest that such skilled motor behavior is achieved through sophisticated feedback control. This thesis investigates one physiological implication of this theory. Specifically, we hypothesize that rapid feedback responses following mechanical perturbations possess many of the functional attributes thought to be reserved for voluntary control because these two systems have contributions from similar neural substrates (eg. motor areas in cortex).&#xD;
Our studies were specifically designed to investigate rapid feedback responses during the long-latency epoch, which occurs between 50-100ms following a mechanical perturbation. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the sophistication of the long-latency response rivals that of voluntary control. In our first study (Chapter 2) we examined if rapid feedback responses were sensitive to features of the end target. We found that muscle activity during the long-latency epoch was modulated by the size/shape of the end. In our second study (Chapter 3) we observed flexible responses in muscle activity during the long-latency epoch that reflected rapid ‘decisions’ during online control regarding how to navigate around obstacles in the environment as well as how to select amongst multiple potential goals. In our final study (Chapter 4) we examined if rapid feedback responses in the shortened muscle parallel the sophisticated responses observed in the lengthened muscle. We found that unloading a pre-excited muscle elicited sophisticated inhibitory responses, including knowledge of limb mechanics and rapid target selection, during the long-latency epoch that are comparable to the excitatory responses observed during loading.&#xD;
Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis demonstrate that the responses in the&#xD;
long-latency epoch reflect several functional attributes typically reserved for voluntary control.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The catastrophic consequences associated with landslides necessitate predictions of these hazards to be made with as much certainty as possible.  However, the often complex nature of these events make predictions highly challenging.  In this thesis, a number of hypotheses related to the triggering mechanisms and subsequent consequences of landslides in a loose-granular soil were investigated.   The investigation was conducted using small-scale geotechnical centrifuge models, and a new flume facility developed to examine landslide behavior in a reduced-scale model.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first hypothesis explored in this research was that static liquefaction might preferentially occur in the saturated granular soil located at the base of the landslide rather than the well-drained inclined portion of the slope.  Using a geotechnical centrifuge model, it was found that a small initial toe failure did act as a monotonic loading trigger to shear the loose contractile saturated sand at the base of the slope and caused liquefaction to occur. &#xD;
&#xD;
The second hypothesis investigated whether the consequences of a landslide triggered under elevated groundwater antecedent conditions are higher than scenarios under drier antecedent conditions.  Results from five centrifuge models subjected to different antecedent groundwater conditions show that higher groundwater conditions can result in landslides with velocities about three times higher and travel distances eight times higher than low antecedent conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The third hypothesis investigated the influence of slope inclination on landslide consequences.  Seven geotechnical centrifuge models were built and tested, comparing the consequences of  landslides triggered in 20° and 30° sloped models with different groundwater conditions.  The results of these tests found that the influence of slope angle on the mobility consequences of a triggered landslide are highly dependent on the antecedent groundwater conditions.  The most significant case was under high groundwater conditions, where the shallower 20° slope travelled twice the distance and speed of the steeper 30° slope. &#xD;
&#xD;
A new flume facility was developed to examine landslide behaviour in a reduced-scale model, and a direct comparison was made to one of the centrifuge models from the research.  The comparison demonstrated the challenges associated with using reduced-scale models to study suction-dominated problems such as hydraulically-induced landslides in loose granular soils.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Knee replacement surgery is a common orthopaedic procedure that greatly benefits from a three-dimensional geometric representation of a patient's knee bone obtained from MR or CT data. The use of these image modalities pose the following challenges: (i) high imaging cost; (ii) long wait times; (iii) limited availability and (iv) in the latter, large exposure to ionizing radiation. Traditional approaches based on planar X-ray radiography are significantly less prone to these issues; however, they only provide two-dimensional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work presents a proof of concept study for generating patient-specific femoral bone shapes from a statistical shape atlas using anatomical features acquired from calibrated X-ray radiographs. Our hypothesis was: three-dimensional geometry can be reconstructed, within 2 millimeters RMS, by identifying features on two calibrated radiographs. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with regards to acquiring features and the viability of reconstructing patient-specific bony anatomy. A set of reliable and relevant features is identified for which an acquisition protocol and user-interface was devised to minimize inter-observer variability. Both the data and methods used to construct the atlas are discussed as well generating shapes from features. The reconstructions accuracy was comparable to, albeit lower than, competing approaches that rely on two-dimensional bony contours.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Element test results reported in the literature under both triaxial and plane strain conditions indicate that loose saturated granular specimens can experience softening instability at stress ratios lower than what might otherwise be expected given the critical state friction angle of the soil. The region of potential softening instability in stress-space is often explained using the framework of the instability line. This phenomenon is particularly relevant to shallow slopes of 1 to 2 m depth. However, the practical realities of sample preparation for triaxial testing make performing tests below 20 to 30 kPa of confining stress exceptionally difficult. &#xD;
In this thesis, the development of a centrifuge tilt-table test device is described which aims to test the behaviour of loose granular slopes under stress paths of increasing slope inclination or increasing pore water pressure. A system of instrumentation including pore pressure transducers, inclinometers, displacement transducers, and high-resolution cameras was designed to monitor the behaviour of the slope model. The development of a system to provide a controlled groundwater level within the slope model proved to be particularly challenging. The results of two competing design concepts are presented for the water boundary condition and discussed.&#xD;
The centrifuge tilt-table is used to compare the physical response of a slope to the behaviour predicted by the infinite slope and softening instability models using scale model centrifuge testing.  If softening instability is a rigorous concept, it should be the primary observed failure mechanism as it will occur at a stress state below the failure line.  Tests were performed on loose Ottawa F110 sand at 1g, 20g and 40g and 60g.  Deviatoric strain-softening was observed in loose dry sand.  The softening instability event resulted in a rapid increase in shear strain at constant shear stress while the soil was at a stress state below the failure envelope.  Any soil that can experience softening instability (i.e. granular, loose, saturated, and behaves undrained) will undergo two failures: one caused by deviatoric strain-softening (softening instability) and a second caused by shear failure at a larger slope angle.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The study of history has always been very significant to me. My early and most vivid exposure to the subject occured when I was in grade ten. At the time, I felt that a part of me was disconnected from the content we were taught. I was not able to identify myself with the history narrated in the textbooks. I began to examine history from a critical perspective, and thought about whose history was being taught. Textbooks play a powerful role in the way students understand history and in their cultural and political formation. This study is theoretically framed by critical race theory and post-colonial theory. I compared two ministry approved grade ten history textbooks published under two different governments to examine how the history of non-white minority groups has been represented and integrated into the narrative of the textbooks. I investigated the representation of Black Canadians, Chinese Canadians, Japanese Canadians, Vietnamese Canadians, and South Asian Canadians. Furthermore, I analyzed how the government's educational objectives and their differing agendas intersected with the content in the textbooks. Overall I found that the minority groups I studied were marginalized in the first textbook I looked at, however in the second textbook they were provided much wider representation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The development of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is enabled by the recent advances in wireless communication and sensing technologies. WSN have a wide range of scientific and commercial applications. In many applications the sensed data is useless if the location of the event is not associated with the data. Thus localization plays a substantial role in WSNs. Increased dependence on devices and sensed data presses for more efficient and accurate localization schemes. In many Internet of Things (IoT) deployments the area covered is large making it impossible to localize all devices and Sensor Networks (SNs) using single-hop localization techniques. A solution to this problem is to use a multi-hop localization technique to estimate devices' positions. In small areas SNs require at least three anchor nodes within their transmission range to estimate their location. &#xD;
Despite numerous existing localization techniques, the fundamental behavior of multi-hop localization is, as yet, not fully examined. Thus, we study the main characteristics of multi-hop localization and propose new solutions to enhance the performance of multi-hop localization techniques. We examine the assumptions in existing simulation models to build a more realistic simulation model, while studying and investigating the behavior of multi-hop localization techniques in large scale deployments before the actual deployment. We find that the introduced error follows the Gaussian distribution, but the estimated distance follows the Rayleigh distribution. We use the new simulation model to characterize the effect of hops on localization in both dense and sparse multi-hop deployments. We show that, contrary to common beliefs, in sparse deployments it is better to use long hops, while in dense deployments it is better to use short hops. Using short hops in dense deployments generates a large amount of traffic. Thus we propose a new solution which decreases and manages the overhead generated during the localization process. The proposed solution decreased the number of messages exchanged by almost 70% for DV-Distance and 55% for DV-Hop. Finally, we utilize mobile anchors instead of fixed anchors and propose a solution for the collinearity problem associated with the mobile anchor and use Kalman Filter (KF) to enhance the overall localization accuracy. Through simulation studies, we show that the scheme using a Kalman Filter decreases the estimation errors than using single direction by 31% and better than using weighted averages by 16% . As well, our new scheme overcomes the collinearity problem that appears from using mobile anchor nodes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An unprecedented era of “connected vehicles” is becoming an imminent reality. This&#xD;
is driven by advances in vehicular communications, and the development of in-vehicle&#xD;
telematics systems supporting a plethora of applications. The diversity and multitude&#xD;
of such developments will, however, introduce excessive congestion across wireless&#xD;
infrastructure, compelling operators to expand their networks. An alternative to&#xD;
network expansions is to develop more efficient content delivery paradigms. In particular,&#xD;
alleviating Radio Access Network (RAN) congestion is important to operators&#xD;
as it postpones costly investments in radio equipment installations and new spectrum.&#xD;
Efficient RAN frameworks are therefore paramount to expediting this realm&#xD;
of vehicular connectivity.&#xD;
Fortunately, the predictability of human mobility patterns, particularly that of vehicles&#xD;
traversing road networks, offers unique opportunities to pursue proactive RAN&#xD;
transmission schemes. Knowing the routes vehicles are going to traverse enables the&#xD;
network to forecast spatio-temporal demands and predict service outages that specific&#xD;
users may face. This can be accomplished by coupling the mobility trajectories with&#xD;
network coverage maps to provide estimates of the future rates users will encounter&#xD;
along a trip.&#xD;
In this thesis, we investigate how this valuable contextual information can enable RANs to improve both service quality and operational efficiency. We develop a collection&#xD;
of methods that leverage mobility predictions to jointly optimize 1) long-term&#xD;
wireless resource allocation, 2) adaptive video streaming delivery, and 3) energy efficiency in RANs. Extensive simulation results indicate that our approaches provide&#xD;
significant user experience gains in addition to large energy savings. We emphasize&#xD;
the applicability of such predictive RAN mechanisms to video streaming delivery, as&#xD;
it is the predominant source of traffic in mobile networks, with projections of further&#xD;
growth. Although we focus on exploiting mobility information at the radio access&#xD;
level, our framework is a direction towards pursuing a predictive end-to-end content&#xD;
delivery architecture.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Endometriosis, characterized by the growth of endometrium outside the uterine cavity, is a disease which causes pelvic pain, inflammation and associated with infertility. Endometrium, which exits the uterus through retrograde menstruation, must establish a new blood supply as it attaches and invades into ectopic tissues to form an endometriosis lesion. Angiogenesis is therefore essential in endometriosis disease progression. The inhibition of blood vessel growth by anti-angiogenic agents is a potential strategy to manage endometriosis disease progression. This thesis investigated angiogenesis of endometriosis lesions, and evaluated a novel anti-angiogenic peptide as a potential therapeutic to manage endometriosis. An atlas on the microscopic anatomy of the pregnant mouse uterus is also presented. Synuclein-γ (SNCG), a protein involved in cellular proliferation, was found to have elevated expression in endothelial cells of endometriosis tissue compared to eutopic endometrium. In an alymphoid xenograft mouse model of human endometriosis, where human endometrium is engrafted into the peritoneal cavity of Rag2-/-/IL2r-/- female mice, peptide inhibition of SNCG resulted in reduced vascularization of endometriotic lesions. This study indicates that SNCG has a potential role in angiogenesis of endometriosis lesions. Using the same alymphoid mouse model, we evaluated the effect of an anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 mimetic peptide, ABT-898, on angiogenesis of endometriotic lesions. ABT-898 inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation in vitro. Mice treated with ABT-898 showed reduced vascularity of endometriosis lesions compared with control. Angiogenesis is also an essential process in the female reproductive system. Females with endometriosis are of reproductive age, so it is essential to establish that anti-angiogenic therapies do not&#xD;
iii&#xD;
interfere with reproduction. We evaluated the effect of ABT-898 on angiogenesis in the female reproductive tract in non-pregnant mice. ABT-898 did not affect estrous cyclicity, or vascularity of the uterus or ovary in non-pregnant animals. ABT-898 did not alter litter size or pup weight when given to pregnant mice throughout gestation. In summary this thesis implicated a role for SNCG in angiogenesis of endometriosis lesions, and found that ABT-898 could be a useful therapeutic to manage endometriosis disease progression as it reduces angiogenesis of endometriotic lesions, while having no observable effect in reproductive organs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Beneficial management practices for controlling and managing pollutant loadings from entering source waters are essential to preserving the natural habitat of lakes and rivers. Artificial Floating Wetlands (AFWs) are a promising technology, when applied with other beneficial management practices, for the removal of water borne contaminants in urban and agricultural runoff. &#xD;
&#xD;
To evaluate AFWs for their application for nutrient-rich water remediation, a pilot scale study was assessed at the Centre for Alternative Wastewater Treatment in Lindsay Ontario. Fifteen ponds, averaging in size from 7.2 m width to 9.7 m length to 3.8 m depth were divided into two controls and three treatments, each with three replicates. The controls were not covered with AFWs and were used for comparative purposes while the treatments had AFW coverage averaging 67% of the total surface area of each pond. The treatments and controls received varying inputs of simulated stormwater runoff during the study. This study was used to determine the effects of high surface area coverage of AFWs on temperature, pH, DO and ammonia. &#xD;
&#xD;
A lab scale study was designed to investigate the results obtained from the pilot study and to assess the effectiveness of 100% AFW coverage for nutrient-rich water treatment. The study consisted of twelve 150 L containers, with four of the containers covered with the AFW, four without coverage and the final four with coverage without vegetation. Water quality parameters including phosphorus, nitrogen, E.coli, pH and temperature were tested on a weekly basis for two five week retention periods. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results from these studies suggest that AFWs can provide a valuable method of treatment when combined with other beneficial management practices. The pilot scale study demonstrated that AFWs inhibit algae growth and create a cooler environment below the wetland surface. Results from the second study indicate AFWs have a much better and quicker removal of phosphorus and ammonia when compared to the treatment with coverage without vegetation. E.coli levels were completely reduced within the water column for all treatments during the testing period.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Concrete-Insulation-Concrete Sandwich Panels with Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) shear connectors can be a solution to increasing energy efficiency in building envelopes, while also providing many architectural, structural, and economic benefits for building designs.  This study consists of extensive experimental investigation of the shear and thermal properties of a unique sandwich panel design, incorporating GFRP shear connectors and a concrete “stud” system.  The goal of this study is to expand upon the knowledge of alternative connectors’ effect on structural and thermal properties of sandwich panels, and to develop a thermally, structurally, and economically efficient panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the structural phase fifty 254x254x900 mm specimens representing segments of the precast sandwich wall, comprising two concrete wythes and a concrete stud surrounded by insulation foam, were tested in a double shear configuration.  Three types of GFRP connectors produced from available sand-coated and threaded rods were tested and compared to conventional steel and polymeric connectors.  GFRP connector diameters varied from 6 to 13 mm, and spacing varied from 80 to 300 mm.  Both circular and rectangular cross-sections were examined, along with various end treatments to compare with simple straight embedment.  The shear strength of GFRP connectors ranged from 60 to 112 MPa, significantly higher than polymeric connectors but lower than steel connectors.  As the connectors bridged a small gap of insulation between the concrete wythe and stud, their shear strength was lower than manufacturer reported values due to the presence of some bending.  Varying the size, spacing, cross-section shape or end treatment of connectors had insignificant effect on their strength.  The connectors failed by longitudinal delamination then transverse shear, but did not pull out of the concrete wythe.  Adhesion bond between concrete and insulation was significant and contributed about 28% of resistance, but was too variable for use in design.&#xD;
 &#xD;
In the thermal testing phase, ten 254x1550x2400 full-scale specimens were tested in a purpose-built hot box apparatus under steady-state conditions.  GFRP connectors showed minimal thermal bridging regardless of cross-section area or spacing, while steel connectors demonstrated significant thermal bridging in recorded temperatures despite a smaller cross-section area, and were clearly visible in thermal imaging.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Laser processing has the advantage of minimal sample contact and thus little tool wear over time compared to conventional machining. However, this leads to the difficulty of real-time depth monitoring and control. To help understand the process and achieve automation of laser micromachining, a coherent imaging technique adapted from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is applied “inline”with a machining laser to monitor the depth changing information. The axial resolution of the inline coherent imaging (ICI) system is 7–8  microns and the acquisition rate is up to 230 kHz. The capture time is as low as 1.5 microseconds.&#xD;
3D laser machining usually requires ultrafast lasers and homogeneous materials. With ICI, a feedback system is developed for 3D sculpture suitable even for heterogeneous materials without any sophisticated material characterization. 3D patterns with sizes up to 1 mm × 1 mm × 0.2 mm are sculpted in bone and wood with a ps UV laser. 3D patterns with sizes up to 6 mm × 6 mm × 2 mm are sculpted in bone with a CW IR laser.&#xD;
Many laser applications require high scan speed facilitated by scanning optics. The versatility of ICI is also demonstrated in a galvo-telecentric beam delivery system. ICI is used in a process of trench (as long as 10 mm) etching of steel to monitor the intrapulse and interpulse morphology changes as well as the sweep-to-sweep (up to 36 sweeps) depth changes. High scan speed (up to 375 mm/s) trench etching of silicon are also monitored and the parameter space is explored without destructive post-processing.&#xD;
Motion during imaging capture time (&gt;1.5 microseconds) may cause contrast degradation. To reduce the motion artifacts, preliminary experiments on stroboscopic ICI based on a kHz pulse repetition rate femtosecond laser are described. By “sampling” the motion of the machining front discretely with a “sampling time” as short as the imaging pulse duration, our results demonstrate that stroboscopic ICI is a promising way to improve the ICI contrast against motion artifacts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigates microseismic P-wave arrival time detection performance of automatic picking algorithms, as well as the handpicking performance of human experts. The data set used in this project was collected from Malmberget mine (LKAB, Sweden) and the handpicked P-wave arrivals were prepared by multiple expert analysts from the Institute of Mine Seismology (IMS). Characterization of the event records in the data set was completed including the magnitude distribution of the events, noise content of the traces, and frequency spectrum of the traces. Three promising automatic P-wave picking algorithms from previous seismological research were investigated: the short-term average to long-term average ratio detector (STA/LTA), the characteristic function detector (CF), and the autoregressive modelling detector (ARfpe). Several versions of each algorithm were implemented, and the most promising versions were tested on the full dataset of microseismic events. The STA/LTA algorithm and CF algorithm were superior to the ARfpe algorithm in terms of accuracy and percentage of false negatives (missed P-wave arrival time picks). The analyst P-wave arrival times were compared and statistical distributions of the analyst P-wave arrival time differences were studied. The analyst P-wave arrival time difference and algorithm P-wave arrival time difference were defined as the mean analyst P-wave arrival time minus the specific analyst P-wave arrival time pick or the specific algorithm P-wave arrival time pick. The analyst and algorithm P-wave arrival time differences were combined into separate statistical distributions and compared. The analyst P-wave arrival time distribution lengths varied by a factor of 5, and the percentage of outliers in the distribution varied between 12% and 32%. The STA/LTA algorithm had comparable distribution statistics to the worst analyst P-wave arrival in terms of median value, distribution length, and percentage of outliers. However when the number of traces with automatic P-wave picks within the analyst handpicking range was calculated the STA/LTA algorithm had only 32.0% of picks and the CF algorithm had only 11.6% of picks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A three-beam heterodyne polarimeter has been designed and constructed to measure line-integrated density and Faraday rotation of accelerated spheromak plasmas in the Plasma Injector 1 and 2 devices (PI-1, PI-2) at General Fusion Inc. Faraday rotation is a function of the local magnetic field and electron density. Therefore, the polarimeter has the potential to provide information on the internal magnetic field of the plasma.&#xD;
 &#xD;
A typical spheromak is about 1m in length and is accelerated to speeds on the order of 100km/s. At a bandwidth of 1MHz, the polarimeter can axially resolve the spheromak down to about 10cm. The polarimeter uses a $\nit{CO}_2$ laser that produces a Faraday rotation signal of about $0.5\degrees$ for a typical plasma with density and magnetic field on the order of $\ee{21}\mmt$ and 1T. The Faraday rotation measurement noise floor for a null signal is about $0.1\degrees$.&#xD;
&#xD;
Two important sources of Faraday rotation error are the ellipticity and collinearity of the plasma-immersed beams. These error sources are examined by sending the plasma beams through a rotating optic to mimic the path through a dense, magnetized plasma. The error due to the ellipticity effect has been reduced to below the noise floor by careful alignment and use of zero phase reflectors that minimize elliptical polarization of the beams. &#xD;
&#xD;
Collinearity error has been greatly improved by aligning the beams with a rotating ZnSe wedge. Measurements after the alignment match well with a model Faraday rotation signal generated from magnetic probe measurements. However, beam collinearity continues to be a significant source of error. For regions with strong density gradients, the size of this error can be on the order of the signal magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
For future work, steps should be taken to improve the alignment of the two plasma-immersed beams, and to shorten the length of the beam path to further reduce the beam collinearity error.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCLs) are commonly paired with a geomembrane and used as part of a composite liner system for landfill barriers.  Under some circumstances, leaving a composite geomembrane/geosynthetic clay liner exposed to solar radiation in the field has been shown to cause shrinkage of the underlying GCL.  Recent field studies have shown that leaving a composite liner exposed can also lead to down-slope erosion of bentonite from the GCL due to the down-slope movement of moisture.  &#xD;
&#xD;
To investigate the factors that can affect the onset of bentonite erosion in a GCL an experimental technique was developed to reproduce similar erosion in the laboratory.  The test method simulates the features that occur with the erosion of bentonite caused by down-slope migration of evaporative water in the field.  One needle-punched GCL was tested to examine the factors that can affect the onset of erosion of bentonite particles with the flow of water.  The factors examined include the effect of the initial wet/dry cycle, water source chemistry, flow rate, slope, prior cation exchange, and the effect of no drying phase in the test cycle.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Ten different manufactured GCL products were tested to examine the effect of material properties on the erosion of bentonite from a GCL.  The material properties of the products tested differed in terms of the type of carrier and cover geotextiles, bentonite (powdered, fine and coarse grained, and some with a polymer enhancement additive) and the presence of a polypropylene coating over the geotextile.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was found that the most critical factor to trigger the onset of bentonite erosion was the water source chemistry, with the tests that simulated the evaporation and condensation of water (deionized water) below an exposed composite liner leading to the formation of major erosion features.  The results of the laboratory testing program also show that erosion features are more visible in products with white coloured geotextiles.  The products containing a polypropylene coated geotextile and polymer enhanced bentonite slowed or, in some cases, prevented erosion features from developing.</dcterms:abstract>
