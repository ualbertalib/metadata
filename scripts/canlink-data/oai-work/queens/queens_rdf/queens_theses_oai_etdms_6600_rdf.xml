      <dcterms:abstract>Distributed optical fiber strain sensing is investigated as a technology to enhance the assessment of tendon reinforcement elements that are commonly used in mines and tunnelling projects. Central to this research effort is the application of a particular high spatial resolution Rayleigh optical frequency domain reflectometer that is able to distinguish strain along a standard optical fiber at spatial increments as low as 0.65 millimeters. In applying this technology to reinforcement elements, the objective is to measure a nearly continuous strain distribution, such that complex and non-uniform in-situ reinforcement responses that are induced by ground deformations can be characterized and quantified.&#xD;
This has been approached from an intrinsic sensing perspective, whereby several instrumenting procedures have been developed to directly couple fiber optic strain sensors with various reinforcement elements. Notably, a delta-shaped sensor arrangement and accompanying analysis have been developed in order to calculate the coaxial strain scalar and bending moment vector mobilized along a reinforcement element. Significantly, this allows the maximum strain distribution along a reinforcement element to be measured without prior knowledge of the location(s) or orientation(s) of strain inducing features.&#xD;
	Through a series of laboratory experiments and in-situ studies it was demonstrated that load experienced by a reinforcement element can be measured as a function of distance from the load inducing source. This critically improves common pull test assessment of reinforcement because bond stress and load development length can be quantified and related to bond strength models. Furthermore, several in-situ reinforcement mechanisms mobilized by excavation advancement were measured. These included stress redistributions facilitated by umbrella arch elements in the form of distributed bending moments as well as localized dowel reinforcement across shearing discontinuities. The latter was found to concentrate strain within several centimeters of an active discontinuity, necessitating the high spatial resolution measurements.&#xD;
	In view of use of this technology by practitioners, it has been established that the sensor arrangement can be installed in conformance with standard reinforcement handling and mechanized installation procedures. The end benefit is the developed sensing technique can be used by ground control engineers to more confidently justify alterations and optimizations to support design.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Across the Northern Hemisphere, chloride concentrations in lakes are increasing from decades of road salt use, imperiling aquatic ecosystems. Elevated chloride concentrations threaten aquatic organisms, and zooplankton are especially sensitive. Despite the negative effects of chloride on zooplankton and aquatic communities, current water quality guidelines are based on laboratory studies that exclude indirect effects or additional stressors that may modify tolerance to chloride. Additionally, increasing lake temperatures could exacerbate the negative effects of increasing chloride concentrations on zooplankton, possibly through changes to the phytoplankton community. To determine the effects of increasing chloride concentrations and lake temperatures on freshwater plankton communities and investigate the applicability of the current Canadian Water Quality Guideline for chloride (CWQG), we conducted a mesocosm experiment. We used thirty concentrations of chloride from ambient to 1500 mg/L, ambient or warmed temperatures, and plankton from a lake typical of the Canadian Shield. We found that increasing chloride concentrations negatively affected zooplankton, even at concentrations below the CWQG. Zooplankton abundance, biomass and richness decreased with increasing chloride concentrations to an extent that would likely impair ecosystem functions in highly impacted lakes, and no zooplankton taxa were positively associated with high chloride concentrations. Increasing chloride concentrations also led to a shift in phytoplankton community composition marked by an increase in cyanobacteria, which likely contributed to the negative effects of elevated chloride on zooplankton. The effects of warming, however, were limited to increasing copepod abundance and green algae concentration, and decreasing cyanobacteria concentration. Overall, zooplankton in our experiment were highly sensitive to increasing chloride concentrations and experienced 28 – 55% declines in abundance and biomass at the CWQG, suggesting that Shield lakes are not sufficiently protected from the impacts of road salt pollution.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the gendered and racialized discourses that inform how we understand the problem of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) in the West. Specifically, it traces out the role that whiteness, and white femininity in particular, plays in the valuation of the non-consensual sexualized image. The centring of the young, white, middle-class, cis-gendered, heterosexual, able-bodied female in discourses of IBSA is a function of the cultural, social, financial, and political economies within a contemporary capitalism that is deeply enmeshed with cinematic and surveillant ways of “seeing.” Through a range of case studies (including film, documentary, advertising, and cultural moments) it is argued that the different ways in which the non-consensual sexualized image comes to have social, cultural, economic, and/or political value must be understood as emerging from the context of contemporary capitalism – a capitalism that is deeply entangled with surveillance culture and economies, the affordances of digital networks and technologies, cinematic practices, pornography, gender, race, sexuality, and sexual violence. The dissertation argues for understanding the non-consensual sexualized image as a social technology that (re)produces particular social outcomes, the importance of considering these images in terms of their uses and valuations rather than their content, and the need for more research into how IBSA affects other demographics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The broad aim of this research creation project is to explore my emotional encounters with road-killed animals. This project involves the current road ecology issue of road-killed animals; the encroachment of human settlements and road-building contributes to overwhelming numbers of animal deaths by vehicular slaughter. These animal deaths occur, perhaps as an acceptable cost to the convenience and cultural necessity of road travel. Emotional Geographies demonstrate how humans and animals move through shared spaces, and how road-killed animal sites might impact their emotional connection. Animal geographies examine the importance of animal agency, both in their right to use these spaces and their representation in an anthropocentric world. Acts of mourning are considered in how humans might grieve animals, elevating their lives to be equal to those of humans. The ethical obligations humans have towards animal deaths are explored and my diary entries provide insight in each encounter with a road-killed animal. Examining a variety of approaches to trans-species artwork, I approach my own paintings in an effort to provide the individual animals agency while simultaneously evoking emotional reactions and ethical conversations among viewers. By using juiced fruits and vegetables,  I create a blood-like staining dye. My paintings take current, animal-focused environmental art and use environmentally conscientious materials and remove any use of animals within the art pieces. I mix pre-existing canvas staining techniques and move them forward by creating organic dyes.  The stains on the canvas mimic the stains remaining on asphalt after a road-killed animal victim has long been forgotten; displaying these paintings within a human space contemplates the divide between human and animal spaces and insists that these animal deaths are considered. Confronting viewers with frequently ignored deaths of often unvalued individuals highlights that further steps must be taken to consider how animals co-exist with us in shared spaces and how human power within these spaces causes animal death.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ambulation in the community is more challenging than walking indoors on level ground due to variable conditions including uneven terrain and slopes, but particularly so for people with hemiparesis due to stroke. Measurement of the quality of gait based on spatial-temporal parameters can provide insight to determine the capacity for community ambulation; however, instrumentation to assess gait is mostly limited to laboratory settings over flat surfaces. Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have the potential to measure spatial-temporal gait parameters in community settings, but few studies have been conducted to determine their validity. The objective of this study was to determine the concurrent validity of an IMU system compared to the GAITRite system in characterizing spatial-temporal aspects of gait in healthy adults and adults with hemiparesis secondary to stroke on level, inclined, and downward sloped surfaces. A cross-sectional validation study including two groups (stroke, n=11; healthy, n=12) who completed the same three walking conditions (level ground, inclined slope, and downward slope) was conducted. The agreement of spatial-temporal outcomes associated with the IMU system relative to the GAITRite system was analyzed using a three-way mixed ANOVA, Bland-Altman plots, root mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficients of variation (CV). No significant differences between the IMU and GAITRite systems were found for measures of step length, step length symmetry, and speed but swing time was consistently overestimated, and stance time was consistently underestimated compared to the GAITRite system. The agreement between IMU and GAITRite systems was not affected by surface condition (incline or downward slope); however, examination of trends indicated that the agreement between IMU and GAITRite systems may be lower for spatial-temporal parameters measured from participants with hemiparesis compared to healthy adults. Further, the variability (RMSE) associated with IMU-derived measurements tended to be higher than those from the GAITRite for the stroke group, and there was higher variation (CV) associated with the IMU system, relative to the GAITRite, among stroke participants. The major findings indicate that the IMU system requires improvements in measurement accuracy before it can be used as a valid measurement system for spatial-temporal gait parameters in healthy and hemiparetic populations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>At many crime scenes, little evidence is left behind; thus, the more tools available for the analysis of minute samples, the better. For instance, trace elemental impurities are not regulated in many commercial materials and thus could be a unique identifier. One of the best techniques for multi-elemental trace analysis is inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry; yet, it is seldom used for forensic analysis.  In this thesis, four different forensic applications will be explored using ICP spectrometry involving four different types of sample: human head hair, automotive paint, solder and gunshot residue.&#xD;
Human hair and automotive paints were analyzed using electrothermal vaporization (ETV) coupled to ICP optical emission spectrometry (OES).  This combination is advantageous for the analysis of forensic materials, as ETV enables the direct analysis of milligrams of solid samples, which eliminates sample contamination that could happen during dissolution.  Moreover, as transport efficiency into the ICP is nearly 100%, a higher sensitivity results than with solution nebulization (SN). Qualitative analysis by ETV-ICP-OES in combination with multivariate statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, enabled the discrimination of gender and general ethnicity from head hair as well as vehicle manufacturer, year of production and colour from an automotive paint chip. &#xD;
Quantitative analysis by SN into ICP mass spectrometry (MS) following acid digestion constitutes an even more sensitive approach than ETV-ICP-OES.  The concentrations of trace impurities were measured by SN-ICP-MS in lead-tin solder, commonly used in the making of improvised explosive devices, to help to narrow down the list of suspects if pieces of solder salvaged at the crime scene are matched to unused pieces found in a suspect’s home.  Quantitative analysis by SN-ICP-MS is also useful to assess the health and safety of forensic personnel as well as cross-contamination in a forensic facility. Because forensic ballistic profiling requires a firearm discharge in an environmentally controlled range, a high concentration of lead accumulates on surfaces, exposing employees to potential lead-related health risks. In addition to quantifying the lead concentrations on surfaces in different areas, SN-ICP-MS also enabled the identification of an effective lead abatement method.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Borocations have been synthetically accessible entities for over 35 years, thought of as chemical curiosities too reactive to be synthetically useful until recently. Our group has contributed to the development of a class of three-coordinate dialkyl borocations, known as borenium ions, stabilized by N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). Our NHC is based on the 1,2,3-triazolylidene ring system, a modular motif that we previously exploited in borenium-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions. This thesis describes our work on borenium ion catalysis as well as insight into unexpected decomposition pathways. First, we established a facile hydrosilylation protocol of imines and quinolines with triazolylidene borenium ion 1+ under mild conditions. With respect to quinoline reductions, 1+ does not completely reduce the N-heterocyclic ring, giving rise to a cyclic N-silyl enamine, which we applied in a Mukaiyama aldol-like reaction with aldehydes to produce unique γ-aminoalcohols. Interestingly, control experiments showed that 1+ catalyzed both the reduction and nucleophilic addition. Next, we attempted to reduce pyridines with dihydrogen, a classically difficult substrate class. Control reactions indicated that catalyst decomposition was favoured at high temperatures in the presence of a bulky secondary amine. To mitigate this problem, a hydrosilane was injected into the reaction, allowing for more mild hydrogen pressures and temperatures. Thus far, 1+ reductions are racemic and introduction of chiral NHCs or boranes has resulted in low stereoinduction. The avenue presented in this thesis to overcome this challenge is the preparation of NHC-boranes containing chiral phosphate substituents. Strong thermodynamic and kinetic hydricity of the NHC-borane was critical for facile synthesis of these molecules. Finally, we discovered that imidazolylidene-stabilized carbene boranes ring expand at elevated temperature to yield cyclic azaborines. Subsequent hydride abstraction of these cyclic systems resulted in 6-membered cyclic aromatic boron carbocations. The data presented in this thesis challenge the preconceived notions of high NHC stability with regard to exotic main group molecules and approaches to overcome these obstacles has resulted in new synthetic methodologies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores several aspects of empirical corporate finance. The three essays in my dissertation are in line with the two streams of empirical corporate finance research: mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) is with the transaction-based stream whereas supply chain financing is in line with the contractual finance research.&#xD;
In the first essay, I use the Jump Start Our Business Act (JOBS Act) in 2012 as a quasi-natural experiment to examine how increased access to the IPO market affects the bargaining power of private targets in mergers and acquisitions. I find that U.S. private targets are valued higher after the JOBS Act relative to public targets acquired by U.S. acquirers. The announcement returns of acquirers that took over U.S. private targets after the JOBS Act are lower. I find that the effect is more pronounced for target firms with higher disclosure costs and for firms with less bargaining power.&#xD;
In the second essay, I examine the information role of media outlets, namely newspapers, in the supply chain. I exploit a comprehensive dataset of U.S. supplier-customer pairs as well as news coverage by newspapers, of customers over the period 2000 to 2016 to examine how suppliers utilize information from the media to manage their primary customers. I document that a one standard deviation change in the media coverage of a firm’s customer translates into a 5.29% increase in the possibility of it being recognized as a primary customer. Enhanced media coverage also leads to more liberal trade credit terms. I rely on local news outlets’ shutdowns and airline routes closedowns to establish causality.&#xD;
In the third essay, I examine how investors’ acquisition of information from EDGAR filings influences firms’ trade credit. I use the download intensity of the SEC’s EDGAR system and find that more downloading decreases aggregate trade credit offering, and the effect is only significant for the distant investors who have less information about the firms.&#xD;
The results are consistent with my model that information acquisition by investors without a complete understanding about the managers’ actions makes them focus on short-term performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Access to high-quality primary care has been identified as a pressing need for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Adults with IDD live with complex physical and mental health conditions, use health services differently than the general population and continue to face challenges when accessing health services. Interprofessional primary care teams offer comprehensive and coordinated approaches to primary care delivery and are well-positioned to address the needs of adults with IDD and other vulnerable populations. Although interprofessional primary care teams are recommended, there is currently limited understanding of how interprofessional services are delivered and how this approach improves the health of adults with IDD. The overall objective of this research was to gain a detailed understanding of the current provision of interprofessional primary care for adults with IDD.&#xD;
This dissertation presents the results of two studies. A scoping review was completed to examine the provision of interprofessional primary care for adults with IDD in a global context. A multiple case study was also conducted with five interprofessional primary care teams in Ontario, Canada. The aim of this study was to describe interprofessional primary care for adults with IDD within and across models of team-based care in one local health service context. &#xD;
The results of the studies highlight that there are multiple approaches to the provision of interprofessional primary care for adults with IDD. In Ontario, adults with IDD are a small part of the patient population served and overall, this group was poorly identified. Key organizational attributes, as well as the experiences of patients, caregivers and health providers were described. Interestingly, despite the presence of interprofessional health providers, there were limited organizational processes to engage a wide-range of interprofessional services. There was no consistent reporting of outcomes and no processes in place to measure the impact of interprofessional services for this population. Results provide important insights into the current state of interprofessional primary care for adults with IDD in Ontario and highlight a critical need for further work in the field to develop processes to engage in team-based care and demonstrate the value of the approach for this population.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A series of laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the effect of prehydration fluid, a 4-mm diameter central coating defect, coating defect position and nature, and the effect of coating orientation of a multi-component coated geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) on interface transmissivity, θ between the interfaces of GCL and a 1.5mm thick high-density polyethylene geomembrane (GMB) when permeated with a simulated municipal solid waste landfill leachate. Also, two different conventional GCLs were used to explore the effect of prehydration and permeant fluid, desiccation of GCL on θ and assess the self-healing capacity of desiccated GCLs for three different permeant solutions under a range of applied stresses (10-150 kPa). It was found that &lt; 70 kPa, θ was dominated by variability in initial contact condition between the interfaces of GMB-GCL and the effect of other factors was largely masked by the contact variability. At 100-150 kPa the effects of initial variability were largely eliminated but there was no notable effect of other factors for both multi-component and conventional GCLs. Desiccation of GCLs increased transmissivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to an intact specimen at 10-100 kPa. Even at 150 kPa desiccated specimens had θ ≤ 8.0x10-9 m2/s for all specimens tested. The chemical composition of permeant solutions, crack width, and nature of bentonite played an important role in healing the cracks of desiccated GCLs.&#xD;
A new laboratory test setup was developed to apply freeze-thaw cycles at the GMB-GCL interfaces and tests were conducted to do a preliminary study of 5 and 16 freeze-thaw cycles effect, two different prehydration fluids and means of hydration of GCL during freeze-thaw cycles on θ, for a range of stresses (10-100kPa). The preliminary results showed that the new test setup successfully applied freeze/thaw cycles to the interfaces of GMB/GCL. The ice lenses, on thawing had a significant effect on θ at 10 kPa. When GCLs were externally prehydrated with RO water and pore water and then subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, there was no evidence of any significant effect of 5-freeze/thaw cycles but there was an effect of 16 freeze/thaw cycles on interface transmissivity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Understanding how fatigue affects task performance is crucial for understanding injury risk. Historically, the tests used to measure fatigue and the effects of that fatigue were not always similar to the tasks that generated that fatigue. Many studies that examine fatigue in jumping implement a pre-fatigue test, followed by a fatiguing protocol, and then a post-fatigue test. If the pre-fatigue and post-fatigue tests are not functionally similar to the fatiguing task, then the information obtained may not accurately represent the true effect of fatigue on the specific task. To avoid misinterpretation the testing tasks must be similar, or ideally identical, to the repetitive, fatiguing task. Therefore, in this study, a vertical countermovement jumping task was recorded continuously and the landing biomechanics were analyzed over time to explore how fatigue was manifest as jump performance decreased. The purpose of this study was to identify how landing biomechanics changed as the degree of fatigue increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
Kinematic, kinetic and muscular data were collected from 10 experienced jumpers, and 14 novice jumpers. For each participant, data were collected continuously during the continuous execution of 60 maximal vertical jumps, where the rest time between jumps was four seconds. Independent samples t-test assessed the difference between the novice and elite group. For the last 45 jumps of the fatigue protocol, slopes with 95% confidence intervals and correlations were computed to assess the rate of change for each variable and the relationship between the fatigue measures, and the landing biomechanical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results demonstrate there was no significant difference between the novice and elite group mean slope for all variables. Three of the landing biomechanical variables had slopes significantly different from zero: the maximum knee angle (Kmax), the location of the maximum ground reaction force (GRF Loc), and one of the stiffness measure (Stiff5). Additionally, the changes in jump height are not correlated with changes in landing biomechanical variables (correlations &lt; 0.50), which presents an important consideration for using jump height as a single variable for determining if individuals are at risk for a fatigue-related injury.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A growing emphasis has been placed on the importance of the gut-brain axis (GBA) and its role in normal physiological functions of the body. This bidirectional axis links cognitive functions of the central nervous system (CNS) with a number of peripheral intestinal functions such as intestinal permeability, immune activation, and neuro-endocrine signalling. Studies have highlighted the possibility that the intestinal microbiota could influence the function of the gut-brain axis; however, mechanisms underlying these interactions are currently unknown. In hopes of better understanding how the microbiome may play a role in altering the gut-brain axis, I studied the epithelial barrier of the gut, as it acts as the interface between the microbiome and the gut-brain axis. I investigated whether disrupting the microbiome in vivo with antibiotics, and mimicking a healthy microbiome through the application of a commensal bacterial community (microbial ecosystems therapeutics-1; MET-1) can modulate epithelial barrier functions.  Using Ussing chambers, I investigated changes in colonic mucosal epithelial permeability in vitro in both antibiotic-treated animals and following the local application of MET-1 (1:1000). Additionally, I examined the effect of antibiotic treatment on paracellular permeability and intestinal transit in vivo, serotonin bioavailability, epithelial ion secretion, and neurotransmission. Paracellular permeability of the colon was significantly increased in vivo following a 7-day vancomycin treatment, and Veratridine-stimulated (30 µM) ion secretion was significantly diminished in colonic tissue of mice subjected to the treatment compared to controls. Apical application of MET-1 did not enhance epithelial barrier function in vitro. Moreover, no differences in intestinal motility, serotonin bioavailability, and ion secretion were found between antibiotic-treated animals and controls. These results indicate that the modulation of host microbiota leads to changes in mucosal permeability and Veratridine-stimulated ion secretion, which may facilitate the access of microbial metabolites to the nervous system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Thin-walled hollow sections such as rectangular hollow sections (RHS) have very high torsional rigidity, and thus make a very economic choice for applications which are susceptible to lateral torsional buckling. However, as the depth of a thin-walled RHS increases to ensure adequate bending stiffness, its depth-to-thickness ratio increases and the section is now susceptible to webcrippling/local buckling failure. This causes a reduction in its moment rotation capacity. Therefore, deep thin-walled RHS are not efficient when used as long un-braced spans that require high bending strength and rotational capacity. As such, a new polygonal hollow section (PHS) was developed and a research project initiated to compare the PHS to typical RHS via experimental and numerical analyses comprising four-point, three-point and cantilever bending tests. The results showed that the PHS has almost four times the moment rotation capacity of a comparable RHS and the potential to minimize web-crippling failure in thin-walled hollow sections.&#xD;
Following completion of the flexural bending tests, cantilever bending tests using PHS and RHS beams were conducted. The results showed that lateral torsional bending is not significant for HSS as the lateral deflections recorded at the top and bottom flanges of all the beams were minimal (&lt; 2 mm).&#xD;
Finally, numerical analyses were conducted to simulate the bending behavior of PHS beams and to consider the effects of varying specimen dimensions that were not considered in the experimental program. The results showed that PHS beams have a higher bending moment capacity, almost twice that of RHS beams. This is rather remarkable given that the PHS beams have 4% lower cross-sectional area and 18% lower moment of inertia than comparable RHS beams. It is speculated that the provision of bends in the flanges and webs of the cross-section gave rise to the increase in the moment capacity of the PHS beams. Furthermore, in comparison to the CAN/CSA-S16-14 design guidelines, the results showed that within limits of 32 ≤ h/t ≤ 85 and 19 ≤ b/t ≤ 64 the PHS beams can be classified as Class 1 sections while the RHS beams were confirmed to be Class 3 and Class 4 sections.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research studied the capabilities of RANS-based computational fluid dynamics to model large scale 2-phase propane jet flares with considerations for thermal radiation, soot development, and other key flare properties. The goal of this work was to determine how modest CFD could be used in the generation and evaluation of large scale jet flares that are often only studied experimentally. Measurements of incident thermal radiation to remote targets, soot volume fraction, and relevant flare geometries are reported based on the CFD models produced and compared to various analytical and experimentally derived models.&#xD;
&#xD;
The CFD study was completed using the commercial suite of tools from ANSYS, namely ICEM CFD 18 and Fluent 18. Emphasis was put on evaluating the pre-existing models within the solver. The standard &#xD;
k-ε turbulence model was used in this study due to its support from literature, and performance in preliminary tests. A probability density function approach was used to model the non-premixed combustion, and the 2-step soot model was used to predict soot production. The P-1 radiation model was used as it is an economical, non-raytracing model that allows for the inclusion of radiation from soot. &#xD;
&#xD;
The CFD results were compared to a solid flame model as well as empirical models and measurements. The CFD predicted soot volume fraction in the flare between 2.7×10^(-7) and 4.9×10^(-7) depending on the flare boundary temperature selected. Incident thermal radiation was found to agree strongly with a solid flame model; ranging from 1.6 kW/m^2  at a 2m distance, to 0.11 kW/m^2  at 15m. Agreement with experimental radiometer data was weak, with the CFD results predicting much lower levels of thermal radiation. Average surface emissive power of the flare was determined to be 100.3 kw/m^2  using literature based techniques and agreed well with various empirical models from literature. The radiative signature of the flare was also studied for crosswinds of up to 6m/s, showing expected increases in incident radiation to downstream targets - up to 9.1 kW/m^2  in the near field for 6m/s winds.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a syndrome in which an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure&gt;20 mmHg is associated with adverse pulmonary vascular remodeling, which results in right heart failure and death. The World Health Organization classified PH into 5 groups. The most common causes of PH are left heart diseases, which is classified as group 2 PH. Currently, there is no approved therapy for group 2 PH and treatments are largely supportive. The goal of my PhD work is to find effective therapeutic strategies for group 2 PH in preclinical rodent models.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods &amp; Results: A retrospective cohort study was done on patients (n=9289) who had a transthoracic echocardiography at the Kingston Health Sciences Centre. We found that although 44.1% patients had elevated pulmonary pressure [right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP)&gt;30mmHg], only 3.1% carried a clinical diagnosis of PH. The rate of hospitalization increased in direct proportion to RVSP. We studied the supra-coronary aortic banding (SAB) rat model of group 2 PH, a preclinical model of aortic stenosis or coarctation. SAB rats developed group 2 PH and a metabolic shift in the terminal stage of glycolysis in their LV and RV myocardium. Specifically, the expression of pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) to 1 (PKM1) ratio was significantly upregulated in the SAB vs. control myocardium. We then treated SAB rats with the PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin, in SAB rats. Shikonin restored PKM2/PKM1 ratio and improved RV function. Finally, we examined the role of RV ischemia in group 1 PH. SAB increases right coronary artery systolic perfusion pressure, which improved RV perfusion, restored the RV PKM2/PKM1 ratio and improved RV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: PH is common and portends adverse outcomes and yet is under-diagnosed by clinicians. Even mild elevation of pulmonary pressure (RVSP&gt;30 mmHg) is associated with increased number of hospitalization and comorbidities. Elevated PKM2/PKM1 ratio is associated with RV dysfunction and failure in the SAB and MCT rat models of PH. Improving RV perfusion pressure and using PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin reduces PKM2/PKM1 ratio to normal level in MCT and SAB rats, respectively. Restoration of normal PKM2/PKM1 ratio is associated with reduced RV hypertrophy and improved RV function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>While the need for newer and more efficient network security techniques is increasing, refining the existing and proven techniques can also have potential benefits and outcomes. One of the aspects of such improvements in the existing system is making them flexible to adapt for the modification. Currently we have an intrusion detection system (IDS) that defines the normal patterns of a network behaviour using constraints. Failure of these network constraints indicates an intrusion in the network. The IDS dissects the network packets into network information to evaluate the constraints. In this research, we augment the existing IDS to validate constraints defined on application data. We augment the IDS to further dissect the data coming in the network packets. We define data constraints to find possible malicious inconsistencies in the application data of a closed network, such as in Air Traffic Control (ATC).&#xD;
&#xD;
An ontology is defined for the domain of ATC. We use the ATC ontology for the ATC domain data representation and threat evaluation. We modify an existing air traffic system simulation which generates ATC data and use it to generate both clean and malicious data. The data is then structured using the rules and relations in the air traffic control ontology. Rules and queries are then developed for this data, representing detectable threats. The queries are then transformed into application data constraints readable by the IDS. Presently this transformation specification is manual. In the future, the IDS will be updated for the auto transformation using the sequence of steps specified in the manual transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we demonstrate the working of the application constraints and queries for detecting violations. The data constraints are written in the same domain specific language (DSL), already used for the IDS. Moreover, we highlight the change  required by the DSL and the transformation to generate for the constraint engine of the IDS. The research successfully produces a proof of concept for representing presence of application data attack at the network level.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the end we conclude that by validating the domain data constraints with IDS, we assert that the ATC domain data constraints are transformed and enforced at the network level. The proposed representation and manual transformation specification demonstrate the possibility of adding and testing new changes to critical systems with much ease.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>While the recent adoption of a person-centred approach to long-term care in Canada has done much to address the shortcomings of its biomedical predecessors (particularly bringing to light the social-psychological aspects of living with dementia), it has not resulted in notable increases in quality of life for those who live in long-term care facilities. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute a relational and place-sensitive perspective of person-centred care that highlights where the approach could be better aligned with its experience and ultimately informs a higher quality of life for people living in long-term care environments. To do so, empirically expressed tensions in the lived experiences of long-term care facilities espousing person-centred care are considered through the lens of a relational landscapes of long-term care framework derived from the burgeoning field of geographical gerontology. A qualitative, community-based, multi-site case study methodological design guided the collection of interviews with residents, staff and family members in three long-term care facilities designed to elicit their lived experiences. Observation periods in each facility contributed to my own perspective of the care environments. Tensions expressed within each of the empirically emergent themes that shaped the lived experiences of participants (atmosphere, flexibility and relationship-building) were considered as they relate to the core concepts of home(place), care and personhood to expand person-centered care and contribute to (while simultaneously arising through) the landscapes of long-term care framework. Specifically, the expansion of conceptions of home as a functional, familiar potential beyond its locational aspects; of care to incorporate a broader range of relationships and the potential of the built environment to foster these relationships; and of personhood as a de-centred process rather than a uni-directional outcome were found to be the potential nucleus of an expansion of person-centred care that addresses its experiential and conceptual tensions. Conceptually, the contribution of this research is an advancement of relational understandings of place and care in the long-term care context.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Additive manufacturing (AM), specifically the process of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), is a manufacturing procedure where a part is constructed by extruding a melted filament in a layer-by-layer fashion from the bottom up. AM processes offer the ability to manufacture more complex features versus traditional subtractive and formative manufacturing methods. Topology optimization is a structural design tool which is known for generating high-stiffness designs having complex and organic features, making it an ideal tool for using with AM technologies. Traditional topology optimization performs well for stiffness design, but stress considerations are often neglected. A significant shortcoming of FDM is the tendency for tensile material properties in build direction to be significantly weaker than the strengths in the other axes. This work presents a methodology for maximizing the safety factor of structural components for fabrication using FDM AM technology by considering the anisotropy of the material strengths using the Tsai-Wu failure criterion. This is achieved through minimizing an aggregated failure index subject to a volume fraction constraint and is implemented into the framework of density-based topology optimization. Multiple numerical test cases are solved to test the behaviour and robustness of the methodology using fictious material properties. For simple test cases, then methodology does not provide competitive designs compared to the traditional stiffness-based topology optimization formulation; however, test cases which exhibit sharp corners and stress concentrations show significant improvements to the safety factor of the designs when compared to the traditional stiffness-based topology optimization formulation. Real-world material properties of plastic FDM are used to show that for the design of an L-shaped bracket, a common shape used in industrial topology optimization problems, the methodology successfully improves the strength of parts when compared to the equivalent stiffness-based topology optimization result.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>One of the major threats to the security of software systems is the occurrence of security vulnerabilities, which can potentially cause a variety of problems including, but not limited to, information loss, privilege escalation, data breach, and system failure. Software vulnerability prediction is therefore a critical part of software engineering. A variety of approaches have been proposed to detect the most likely locations of vulnerabilities in large codebases. Many of the existing methods rely on traditional software metrics such as lines of code, complexity and code churn. In this study, we explored the possibility of using Rich Contextualized Language Use Vectors (RCLUVs) as a feature set for predicting vulnerabilities in the context of the Linux kernel. &#xD;
The RCLUV of a source code file contains elements representing the frequency of each programming language feature being used, both individually and in the context of other features. This code profile is generated by parsing the source code of a program and analyzing the resulting parse tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
We mined vulnerabilities reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and built a dataset containing all known vulnerable files in the 14-year history of the Linux kernel. We built and evaluated RCLUV-based prediction models using different machine learning algorithms under both experimental and realistic scenarios. Analysis of the learning curves of the models demonstrates that RCLUVs are effective for training machine learning models to learn vulnerability patterns. Performance comparison of our models with four different popular vulnerability prediction models shows that our approach outperforms the models trained on includes, function calls, and software metrics in an experimental setup. Moreover, our models can successfully predict more than half of the future and unseen vulnerabilities in a real-life setting when given enough training data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fuel channels in CANDU (CANadian Deuterium Uranium) nuclear reactors consist of two non-concentric tubes; an inner pressure tube (PT) and a larger diameter calandria tube (CT), within which the PT is contained. The gas annulus space between the tubes, known as the gap, ensures that hydride blisters do not form on the outer diameter of the PT, as these can lead to potential cracking. Consequently, accurate measurements are required to ensure that contact between PT and CT is not imminent. The PT-CT gap is monitored from within the PT using an electromagnetic eddy current probe called the gap probe. The gap probe has previously been investigated to extract additional information from the channel past its intended purpose, including a method to profile the inner PT surface by examining probe lift-off effects. This thesis looks at two other areas of enhancement of the gap probe’s functionality; extracting the liquid injection shutdown system (LISS) nozzle proximity to fuel channels, and extracting PT microstructural information by monitoring local PT electrical resistivity. LISS-PT proximity information was extracted from an experimental setup that could vary PT wall thickness, PT resistivity, PT-CT gap, LISS-PT proximity and gap probe lift-off. Empirical models were identified over two effective detection ranges, and out-performed remote field eddy current methods near LISS-CT contact. In addition, as PT-CT gap algorithms become more sophisticated, the ability of being able to extract local PT resistivity from gap inspection data will become available. The utility of local PT resistivity depends on research linking resistivity to characteristics of interest to CANDU reactor operators. This work identified that as PTs experience operating temperatures between 250-320 °C and their microstructure transforms, specifically decomposition of the beta-phase, the resistivity is found to decrease by up to 10%. This result has implications for some gap inspection algorithms that assume constant electrical resistivity. This change in resistivity due to heat treatment, if measured, could be leveraged to provide axial and circumferential microstructural information that could be used by probabilistic and deterministic fuel channel degradation models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Advanced power electronic supplies with high power density are strongly demanded in a wide range of power levels. This thesis proposes high power density and thermal management solutions for three levels of power system integration: chip level for low power converters with 5W to 30W power ratings; power device level to decrease the component size; and power converter level including DC-DC converters and AC-DC converters range from 1kW to 6.6kW. &#xD;
High performance point of load converter structure is investigated for low power level compact module applications based on the power supply in inductor (PSI2) technology. This thesis proposes a 3D PSI2 integrated power module at 5V/8A output which reduces the size of POL module while maintaining a low junction temperature. Improved thermal modeling methodology is developed for integrated modules to achieve more accurate thermal analysis.&#xD;
In device level, a novel micro electromechanical system (MEMS) power relay which uses tiny MEMS switches is designed. The MEMS switch is used to replace the bulky magnetic – metal contact structure in traditional power relay solutions. Much lower on state resistance than solid state relay (SSR) is achieved, therefore less thermal issue is address due to lower conduction loss.&#xD;
Power density improvement and thermal design for discrete mid-level power converters from 1 to 20kW are studied and two high power density converters are proposed. The first implementation is a high current low voltage converter (with 14V/270A load) for electric vehicles (EVs). By building a multi-PCB cooling (MPC) cooling structure, the volume of converter is reduced by 31% while achieving the best heat dissipation performance.  The second research is a single stage LLC AC-DC converter with PFC for on board charger (OBC) application. The LLC converter is proposed which combines the functions of power factor correction (PFC), DC-DC voltage regulation and galvanic isolation in only one stage. Bulky magnetic components are saved, and high power density is achieved by the proposed converter.&#xD;
In this thesis, multiple research methodologies including mathematical modeling, finite element analysis (FEA), SPICE based simulation and experimental test are employed to verify the proposals and theories.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The incorporation of Recycled Asphalt Pavements (RAP) and Shingles (RAS) into neat asphalt binder is a useful development towards environmental sustainability apart from its economic savings benefits, which comes as a relief to the finances of the transportation sector. Recycling of pavements reduces the demand for non-renewable resources such as new asphalt binder and mineral aggregates. Unfortunately, there are no protocols to control and guide the sector or contractors on the appropriate and effective amount of RAP/RAS that can be used, which has created a monitoring problem on its usage. &#xD;
The effects that RAP (Highway 7, 11, 403) and RAS have on the rheology of two sources of virgin asphalts of the same grade was studied under this research. Two binders of grade PG 58-28 were modified at different percentages (10%, 20% and 30%) of RAP and RAS. To simulate aging that occurs during Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) production, laying and compaction and aging that occurs during service life, the modified binders were subjected to Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO) aging and Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) aging. Rheological properties before and after modification and aging were measured using the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR).  The resistance to fatigue cracking, permanent deformation, the performance at high and intermediate temperature were accessed using the DSR. The Fraass Breaking Point (FBP) instrument was used to determine the temperature at which cracks initiate which is related to the fatigue resistance in asphalt binders. The extent of oxidation after modification and aging was determined using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC) technique was used to study the changes in glass transition temperatures between the different RAP/RAS at the same modification dosage and aging. The binder increased in stiffness as the percentage of modification increased and this differed with each RAP/RAS source. The binders showed it could take more than 30% dose of Highway 7. Highway 403 RAP and the RAS, from results, are unsuitable for surface course pavement construction. The aging effect was very prominent after aging the samples in the PAV for 40 hours as compared to the standard 20 hours. It was found that the determination of the low temperature performance of a binder using the limiting phase angle temperature at 30 is promising.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cancer metastasis is the greatest ongoing obstacle to improving therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Metastasis is a complex process reliant on phenotypic plasticity and dynamic changes in gene expression. MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that are post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression. Due to specificity for multiple targets and functional redundancy in the genome, miRNA fine-tune expression of gene-networks involved in virtually every cellular process. In cancer, dysregulated miRNAs can act as tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and are useful biomarkers. In this work, we examined the expression and function of miRNA in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and cutaneous melanoma to gain insights into mechanisms of disease progression and metastasis. Due to numerous reports identifying miR-206 as a metastasis-suppressor in multiple cancers, we characterized the effects of ectopic expression in LUAD, finding that miR-206 mediated suppression of tumor growth and metastasis through broad disruption of TGF-β signaling. However, the highly muscle-specific expression patterns of miR-206 imply that this miRNA plays no physiological role in preventing LUAD. To explore the reasons why miR-206 is widely identified in cancers outside of muscle, we analyzed miRNA expression in primary and metastatic melanoma tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort, as well as melanoma and stromal cell lines. We determined that miR-206 and several other highly-studied metastasis-suppressor miRNAs were likely identified due to enrichment in stromal cells, highlighting the need to consider cell-type composition in tissue-level miRNA data. Through characterizing miRNA expression in melanoma, we identified a novel subset harboring expression of the chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC). C19MC was associated with overexpression of cancer/testis antigens, altered global DNA methylation profiles, and enrichment of embryonic gene expression patterns consistent with dedifferentiation. Furthermore, we identified five melanoma cell lines with endogenous C19MC expression and established tumor xenograft models to compare tumor growth and metastasis potential in vivo. These models will facilitate further functional studies of C19MC in melanoma and identification of new therapeutic vulnerabilities. Overall, the findings presented here provide insights into the functional roles of miRNAs in metastatic cancers, highlighting challenges in research methodology, and the potential applications of this research in cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the last two decades, we have seen the proliferation of nonstate actors such as transnational corporations (TNCs) on the global stage. Despite evidence pointing to the socio-economic contributions of TNCs, there have also been numerous reports of business complicity in human rights abuses. As a result, transnational voluntary governance initiatives (TVGIs) such as the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs) and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) have emerged to promote corporate social responsibility (CSR). The existence of inalienable human rights has been accepted by the 193 member countries of the United Nations; however, despite claims of respecting the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, cases of human rights abuses by TNCs continue to come to light, especially in the extractive sectors of the Global South. This begs the following question: To what extent can state-business participation in regulatory governance norms promote responsible business conduct (RBC) and sustainable development practices in mineral resource sectors? This dissertation seeks to answer the above question by analyzing the following puzzles: 1) Why and how do TNCs successfully interact with some host states to adopt TVGIs on business, security and human rights (BSHrs), but not with others? and 2) What are the drivers of BSHrs commitments and/or reporting among TNCs? Utilizing insights from field research, new institutionalisms, ‘global assemblages’, and a Transnational Business Governance Interactions (TBGI) framework, I argue that although home-country (Canada) commitments to TVGIs on BSHrs norms are essential for promoting responsible corporate behaviours, what largely drives and differentiates Canadian transnational mining firms’ commitments to BSHrs norms in mineral-rich host states (Ghana and South Africa) tend to be a combination of the host states’ institutional contexts (e.g., state-business strategic postures), the dynamics of legitimacy (the ‘social license to operate’) and transnational mineral governance assemblage (TMGA) for corporate human rights due diligence. Overall, my dissertation contributes to ‘eclectic scholarship’, improves the traditional scholarly discourse on CSR and human rights obligations, broadens the policy dialogue on sustainable development, and helps us understand how norm dynamics influence international ‘soft’ law, transnational mining investments and natural resource governance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The perinuclear theca (PT) is a condensed cytosolic capsule that surrounds the eutherian sperm nucleus and contains various proteins involved in fertilization. Previously, proteomic analysis of the bovine PT revealed a novel population of four core histones residing in this distinctly non-nuclear location, despite the traditional role of histones in nuclear DNA stabilization. Utilizing immunocytochemistry, histones were localized to two sub-compartments of the murid PT, the post-acrosomal sheath and the murid-specific perforatorium. This finding created the framework to pursue our primary objective: to determine the role of PT core histones in fertilization and early embryogenesis. Specifically, given their inherent ability to bind DNA, we hypothesized that PT-associated histones stabilize sperm chromatin during male pronuclear formation in the developing zygote.&#xD;
To investigate this, we assessed the consequences of performing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with histone-depleted (HD) sperm. The mouse model is ideal for such functional assays because only the sperm nucleus and PT are required to achieve fertilization via ICSI. To create a valid depletion model, histones were selectively extracted from the mouse PT under high salt conditions paired with mild sonication. SDS-PAGE analysis of KCl-treated murid sperm extracts revealed four low molecular weight bands which, by immunoblotting with anti-core histone antibodies, corresponded to calf thymus core histones (H3, H2B, H2A, H4) run in adjacent lanes. Conversely, PT-bound activating factor, PAWP, remained largely intact following high salt extraction, indicating selectivity of the protocol.&#xD;
ICSI functional assays compared developmental patterns of mouse embryos fertilized with control or HD sperm. Using light microscopy, HD oocytes were found to initiate activation at the same rate as control groups but displayed significantly fewer 2-cell embryos and blastocysts at the appropriate developmental timepoints. This suggests that early embryonic development is delayed in the absence of PT-derived core histones, presumably as compensation for destabilization of the male chromatin following fertilization. While their direct influence on sperm chromatin was unclear by our methods, this thesis presents evidence for the influence of PT core histones on early embryogenesis, and proposes a model of PT histone depletion for future functional analyses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Most breast cancers are estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and therefore benefit from endocrine-based therapies such as tamoxifen which impair estrogen signaling. However, resistance is a major clinical concern and ER status alone is insufficient to predict treatment response. As a result, additional biomarkers are needed to predict resistance. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is an attractive candidate because it functions as a tumor suppressor in ER+ breast cancer and low GR expression has been associated with poor outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients. GR promoter methylation occurs frequently in ER+ tumors and coincides with particularly low GR expression. To investigate GR methylation as a potential biomarker, we developed a targeted multiplex bisulfite sequencing assay to detect promoter methylation in archival tumor samples. With this assay, we evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of GR methylation in ER+ patients from the CCTG MA.12 tamoxifen clinical trial. Region-specific GR promoter methylation was an independent marker of poor prognosis and identified a subset of patients with especially poor survival, particularly in the absence of tamoxifen treatment. This provides a foundation for the continued development of GR methylation as a prognostic marker in ER+ breast cancer.&#xD;
Given the tumor suppressive role of GR in ER+ breast cancer, we examined the regulation of GR expression in the context of tamoxifen treatment. GR mRNA levels increased with tamoxifen in ER+ but not ER− breast cancer cells, suggesting ER is involved in regulating GR expression. The GR promoter is particularly complex with multiple first exons. By adapting 5’RACE for next-generation sequencing, we established that increased GR expression was mediated through the same exons in the proximal promoter in tamoxifen-treated ER+ cells. We then carried out a functional analysis of this promoter region in ER− cells transiently expressing ER or naturally-occurring ER mutants (Y537S or D538G). Our findings suggest tamoxifen upregulates GR through an ER-dependent non-classical signaling mechanism with differing characteristics depending on the ER mutation. Since GR has an established antiproliferative effect on ER+ breast cancer cells, tamoxifen-induced GR upregulation could be an important factor influencing treatment response. This work may have important clinical implications for tamoxifen-treated patients, including those with acquired ER mutations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Movement and mobility are concepts that are frequently used in the nursing field. Movement is a fundamental human ability which changes as individuals grow and as a result of illness or injury. Movement is one of many factors which affects mobility. Decreased mobility can lead to decreased quality of life and independence. As individuals age the incidence of mobility difficulties increases, reaching 81% for women and 57% for men at the age of 90. Most of the tasks that nurses help their patients complete involve some degree of movement or mobility, so it is important for nurses to be able to determine if their interventions are returning patients to their optimal level of functioning in movement and mobility.&#xD;
Despite the importance of these concepts, they are often confused or used interchangeably. These concepts need to be clarified to ensure proper measurement of outcomes. A concept analysis was completed to clarify and compare movement and mobility that was followed by a scoping review in order to identify and analyze measures that claimed to measure either movement or mobility. The measures were analysed using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), an alpha-numeric system created to code health information. Because the code set generated by the scoping review was larger than the data sets seen in existing studies, existing methods for analyzing and presenting data were further developed. Finally, the concepts of movement and mobility were operationalized using an example case to show how the information from the scoping review can be used to select measures of movement and mobility for clinical and research purposes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Typically, medical training does not prepare healthcare workers to deal with emotions in medical practice, which can cause them to shut down emotionally and withdraw from patients as a way of protecting themselves. Recent work demonstrates how emotions play an essential role in healthcare relations and patient care delivery and, as such, call for greater attention in sociological research. The primary aim of this exploratory research was to uncover and understand the emotional, social interactions of healthcare workers in a Canadian hospital context. The findings of this study come from a combination of ethnographic field research and 28 in-depth interviews with various healthcare professionals within one Canadian hospital. A principal finding is an expectation for healthcare workers to follow “feeling rules,” which are socialized through a hidden curriculum and specific ward cultures.  The main cause of sadness at work comes from what is commonly known as a “bad death,” while anger mainly emanates from poor interactions and relationships with colleagues. Participants report that interactions with colleagues are the primary source of happiness, along with recognition from their patients (the chief source of happiness and accomplishment). The encouragement to suppress emotions in the workplace and the lack of recognition and support for emotional distress from hospital management had a negative effect on the personal lives of healthcare staff. The workplace expectations for healthcare workers to hide their negative emotions render such experiences invisible, and further leave staff to deal with such emotions alone. These findings are important for understanding how to effectively prepare healthcare workers to recognize and process emotions encountered in medical practice, and to make negative emotional experiences visible.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis seeks to determine the characteristics of a future forest bioeconomy that will contribute to the resilience of forestry communities across northeastern Ontario to inform bioeconomy development in the region.  A regional approach is taken to evaluate pathways for forest bioeconomy development over the near and long-term.  This approach is unique in that all potential energy and non-energy uses for available low quality forest biomass in northeastern Ontario are considered, as is the regional infrastructure and characteristics of the forest sector and available biomass.  Some (commonly studied) pathways were ruled out early based on information in the literature and the characteristics of the existing regional forest sector.  Other pathways were deemed promising and further analyzed within the regional context.  The analysis assesses the regional performance of different conversion pathways and specific technologies within them. &#xD;
Assessment of technologies for deployment in the near-term was done at the community level, using a case study approach to evaluate several options for displacing natural gas used primarily as heating fuel.  To assess pathways for advancing the forest bioeconomy over the long-term, a larger-scale regional method was applied to get a sense of what a coordinated approach to advanced biorefining might look like across eastern Canada.  The results of this analysis shed light on the type of advanced processing facilities that might be feasible in Northeastern Ontario and informed the analysis of advanced processing pathways.  As analysis of advanced conversion pathways progressed, it became clear that there was a lack of published information on advanced technologies that could be deployed in regions with a strong sawmilling sector but little pulp capacity, such as northeastern Ontario. Chapters 4 and 5 address gaps in knowledge that hinder further development while also providing insight into the economic feasibility and conversion characteristics and process improvements that could enhance feasibility.  Chapter 6 draws on the analysis in the previous chapters, and the deep body of resilience literature, to identify characteristics of a future forest bioeconomy that would maximize the resilience of communities across northeastern Ontario, and the forest sector upon which the region was built, over the near and long-term.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The dissertation seeks to examine systems of racialization that produce the “Indian Muslim” subaltern biologically, discursively, and historically while bearing in mind the material consequences for the group circumscribed within such frameworks. In the endeavor, the dissertation implicitly strives to reconsider the legacy of colonial vocabularies that have entered the mainstream consciousness of “South Asian Studies” and to interweave the approaches and frameworks of Subaltern Studies and Critical Race Studies via the site of the Indian Muslim. In particular the dissertation focuses on the structural, legal, and civic routes by which the pluralistic South Asian Muslim community was homogenized. Between 1947-1993, the enactment of polemical laws affected local Indian Muslim language rights, property ownership, gender relations, the occurrence of mass scale police violence, and notions of spirituality in Lucknow. Simultaneously the dissertation elicits the multiple strategies by which Muslims have resisted and deflected these processes. For both historicizing caste among Muslims and developing the salience of race as a category of analysis, this dissertation seeks to stage a major intervention in South Asian studies and histories of Islam across multiple scales – local, regional, national, and transnational.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With a growing shift of responsibility placed on educators to support the mental health needs of their student in addition to academic outcomes, teachers are in need of training to prepare them for this duty. This project has been developed in response to this need; its intention is to prepare Ontario elementary and secondary educators in supporting their students specifically with anxiety. Through the professional development of an additional qualifications course, this project seeks to provide educators with practical information on the manifestations, outcomes, and experiences of students with anxiety as well as strategies for supporting these students in the elementary and secondary classroom. The purpose of this project is to supply information about childhood and adolescent experiences of anxiety in language that is written for Ontario educators. The medium of an Ontario College of Teachers Additional Qualification course was used to create a formality that is recognized by Ontario practising teachers to entice educators to learn more about topics surrounding anxiety and feel better equipped to support the mental health needs of their students.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines two intersecting historical influences on Victorian supernatural fiction: commodity-driven cultures of object production and exchange, and discourses of nineteenth-century biological sciences. I argue that the appropriation of commodity-oriented and scientific languages in occult fiction and non-fiction coincided with a mass cultural shift in thought with regard to the soul, what it was made of in a material sense, and by extension, how it functioned. Authors were more and more drawn to spectral imageries that involved disassembly, reorientations of function, and fluid materiality that imagined the soul as something more readily preserved and made readable through material objects. As a result of Victorian commodity culture and professionalized science, depictions of spiritual and emotional transformations were more readily and complexly visualized as material exchanges that imbued the symbols of industrial and commodity-driven life with new relevance for ethical, spiritual life in the nineteenth century. Examining both the figure of the ghost as a site where boundaries between material and immaterial are often necessarily reinterpreted, and more abstract representations of the materialized soul such as the haunted portrait of Wilde’s Picture of Dorian Gray, this dissertation examines how supernatural fiction facilitated conversations pertaining to the adaptation of industrial and scientific life into a new imagined realm of ‘modern’ spiritual existence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this study is to describe youth presentation to the Emergency Department (ED) for alcohol-related issues.  Current alcohol-related research relies on self-reported data of individual-level alcohol consumption. While Canada and Ontario have reported stable population consumption rates, presentations to emergency departments and the costs associated with alcohol consumption have increased (Myran et. al. 2019 and; CSUCH, 2018).  This study is a chart review of patient visits for alcohol-related issues to the ED and Urgent Care Center at Kingston Health Sciences Center (KHSC) between September 1, 2013, and April 30, 2017.  All patients aged 12-24 who visited the ED and Urgent Care Center at KHSC for alcohol-related reasons were eligible for the study. An n= 2,479 of study eligible patients presented to KHSC over a four-year period for alcohol-related issues.  Young patients presenting for alcohol-related issues during the study period had an absolute increase of 1.37%.  Results suggest a conceptual split in the calendar between ‘ordinary’ drinking weeks and ‘ritualized drinking event dates’, and presentations in Kingston seem to follow a patterned trend that is connected to these ritualized dates. Ritualized drinking event dates in Kingston increased during the study period.  These dates comprise 4.6% of total days during the study period but account for 23.3% visits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Image-guided Interventions (IGI) have revolutionized medical practice and improved the quality of life for patients by enabling less invasive surgeries and treatments. Recent advancements in computing power and learning algorithms, e.g., Deep Learning (DL), have allowed automated learning-based systems to identify diseases with accuracies comparable to clinicians, adding further capabilities and potential to IGI. In a typical IGI, image registration methods are utilized to incorporate pre-operatively identified lesions/information into the intra-operative procedure. This makes image registration a fundamental part of IGI. Furthermore, learning algorithms are utilized in both improving pre-operative to intra-operative information integration as well as enhancing interpretation of intra-operative images, procedures, and guidance. &#xD;
&#xD;
The overall objective of this thesis is to identify and address several important considerations in each of these elements of IGI. In particular, for image registration, we propose solutions to enhance the explainability and interpretability of registration methods through a novel theoretical framework that connects the conventional information-theoretic based algorithms to the new deep metric-based methods; furthermore, we propose a new image registration approach based on deep probabilistic multi-class classifiers which can be utilized to estimate the uncertainty of registration. We test and evaluate our solutions in image registration on simulated neurosurgical data, and in a study using radiation therapy data from our local health sciences centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
To enhance the interpretation of intra-operative imaging, we propose an application of unsupervised representation learning that considers the vagaries and noisy nature of the gold-standard labeling in biopsy data. We demonstrate that by mapping biopsy samples with similar properties close to each other on a hyper-lattice, we are able to successfully cluster regions of malignant and benign tissue in the prostate. We also investigate different techniques for pre- and intra-operative information fusion through deep learning. We demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modality integration of information from MRI and ultrasound to improve prostate cancer detection. Our developed solutions enable the generation of cancer probability maps that can augment prostate biopsies and improve targeting of cancer foci. Finally, we develop an open-source browser-based framework to make the deployment of learning algorithms in IGI more accessible to practitioners and for educational purposes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High rates of deforestation and forest degradation occurring in many tropical and subtropical forest are major global environmental issues. Specifically, deforestation and forest degradation are significant issues within Tanzania due to the fundamental role forests play in supporting local livelihoods, and the significance of Tanzania’s forests in helping to mitigate climate change. This project uses the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to evaluate Tanzania’s National Forest Policy of 1998, Participatory Forest Management (PFM), and Reducing Emissions of Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) to determine if sustainable forest management is being achieved within the country. The project reveals that Tanzania’s forest protection policies and initiatives are inadequate in achieving sustainable forest management as they do not effectively address the key drivers of deforestation and forest degradation including uncontrolled subsistence agriculture, charcoal consumption, illegal logging, in migration, and climate change. Furthermore, I discuss several recommendations for improved sustainable forest management in Tanzania.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis investigated the phytoextraction of both organic and inorganic contaminants from two locations of Canada (Point Pelee National Park (PPNP), Ontario and Iqaluit, Nunavut). PPNP is a National Park that is highly contaminated with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dieldrin, arsenic and lead from historical agricultural and residential pesticide applications. Six planted native grass and weed species, and several naturally occuring species were analyzed for DDT, dieldrin, arsenic and lead in four contaminated plots of PPNP. A composting study was also completed to determine if composting of contaminated plant material is an effective and sustainable option for handling contaminated plant biomass. Of all plant species studied in PPNP, Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) was deemed to have the most potential for phytoextraction because it had a large biomass and accumulated high amounts of all four contaminants of interest. For this reason, it was selected for a follow-up greenhouse study. Two seed sources of A. gerardii (one commercial and one collected from PNPP) were grown in PPNP soil contaminated with DDT concentrations of 1,059 ng/g (low) and 5,071 ng/g (high). Mean levels of DDT in plant shoots were significantly higher (100.64 ± 33.09 ng/g) in the high contaminated soil but did not statistically differ in dieldrin, arsenic and lead concentrations between soil types. Seed source had no effect on phytoextraction potential.&#xD;
Mercury (Hg) concentrations within the Canadian Arctic are a current area of concern and research on merucry accumulation in terrestrial vegetation of the Arctic remains limited. Mercury levels in 24 soil samples, 23 plant, five lichen, and eight fungal (mushroom) species were assessed from eight locations in and around Iqaluit. Soil mercury levels across locations were not statistically different; however, median mercury concentrations of plant, lichen and fungi species ranged from 0.005 µg/g Hg dw in Saxifraga cernua (nodding saxifrage) to 1.6 µg/g in Lycoperdon perlatum (puffball). &#xD;
Overall, this thesis contributes new information on pesticide and metal phytoremediation in PPNP, demonstrating that phytoextraction by A. gerardii may be a suitable option to remediate contaminated soils in this National Park, and that phytoextraction by some Canadian Arctic vegetation may lead to elevated mercury concentrations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research presents an argument for situating shape grammars as the core component of drawing and design through observation, and as a core component for improving spatial reasoning and visual spatial perception, especially in the practice of geometry and its relationship with algebra. The research demonstrates the potential for drawing and design to be taught throughout the curriculum, especially at the primary level. As my results show, the craft is, at its essence, transdisciplinary and one that ties all subject matter together. Those who have championed the importance of skills such as sketching, drawing, and design as being integral to the visual arts, have had their words fall on deaf ears in both broad educational contexts and in art education itself which. In part, this is because there has been no real way to standardize a best practice for learning a technique that is ambiguous. My research addresses this head on through the development of the ESPIAL (Elucidating Six Points for Insight Analysis of Likeness) tool. The tool offers a standardized means to assess the drawing process without determination of outcome. This research consisted of a 10-week intervention with pre- and post-testing where students in Grade 3 and Grade 4 were taught to draw and design using shape grammars. This mixed methods study took place in four sites in and around Montréal, Québec, Canada. The results showed students improved in standardized tests that measured visual motor integration and spatial manipulation tasks. Qualitatively, this research demonstrated that the shape grammar approach improved children’s drawings substantially. Children were able to render what they saw with nuance and sophistication. In particular their ability to manipulate, interpret, and see in multiple perspectives calls into question notions of stage development theories that place cognitive limitations on children’s vision based on age alone.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Like hunger, food banks are widespread and found in nearly every community across Canada. The food bank model is an insufficient response to hunger and ignores the root cause of food insecurity: income. There is an increasingly popular approach to food security through a community food program model that has the potential to reduce stigma, build community, and challenge class divides. The purpose of this research is to examine community fresh food programming performed in Ontario’s small- and medium-sized urban areas. This includes determining what organizations run programming, the extent to which they operate, and the impact of fresh food programs. To answer these questions,  I compiled a database of organizations, administered phone surveys for those who participated in fresh food programming, performed in-depth interviews with select organizations, and acted as a participant observer to community food programs through my position as a Mitacs intern in Prince Rupert, BC. There were four major findings from this research. First, place is elemental to food work. Organizations often respond to place-based needs, and perform relationship-dependant, community-centred work at the local scale. Second, food can be used as a means to achieve other goals unrelated to food security and food insecurity, such as building food skills, bringing people together, building community, generating resiliency, breaking down barriers, building networks, increasing understanding of systemic issues, empowering people, and increasing civic engagement. Third, the actions of governments have a significant impact on the lives of people living in poverty and who are food insecure. Policy changes to social assistance and income are needed to eradicate food insecurity. Finally, food rescue is not a solution to either food waste nor food insecurity. Rather, food rescue is a resource drain for emergency food services in terms of time, energy, and finances. Food rescue acts as an ‘in the meantime’ solution that neglects to address the systemic cause of either issue. This study seeks to contribute to the literature on changing community food models. It also aims to inform policymakers of the challenges and areas for improvement within the charitable food and community food program sectors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Kinesins are the largest superfamily of microtubule-binding motor proteins in eukaryotic cells. All kinesins contain a motor domain that hydrolyzes ATP to power their directional movement along microtubules, or to catalyze the release of tubulin subunits from microtubule ends. These activities support essential functions such as vesicle and organelle transport, chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis, and regulation of microtubule dynamics for cell growth and division. The mitotic kinesin KIF14 is distinguished from other kinesins by a long N-terminal extension (NTE) (355 residues) of its motor domain that enables it to bind and bundle actin filaments. The ability of KIF14 to bind to actin is unusual because myosins have long been considered as the only cytoskeletal motors to act directly upon actin filaments. The actin binding ability of KIF14 appears to correlate with its co-localization within the actin-rich contractile ring at the cell midbody where it plays a vital, but undefined, role during cytokinesis. Accordingly, loss or disruption of KIF14 activity leads to cytokinesis failure. Conversely, KIF14 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis for multiple types of cancer. The first research aim of this thesis was to locate the binding sites of a panel of KIF14-selective inhibitors identified from a high-throughput screen. Unable to obtain crystal structures of the KIF14-inhibitor complexes, we used molecular docking to predict their interaction modes computationally. The docking software “Glide” identified a unique binding pocket between helix 2 and 3 of the KIF14 motor domain, which is directly adjacent to the site of ATP hydrolysis. Visual inspection and computational analysis of each inhibitor’s binding conformation enabled the design of a library of derivatives of these inhibitors; some of which were predicted to have improved affinity and specificity for KIF14 upon repeating the molecular docking workflow. The second aim was to understand how the NTE of KIF14 binds actin and affects actin filament structures. By systematically dissecting the human KIF14 NTE into a series of short polypeptide fragments, we were able to locate distinct microtubule- and actin-binding regions. By a combination of pyrene-actin polymerization assays and TIRF microscopy, we further identified the regions of the NTE that stimulate F-actin polymerization and F-actin bundling. We also obtained evidence that the NTE promotes actin polymerization by acting as an actin nucleation factor and an F-actin stabilizer. Interestingly, these abilities of the NTE are influenced by the microtubule-binding interactions of KIF14’s motor domain. These new insights provide the first building blocks of a molecular model that explains how KIF14 influences actin dynamics at the midzone during cytokinesis, and could help guide the development of strategies to inhibit KIF14 activities for the benefit of people living with cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arctic tundra vegetation structure profoundly affects ecosystem processes and climatic regulation. Therefore, there is a growing urgency for more accurate biogeochemical models to better understand how tundra vegetation will respond to ongoing major environmental changes, including rising temperatures, enhanced soil nutrient availability, and increased snowfall. The stoichiometric homeostasis model (the H model) - which quantifies the ability of an organism to maintain its internal elemental concentrations despite variation in the availabilities of these elements as resources - may provide valuable insights into vegetation-environment feedbacks, but its application in the Arctic has not previously been investigated. In this thesis, I used a two-step approach to first evaluate and then improve the H model for understanding the structure and functioning of a low Arctic plant community. First, I tested the applicability of the H model in the tundra context. Second, I improved the accuracy for determining the homeostatic H values by comparing two methods for estimating soil nutrient availabilities (ion exchange membrane (IEM) incubation versus soil sample extraction methods). Third, I examined the applicability of the H model in predicting key aspects of species’ ecological performances under various experimental manipulation conditions over two successive 6-year periods at both the individual species and community levels. The IEM method was superior to the extraction method in providing biologically meaningful soil nutrient data for modeling the H values. The H indicator based on nitrogen (N):phosphorus (P) ratio (HN:P) was a more robust homeostatic indicator than those based on either single element (HN or HP). Furthermore, variation in plant P rather than N stoichiometry drove much of the differences in HN:P. In terms of functioning, tundra species with relatively high HN:P values were more dominant, more temporally stable, and less responsive to the effects of environmental change on soil available P. Finally, communities with higher HN:P values also had more aboveground biomass. Together, these results highlight the value of using the combination of both N and P for a more complete understanding of homeostatic regulation, and validate the potential of using H values to predict tundra plant community structure and functioning in a rapidly changing environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hobbes was Britain’s quintessential atheist at the dawn of the eighteenth century, and Hobbism (a widely recognized creed) was commonly used to identify and police theological and ecclesiological heterodoxy. A competing interpretation of Hobbism emerged over the first fifty years of the century. “Enlightened” Hobbism, like the traditional variant, took advantage of Hobbes’s notoriety, but now in a social and civil context. This dissertation explores an aspect of Hobbes’s reception from 1700 to 1760. The primary focus is on the works of Shaftesbury, Mandeville, Hutcheson, and Archibald Campbell. An analysis of these early British moralists reveals that they participated in a shared project of portraying Hobbes as a pessimistic egoist in moral terms. This was in sharp contrast with the majority of authors who highlighted Hobbes’s materialism, determinism, Erastianism, and moral conventionalism, as indicators of heresy and atheism. These two variants of Hobbism did not exist in isolation. “Enlightened” Hobbism was first articulated by Shaftesbury following accusations that he was an atheist in Hobbesian terms. Mandeville, Hutcheson, and Campbell subsequently had to navigate their own proximity to “Enlightened” Hobbism. Atheistic Hobbism was most suitable for a British context still obsessed with identifying theological truth. But as the priorities of civil society shifted and moralists challenged the theological basis of ethical discourse, British divines also had recourse to “Enlightened” Hobbism when justifying the necessity of the Church, God, and particular providence in the terms of civil prudence and utility. The primary goal of this dissertation is to explore the deployment of Hobbes and Hobbism in the moral discourse by these two groups: those who interpret morality through the lens of theology and the otherworldly, and those who view it as a fundamentally human endeavour. But this analysis also identifies a significant characteristic of the early British Enlightenment. As much as Enlightenment moralists forcefully distanced themselves from Hobbes, by rooting morality firmly in the human experience they contributed to the Hobbesian project of wresting authority from the Church and the otherworldly.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Anthropogenic activities have led to widespread of heavy metal contaminants such cadmium and arsenic. When left untreated, they pose risk to both human and ecosystem health as well as further reduce arable lands. Phytoremediation, which is the use of plants and their associated microorganisms to clean up such contaminants, is environmentally friendly and cost effective. Fast-growing trees such as Populus sp. are good candidates for phytoremediation because of their tolerance to heavy metals, high biomass and their distribution across much of the northern hemisphere. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying poplar’s phytoremediation are poorly understood. Although Populus is a model tree species, with a sequenced genome and many genetic and genomic resources, the identification of genes for important tree traits is still slower than in other model plants such as Arabidopsis. This study uses a functional genomics approach to identify genes related to phytoremediation by taking advantage of a large collection of activation tagged poplars (Populus tremula x P. alba hybrid 717-1B4) created by Dr. Sharon Regan’s Lab. After screening over 1700 independent transgenic lines for characteristics that could affect the phytoremediation, seven mutants had altered root biomass whereas 15 mutants had altered response to heavy metals. Of the seven root phenotypes identified, two previously studied mutants, called rippled leaf and adventitious root were further investigated. RT-qPCR analysis showed an up-regulation of CYCLIND1;2 and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase XBAT32/33 in the roots of rippled leaf and adventitious root mutants respectively. The upregulation of CYCLIND1;2 is suspected to increase the root biomass through accelerated cell cycle division. XBAT32/33 on the other hand is suspected to promote the production of lateral roots through the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. Altogether, this study provides a starting point in the quest to discover key genes responsible for phytoremediation and could lead ultimately to the development of biomarkers for selection of superior trees from natural population for clean-up purposes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Spreading depolarization (SD) is neurological phenomenon that results in the depression of neural activity and is found in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems. SD is characterized as a propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization. In invertebrate models this leads to complete neuromuscular shutdown. SD has been investigated in mammalian models for decades, as it is associated with many human pathologies including stroke, migraine and traumatic brain injury, however its occurrence in insects has only recently been determined. In the African migratory locust, L. migratoria, SD is associated with entry into a reversible stress-induced coma. Although there are many physiological differences in CNS properties between mammals and insects, the characteristics of SD remain consistent. For my thesis I used pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches to investigate the occurrence of SD in L. migratoria in response to anoxia. I characterized the variation in anoxic coma induction and recovery using three methods of anoxia, CO2 and N2 gas, and water immersion. These results showed that water immersion had increased coma induction and recovery times, whereas CO2 lead to shorter induction times and intermediate recovery times. I conclude that water immersion and N2 gas are the most useful methods of anoxic coma induction for future investigations. Additionally, I investigated the role of adenosine and adenosine receptor manipulation on coma recovery. Mammalian research shows that adenosine contributes to delayed synaptic recovery following SD. My results show that adenosine does delay recovery, however caffeine, as an adenosine receptor antagonist, decreased recovery times in whole animals and increased recovery times in semi-intact preparations. I investigated the potential pathways of adenosine receptor activation, exploring both cAMP and ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel activation and inhibition. These results show that cAMP activation and KATP inhibition increased time to recover. Given these results, I discuss the similarity with mammalian findings and consider how this information contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In City of God Augustine refers to the theatre as a “pestilence” on the morals of the Roman people. Further, he devotes a large portion of the third book of the Confessions to outlining his own sinful experiences with the theatre and a Platonic attack on the poetical arts. From these passages in his two most famous works it would be reasonable to see theatre as incompatible with an Augustinian worldview. However, by expanding upon O’Connell’s Art and the Christian Intelligence in St. Augustine, Smith’s “Staging the Incarnation: Revisioning Augustine’s Critique of Theatre”, and Drever’s “Entertaining Violence: Augustine on the Cross of Christ and the Commercialization of Suffering”, this study shows that a complete condemnation of the theatre cannot be sustained in light of the wider Christian framework within which Augustine operates. This thesis begins by examining the similarities between Plato and Augustine’s critiques of theatre on both ethical and ontological grounds. Having established that the basis of their attack lies in three elements: imitation, the emotions, and material images, an exploration of Augustine’s views on material creation, the Incarnation, Resurrection, and human persona shows that neither the emotions nor material images can be condemned on the Platonic assumption that their natures are inherently corrupting; in fact, both of these are shown to be moral goods that, while liable to corruption because of the Fall, are innately good. Given that they are moral goods, it becomes possible to make room in Augustine for the possibility of a ‘redeemed theatre’ where the mimetic imitation inherent to the theatrical arts is not a moral hindrance but a devotional aid. Indeed, Augustine’s use of theatrical elements in his own writing points to the efficacy of this method of evangelization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work investigates the use of self-supervised learning for ECG-based affective computing. We propose a novel self-supervised ECG representation learning framework to address the limitations of fully-supervised learning. Our proposed framework is developed using four popular ECG-affect datasets that contain a wide variety of emotional attributes such as arousal, valence, stress, and others, collected in different experimental settings. Our proposed solution achieves promising results and sets new state-of-the-art in classifying affect in all four datasets. We present interesting insights regarding our proposed framework and analyze the relationship between the self-supervised tasks and emotion recognition. Further, we explore the concept of self-supervised affective computing and utilize the framework in an applied setting. To this end, we collect ECG and affect data from medical practitioners during a trauma simulation study, and utilize our proposed self-supervised framework for classification of cognitive load and levels of expertise, achieving great results and outperform fully supervised solutions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Practical applications of portable and wearable electronics is linked with the development of power sources that address the physical requirements of these electronic devices, such as flexibility and a small footprint. In this work, we report on the development of several promising power sources for microdevices and flexible electronics. We fabricate microbattery on a glass substrate because this is a well-defined material and very similar to silicon, a standard material for micro-electro-mechanical systems. However, the miniaturization of a nickel/metal hydride cell requires a different method of fabrication than that of macroscale batteries. Microfabrication techniques including electrodeposition, e-beam evaporation, and magnetron sputtering can be used to fabricate the electrodes of a microbattery. Thus, we introduce a process for the deposition of intermetallic thin-film alloy on a glass substrate. We use this technique for the fabrication of a coplanar thin-film Nickel-Metal hydride microbattery with a gel electrolyte. The performance of the electrodes and the device is evaluated using electrochemical methods, including cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.&#xD;
This work also presents the fabrication of a supercapacitor made by printing and reduction of graphene oxide inks. A leavening agent is added to enhance the capacity of the electrodes. The effect of the leavening agent electrode capacitance of the electrodes is investigated in terms of material characterization and electrochemical performance.&#xD;
Finally, we introduce a novel hybrid battery supercapacitor based on the combination of a self-assembled graphene hydrogel that encapsulates a vanadium solution. The electrochemical characterization of device shows that the hydrogel combines the high specific surface area of the reduced graphene oxide and the redox activity of the vanadium ions, leading to a specific capacity of 200 mAh/g. This power source can be operated as a supercapacitor, as a battery, or as a hybrid, depending on the operating conditions. Its unique power-handling capabilities depend on the rate of discharge which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. Additionally, this device offers further significant advantages, including fast charging capability (10 minutes), high durability, and mechanical flexibility.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infection of the endocardium. Available evidence on the comparative effect of medical versus surgical treatment of IE is limited by systematic error. It is unclear if surgery, when compared with medical treatment, is protective against long-term mortality. &#xD;
Objectives: 1) To complete a systematic review of the published studies that compare the effect of surgical versus medical IE treatment (modelled as time-dependent) on mortality. 2) To examine the effect of bias on the observed apparent long-term protective effect of surgery. 3) To determine whether surgical treatment of IE improves survival when compared to medical treatment. &#xD;
Methods: Using a retrospective population-based cohort study design, the effect of surgical versus medical treatment of IE on mortality was explored using advanced methods to examine and correct for bias including marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting, time-dependent exposure and confounders and the creation of adjusted survival curves. &#xD;
Results: The study cohort included 16,380 adult Ontarians with IE. In models with time-dependent treatment and confounders, the average risk of mortality at 30 days was increased in patients who underwent surgical versus medical treatment, (HR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.01-1.47), while those who underwent surgery had a decreased risk of mortality at one year (HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.67-0.84) when compared to those treated medically.&#xD;
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that bias in published studies likely contributed to the discrepant evidence of surgical versus medical treatment on survival. We are also the first to show the effect of time-dependent confounding in IE research, and that the effect of time-dependent confounding may vary between males and females. Future research into the effect of surgical versus medical treatment of IE on mortality should aim to limit three important sources of bias present in previously published IE studies: immortal time bias, selection bias, and time-dependent confounding.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is widely recognized that access to greenspace benefits the residents of urban centres in many ways. Correlations between access to greenspace and lowered rates of both mental and physical health issues have been shown in several studies. The health benefits of public greenspace are more notable in lower income areas where residents have less access to private greenspace. While there is a great deal of scholarship showing that higher income areas have greater access to greenspace, there has been little quantitative research on how much parks are used and how parks are used. This thesis involves the study of three Toronto parks and a methodological critique of park studies. My first chapter reports findings from 331 hours of observations of park use in Toronto’s Regent, Dovercourt, and Rosedale parks. Park users were categorized and tallied by use type (Leisure, sports/fitness, petcare, childcare, transit). I consider the socioeconomic status of each park’s neighbourhood, park facilities (benches, sports facilities, washrooms, playgrounds, etc), tree canopy coverage, weather, and seasonality. My second chapter concerns the physical design of parks centering on seating and its role in social infrastructure. The final chapter is a critique of the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) method used in previous studies of park use. My research demonstrates the importance of passive park use when planning for public health and I conclude with a number of suggestions for improving park planning processes and the study of public parks.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Beginning in 1883, Ontario was the first, and for many decades the only province in Canada that has continuously provided kindergarten as part of a public education. In 2010, Ontario made another innovative policy decision and introduced a new model of kindergarten, the Full-Day Early Learning–Kindergarten program (FDELK), extended to a two-year, full day play-based program instructed by a team of educators including a kindergarten teacher and an early childhood educator. Ontario is a leader in Canada in the field of publicly funded early childhood education and represents an interesting case of a program that has gone through many stages before reaching its current point. The success in establishing kindergarten may offer compelling evidence leading to changes to early years education policy in other jurisdictions. Although Ontario’s kindergarten has an almost 150 year history, it is scarcely represented in literature, especially its development between the 1960s and 2010. This thesis will attempt to fill this gap by analysing selected documents to trace the development of Ontario’s public kindergarten from its inception to the current FDELK, and will identify the evolving characteristics of kindergarten, trends, and paradigmatic changes in the analyzed period by using a longue durée approach and Quentin Skinner’s theoretical framework and his theory of interpretation. Using this method, this study explores the historical and intellectual foundations of the FDELK, power dynamics influencing the development of kindergarten, and the intersection of political agendas, ideologies, and economic and pragmatic considerations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This project proposes a professional development framework that encompasses multidimensional institutional support to graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) to enhance the level of their pedagogical knowledge and skills. This framework will provide institutional stakeholders with a tool to anticipate the essential needs for GTA support and tailor needed professional development activities to heighten the quality of their undergraduate teaching practices. Many of these GTAs will provide Canada with a pool of future faculty members who will be key players in the national higher education system in the near future; their pedagogical competence will thus be reflected in their teaching and instructional practices.&#xD;
For the implementation of this project, I ran a training needs assessment, in which I collected data from faculty members and students using a faculty survey and faculty, undergraduate and graduate student interviews. The needs assessment showed a wide spectrum of training needs: learning and assessment theories, evaluation techniques, language barriers, cultural differences, communication skills, stage fright, and professionalism. &#xD;
Informed by the training needs assessment and the available literature on the pedagogical professional development of GTAs, I developed a multidimensional framework, Teaching Assistants Professional Development (TAPD) program, which was adapted from Bronfenbrenner’s ecological theory. This model eencompasses five dimensions: individual, microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. The proposed framework identifies the pedagogical needs of GTAs and provides tools for meeting these needs in order to enhance the quality of undergraduate teaching practices and responsibilities. &#xD;
Mapping TAPD to the institutional available training options showed a need for departmental training programs that support the GTAs’ pedagogical content knowledge in a relatively short period of time and starts a community of practice among the GTAs. The project was implemented for two consecutive years in four departments, and plans for future trainings are laid. The main limitation of disseminating these departmental training programs is the financial commitment the departments must incur to have it as a mandatory training. &#xD;
I appended this project document with a bibliography that includes a comprehensive collection of seminal work that tackles different perspectives of teaching assistants’ professional development.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The emergence and persistence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs), comprising multiple toxicity-producing cyanobacteria genera, pose great threats to aquatic environments, to many native species, and to human health. However, recent CHAB monitoring systems using traditional methods lack the ability to detect cyanobacterial blooms at their earliest stages and thus to predict actual cyanobacterial risks. The sequencing of cyanobacterial genomes led to the description of gene clusters responsible for cyanotoxin production, which paved the way for the use of these genes as targets for PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR). qPCR shows a great potential for detecting, monitoring, and even predicting future CHABs. In my study, I evaluated the use of qPCR in CHAB monitoring and early warning. I reviewed the studies that reported the detection of microcystin genes in natural populations from 2002 to 2019. These suggested that qPCR serves as a rapid and convenient method for monitoring the abundance of toxigenic and non-toxigenic populations of harmful algal species. I found that the variation in the proportion of cells bearing Microcystis mcy genes to Microcystis 16S gene (toxigenic Microcystis to total Microcystis) was usually stable across water bodies in the range of 20%. I discuss the possible issues associated with contradictory findings in the literature, present methodological limitations, and consider the use of qPCR as an indicator of CHAB risk. In addition to this literature review, I conducted field research on Dog Lake and three experimental ponds in the environs of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. At both sites, I did long-term monitoring and found seasonal variation in Microcystis abundance. I found large differences in the mcyE/16S proportions between Dog Lake and the experimental ponds, which averaged approximately 30% and 1%, respectively. Among the three experimental ponds, I found that proportion was related to the abundance of Viviparus georgianus (the banded mystery snail). My experimental study verified the effectiveness of qPCR for long-term monitoring of the abundance of toxigenic and non-toxigenic Microcystis. My results also supported the hypothesis that the proportion of toxigenic Microcystis to total Microcystis is stable in particular water bodies at least across one year. Moreover, I quantified the Microcystis overwintering distribution pattern under the ice cover in winter. I found that the abundance of Microcystis decreased with increasing depth and that the proportion of toxigenic Microcystis to total Microcystis did not change between winter and incoming summer. In shallow water, the benthic Microcystis abundance in winter was consistently similar to pelagic Microcystis abundance in spring, where I assumed that benthic overwintering Microcystis played significant roles in subsequent CHABs. I concluded that the quantification of Microcystis genes and the proportion of toxigenic Microcystis to total Microcystis could serve as new indicators to estimate the potential toxicity of future CHABs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) Calls to Action report demands the better preparation of teachers to deliver Indigenous content (2015, p. 7). A major problem is that non-Indigenous teachers have not been adequately trained to teach Indigenous students (Bissell &amp; Korteweg, 2016). The lack of Indigenous cultural knowledge and perspectives among teachers has been identified as a significant factor in the limited achievement of Indigenous students in the Canadian public-school system (Kanu, 2005). Non-Indigenous teachers require appropriate historical, cultural, and place-based knowledge to build positive relationships with Indigenous students and families who have been and continue to be silenced, marginalized, or failed by institutions that reproduce settler-colonial relationships through Eurocentric curriculum, texts, and teaching methods (Battiste, 2013). The purpose of this grounded study is to describe the expectations the Indigenous community has of non-Indigenous teachers in a northern Saskatchewan context, and to explore why some non-Indigenous teachers make long-term commitments. A post-colonial Indigenous research paradigm informs the study that is framed by decolonizing theory (Chilisa, 2012) and a de/colonizing theory of reconciliation (Madden, 2019). First Nations and Métis Elders and teachers in the study have asked non-Indigenous teachers to support Indigenous students by engaging in learning about students’ worldview and cultural identities, the historical context of the area, and systemic racism in education. Non-Indigenous teachers have been encouraged to continuously reflect to address personal privileges, biases, and assumptions that inform their relationship to the territory and its people. By respecting and including the community in students’ learning experiences, non-Indigenous teachers can form positive relationships with students that foster wellbeing. Student achievement should be locally defined and can be supported with collaborative goal setting and ongoing, respectful feedback. Indigenous content and perspectives should be taught every day, in meaningful, accurate, and positive ways, using appropriate resources from Indigenous sources and domains of knowledge, with the inclusion of land-based learning. Non-Indigenous teacher participants relocated to teach in northern Saskatchewan and have stayed for a minimum of five years; they have attributed their long-term commitment to a willingness to learn, community-mindedness, and positive relationships with the students and the land.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A significant barrier to players’ enjoyment of video games is the competitive nature of many multiplayer games. It can be difficult for people with different abilities to enjoy playing together. Player balancing (such as aim assistance) helps people of varying abilities play together by adjusting game mechanics. Player balancing is particularly important in games where differences in fine motor ability can have large impact on game outcomes, and in making games accessible to people with motor disabilities. The focus of this thesis is to determine whether aim assistance can reduce the barriers to group play with children who have cerebral palsy. We did this by evaluating whether aim assistance significantly reduces differences in player performance, and whether aim assistance negatively affects player perceptions of fairness and fun. Our evaluation involved a two-step process. The first step was a six-day study of a novel aim assistance algorithm with eight children with cerebral palsy. We tested the impact of this algorithm on balancing, player behaviour, and player perceptions through its incorporation in a two-player competitive aiming game. Our second step involved a qualitative evaluation with 18 pairs of typically developed adults of a revised game that implemented two improvements to the aim assistance algorithm. Our aim assistance algorithm did not significantly reduce the gap in player performance in a video game for children with cerebral palsy. However, it did reduce the difference in players’ scores in heavily imbalanced (“blowout”) games between players with different levels of fine motor ability levels. Aim assistance was generally viewed positively in social play settings and, players reported it had a positive impact on their play experience. We also found that game elements that draw attention to aim assistance need to be designed with attention to colour. When applying visual effects, players need to be informed of their purpose to make use of them effectively.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation sought to further our understanding of the nature of leadership by developing and investigating a novel construct: a passion for leadership. In Study 1, I developed a dualistic model of a passion for leadership by distinguishing between a harmonious and an obsessive passion for leadership. Harmonious passion for leadership involves an intense, controllable desire to engage in leadership thereby creating a flexible form of persistence. In contrast, obsessive passion for leadership reflects an intense, incessant need to engage in leadership such that activity involvement is considered rigid. Then, across 7 studies involving 9 separate samples, I developed a reliable and valid measure of a passion for leadership, in which the harmonious and obsessive passion for leadership demonstrated internal and temporal stability and manifested content, construct, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent-related validity. Study 2 extended the first study by testing whether the passion for leadership is psychometrically invariant across groups. In particular, I investigated whether the factor structure of the passion for leadership was equivalent across biological sex (male vs. female) and country (USA vs. China). Two separate cross-sectional online surveys were conducted with leaders for each group. The results demonstrated that, for both sex and country, the passion for leadership measure was partially invariant. Based on the dualistic model of a passion for leadership, Study 3 examined whether harmonious and obsessive passion for leadership predict transformational leadership and abusive supervision, respectively. I also investigated the moderating role of gender. Within the context of a laboratory-based experiment, the findings showed that priming harmonious passion for leadership led to higher levels of transformational leadership; in contrast, priming an obsessive passion for leadership had no effect on abusive supervision. Furthermore, gender did not moderate the effects of harmonious or obsessive passion for leadership on either transformational leadership or abusive supervision, respectively. I close this dissertation with a general discussion of the three studies and recommendations for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Student-athletes represent a unique group of individuals that must balance their academic goals with their athletic pursuits in a high performance sport context. Coaches play a significant role in helping athletes achieve in both contexts, which involves extensive planning and preparation beforehand in order to create an environment for student-athlete success. This study used a foundational concept from the industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology literature to investigate the necessary conditions that interuniversity sport coaches implemented prior to and during a competitive season to facilitate performance for both their individual athletes and the collective team. Using a case-study approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with five U Sports head coaches from soccer, cross-country running, ice hockey and basketball before and at the end of their seasons. As a way to triangulate information obtained from coaches and to enrich my understanding of the particular conditions discussed, I also interviewed student-athletes from each team (n = 5) and the High Performance Director who manages this particular U Sports Athletics program. The data were analyzed thematically to highlight the necessary conditions specific to each coach and their individual athletes, and were then generalized across all teams within the broader athletics program. The five conditions discussed with coaches are described in detail: (1) create a team vision with clear objectives, (2) opt for athletes of best fit, (3) assemble team roles and expectations, (4) confirm and allocate necessary resources and support, and (5) have competent and prepared team coaching. Within each condition, I first provide support for their relevance and importance based on participant responses, followed by strategies for how to implement conditions in practice. Lastly, and perhaps of most significance, I discuss considerations of the broader context within which these teams are situated, as well as at the case level for the conditions established. Both research and practical implications emanating from this thesis are discussed in Chapter 5.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work aimed to develop a simple, two-sensor system to measure gait efficiency and stability. The system was tested by measuring the compromised gait pattern of 15 healthy adults (aged 18-30). The gait pattern was altered by forcing participants to walk on their toes on their right side using an ankle-foot orthotic (AFO) and heel wedges. There were 5 conditions: a control condition, a zero AFO condition (AFO with no restrictions or wedges), and a low (5 degrees of plantar flexion), medium (15 degrees of plantar flexion) and high (25 degrees of plantar flexion) wedge conditions. Participants were instrumented with two-sensors, one on their low back, and the other attached to their head, as well as motion tracking markers placed on landmarks of the lower limbs and a motion tracking marker on each sensor.  Participants completed ten, 7-meter, walking trials under each condition. Four outcome variables were calculated, two for efficiency and two for stability. The outcome variables were calculated from the movements of the low back and the head and the relationship between them. Repeated measures MANOVAs (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) found an overall decrease in gait efficiency and stability with increasing plantar flexion angle. There was no significant interaction between measurement tool and condition, suggesting that the sensors measured changes in the outcome variables that were similar to those measured by the motion capture system. This work is the first step in the validation of a simple two-sensor system to measure efficiency and stability of gait. Efficiency and stability are two objective and clinically relevant variables that when combined with the tests presently used in clinic will give a more holistic view of an individual’s gait.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Applications of deep learning using text have shown wide success in detecting human emotions, analyzing social media feeds, classifying text and creating compressed representations. While deep learning has been widely applied across numerous domains, researchers have only begun to apply these techniques to the field of law. Recently, researchers have shown success in utilizing attention-based models for predicting criminal charges using unstructured text as an input. The legal field poses many challenges such as having a small amount of legal data available in Canada, the verbosity of judgements, the legal-jargon used in judgements, and the subjectivity of outcomes. In the medical domain, we have seen breakthroughs using machine learning to predict diseases using physicians' notes and classifying patients using ICD-9 codes. Unfortunately, many of the state-of-the-art systems required expensive hand-annotated labels that are often unobtainable. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this work we investigated the prediction of reasonable notice and the identification of similar cases for personal injury in the field of law, and the prediction of PTSD in the medical domain. High costs in litigation currently create a barrier for the majority of Canadians. We believe with a deep learning approach for the prediction of reasonable notice, we can help people weigh the costs of their legal options with the potential outcomes. Similarly, in personal injury, identifying previous judgements with similar plaintiffs would help legal practitioners and laypeople anchor their expectations of damages. Lastly, intelligent systems in the field of medicine can help medical professionals provide a better patient care through the prediction of future complications. &#xD;
&#xD;
For our legal research we utilized numerous attention-based models and pretrained models with legal judgement summaries typed by humans as input. The out-of-the-box pretrained RoBERTa model performed the best with a 69% accuracy. We believe our work approaches the upper-echelon of performance given the subjective nature of judges and the variability in outcomes. RoBERTa, modified with two classification layers, yielded the best qualitative results for identifying similar cases in personal injury. Lastly, the need for manual validation in our medical research led us to demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a weakly-supervised approach.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Environmental hypoxia is a phenomenon in which low oxygen conditions force organisms to respond behaviourally and physiologically to survive in an otherwise lethal habitat. Animals display different mechanisms to cope with the harsh living conditions of a hypoxic environment, most of which can be summarized as: (i) improvement of oxygen transport capacity, (ii) improvement of oxygen storage, and (iii) supply of energy via anaerobic metabolism. Daphnia respond to hypoxia by increasing the expression of extracellular hemoglobin (Hb), an oxygen transport/storage protein. It is generally thought that this upregulation is used as a strategy to sustain sufficient oxygenation to tissues, allowing Daphnia to stay systemically normoxic even when the environment is hypoxic. Although the changes/differences in Hb levels have been studied in many contexts, very little has been done exploring the basic properties of energy metabolism in Daphnia. My focus was on the link between the Hb response and the metabolic phenotype. I sampled different Daphnia species from 20 lakes in the Frontenac Arch Biosphere. The resulting metabolite analyses support the idea that the benefit of Hb is facilitating oxygen delivery rather than to increase oxygen storage. I found a distinct lack of coordination in the responses of the glycolytic enzymes relative to Hb. Daphnia pulicaria from four lakes appeared to demonstrate one of two strategies in relation to coordination of glycolytic genes and Hb. In some lakes D. pulicaria showed a pronounced induction of Hb without changes in glycolytic enzymes, whereas other lakes showed a blunted Hb response but pronounced glycolytic response. Serial sampling showed the Hb response early in the season (May-June) and a glycolytic response later in the season (September- October). Further studies should include transcriptome analyses exploring if lake-by-lake differences are due to microevolutionary variation or phenotypic responses to different degrees and durations of oxygen stress.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Housing is a basic need that many Canadians struggle to obtain. While some Canadians cannot afford private market housing costs, others require additional services or supports to help ensure a stable tenancy and allow them to live independently and with dignity. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this report, supportive housing was defined as affordable housing that is safe and secure, while providing access to support staff and services to enhance independent living. Supportive services are often flexible in nature, dependent on the needs of the individual, and can have many different forms. &#xD;
&#xD;
This report examined two aspects of supportive housing: 1.) The development of new affordable housing; and 2.) The supportive services offered upon the completion and operation of housing. &#xD;
&#xD;
Seven supportive housing case study projects were examined through a comparative case study analysis. The projects are from British Columbia and Ontario because these two provinces have the most serious housing affordability issues with high and rising rents, low vacancy rates, and large waiting lists for social housing. A profile was created for each project and key findings were synthesized and compared between the two provinces. The case studies are:&#xD;
•	Karen’s Place, Ottawa, ON &#xD;
•	Parkdale Landing, Hamilton, ON &#xD;
•	Tony Di Pede Affordable Housing Complex, Toronto, ON &#xD;
•	Dryden Urban Indigenous Homeward Bound, Dryden, ON &#xD;
•	The Budzey Building, Vancouver, BC &#xD;
•	Camas Gardens, Victoria, BC &#xD;
•	New Jubilee House, Vancouver, BC &#xD;
&#xD;
Since 2017, housing organizations have been looking for funding under the NHS. Opportunities for funding under the NHS for supportive housing were explored in this report. &#xD;
&#xD;
This report demonstrates lessons learned and provides a spectrum of evidence-based best practices from existing supportive housing developments. The following questions are addressed in this report.&#xD;
1. What are the existing models for development of affordable supportive housing? &#xD;
2. What are the success factors to facilitate this type of development? &#xD;
3. To what extent are these models and success factors aligned with the new funding opportunities under the NHS for supportive affordable housing?</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is composed of three studies that examined the relationship between early adolescents’ sexual harassment experiences (as targets, witnesses, and perpetrators) and the peer environments in which they are embedded. Taking a feminist-developmental perspective, these studies explored peer-contextual predictors of sexual harassment perpetration, as well as psychosocial correlates of perpetration and victimization. Students in Grades 7 and 8 (n = 435 participants at Time 1; n = 370 at Time 2) completed self-report measures of sexual harassment perpetration, victimization, witnessing, psychosocial functioning, and peer social networks at two time points, about four months apart. Study 1 examined cross-sectional associations among sexual harassment victimization, shame, and depressive symptoms, and explored how witnessing sexual harassment might affect these associations. Study 2 examined individual and peer contextual predictors of sexual harassment perpetration. Finally, Study 3 examined psychosocial consequences of sexual harassment perpetration, and explored how individuals’ social power might impact their experiences. The results of these studies suggest that peers play a complex role in the development of sexual harassment, and in predicting perpetrators’ and targets’ psychosocial responses to these behaviours. Findings can inform the development of effective intervention programs at the middle school level, with implications for preventing sexual harassment and mitigating its consequence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nutrient loading is an important factor that can indirectly deplete dissolved oxygen concentrations in lakes. In environments where seabirds nest and breed, guano is a prominent source of nutrients that can eutrophy waterbodies. Such external nutrient inputs may deplete bottom-water oxygen, resulting in shifts in bottom-water invertebrate communities that are sensitive to changes in oxygen. Chironomidae (non-biting midges) can be used as paleolimnological indicators to infer changes in past oxygen conditions due to their sensitivity to oxygen concentration, excellent preservation in sediments and abundance. I assessed the long-term changes in subfossil chironomid assemblages linked to reconstructed changes in the seabird colony size of the Leach’s Storm-Petrel in ponds located off the Canadian East coast on Baccalieu Island, Newfoundland, and Grand Colombier Island, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, France, to qualitatively reconstruct past changes in dissolved oxygen conditions, and thereby indirectly infer changes in colony size. Ornithological surveys indicate declines in the Leach’s Storm-Petrel colony in Newfoundland since the 1980s, whereas the colony in Saint Pierre and Miquelon is believed to be stable or increasing, albeit based on limited observational data. Using dated sediment cores from seabird-impacted lakes, I isolated chironomid head capsules, taxonomically identified them to the genus level, and determined their abundance and diversity. Using the chironomid assemblages, I qualitatively inferred lake oxygen conditions over the past ~1700 and ~5700 years on Baccalieu Island and Grand Colombier Island, respectively. Furthermore, I investigated if the timing of changes in chironomid-inferred oxygen coincided with known occurrences of seabird-derived inputs in the lakes’ catchments, as determined by surveys and other paleolimnological proxies. The chironomid data provides novel information on past oxygen levels in the lakes. In both sites, chironomid assemblages indirectly tracked past changes in the storm-petrel colony size, and their more recent declines. These data, alongside several paleolimnological proxies, will be used to determine the long-term natural variability and dynamics of Leach’s Storm-Petrel populations. This research provides data required to implement informed conservation and management strategies. Moreover, understanding the background conditions and responses of lakes to nutrient loading provides insights on the effects and tolerance of lakes to disturbance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A multiplexed approach to multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy is presented.  Numerous modifications were made to a home-built Hadamard-Transform Excitation-Emission Matrix (EEM) spectrometer resulting in a greatly improved spectral resolution of 5.3 nm, at a data acquisition rate of over 6 EEM spectra per minute. In addition, provisions were made to simultaneously record optical transmission spectra with the 3D EEM spectra. Integration of the spectrometer into a custom-designed stopped-flow injection device allowed for the simultaneous collection of UV/Vis absorbance and fluorescence EEM spectra of reacting solutions. &#xD;
With this optimized configuration, over 8400 EEM spectra were collected while performing two kinetic studies on two rapidly evolving chemical reactions with multiple overlapping spectral components. Improved reproducibility reduced the uncertainty of kinetic rate constants from 40% to 4%. The third-order rate constant for the demetallation of chlorophyll-a to pheophytin-a was experimentally determined to be 611±20 ×102 M-2∙s-1 as derived from a parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis where absorbance and fluorescence data were combined. A PARAFAC analysis of data collected from the insertion of a copper atom into pheophytin-a resulted in several absorbing components and only a single fluorescence component. A reaction model with a pre-association complex and sitting-a-top (SAT) complex as intermediates explained the absorbance data resulting in a sequence of second-order reactions with rate constants of 4.03 ± 0.2 M-1 s-1,  2.71 ± 0.2 M-1 s-1, and 0.28±0.02 s-1∙M-1, respectively. The rate constant of fluorescence decay was determined to be 1.7±0.1 M-1∙s-1 which is consistent with the fluorescence signal being a combination of the pheophytin-a and the pre-association complex.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the literature of moral progress, there is an ongoing debate over the role of moral reasoning in enabling large-scale behavioural change. On the one hand, rationalists argue that more and better moral reasoning is key to overcoming moral ignorance, which is believed to undergird many problematic social practices. More specifically, many of them claim that monological introspection is the best form of moral reasoning. By abstracting oneself from the reality distorted by biasing emotions and arbitrary conventions, one is best able to identify objective moral truths. On the other hand, skeptics argue that moral reasoning often subverts moral progress by rationalizing and reinforcing the biased status quo.  Objectivity, on their view, is an illusion. Moral progress, if it exists, is to be pursued by nonrational means.&#xD;
&#xD;
My thesis makes two contributions to the debate. First, I argue that we need not be skeptical of the progressive force of moral reasoning in reforming moral judgements (and the moral norms that embody them). Drawing on the empirical literature on motivated moral reasoning, I argue that while motivational biases are indeed often resistant to individual introspection, they can be reliably and effectively identified and corrected if we adopt a discursive and accountable form of moral reasoning. Second, I argue that by focusing exclusively on moral reasoning, both rationalists and skeptics miss a more important question, which is the role of social reasoning in reforming social judgements (and the social norms that embody them). This neglect is problematic because (a) social judgments, not moral judgments, guide the majority of social practices; and (b) social judgments can rarely be revised by impartial moral reasoning alone as they have a distinctly group-normative logic. To fill the gap in the literature, I develop a new normative model of social reasoning that guides groups to revise their group norms, using group-rational attitudes such as solidarity, trust, and trustworthiness. The upshot is that to advance moral progress, not only do we need impartial moral reasoning, we also need partial social reasoning.</dcterms:abstract>

CAN is considered as a de facto standard for efficient communication of an embedded control system network. However, it has no built-in security features. In this thesis, the existing security solutions for the CAN protocol found in the literature are classified in terms of security enforcement procedures. The classification can facilitate the researchers to select an appropriate security technique depending on security requirements. We also propose a security framework to secure CAN communication using the Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD). The framework ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of CAN data transmission. The experimental results show that the delay of the proposed approach can be reduced to 0.07 ms depending on hardware configurations. We consider it lightweight since it adds a low overhead regardless of performing encryption and authentication. We evaluate the approach using four metrics: communication overhead, network traffic load, cost of deployment, and compatibility with CAN specification. We show that the framework keeps the network traffic unchanged, has low deployment cost, and is highly compatible with the specifications of the protocol.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background and Purpose: There will always be a discrepancy between theory and practice.  The coevolution of the theory and practice of anatomy has become more difficult with the passage of time, and the advancement of knowledge extending into the histologic and chemical levels.  Professional life continuously presents situations that are not textbook accounts with clear answers, especially in the realm of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practitioners.  The purpose of this research was to create a complexity-based course of human dissection to bridge the gap between clinical and laboratory anatomy.  Method: The creation of the self-organizing dissection course involved utilizing several characteristics of complex systems to frame an environment, which was supportive and inclusive of learners, rather than the creation of a unique list of anatomical structures or dissection procedure for the participants to accomplish.  A fully equipped laboratory supplemented by audiovisual aids was combined with treatment tables set up in an adjacent room, allowing participants to simultaneously manipulate willing fellow participants while performing a dissection.  Results: The utility of the complexity-based dissection course was shown to enhance perceived anatomical visualization skills and clinical efficacy for CAM practitioners practicing physical manipulation.  The nature of an emergent case study narrative within the course was also demonstrated, lending support for the use of this pedagogy in the anatomical education of CAM practitioners.  Conclusions: Participating in the complexity-based human dissection course was a valuable endeavor for practitioners of CAM who use physical manipulation, in their daily clinical work.  Previous dissection was not required nor was a great deal of clinical experience to have a positive impact on participants, making this approach flexible enough to have participants of all levels of experience, and differing philosophical backgrounds, work in an inter-professional team.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction: It is well known, and well documented that Indigenous conceptualizations of wellness differ from Western conceptualizations. Using Western parameters and formulations to appraise Indigenous health and wellness is highly problematic. &#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose: To address the need for Indigenous community-led conceptualizations of wellness in order to inform the creation of more culturally relevant and applicable indicators of Indigenous community wellness. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Conceptualizations of wellness were explored in three First Nations communities participating in the Kahnawà:ke Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP) Community Mobilization Training (CMT). Kane &amp; Trochim’s (2007) Concept Mapping for Planning and Evaluation was used to systematically collect and analyze data in partnership with each Indigenous community. The research consisted of three phases including Wellness Indicator Talking Circles, online unstructured sorting and rating, and concept map interpretation sessions. &#xD;
&#xD;
Data Analysis: Using Concept Systems® Global Max™ software, three data analysis steps were conducted to create the concept maps including a similarity matrix, multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical cluster analysis. All interpretations of these outputs were completed using a participatory approach. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: The themes of balance and wholism, intergenerational relationships, the importance of Indigenous language and culture, connectedness, food systems and the environment were prominent in all three communities. However, each community’s concept map was distinct, highlighting that the meaning of wellness within each community was directly related to their local history, context, ideals, and resources. &#xD;
&#xD;
Discussion: Given the diversity of perspectives, histories, cultures, contexts, values, and experiences across Indigenous nations, establishing generalizable Indigenous community wellness indicators is unrealistic. Conceptualizing Indigenous community wellness is a process that should be locally determined to foster ownership and sovereignty over strategic planning and evaluation efforts related to the promotion of wellness within a community.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools that help patients select a treatment option for a medical condition. PDAs often include narratives about other patients’ experiences, but this inclusion may lead to biased decisions due to psychological transportation into the narrative world. Transportation has been shown to facilitate attitude changes, but it has not been studied in a medical decision context. Patients may be less susceptible to transportation if they are focused on extracting answers to specific questions that they have about the treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
Winterbottom’s (2012) dialysis selection protocol was adapted to determine whether transportation could underlie decision bias in four experiments. Participants were asked to choose between two forms of dialysis to treat a hypothetical kidney failure. Information segments about others’ treatment experiences were presented in a narrative format or a non-narrative question and answer (Q&amp;A) format, and transportation was assessed after the presentation of each information segment. In the first experiment, information about the dialysis options was presented in different formats (narrative versus Q&amp;A) whereas the second experiment presented the two options consecutively in the same format. Overall, the results confirm that transportation can occur in a medical decision context. However, both formats were equally transporting when presented first, and participants were not biased toward the option presented in the narrative. When presented second, both formats were less transporting if preceded by a narrative, suggesting that transportation into one narrative world may hinder immediate transportation elsewhere. The last two experiments explored whether transportation can account for the biasing effect of patient narratives over doctor narratives reported in Winterbottom’s original study. A dialysis option was more likely to be selected if it was presented in a patient narrative than a doctor narrative and participants favoured the option described in the more transporting narrative. This effect of narrator identity was completely accounted for by a mediated path through transportation, however, there may be other mediators and/or moderators along this indirect path. Given this incomplete understanding of narrative bias and the aforementioned order effects, decision aid developers are advised to exercise caution when considering the inclusion of narratives in PDAs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been shown to be exceptional ligands for molecular coordination chemistry due to their ability to form strong carbon-metal bonds. Only recent, our group and others have demonstrated that the strong carbon-metal bonding properties of NHCs can be leveraged for materials chemistry. In 2014, Crudden and co-workers showed that self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) derived from NHCs on gold surfaces were significantly more stable than thiolate SAMs; which, for decades, have been considered the state-of-the-art in SAM chemistry. Since then, our group has continued to advance the field by incorporating unique functionalities to NHCs and new methods of SAM formation. In addition, stability of NHCs in different chemical and electrochemical conditions was critical to determine NHCs use in biological and industrial applications. &#xD;
In this thesis, I will present the use of electrochemical measurement of NHCs in phosphate buffer are discussed to confirm the prospective use of NHC-based SAMs in biological applications. The electrochemical stability of NHC-based SAMs at different levels of applied potential will also be presented. This study is crucial to employ NHC-based SAMs in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, sensors, and catalysts. For both projects, 5-((6-ferrocenohexyl)oxy)-1,3-diisopropyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-3-ium bicarbonate (2-8•H2CO3) and  2-(6-(4-anthraquinyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)hexyloxy)-1,3-diisopropyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-3-ium bicarbonate (8-4•H2CO3) were synthesized as a new NHC-based electrochemical tag molecules to compare with the known NHC 5-((12-(4-(ferrocenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)dodecyl)oxy)-1,3-diisopropyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-3-ium bicarbonate (1-20•H2CO3) which was previously used in the Crudden lab for electrochemical analysis. &#xD;
The capability of 3-6-ethyl-1,3-diisopropyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylate trifluorosulfonate (2-18•OTf) as a measles biosensor will be discussed. The mechanisms of SAM formation with NHCs will be discussed using free carbenes and their precursor bicarbonate and triflate salts. Finally, the first example of NHC depositions on Vulcan xc-72 carbon will be presented, and the effect of different oxidative treatments of carbon to facilitate NHC deposition will be discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Given that more Canadians than ever before are living in auto-dependent suburban environments, sustainable suburban development has become a critical planning issue. Planners should identify and analyze suburban neighbourhoods that reflect more sustainable development and design. Garrison Crossing in Chilliwack, British Columbia, is one such neighbourhood, redeveloped on the former Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Chilliwack by the Canada Lands Company (CLC). The CLC is a self-financing Crown corporation that protects the Canadian public interest in terms of sustainable redevelopment and management of surplus federal land. Therefore, analysis of Garrison Crossing can reveal lessons for more sustainable suburban development and investigate the performance of this unique organization. Using modified Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighbourhood Development criteria, this report analyzes the sustainability of Garrison Crossing relative to three comparable projects in the suburban British Columbia Lower Mainland: Bedford Landing in the Township of Langley and East Clayton and Rosemary Heights in the City of Surrey.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the sources of government spending variations across time and countries. Overall, both theory and evidence indicate that government spending variations originate not only from economic forces, such as the state of the business cycle and inherited financial fragility, but are ultimately linked to a country’s domestic political environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 2, I provide empirical evidence on the political determinants of government spending using a panel structural VAR. I use the full sample of OECD countries since 1990 and exploit time-varying ideological party positions. I find that&#xD;
government spending appears to be the key channel through which government ideology affects economic growth. In particular, left-wing governments tend to increase government spending growth after being elected leading to a temporary increase in economic growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 3, I introduce a theoretical framework that is consistent with the empirical evidence that decisions towards government spending vary according to the ideology of the ruling party on a left-right spectrum. I incorporate heterogenous voters, parties, and repeated elections into a traditional one-sector neoclassical model and calibrate the model for twelve advanced economies since 1950. The model predicts that a large fraction of the time series variations in government spending can be linked to the domestic political environment for most countries (54% on average) and especially in countries with more political polarization and higher persistence in government ideology, as in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 4 presents an empirical case study of an additional, potentially important source of government spending variations. I show that the lack of independent monetary policy may constrain Eurozone countries with a fragile financial position to implement austerity measures in the face of economic downturns such as the ones experienced since the financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis will examine how the way we experience knowledge has changed due to the ubiquity of electronic media. Specifically, there will be an examination of how the new digital media – and social media in particular – are structured to continuously redirect the attention of the thinking subject into a series of logically enclosed spaces. &#xD;
&#xD;
The structure of this thesis follows two core arguments. The first will be an examination of how misdirection evolved as a rhetorical technique whose origins are fundamentally grounded in the project of persuasion. This thesis will argue, that misdirection as a technique uses rhetoric to distract a thinking subject, as a means of persuading that subject to the rhetorician’s point of view. The foundational theory will derive primarily through an examination of Plato’s Republic and Harry Frankfurt’s On Bullshit to trace the origins of this rhetorical technique and to sketch a brief chronology of its evolution to the present day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secondly, misdirection will be placed in the context of a changed epistemological and technological landscape. Jean Baudrillard’s Simulacra and Simulation will provide an examination of how the electronic landscape has transformed misdirection from a rhetorical technique into a means of experiencing the world. This thesis will argue that Baudrillard’s simulated hyperreality – the constant act of imitating a poorly represented reality which leads to an enclosed world that no longer remembers its point of origin – is made possible by the self-referential and algorithmically determined structure of digital media that renders misdirection autonomous.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, the thesis will conclude by taking this theoretical framework and using it to interpret recent real-world events that have occurred between the new millennium and the present day. Several phenomena, from art to political transformations, will be contextualised and interpreted as examples of autonomous misdirection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Groundwater contamination by dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) continues to be a significant environmental problem. DNAPL site characterization forms the basis of DNAPL site remediation success and requires attention. Mathematical modelling was utilized to delineate a trichloroethene (TCE) plume resulting from the dissolution of DNAPL in a subsurface environment. A numerical model (DNAPL3D-RX) was used to generate high-resolution field-scale three-dimensional groundwater concentration datasets (referred to as “true” plumes) and semi-analytical models (SCOToolkit3D and SWIF routine) were used to predict the maximum “true” plume extent. The study of SCOTookit3D found that the applied model can predict the maximum “true” plume extent using different monitoring framework settings and having different uncertainties in model input parameters, yet this tool had the limitation of over predicting concentrations by one to three orders of magnitude. The failure of SCOToolkit3D to accurately characterize the “true” plumes motivated the development of the stochastic well installation framework (SWIF) routine, which not only mitigated the earlier discovered failure of SCOToolkit3D but also provided a formal decision support tool for groundwater practitioners to reduce cost and uncertainty in developing a conceptual site model (CSM) by supporting monitoring well or membrane interface probe (MIP) installation decisions through a probabilistic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
The study of the SWIF routine found that installing monitoring wells or MIPs within low and high probability target zones (a target zone is a specific probability contour range on the probability map generated by the routine) will likely result in a large quantity of monitoring unit installations and a corresponding high site characterization cost, compared to installing monitoring wells or MIPs in a medium level probability target zone. The results also demonstrated the successful estimation of key attributes of a CSM in both homogenous and heterogeneous porous media using monitoring well and MIP installations. The results of this research provide the necessary basis to understand the model input parameter uncertainty and the site investigation strategy by optimizing the well installations required for the development of a meaningful CSM.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Headwater streams can compose up to 80% of the total stream length within a watershed but remain most susceptible to stream burial during land use change or management. Rerouting streams into tile drains, canals, non-perforated pipes and paving over, are all examples of stream burial.  This study explores the importance of delineating headwater streams within a watershed hydrological network and the downstream impacts of headwater burial. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to predict changes in discharge, chlorophyll a, DO and sediment for downstream ecosystems, following headwater stream burial. Within the study area of Kemptville Creek subwatershed of the Rideau River Watershed in Kemptville and surrounding area, Ontario, Canada, 908 headwater stream segments totaling 443km of stream length were delineated from a 10-hectare threshold. Model calibration was significantly improved with the inclusion of delineated headwater streams, increasing R2 by 0.49. Headwater streams were confirmed with field observations in 70% of 30 selected headwater stream sites.  Headwater streams were classified based on land use disturbance coefficients and potential downstream organic subsidy contribution. Each headwater class saw 100% stream burial through conversion into irrigation canals using SWAT model. Headwater stream burial was also applied to all headwater streams as one collective group at 25, 50, 75 and 100%.  Ontario Benthic Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) samples from Rideau Valley Conservation Authority were assessed using the Family Biotic Index (FBI) OBBN metric and Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index. Predicted discharge, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen (DO) and sediment inputs were compared against the OBBN community structure, at 7 sample sites. Headwater stream burial results indicated significant decreases in discharge, chlorophyll a, DO and sediment to downstream ecosystems. Headwater stream burial within wetlands representing 33% of the headwaters within Kemptville Creek, had the most significant impact on downstream discharge, chlorophyll a, DO and sediment.  Changes for these variables correlated with several benthic macroinvertebrate families, which supported predictions of community structure shifts following headwater stream burial. Results from this work highlight the importance of headwater streams to ecohydrology within watersheds and contributes to the understanding of ecosystem response as hydrologic regimes are altered following stream burial.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis introduces a new strategy to develop a comprehensive stochastic polymerization simulation with the capacity of considering the secondary reactions attributed to the radical acrylate/methacrylate/styrene polymerization carried out at high temperatures via semi-batch reactor operation. Unlike the conventional deterministic method of polymerization modeling (i.e., method of moments), the resulting kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model can predict the distribution of comonomer units among polymer chains. A combination of acceleration methods is implemented to effectively reduce the computational cost of these simulations while preserving the accuracy of the solution. KMC model output is not only compared to a deterministic model implemented in Predici® but experimentally challenged by comparing predictions to the properties of polymer samples extracted after crosslinking of resin synthesized in a set of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA)/butyl methacrylate (BMA) copolymerizations.&#xD;
While the simulation time has been greatly reduced, the KMC method is still computationally costly relative to deterministic methods. Thus, a methodology has been developed to use the instantaneous copolymer composition and number-average chain lengths output from a deterministic model to estimate the instantaneous mole and weight fractions of polymer chains with respect to the number of comonomer units they possess, with the cumulative quantities calculated through suitable integration.&#xD;
Derivative-free optimization algorithms (e.g., Pattern Search and Particle Swarm) are combined with the accelerated kinetic Monte Carlo model to develop strategies to improve the traditional starved-feed policy often used by industry. Starved-intervals are introduced as an approach to modify the monomer and initiator feeding strategy. This concept is demonstrated using a simpler deterministic model based on the method of moments as a case study. A feeding schedule formulated by utilizing the Pattern Search optimization algorithm combined with the KMC model demonstrates remarkable improvement compared to the traditional starved-feed policy; in fact, this nonlinear feeding strategy reduces the total reaction time from 6 hours to less than 2 hours while the quality of polymer product is improved. This strategy is experimentally verified both at Queen’s University and Axalta Coasting Systems research facility.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Endometriosis is an inflammatory gynaecological disease that affects 1 in 10 women globally. Characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissues found proliferating outside the uterus, the disease is associated with chronic inflammation in the form of increased peritoneal cytokines and leukocyte populations, notably macrophages. Although several studies to date have highlighted the critical roles of macrophages in the progression of endometriosis and the promotion of peritoneal inflammation, the factors responsible for their recruitment and activation remained elusive. Through clinical observations, interleukin (IL)-33 was confirmed as to be a novel endometriosis-related damage-associated molecular pattern and herein we provided a characterization of its role in the regulation of macrophage activation and facilitation of lesion development in a mouse model of endometriosis. We provided evidence that IL-33, along with monocyte/macrophage-related chemotactic factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), were significantly increased within human endometriotic lesions compared to control endometrium. Evaluation of eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis demonstrated macrophages were present in significantly greater abundance than control and may be central to promoting eutopic inflammation. Additionally, with emerging roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome in chronic inflammatory conditions, we sought to evaluate endometriosis patient peritoneal fluid and plasma by multiplex cytokine array and found aberrations in functional inflammasome products and regulators. Studies in our syngeneic, immunocompetent mouse model of endometriosis demonstrated that the administration of recombinant IL-33 induced significant lesion neovascularization and proliferation, as well as promoted robust peritoneal inflammation through the activation of macrophages. Furthermore, we found that inflammatory macrophage recruitment was regulated by the MCP-1/CCR2 signalling axis and was significantly attenuated by MCP-1 neutralization, which resulted in systemic and local perturbation in inflammation. These findings provided novel insights into the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment and activation which ultimately promoted endometriotic lesion development and inflammation in vivo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Differential interferometry of synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) analysis can be used to generate high-precision surface displacement maps in continuous permafrost environments, capturing isotropic surface subsidence and uplift associated with the seasonal freeze and thaw cycle. We generated seasonal displacement maps using DInSAR with ultrafine-beam Radarsat-2 images for summers 2013, 2015 and 2019 at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, and examined them in combination with a land cover classification, meteorological data, topographic data, optical satellite imagery, and in situ measures of soil moisture, soil temperature and active layer thickness. Displacement magnitudes (estimated uncertainty ± 1 cm) of up to 10 cm per 48-day DInSAR stack were detected, but the vast majority of change was far smaller (up to 4 cm). Significant surface displacement was found to be most extensive and of the greatest magnitude in select low-lying, wet, and sloping areas. We speculate that precipitation may be the most important control on the extent of seasonal frost heave, as 2019 showed higher levels of surface displacement than 2013.  Despite both summers having similar thawing degree days, 2019 had double the cumulative rainfall by mid-August. Areas which showed significant displacement in multiple years were sparse but densely clustered in wet, low lying areas, on steep slopes or ridges, or close to the coast. Cumulative displacement across all three years was also examined: areas with large cumulative uplift were constrained to upland areas, and conversely areas showing large cumulative subsidence were constrained to low-lying areas; this may be due to contrasting ground ice concentrations and water availability associated with different sediment composition and frost susceptibility above and below the local marine limit (estimated at 70 m a.s.l.). DInSAR also captured the expansion of two medium-sized retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), appearing to successfully map accumulation of slumped material at the foot of the RTS headwalls, and associated destabilization and subsidence upslope.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The car industry has a growing demand for reliable, continuous, and accurate positioning information for various applications, including routing to a specific destination, asset tracking, and, eventually future self-driving. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers have been widely used for this purpose. However, adequate GNSS positioning accuracy cannot be guaranteed in all environments due to possible satellite signal blockage, poor satellite geometry, and multipath in urban environments and downtown cores. The technological advances and low cost of micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) – based inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) enabled their use inside land vehicles for various reasons, including the integration with GNSS receivers to provide positioning information that can bridge GNSS outages in challenging GNSS environments. An optimal estimation technique, such as the Kalman filter, is used to integrate the positioning solution from both the GNSS receiver and the inertial sensors. However, in dense urban areas and downtown cores where GNSS receivers may incur prolonged outages, the integrated positioning solution may become prone to rapid drift resulting in substantial position errors. Therefore, it is becoming necessary to include other sensors and systems that can be available in future land vehicles to integrate with both the GNSS receivers and inertial sensors to enhance the positioning performance in such challenging environments. The aim of this research is to design and examine the performance of a multi-sensor integrated positioning system that fuses the GNSS receiver data with not only inertial sensors but also with the three-dimensional point cloud of onboard light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system. In this thesis, a comprehensive LiDAR processing and odometry method is developed to provide a continuous and accurate positioning solution, even in challenging GNSS environments. A multi-sensor fusion based on extended Kalman filtering is also developed to integrate the LiDAR positioning information with both GNSS and inertial sensors and utilize the LiDAR updates to limit the drift in the positioning solution, even in challenging or completely denied GNSS environment. The performance of the proposed multi-sensor positioning solution is examined using several road test trajectories in both Kingston and Toronto downtown areas involving different vehicle dynamics and driving scenarios. This thesis discusses the merits and limitations of the proposed method and gives recommendations for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the global burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease continues to rise, there is an increased demand for improved imaging techniques for earlier detection and diagnosis of atherosclerotic plaques, and for quantitative measures of disease progression. Vulnerable plaque lesions are thought to be responsible for the majority of cardiovascular events, characterized by a large lipid core, a thin fibrous cap, and neovascularization – features that increase the risk of plaque rupture and thrombosis. Intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) in advanced lesions in the carotid artery can be visualized using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) technology, and its accurate quantification could provide a powerful tool for the detection of vulnerable plaque.&#xD;
This project was undertaken to develop a model of vascularized atherosclerotic plaque compatible with CEUS, and to apply it in the validation of a novel IPN quantification tool that calculates a normalized IPN enhancement ratio (NER). A variety of plaque mimics (n=92) were created to simulate different plaque phenotypes, and NER values were compared with visual grading of human plaques (n=42). To validate the vulnerable plaque mimics, contrast enhancement of plaque IPN was evaluated using 2D and 3D methods, showing a positive correlation between NER and IPN volume (rho = 0.45; p&lt;0.0001). Enhancement of certain plaque mimic types was shown to resemble human plaques with visual grade scores of 0 (NER score mean difference = 1.05 ± 2.45; p=0.67), grade 1 (NER score mean difference = 0.22 ± 3.26; p=0.95), and grade 2 (NER score mean difference = -0.84 ± 3.33; p=0.80). The NER quantification method was shown to detect grade 2 plaques with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 91%.&#xD;
This methodology was shown to successfully mimic plaque vulnerability and has the potential to improve clinical identification of vulnerable plaques. The neovascularized plaque phantom developed may serve as an in vitro platform for further validation of novel plaque imaging technologies and techniques for the investigation of plaque neovascularization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Machine learning in computer vision has become an invaluable aspect of research on object detection and object tracking. While advancements in current research aim to improve the matching of predictions with ground truth bounding box annotations from humans, to our knowledge, very little work is currently being done on analyzing bounding box path smoothness. Bounding box path smoothness is useful as it can contribute to improve machine vision. Additionally, it provides another metric by which researchers can assess the capabilities and qualities of video object detection systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
In this work, we investigate the problem of object bounding box path smoothness in video object detection systems. We begin by studying the fields of convolutional neural networks for object detection systems, and smoothness metrics from biokinematics research. Two smoothness metrics from this field, namely Log Dimensionless Jerk (LDLJ) and Spectral Arc Length (SAL), are adapted for usage in object bounding box paths and an analysis is done to justify the adaptations made. An in-depth analysis of two bounding box proposal generation systems is done using the two adapted smoothness metrics and validated against the ground truth bounding box paths. The analysis showed that both LDLJ and SAL can differentiate between all tested object bounding box path generation systems. Additional experiments demonstrate that the human annotations are the most smooth bounding box paths, however, the object detection systems tested can be improved naively by doing a moving average over proposed paths.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, we adapt the smoothness metrics as loss functions in a video object detection system to analyze if it could be used as a regularizer on video object detection using convolutional neural networks. We propose, train and analyse a model on video object detection with 7 training regimens which vary only in the regularizer. We found that using a smoothness regularizer can improve object path smoothness by a small amount and conclude with a list of possible future work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With the advancements in wireless network technologies over the past few decades and the deployment of 4G LTE networks, the capabilities and services provided to end-users have become seemingly endless. Users of smartphones utilize high-speed network services while commuting on public buses and hope to have a consistent, high-quality connection for the duration of their trip. Due to the massive load demand on cellular networks and frequent changes in the underlying radio channel, users often experience sudden unexpected variations in the connection quality. To overcome such a variation and maintain a consistent connection, we need to predict these variations before they occur. This can be accomplished by analyzing different network quality parameters at various times and locations and investigating the main factors that affect the network’s performance and network QoS.&#xD;
&#xD;
To this end, we conducted a network survey via Kingston Transit, in Kingston, Ontario, using the Android network monitoring application G-NetTrack Pro from which we constructed a dataset of various client-side wireless network quality parameters. The dataset consists of 30 repeated public transit bus trips, each lasting no more than one hour. We studied two techniques for throughput analysis: regression predictive modelling and time series forecasting. For regression predictive modelling, we deployed various machine learning models on the collected data for throughput prediction and achieved the highest prediction performance with the random forest model. For time series forecasting, we used statistical methods as well as deep learning architectures. Our evaluation shows that the machine learning models had a higher throughput prediction performance than the time series forecasting techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we present an analysis of the collected data, where we investigate the effects of time and location on the network’s measured throughput and signal strength. Also, we discuss and compare the results of applying different throughput prediction techniques on the collected data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The emergence of integrated (or solid state) photonic systems, including quantum dots, waveguides, and cavities, has provided a base to harness quantum optic phenomena for use in current and future quantum technologies. These systems also provide opportunities for exploring fundamentally new regimes in quantum optics. In order to fully realize the potential of these systems, many figures of merit need to be improved, for example by increasing the stability and coherent lifetimes of these systems. Following the notable improvements using measurement-based feedback, time-delayed coherent optical feedback has been proposed as one such method of stabilizing and improving these systems. Furthermore, modelling coherent feedback itself presents an interesting fundamental problem due to its non-Markovian nature. In this thesis, we use quantum trajectory (QT) theory to derive two models for simulating cavity quantum electrodynamic (cavity-QED) systems with time-delayed coherent feedback. First, an explanation of QT theory is given and the related time discretized waveguide (TDW) model is derived. Next we present a model for feedback using the frequency modes of the waveguide and results are presented in the ``one photon in the loop" approximation. We demonstrate how the photon lifetime can be improved in typical cavity-QED with coherent feedback and we explore some nonlinear effects. We then expand the system to allow for two photons in the feedback loop which requires us to use the TDW model. Lastly, this new approach is used to model two two-level systems coupled via a waveguide and connected to a feedback loop. These findings have implications on improving quantum optic systems by creating a new degree of control, as well as for modelling non-Markovian features in quantum optics.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Chemical fate models can provide insights into processes influencing environmental fate and bioaccumulation of chemicals. Currently, experimental data are generally obtained for regulatory assessment of organic chemicals; however, it is believed that concentration- or fugacity-based fate models can be very useful for making estimations prior to testing or for assisting in the interpretation of results. This thesis aims to take a modelling perspective on regulatory aspects of chemical assessment by addressing the three main criteria used internationally for regulation including Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity (PBT) of chemicals. Regulations usually use ‘bright-line’ or ‘pass/fail’ criteria, which may not take all relevant considerations into account, especially when assessing chemicals with new or unusual physical chemical properties. Four studies are presented each of which address relevant issues observed in assessing chemical fate including i) kinetic delays seen in highly hydrophobic substances, which may obscure persistence assessments, ii) assessment of lipid-normalization for calculating bioaccumulation metrics, iii) presentation of the Chemical Exposure Toxicity Space (CETS) tool for estimating successful toxicity test conditions, and iv) application of the CETS tool to two non-fish aquatic organisms. It is demonstrated that simple uptake models can be used to successfully address these problems and the benefit of estimating results before conducting experiments is discussed. It is demonstrated that using simple chemical fate or bioaccumulation models can be very useful by providing insight into unexpected results as well as to help prevent wasted tests by predicting results beforehand. </dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores the feasibility of using a novel degradable cationic flocculant, poly(PLA4ChMA), for enhanced dewatering of mature fine tailings (MFT). Previous research indicated that this material provided improved flocculation of 5.0 wt.% MFT diluted in deionized water compared to commercial anionic polymers, with continued dewatering of the sediment occurring as the polymer undergoes partial hydrolytic degradation. However, the elevated dosages (10,000 ppm) required would make the polymer costly to implement on an industrial scale. With this motivation, the impact of MFT composition and the use of process water is explored while comparing the settling performance of poly(PLA4ChMA) to commercially available alternatives such as anionic FLOPAM A3338. While consolidation of 5.0 wt.% MFT diluted with process water could be achieved using 500 ppm poly(PLA4ChMA), the final compaction levels after polymer degradation were similar to those achieved with the non-degradable FLOPAM A3338. Furthermore, the initial (24 h) compaction and clarity were better with FLOPAM A3338, which also provided faster settling rates (5-8 m/h) than those observed with poly(PLA4ChMA) at 10,000 ppm (&lt;0.4 m/h). Attempts to increase poly(PLA4ChMA) molecular weight did not offer improvements in the settling properties at comparable dosages to those used with FLOPAM A3338. A series of flocculation-filtration experiments were also conducted to compare the performance of the polymers with undiluted MFT. While faster rates of water release were observed with cationic flocculants compared to FLOPAM A3338, no improvement in overall compaction of the tailings was measured with poly(PLA4ChMA), either before or after degradation. Slower rates of water release were measured with poly(PLA4ChMA) following degradation, indicating that the cleavage of the cationic functionality from the polymer during degradation has a negative impact on its performance. Thus, the improved dewatering observed with poly(PLA4ChMA) in dilute MFT suspensions does not extend to conditions that would be encountered in the field.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stormwater pollutants can have deleterious impacts on the aquatic life of receiving waterbodies. The aim of this thesis is to present the findings from stormwater quality monitoring and modelling performed for the Town of Jasper in Alberta, Canada. This research was conducted in order to understand the stormwater quality issues in the Town and propose Best Management Practices to reduce stormwater impacts to the aquatic life of receiving waterbodies.&#xD;
A monitoring program was conducted over a period of a year, and samples were collected at major outfalls in the Town for various weather events. The objective of the monitoring program was to identify key pollutants of concern and to characterize impacts to sensitive surrounding aquatic ecosystems downstream of the Town. A total of 14 stormwater quality parameters were found to be of high concern to aquatic life, particularly total suspended solids (TSS), metals and phosphorus (TP). TSS concentrations were statistically correlated with metals and TP by using a Spearman rank correlation. It was found that vehicular traffic was a major source of metals and that winter road salting was responsible for excessive chloride concentrations. High hydrocarbon loads were traced to the oil leaks associated with the high volumes of traffic during the tourist season and fecal coliforms were largely present due to the fecal droppings of the resident Elk population. A Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) was developed to assess the performance of street sweeping and infiltration trenches to reduce TSS loads in the stormwater in Jasper. Two catchments models were developed for the Town using long-term meteorological data, as well as watershed and drainage system data provided by the Municipality. The quality parameters were calibrated so that TSS loads at the outfalls were within a 20% error of monitoring data. The performance of proposed Best Management Practices (BMP) was assessed using single-event and continuous data simulations. A combined sweeping/trench control scenario was recommended for implementation as it generated the highest removal efficiency of up to 51%. The modelling results were used in support of a stormwater management plan to protect the sensitive ecosystems and waterbodies that surround the Town of Jasper.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As Maori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith has described, “the collective memory of imperialism has been perpetrated through the ways knowledge about Indigenous peoples was collected, classified and then represented in various ways back to the West, and then, through the eyes of the West back to those who have been colonized.” This research project will therefore take an interdisciplinary approach to understand how comics books have become a medium of Indigenous resistance to and a remediation of popular media such as comics which often perpetrate racialized stereotypes as the dominant representation of indigeneity. Furthermore, this research will consider how the reclamation of the comic medium by Indigenous artists can thus be viewed as an expression of “visual sovereignty” by, not only speaking back to settler representations, but also strengthening Indigenous sovereignty by advocating for Indigenous cultural and political power.  This research will primarily focus on three texts — The 500 Years of Resistance Comic by Gord Hill, Betty: The Helen Betty Osborne Story by David Alexander Robertson, and kitaskinaw 2350 by Chelsea Vowel — and consider how each of them enact visual sovereignty.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It is well known that the presence of pores has an effect on the mechanical properties of materials.  A figure case is X-750, a Ni-based alloys exposed to neutron irradiation in nuclear reactors. Interactions with neutrons lead to atom transmutations that spontaneously create nanoscale pores in otherwise sound material. &#xD;
Imaging these nanoscale features using transmission electron microscopy is key to predicting and assessing the mechanical behavior of structural materials in nuclear reactors. Analyzing these micrographs is often a tedious and time-consuming manual process. It is a prime candidate for automation. A region-based convolutional neural network is adapted to detect helium bubbles in micrographs of neutron-irradiated Inconel X-750 reactor spacer springs. This neural network produces analyses of similar accuracy and reproducibility to that produced by humans. Further, this method is shown as being four orders of magnitude faster than manual analysis allowing for generation of significant quantities of data. The proposed method can be used with micrographs of different Fresnel contrasts and magnification levels. &#xD;
To understand the effect that these pores have on mechanical properties, a lattice element method is introduced. The lattice element method uses a spring network to act as forces between nodes to predict the micro-mechanical response of the system. This computationally efficient model shows promise in the application of porous material mechanical testing to fracture. A two-dimensional isotropic linear-elastic model is developed with multiple spring networks and boundary conditions. The lattice element method (LEM) is validated in all model conditions for isotropic behaviour and for size effects. The LEM is then validated in the case of a slab containing a circular pore. The LEM predicts stress concentrations in good agreement with an analytical solution. &#xD;
In the future, the detection network and the LEM, used in tandem, could enable the development of high-throughput simulated material models from experimental porous samples.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Magnetic surveys are an important step in the process of mineral and archaeological exploration. Current magnetic surveying methods include mounting magnetometers to various survey platforms including inhabited airplanes, helicopters, all-terrain vehicles, boats, and backpacks for walking surveys. Recent developments in autonomous controls and remotely piloted systems have led to conducting magnetic surveys from remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS). The use of these recently developed platforms has allowed the mineral exploration industry to reduce risk to pilots and operators of inhabited survey platforms and achieve reduced sensor to magnetic source separations while improving data resolution, or speed of data collection compared to previous survey vessels. In survey regions occupied by freshwater lakes (10% of Canada’s surface area), these aerial survey platforms are restricted by the water surface, limiting the achievable proximity to the ground/magnetic source body. The work completed in this thesis has led to the configuration of an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) equipped with a single frequency echo sounder and an Overhauser magnetometer for applications in marine magnetic and bathymetric surveying. This platform and developed operating procedure are capable of deploying a magnetometer only metres above the lakebed thus decreasing the sensor to magnetic source separation and improving magnetic body resolvability compared to pre-existing public magnetic data acquired across Canadian lakes. The survey vessel configuration was tested in three Canadian lakes (Lake Ontario, Surprise Lake – Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Opinicon Lake – South Frontenac, Ontario) by completing magnetic and bathymetric surveys for shallow sections of each lake. The surface area of each survey was less than 1 square kilometre, with a maximum lake depth of 6.5 metres. Through interpretation of acquired data, localized magnetic anomalies on the order of 200nT have been identified and are suspected to indicate the presence of iron-rich geological units, and/or archaeological waste. The data acquired throughout these  case studies, combined with a regional investigation of over 877,000 Canadian lakes completed throughout this research, has indicated that the configured ASV and operation procedure could serve as an effective and reliable survey platform for purposes of mineral and archaeological exploration in over 68% of Canadian lakes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Stress is one of the most important etiological factors implicated in depression. A principle physiological stress response system is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is proposed as a mechanism that may help translate stress exposures, such as childhood maltreatment (CM), into heightened risk for depression. Further, sex differences in HPA axis regulation have been proposed to help explain women’s heightened vulnerability to depression. Overall, depression and CM are associated with blunted HPA axis reactivity to stress. However, studies also show patterns of heightened HPA axis reactivity in relation to depression, including among depressed individuals with CM, suggesting that other vulnerability factors may be necessary to promote blunted reactivity in depression. Two factors associated with depression in women, and which interact with the HPA axis, are disturbances in affective processes, such as affect dynamics, and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis functioning. Thus, in the current dissertation, in two separate models, I examine whether the relation of depression and childhood maltreatment on HPA axis reactivity may be further moderated by two indices of these systems, namely affect lability and basal testosterone. Specifically, I assessed HPA axis reactivity by assessing salivary cortisol output in response to a laboratory stress task (Trier Social Stress Test) in a sample of depressed and non-depressed women (i.e., no lifetime history of psychopathology). Childhood maltreatment was assessed as the presence of severe CM (sCM) using a rigorous contextual interview, affect lability was assessed via self-report, and basal testosterone was assessed via blood serum. Although I found that the relation of depression and HPA axis reactivity was moderated by sCM, affect lability, and testosterone, the specific pattern of effects among depressed women were not as hypothesized. Instead, I found that affect lability and testosterone helped to further characterize HPA axis reactivity but only for depressed women with no sCM, such that low affect lability/testosterone was associated with lower cortisol reactivity. In contrast, depressed women with sCM showed disturbances in HPA axis responding in the acclimation period just prior to the TSST regardless of affect lability. Implications and future directions for understanding HPA axis functioning in depression are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is split into two sections: the first evaluates the performance of pre-engineered beam-hanger connections under cyclic loading, and the second evaluates the reinforcement of holes in glulam beams using self-tapping screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 3 describes laboratory testing of the Megant 430x150x50 beam-hanger connector under applied interstorey drift deflections based on a modified version of the CUREE loading protocol. The performance of the Megant 430x150x50 connector was evaluated and it was determined that the connector surpassed interstorey drift limits of 2.5%, outlined in the 2015 National Building Code of Canada. The failure of the connector was due to a combined tension and pull-out failure of the wood screws. It was observed that the gravity load has a significant effect on the interstorey drift capacity and energy dissipation by the connector.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 4 describes experimental tests conducted on different size glulam beams: 6-layer, 9-layer and 11-layer. Each beam is tested under three test configurations: no hole, a 2-inch hole at ¼ span and a reinforced 2-inch hole at ¼ span. It was determined that when a hole is introduced, the overall strength capacity of the beam decreases. When self-tapping screws are used as reinforcement around the hole, the strength capacity of the beam can increase up to 34.4% compared to a hole with no reinforcement, and can even over-reinforce the beam by 6.2%, as seen in the 9-layer beam, when compared to its reference beam. The depth-to-span and diameter-to-depth of beam (d/h) ratios have a large impact on the strength and behavior of the beam.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Every day, mobile network traffic is increasing in an unprecedented manner all over the world, resulting in growing demand from the network operators to deploy more base stations in order to be able to serve more devices while maintaining a satisfactory level of service quality. Base stations are considered the leading energy consumer in a network infrastructure; consequently, increasing the number of base stations will increase power consumption. By finding a method to predict the traffic load on base stations, network optimization techniques can be applied to put inactive base stations into sleep mode thereby decreasing energy consumption.&#xD;
This research explores methods capable of predicting traffic load on base stations. The most common time series forecasting techniques are examined in this research on a public dataset that provides records of traffic loads of several base stations over the span of one week. &#xD;
Because of the limited number of records that exist in the dataset for each base station, and to avoid a common problem often raised in training forecasting algorithms, different base stations are grouped together while building the prediction model. Due to the different behavior of the base stations, forecasting the traffic load of multiple base stations together becomes challenging. Our proposed solution involves clustering the base stations according to their behavior and forecasting the load on the base stations in each cluster individually. Different clustering algorithms along with several similarity metrics are compared to each other using a variety of evaluation methods. The base stations load prediction task is formulated as a time series forecasting problem. The most common statistical techniques, machine learning techniques, and deep learning techniques used for time series forecasting are applied on the clusters. Consequently, the clusters’ performances are evaluated and compared. Lastly, two popular online tools, created specifically for the time series forecasting task, are employed to the dataset. The results generated by these online tools are used in this research as a benchmark to compare to the performance of the proposed prediction model. &#xD;
Our findings demonstrate that Deep Recurrent Neural Networks such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) networks perform better than other time series forecasting techniques for large data sets. Our findings offer clustering the time series data according to their behavior before using them for the forecasting algorithms as a solution for the problem of the dissimilar behavior of the time series when they are trained together.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation provides an empirical investigation on the implementation and effects of monetary policy. Chapter 2 examines how interest rate policy is determined at the European Central Bank. I provide empirical evidence against the notion that monetary policy at the European Central Bank favors the national interests of the largest member states. Instead, policy can best be described by a simple voting model where the median interest rate prevails. By mandate member countries are required to consider economic conditions in the broader Euro area when setting interest rate policy and, as I show, there is little empirical evidence suggesting that this is not the case. Because larger countries make up a larger fraction of these economic conditions, policy will favor their economic interests more often than not.&#xD;
&#xD;
The remainder of this dissertation uses data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters to examine the effects of monetary policy on the term structure of inflation expectations in the United States. In Chapter 3 I use the unobserved components model to estimate the term structure of inflation expectations from 1992–2018. I show how the model can be extended to allow for two departures from rational expectations and find that both channels are statistically significant. Contractionary monetary policy lowers inflation expectations after a lag of several years, an effect which is driven by the response of long-run inflation expectations which remain permanently lower after the policy move. Because interest rates and long-run inflation expectations are cointegrated, contractionary monetary policy additionally lowers future interest rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 4 I propose a method to calculate the impulse response of the term structure using local projections. The method uses the law of iterated expectations to derive a set of linear cross-equation restrictions which substantially reduce the number of parameters to estimate. I apply the term structure local projections to estimate the response of the term structures of inflation expectations and interest rates after a monetary policy shock. My results confirm the findings in Chapter 3: higher interest rates today cause both inflation expectations and interest rates to decline in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Positioning services for land vehicle navigation have long relied on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) including GPS; however, GNSS cannot maintain an accurate position while travelling under bridges, around tall building and under tree canopies due to signal blockage or multipath. Integration with the onboard motion sensors or perception systems can not maintain adequate level of accuracy in all environment during long GNSS outages.  The proposed research overcomes the limitations of current positioning technologies to expand their capabilities in degraded environments, providing an ‘uninterrupted everywhere’ positioning. The proposed system integrates a GNSS receiver, onboard motion sensors, and an electronic scanning radar (ESR) presently used in land vehicles for adaptive cruise control. This research develops a new method for ESR-based static object detection using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) approach to support accurate computation of the vehicle’s forward speed. A radar odometry method is then developed to obtain the vehicle position based on ESR. Integration with onboard motion sensors based on Extended Kalman filtering (EKF) is designed and realized to achieve accurate positioning in degraded vision and challenging GNSS environments. An intelligent switching mechanism is designed to choose between GNSS and ESR to be integrated in different scenarios with the onboard motion sensors in order to maintain reliable and continuous positioning in all enviroments. The proposed method sustained reliable positioning accuracy with errors less than 1% of the traveled distance. During GNSS outages, the fusion of ESR with the onboard motion sensors has resulted in at least 50% improvement in positioning accuracy when compared to the onboard motion sensors operating in standalone mode. This thesis discusses the merits and limitations of the proposed method and gives recommendations for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The traditional historiographical narrative locates the revival of grassroots conservatism in the postwar decades, the subsequent reemergence of conservatives in mainstream American politics by the mid 1970s and the completion of this ascent with the election of Ronald Reagan as President in 1980. This thesis argues that there is a crucial stage missing in the existing literature on the development of the New Right as a political force, their election to state government offices in the 1960s and early 1970s. This work will focus on Ronald Reagan’s time as Governor of California as an example of how New Right conservatives grappled with learning how to govern and honed their policy agendas before entering the national political arena. Crucially, this thesis shows that welfare and social policy were an essential part of New Right ideology and played an important role in their critiques of both the Democratic legacy of the New Deal and Great Society as well as President Nixon’s liberal domestic policies. Furthermore, welfare policy and rhetoric were an important wedge issue that was used to create a new, more avowedly conservative political coalition. It is argued that it is essential to look to the laboratories of state government to uncover how conservatives experimented with policy and prepared themselves for national politics if the full narrative of both American conservatism and welfare policy are to be properly understood.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation analyzes sixteenth-century European exile through the lens of masculinity, taking as its case study the Florentine goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini. Drawing on a range of primary texts from the fields of law, literature, and art theory, this project examines Cellini’s written works, such as the Treatises and Autobiography, alongside his sculptural and other three-dimensional objects. The study of masculinity is particularly well-suited for an analysis of the effects of exile—in which gender, sex, and sexuality are alternately maintained and transformed across geopolitical boundaries. In focusing on the interaction between legal institutions and the material body and its representations, this dissertation probes the complex ways exile has shaped sixteenth-century identity formation and gendered categories of citizenship, nationhood, and belonging. It argues that exile forced Cellini and his patrons to negotiate these meaningful but contested categories, making exile central to our understanding of the art of this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation is organized by three crucial aspects of exile, each in a separate chapter: exile’s forced encounter with foreignness, its creation of insiders and outsiders within one nation state, and its resolution in allowing those excluded to come back home. “The Jupiter” examines Cellini’s work in France, especially his work on a rarely discussed work, his silver life-size Jupiter. This chapter asks what role technique and material had in reshaping gendered power in the context of foreignness. “The Bust” assesses the function of state portraiture in defining centre and periphery. In tracing the creation and reception of Cellini’s bronze bust of Cosimo I (1546-47), including its move to the island of Elba in 1557, this chapter explores how exile shaped the expansion of the sixteenth-century absolutist state. “The Mint” examines the end of exile—a significant aspect of the institutional process of exile common in the sixteenth century, occurring when a term-length exile ended or when a banishment was lifted. This chapter analyzes two divergent areas of Cellini’s career, the mint and his marble Crucifix, to examine the function of money and compensation in making meaning in returning home.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is an analytical technique that can provide ultra-sensitive chemical detection on a mobile platform when implemented on handheld Raman spectrometers. However, the large laser spot size of handheld Raman spectrometers requires SERS substrates of sufficient surface area. In this work, we present a straightforward method of fabricating silver nanostructured SERS substrates, and subsequently demonstrate the substrates’ viability as drug checking tools to help combat the opioid crisis. &#xD;
&#xD;
We first demonstrate that electrochemically reducing silver ions onto silicon-gold microchips from a large `bath’ of aqueous solution results in highly-branched, nanostructured films that grow laterally across the silicon surface. The process is found to decrease production time and improve batch-to-batch reproducibility when compared to the existing 'droplet' protocol, which uses a smaller volume of reagent solution. In addition, we study the effect of temperature and mass transfer on lateral nanostructure growth with the intent of achieving large surface area substrates for use with handheld Raman spectrometers. While neither of these factors is found to have a significant effect on the extent of nanostructure growth, the study confirms that the nanostructured films grow under a mass transfer-controlled regime. We finally hypothesize that lateral growth is limited by electrical impedance within the nanostructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
We subsequently establish our SERS substrates’ viability as a drug checking tool, specifically for the detection of fentanyl in drugs. We determine fentanyl’s limit of detection on our platform as 0.078 ppm. SERS spectra of fentanyl, furanylfentanyl, and carfentanil are classified using multivariate analysis coupled with machine classification models. The classification model also identifies trace fentanyl amidst high concentrations of heroin and caffeine. Finally, we achieve SERS fentanyl detection using a handheld Raman device, thus setting a precedent for point-of-care drug checking.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Low temperature poses one of the most biologically taxing and economically significant stresses for a variety of agricultural crops. To combat cold stress, resilient plants can undergo cold acclimation, a process involving intricately programmed genetic, metabolic, and physiological changes. Ice-binding proteins (IBPs), if present, are upregulated under cold stress and present great biotechnological potential for their ability to protect crops against pathogen-associated freezing damage responsible for widespread economic devastation. Until recently, functional investigation of IBPs via knockdown had not been attempted in any organism, but it was accomplished for the first time in the model crop, Brachypodium distachyon, which has emerged as an ideal experimental system for low temperature tolerance in plants. B. distachyon itself has no economical value of more than an invasive weed; however, the use as a model crop refers to the ease of use for research in place of typical crop species. These first IBP knockdowns proved problematic likely due to the pleiotropic effects of constitutive miRNA expression. Here I present a new strategy to generate transgenic B. distachyon containing a temporal miRNA-facilitated IBP knockdown wholly generated without using tissue culture or traditional genotyping techniques. Plants with temporal knockdown of IBPs confirmed the functional importance of IBPs under cold stress, without other obvious pleiotropic effects. Wildtype plants that had not been cold acclimated produced low, basal levels of IBP expression, suggesting that IBPs may be constitutively expressed for developmental needs and only upregulated under cold stress for protective measures.  Although it could not be included as part of this thesis, preliminary assessment of the plasma membrane proteome showed that IBPs do not localize to the plasma membrane, with some potential new protein candidates for future studies on cold stress highlighted. Perhaps most importantly, the methods employed here for transgenic plant generation present an unprecedented level of processivity and low cost so that studies on these many newly identified proteins are now feasible. Thus, an additional legacy of this thesis could be an increasing accessibility and attractiveness of transgenic monocot research in the crucial years to come for humanity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the 1950s, China’s household registration system (hukou) was set up to serve the planned economy, becoming in turn a vital tool to manage migration. After the launching of Reform and Opening policies in 1978, the planned economy receded yet the Chinese government refused to loosen control of migration due to the fear of instability, especially as millions of migrant workers began to enter the large cities in the late 1980s. Thus, the hukou system was maintained and continues to operate effectively today. The hukou system has resulted in circumstances where more than 288 million migrants reside in cities where they do not hold local hukou, restricting their access to public services such as education. At the same time local governments are unwilling to share the publicly funded educational resources that urban residents have enjoyed since the 1950s. &#xD;
National legislation making primary school education compulsory, together with a system of college entrance examinations linked to the hukou system, force migrants to choose between leaving their children behind in rural areas or taking their offspring to the cities where they will face difficulties in receiving adequate education. This entire institutional system has created the current phenomenon of China’s more than 100 million left-behind children and migrant children and resulted in inequitable access to education for left-behind and migrant children in comparison to urban-registered children.&#xD;
Aside from the institutional system, China’s central government and many local authorities have implemented various provisional policies intended to control migration during the past forty years. As the principle of migration control is prioritized over other policies, the system of restrictions has been strengthened and inequity in education has been further solidified. &#xD;
This thesis is based on documentary analysis supplemented by field research on the plight of left-behind children, conducted by the author through interviews of teachers and young adults who had been left-behind as children.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Partnered with the Nunavut community of Gjoa Haven on King William Island, a large-scale Genome Canada project, the Towards a Sustainable Fishery for Nunavummiut (TSFN) project endeavoured to integrate Inuit traditional knowledge and practices with genomic and microbial analyses to assess the sustainability and health of the Coregonus species complex (CSC) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) fisheries. Encompassed within the goals of the project, fish health was assessed based on microbial diversity and condition factor (K) of the sampled fish. In this region, sampled CSC, which included lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) as well as two cisco species (C. autumnalis and C. sardinella) and Arctic char displayed anadromy, transitioning annually from the ocean to freshwater lakes and rivers. Inuit fishers collected samples from the ocean, rivers, and lakes in different seasons, and microbiomes from these salmonids were characterized with respect to changing seasonal habitats. Skin- and intestine-associated microbiomes were characterized through amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Overall, lake whitefish, ciscoes, and Arctic char skin-associated microbiota grouped separately in ordination based on salinity while cisco and Arctic char grouped based on seasonal habitat. Higher Shannon diversity in autumn and spring freshwater habitats suggested a transitional state in the autumn riverine and spring lacustrine environments. Core microbiomes, representing taxa found in at least 50% of samples, were also identified within seasonal habitats. Comparison of skin- and intestine-associated core microbiota showed differences in composition across seasonal habitats. Condition factor (K) remained consistent across seasonal habitats for cisco, was higher for lake whitefish in the lacustrine environment, and progressively decreased for char from ocean, to riverine, to overwintering habitat. There was some evidence of dysbiosis in the microbiota of lake whitefish, which may be associated with stress as these fish are at the northern limits of their range. In contrast, cisco and Arctic char appeared to have more stable communities, possibly displaying resilience towards anadromy within the high Arctic. Overall, these findings may inform sustainable fishery practices in regard to how microbiomes respond to stress and what factors may put these fish at risk of pathogen colonization throughout their migrations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Community-dwelling older adults rate ascending and descending stairs among the top five most difficult daily tasks, likely a result of bodily deterioration due to normal aging. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a chronic prevalent condition and when combined with the normal aging process results in more significant deterioration throughout the sensorimotor and musculoskeletal systems, significantly affecting balance control. The purpose of this study was to investigate postural control differences during stair ascent between people with DM2 and an age-matched control group under three conditions: without additional challenge, with a cognitive challenge, and with a motor challenge, and to investigate which measure of centre of mass (CoM) –body or trunk– is more sensitive to changes in postural control during stair ascent. &#xD;
Methods: Fifteen older adults (¬≥ 65 years) with DM2 and fifteen healthy age-matched controls were recruited. Data were  collected by an OPTOTRAK motion capture system as participants climbed a four-step staircase without hand support at a self-selected pace. Cognitive and motor tasks were added to assess their ability to multitask. The cognitive task involved serial subtraction by three’s and the motor task involved carrying an empty laundry basket. Outcome measures included: body and trunk measures of CoM (RMS, RMS velocity, and peak-to-peak displacement), RMS of centre of pressure, head and trunk stiffening, and gait velocity. &#xD;
Results: In both groups, gait velocity during stair ascent decreased during the basket and cognitive conditions when compared to the control condition. The trunk peak-to-peak CoM measure was more sensitive than the body CoM to changes measure under the cognitive condition, with no between-group differences identified.&#xD;
Conclusion: The ability of individuals with and without DM2 to maintain postural control during stair ascent with the addition of the secondary task may be attributed to a slower gait velocity. When a cognitive task was added to stair ascent, the measure of trunk CoM displacement was more sensitive to changes when compared to the measure of body CoM displacement, indicating that individuals with DM2 did not change their use of postural control strategies when compared to the healthy control participants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recycling lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and using their recovered materials to make new ones has many economic, social, and environmental benefits. The greatest benefits come from recycling metals from  cathode active materials (CAMs), for example Li, Ni, Co, and Mn from NCM111 (a common electric vehicle CAM). Hydrometallurgical recycling processes, in which CAMs are leached and metals are extracted from the pregnant leach solution (PLS), are favoured because they can recover all metals. Due to the hazards of leaching with strong acids, organic acids are becoming preferred lixiviants; however, they are expensive. In this work, two green chemistry hydrometallurgy processes were developed to recycle CAMs from LIBs. Both processes regenerate organic acid lixiviant, have high Li, Ni, Co, and Mn recoveries, and produce sodium-free Li2CO3.&#xD;
In the first process, Donnan Dialysis is used to extract Li, then Ni, Co, and Mn, as well as to reprotonate organic acid in PLS. Donnan Dialysis combined with bicarbonation and decarbonation is used to produce Li2CO3 from the Li extract. Heating is not required in the process. Mass balances, charge balances, and mass flux equations were developed. Experiments were performed to obtain mass transfer coefficients. The process was simulated and the results were: recoveries of 94.1% for Li and 99.4% for Ni, Co, and Mn and 98.9% of organic acid reprotonated. &#xD;
In the second process, formic acid was used to leach NCM111 while simultaneously precipitating Ni, Co, and Mn formate salts. These salts were reacted with sulphuric acid to yield mixed Ni, Co, and Mn sulphate salts and formic acid, which was evaporated. The PLS was saturated with Li2CO3, which precipitated residual Ni, Co, and Mn, and was filtered then dewatered. The LiCOOH salts obtained were thermally decomposed in air to 99.97 wt% Li2CO3. Recoveries of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn were 100%. The process produces neither solid nor liquid waste. By condensing vapours from dewatering and evaporation steps, 66% of the water and 57% of the formic acid needed for leaching can be recovered for reuse. Mixed Ni, Co, and Mn sulphate salts and Li2CO3 can be used to make new LIBs.</dcterms:abstract>
