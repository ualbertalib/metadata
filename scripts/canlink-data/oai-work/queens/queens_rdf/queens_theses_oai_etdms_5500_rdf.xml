      <dcterms:abstract>Undiscovered ore bodies have become increasingly more difficult to target, requiring new exploration techniques to pinpoint the undercover location. Sedimentary overburden in regions of intense glaciation have made exploration difficult, relying on dispersal-trains for evidence of mineralization. The focus of this study is on the silt-clay sized material as significant proportions of indicators of mineralization found in dispersal-trains could be contained within that fraction. This smaller size-fraction could improve spatial distances associated with ore body’s dispersal-trains and decrease exploration costs/time. This research examines the physical processes of mineral dispersal in the &lt;63 µm size-fraction of till, analyzing individual fractions from 45-63, 20-45 and &lt;20 µm. The laboratory research and field orientation case-study, was investigated by Queen’s University in collaboration with the GSC, to develop novel methods to examine and characterize the &lt;63µm heavy mineral fraction of till. The research is broken down into 3 parts: 1) development of methods for separation of the &lt;63µm size-fraction of HMC by experimenting with settings (mode/oscillation and flow-rate) using HydroseparatorTM technology based on different mineral densities and grain size 2) development of methods for the representative sampling of the &lt;63 µm size-fraction of sperrylite in blank light-fraction till using controlled and real separation techniques; and 3) application of methods to real till samples collected from the southern Core Zone (Northern Québec, Labrador, Newfoundland). Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy used in conjunction with Mineral Liberation Analysis was used to characterize the modal mineralogy of each sample. A comparative study analyzed the difference between the &lt;63µm fraction (Queen’s University) and the &gt;63 µm fraction (ODM). Many indicator minerals in bedrock sources are &lt;0.25 mm and are rarely characterized in glacial sediments because of our inability to separate, visualize, and chemically analyze these small mineral grains. Using the &lt;63 µm size-fraction, along with glacial history, dispersal-trains can be detected from distal regions aiding in exploration targeting below surface deposits. Past studies have begun to examine grains of similar size however, the approach used in this study differs from techniques previously used and could expand the usefulness of HMC for exploring mineral deposits within glaciated terrain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis explores low power communication blocks for applications in biotelemetry. As wireless networks become more prevalent and demand for sensor networks increases, so does the need for low power wireless communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, a microwave wake-up receiver (WuRx) for biotelemetry applications is presented using 130 nm CMOS technology.   The receiver is designed to operate at 7.6 GHz and measured results show that it has a sensitivity of -40 dBm while drawing just 3 uA from a 0.5 V supply. The presented work has the smallest known area and exhibits a competitive trade off between DC power, sensitivity, and bit rate.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Second, a Frequency Modulated Ultra-Wideband (FM-UWB) receiver optimized for low power and fast start-up is also presented in 130nm CMOS. The receiver consists of a front end amplifier converting a frequency modulated (FM) signal to an amplitude modulated (AM) signal which is applied to an envelope detector. The receiver front end is for 500 MHz channels in the 3-4.5 GHz range. The Amplifier uses passive gain and four cascaded gain stages to achieve high RF gain without the need for super-regeneration and simplify the architecture this way, the front end has a 5 us wake-up time to enable efficient duty-cycling. The measured front end receives a signal at -68 dBm while consuming 600 uW of power (excluding a test buffer) from a 1 V supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
Last, a Frequency Modulated Ultra-Wideband (FM-UWB) transmitter optimised for low power consumption is presented.  The chip includes a sub oscillator tunable from 0.1 to 4 MHz, a radio frequency oscillator tunable from 3.0 to 4.5 GHz, and an output power amplifier with matching network. Depending on channel selected, the measured transmitter consumes between 440 uW and 640 uW of power to produce - 14 dBm continuously to a 50 Ohm load, which is the lowest reported power. Two power supplies are used to reduce the effect of wasted voltage headroom between circuit blocks. Fabrication was done using the IBM 130 nm CMOS technology on a 1mm x 1mm loose die, the the circuit occupies 0.2 mm2 which is a tie for the smallest area.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The inefficient use of the limited spectrum resources caused by the widely used static spectrum assignment policy has inspired the conception of the cognitive radio network (CRN). A CRN enables mobile users to optimally adapt their operating parameters according to the interactions with the surrounding radio environment. However, existing dynamic spectrum assignment approaches, a key component in CRN, suffer from their complexity, inflexibility, and lack of support for different classes of users.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we address the above issues by developing a heuristic-based dynamic spectrum sharing framework that can improve spectrum utilization efficiency and throughput in a CRN. Our framework consists of three parts. The first part addresses spectrum assignment that allocates new users to vacant spectrum bands without impeding existing users, for which a customized genetic algorithm is introduced. The second part focuses on the migration option where sometimes it might be beneficial for an existing user to move to a different spectrum band or disconnect to make room for a new user. This problem is solved by using a simulated annealing (SA) approach. In addition, we construct a migration cost model and study the impact of different traffic classes that are defined based on transmission rate requirements. The third part of our framework builds on the migration model and develops a round-based assignment approach that employs a prediction model to estimate when admitted users are likely to leave the network and uses the information to improve the migration decision. The prediction model relies on three newly constructed prediction methods to forecast user call duration, the fixation approach, the convergence approach, and the window-shopping approach, with each requiring less and less knowledge about user call preferences. Additionally, a price-based classification of user call characteristics is introduced. &#xD;
&#xD;
Compared to other dynamic assignment approaches, our framework considers both overlay and underlay cases, offers a bounded response time and can work with different objective functions. It also considers user call characteristics and can accurately predict migration probability under various traffic conditions. Our simulation results show significant performance improvement in throughput and network utilization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 2016, Digital Learning for Development and All Children Reading released a “Grand Challenge for Development” urging researchers to explore the barriers that children with sensory disabilities in the Philippines face regarding learning how to read. Close to half a million people are blind and many more have low vision in the Philippines. The primary goal of this study was to engage in the co-design process to create a device to help children in the Philippines and Canada with visual impairments learn braille. &#xD;
&#xD;
Questionnaires that aimed to identify the barriers of using existing devices for reading were released to participants in the Philippines and Canada. Results showed that problems with existing devices were associated with device accessibility, portability, durability, usability and function. Participant feedback was further analyzed and incorporated in the brainstorming of a device that could help teach braille to children with visual impairments in the Philippines and Canada. Using results from a weighted evaluation matrix analysis and feedback from partners in the Philippines and Canada who taught reading to persons with visual impairments, a design was selected to prototype. Two prototypes were created. The most current prototype was an interactive pegboard that mimicked four braille cells. The device asked the user to form a letter or spell a four-letter word in braille using pegs, then either congratulated or corrected the user depending on the user’s performance. Usability testing showed that participants liked the device and found it easy to use and interactive. Suggestions for improvement included adding various modes for users of varying reading levels, reducing the size, weight and cost of the device and adding a headphone port. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results from this study highlight advantages of engaging in the co-design process and provide important data for other researchers developing devices for persons with visual impairments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Computer experiments are utilized as a popular tool of studying the relationship between responses and the factors that affect them. They are widely used in scientific researches and applications. Dynamic computer experiments refer to computer experiments with time-series responses. Different dynamic computer models have been proposed to emulate the relationship between the time-series responses and the corresponding quantitative factors. Qualitative factors are also widely used and show important effects in many scientific problems. Different models have been proposed for one-dimensional outputs and both quantitative and qualitative factors. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we have reviewed some popular dynamic computer models with only quantitative factors. We make empirical comparisons of the prediction accuracy of three existing dynamic computer models with only quantitative factors. Among the three models, the dynamic linear Gaussian process model and the singular value decomposition based Gaussian process model outperform. Based on these two models, we incorporate the qualitative factors utilizing the additive correlation structure and propose two new modelling methods for dynamic computer experiments with both quantitative and qualitative factors. We also explored the different choices of the prior distributions for the unknown parameters in these two models. The prediction accuracy of the two proposed modelling approaches is tested by a limited simulation study.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Makerspaces exist in public and private institutions as informal spaces where participants create tools to solve problems. Generally, makerspaces focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and as a result, tend to be installed more frequently in science-related institutions (e.g. science centres). Historical institutions on the other hand, have not been afforded the same opportunity. The purpose of this case study was to describe how a makerspace functions as a learning space in a historical institution. To develop a holistic understanding of the participants’ experiences within the makerspace, a descriptive explanatory single case study is presented in this paper. This addresses the research questions: 1) How do participants describe their experiences with the program?; 2) When participants partake in the makerspace environment, what does their behaviour look like?; and 3) What do participants describe as their learning gains? The findings suggest that makerspaces in historical institutions allow for positive social behaviours, and learning gains, but they do not show significant historical learning gains. These findings are discussed by comparing what the literature suggested would occur when a makerspace was brought into a museum to the results from the study. Future research needs to explore what program elements would be beneficial in creating a stronger tie between history through making activities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Android devices remain an attractive mobile malware target in recent years. Android applications (or simply apps) in the device are vulnerable to diﬀerent attacks which can tamper with the execution of an app to change app behavior so that it performs harm to users or can debug an app to steal private data (source code, user data and behavior). Android app protection is necessary to defend app behavior integrity and protect app privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
The app cache, where the app actually runs, is vulnerable to being tampered with. Cache tampering allows for the same behavioral changes as piggybacking. Piggybacking an app is to repackage an legitimate app with extra code that can perform malicious acts after installation, such as stealing user sensitive data or displaying unsolicited advertisements. The cache loading process of Android Runtime (ART) can be exploited by cache tampering attacks without rebooting the device.&#xD;
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) full enforcement has been deployed in the Android platform since Android 5, which enhances the security of Android platform and decreases the security concerns apps should take care of at the same time. Therefore, apps are vulnerable to being debugged in an insecure Android environment such as an emulator or a device with a rooted Android ROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
We present a comprehensive app protection approach using anti-tampering and anti-debugging techniques. We implement separate solutions in terms of two protections against tampering and debugging. We maintain the integrity of app cache&#xD;
and implement a lightweight cache protection solution for anti-tampering. We collect debugging points of ART and protect them at runtime from being tampered with. Our solution can be deployed easily across diﬀerent Android ART-based platforms with little eﬀort. App developers are able to use our techniques to protect their apps.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Food insecurity, the limited or uncertain ability to access sufficient and acceptable foods, remains a persistent problem. Societal responses have been based on partial understandings of the causes and dimensions of food insecurity. In this research I seek to examine how neoliberalism shapes individual and societal responses to food insecurity, to help to identify underlying causes that could guide effective policy. &#xD;
	This research begins with people’s lived experiences of and self-reported strategies for navigating among personal, private sector, charitable and state resources for managing food insecurity. Through an ethnographic approach that includes participant observation and 51 semi-structured interviews, I investigate how individuals at risk for food insecurity in Kingston, Ontario, Canada and Havana, Cuba manage the day-to-day work of putting food on the table. Using a Bourdieuian logic of practice framework, this research explores the strategies people use to avoid and to manage food insecurity in countries that sit in different relationships to global neoliberalism. &#xD;
	I advance several findings based on this research. First and foremost, the experience of food insecurity is inextricably linked to other aspects of poverty and deprivation. Second, precariousness appears to be a significant determinant and dimension of food insecurity. Finally, while socially networked strategies for managing food insecurity have some benefits, they do not provide sufficient protection against episodic food insecurity, and in fact may exacerbate unequal access to resources for managing and avoiding food insecurity. &#xD;
	This research supports existing recommendations that policy addressing food insecurity be a joined-up policy that combats multiple dimensions of poverty and inequality. This research also suggests that policy to address food insecurity must counter the effects of precariousness that characterizes both the neoliberal state in Canada and the neoliberalizing state in Cuba. A guarantee of adequate income will be a fundamental step in addressing this. People at risk for food insecurity should be supported in continuing to exercise the effective skills they already use for avoiding food insecurity and managing the work of putting food on the table. &#xD;
	Further qualitative research is needed to understand the multiple dimensions of food insecurity and its specific manifestations in different countries.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Partial migration, which occurs when only some animals in a population migrate, is ubiquitous.  However, despite numerous studies investigating how partially migratory systems are controlled, we know relatively little about what determines whether an individual migrates.  In this thesis, I investigate ecological factors and individual characteristics shaping alternative migratory strategies in a partially migratory population of western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana).  &#xD;
&#xD;
First, I ask whether sex, age, or body size are related to variation in migration behaviour.  Using hydrogen isotopes in claw tissue to infer migratory strategy, I show that young bluebirds, particularly young females, are less likely to migrate than older birds, and that bluebirds mate assortatively by migratory strategy.  I also demonstrate that some bluebirds switch strategies between years, indicating that migratory behaviour is not under strict genetic control.  Second, I ask whether individual differences in diet could lead to variation in migratory strategy.  Using nitrogen and carbon isotopes in feathers, I show that the diet of resident males during fall moult differs from that of resident females and migrants of both sexes.  Responses to experimentally presented novel foods suggest this variation could be due to differences in behaviour: resident males are less hesitant to eat novel insects than migrant males, but the opposite is true of females.  Finally, I ask whether two personality traits, boldness and aggression, differ with migratory strategy.  I show that residents are bolder than migrants, but there is no difference between groups in aggression.  However, resident bluebirds from BC are more aggressive than resident bluebirds from California.  &#xD;
&#xD;
My results indicate that social influences, variation in diet, and personality traits may all play a role in determining whether bluebirds migrate.  They also imply that different factors may shape migratory strategies in males and females.  Overall, my research emphasizes the necessity of examining a wide variety of ecological factors and individual characteristics when attempting to determine how partially migratory systems are controlled.  The flexibility of these systems suggests they are likely to shift as a result of global environmental change.  To better predict their responses, an understanding of factors driving variation in migratory strategy is essential.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Out of necessity, plant nutrient requirements must be locally met, which explains the importance of soil fertility and soil microbial community structure. It is thus vital to understand the impact of climate change and technological breakthroughs on the microbes associated with natural vegetation and our crops. This thesis attempts to address these questions with two distinct investigations.&#xD;
 In the first investigation, soil communities were examined in long-term maintained fertilizer and warming treatments in the Arctic tundra. The microbiomes associated with Arctic birch (Betula glandulosa) within the 5 treatment plots (control, high nitrogen (N), high phosphate (P), high N+P, and warming) near Daring Lake, NWT were sampled. Microbiome analysis of bacterial and fungal communities, using 16s rRNA and ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) analysis respectively, showed differences in bacterial communities with an increase in the family Xanthomonadaceae present in the N plus P treatment, while control and warming treatments showed similar soil and rhizosphere microbiome structures. There was an increase in Thelephora fungi in the high P treatment. &#xD;
In the second chapter, microbial communities and plant growth were monitored after treatment with nano-phosphate fertilizer. Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) has been cited as more environmentally friendly and efficient than traditional fertilization with inorganic phosphate (P2O5). The needle-like nHA was used to evaluate the impact on early microbiome establishment in soybean (Glycine max) and in the soil, in an agriculturally realistic manner, utilizing 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Little difference was found in the soil structure and rhizosphere microbiomes between controls and nHA treatments. Growth experiments implementing nHA at agricultural recommended levels of P2O5, added to soil at the time of planting, did not show a significant increase in growth, biomass, or yield compared with P-deprived controls, suggesting that the nHA used here did not function as an effective fertilizer. The effectiveness of nano-fertilizers is likely influenced by their physicochemical properties (i.e. shape and surface) and their interactions with the soil matrix, making it important to evaluate these factors when designing new nano-phosphate fertilizers. Traditional P fertilization as used in the Daring Lake plots, was more effective, with a higher impact on the associated microbial community structure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Raglan Mine is located on the Ungava peninsula, Québec, Canada. It’s a Ni-Cu-PGE magmatic sulphide deposit undergoing brownfield exploration. Given the available data from Raglan Mine and the underutilization of geophysical data integration in mineral exploration, this thesis’ purpose is to investigate the utility of data integration. Specifically, four objectives are set to integrate petrophysical and geophysical data in forward and inversion modelling of Zone 5-8 at Raglan Mine. The first two objectives are met through forward modelling a 3D geological model. Magnetic and gravity forward models are compared to observed data. The major outcome establishes a macro-magnetic susceptibility maximum for the ultramafic of 0.31 SI. Vertical gravity modelling shows lows over sediments, and highs over basalts and an intermediate high over the ultramafic. Additionally, the resolvability of ore targets is investigated, showing that these targets are unresolvable using airborne and terrestrial magnetic and gravity methods. These results are incorporated in inversion modelling. Inversion modelling is an optimization problem, which is non-unique, meaning many solutions could fit. This issue is mitigated through constraints from input data and reference models (cooperative inversion). Objectives 3 and 4 are met by running single parameter and cooperative inversions. Outcomes of single parameter inversions show that magnetic inversions are effective in outlining the UM unit to a depth of ~1000-1250m with a cut off of 0.05 SI. Single parameter gravity gradient inversions outline lower density sediments and higher density basalts. The ultramafic is outlined to depths of ~560-910m (cut off 0-0.3 g/cm3) after which ambiguity exists due to density overlap with basalt. Gravity gradient inversions are enhanced through the cooperative magnetic isosurface reference model, which also balances out the impact of the surface geology constraint. The gravity gradient isosurface constraint on the cooperative magnetic inversion causes the ultramafic limbs to diverge. Overall, forward modelling is able to approximate observed data, and single parameter and cooperative inversion modelling are able to position the magnetic ultramafic and higher and lower density sediments and basalts in geologically and geophysically logical&#xD;
locations. This approach has promising applications in other zones.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Falling is a serious issue among adults over the age of 65 as the incidence and impact of falls rapidly increases with age. Traditionally, exercise interventions have proven to be effective in improving balance and strength, and in reducing the number and risk of falls. More recently, the use of gaming and virtual reality technologies have been shown to be more engaging and effective than typical exercises alone. Using the Nintendo  Wii Balance Board  and customized software, a stepping game was developed that has previously been able to identify difference in performance between healthy participants and participants with conditions that affect balance, but the game has not been tested longitudinally. &#xD;
The objectives of this study were to investigate the stepping game system for its efficacy as a supplemental balance therapy by evaluating functional outcomes and participant satisfaction; to further evaluate the stepping game as a measurement tool to quantify longitudinal changes in balance by identifying trends in performance; and to examine the presence of a possible learning effect with the technology. The stepping game was integrated into two older adult exercise classes and functional outcomes were compared between control groups, who participated in the weekly exercise class, and test groups, who received supplemental therapy with the stepping game system. It was then integrated into two additional exercise programs to analyse trends in game performance over an 8 or 10-week period.&#xD;
The results of the pre-post study regarding using the stepping game as a therapy were inconclusive. The game was able to identify statistically significant changes in performance measures (response time, reaction time and step time) for some participants over the span of the exercise program; however, a larger same size and a stricter protocol is necessary to evaluate the clinical significance. One participant's improvement in balance was reflected in both game performance and change in Berg Balance Scale score, highlighting the potential usefulness of the game as an assessment tool. A learning effect with the technology was also identified for some participants. Lastly, there were mixed responses regarding engagement as using the game every week became repetitive and boring.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) are considered to be the most sustainable technology for small, rural and remote communities in North America. However, due to the configuration of WSPs and limited control over these systems, performance concerns during certain parts of the year may arise, as elevated temperature and extended hydraulic retention time (HRT) could stimulate excessive algal growth that results in sustained high pH levels in the system and effluent. Amherstview Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) in Amherstview, Ontario frequently experiences high pH effluent during the summer and is assessing the potential of a constructed wetland (CW) system to mitigate these &#xD;
operational issues. In order to design a CW, a bench-scale experiment was conducted to identify the best available substrates and operational conditions in the laboratory. A short-term assessment of four substrates followed by long-term monitoring of the two most promising substrates was undertaken under different HRTs and organic loading rates (OLRs). The results showed that peat exhibited the best pH attenuation capacity, and the pH attenuation performance could be substantially improved when the OLR was increased over 70 mg/L COD with a HRT longer than 4 days. The feasibility of this CW system was further tested in the field over the span of a year to investigate the nutrients removal efficiencies, as well as to evaluate the effects ofsubstrate and vegetation on the wetland system using authentic secondary effluents from &#xD;
the Amherstview WPCP. The results showed that all treatment systems could attenuate the pH level during both the start-up and operational periods, while significant nutrient removal performance could only be observed during the operational period. The results of the bench-scale and small-scale studies provided useful information for the design of the pilot-scale CW. The pilot-scale CW was successfully designed and established at the Amherstview WPCP. Overall, this newly designed free water surface (FWS) CW was highly effective at retaining phosphate (PO4-P) and total phosphorus (TP), and fairly effective at removing nitrate (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN). It is anticipated that the treatment performance of this CW could further improve when the CW becomes more mature.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is organized into four chapters; an introduction, two distinct empirical research studies, and a reflection piece on the research process. The first empirical study (Chapter 2) examines the effects of external government demands for accountability reporting, as witnessed by Indigenous individuals who work and live in First Nations communities. The chapter sheds light on the personal interpretive schemes that individuals employ to make-sense of accountability and reporting in their social context. The findings indicate that individual perceptions about accountability vary according to the participant’s personal background and their role in the community (i.e. administrative manager vs political leader). The attitudes of managers about their political leaders were found to contain commonalities to the attitudes expressed in the historic accounts of former government agents (i.e. Indian Agents) who had once managed First Nations communities on behalf of the “Indian Department”. The second study (Chapter 3) examines how budgets and budgeting in the Canadian government’s Grants and Contributions Program govern financial transfer payments to Indigenous recipient groups. The study indicates how budgeting practices allow government agencies to reinforce the dominant-subordinate social relationship that has long existed between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups in colonial settings. The budgeting structure retains characteristics of historic colonial forms, originally intended to contain, control and assimilate the Indigenous population of Canada. Two key outcomes of the chapter are that Indigenous populations have little choice but to cooperate with government imposed funding requirements and that they retain a sense of agency through small acts of resistance against government funding agencies. Finally, Chapter 4 reflects on my experiences as an Indigenous field researcher while investigating the accountability relationships between First Nations populations and government agencies. The chapter shows how reflexive strategies were employed to ensure quality control over the collection and analysis of qualitative information. The chapter suggests strategies for future qualitative research projects, conducted in Indigenous contexts, that may benefit from reflexive practices. Overall, the dissertation extends accounting and Indigenous research streams and informs contextual accounting and Indigenous research on the potential of reflexivity as a strategy for conducting qualitative inquiry and in the construction of knowledge.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Successful population establishment, subsequent population dynamics, and extinction have all repeatedly been shown to be affected by the quantity of initial colonists. However, there are other, less studied factors that could determine population success, including the physiological condition in which colonists arrive (‘quality’), and the frequency with which they arrive (‘arrival frequency’). While all of these factors can individually drive the dynamics and extinction of new populations, we do not understand which has the strongest influence, nor the circumstances under which their relative importance may change. In this thesis, I examined the importance of different combinations of colonizer characteristics for population success, and how their importance varied between species and individuals. In my first experiment, I showed that population size, not arrival frequency, was the primary factor determining the survival and performance of introduced populations of Hemimysis anomala. In my second experiment, I found that the population dynamics of Daphnia pulicaria were only influenced by colonist quality, while the establishment of Skistodiaptomus oregonensis was more strongly influenced by arrival frequency. Finally, I showed that the benefits of increasing colonist quantity and genetic diversity can change based on colonist identity. For some Daphnia pulex colonists, higher quantities or genetic diversities improved their success, while in others there was little effect. I also conducted an additional project that examined the mechanisms driving human-mediated dispersal. Colonization is a shared and integral process across ecological disciplines, and our current understanding of the mechanisms involved is founded on research of both ‘natural’ and ‘human-mediated’ colonization. This project integrates the biological- and human-based processes involved in human-mediated dispersal, and develops a general framework outlining the mechanisms that determine which individuals enter, survive, and exit from human vectors. Overall, my work highlights the necessity of considering multiple colonist characteristics, and pre-arrival processes, to understand, predict, and control colonization, and that the value of particular characteristics is not necessarily consistent across species and individuals.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wild parsnip is an invasive plant that has serious health risks to humans due to the toxin in its sap. Monitoring its presence and spread has been challenging for conservation authorities due to its small size and irregular shape. On traditional remotely-sensed images acquired by satellites or airplanes, wild parsnip cannot be distinguished from other vegetation due to low spatial resolution of the imagery. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can obtain ultra-high resolution (UHR) imagery and have been used for vegetation-related monitoring in both environmental and agricultural applications in recent years. In this study, UAV images captured at Lemoine Point Conservation Area in Kingston, Ontario, are used to test a methodology for distinguishing wild parsnip. The objective of this study is to develop an efficient invasive wild parsnip classification workflow based on UHR digital UAV imagery. The challenge is that all processing options are based only on visible bands information (RGB) of the digital cameras on UAV, which means there is no infrared spectral information to use. The UAV image processing flow included image orientation, digital elevation model (DEM) and digital surface model (DSM) extractions, individual orthophoto production, and orthomosaic generation processing using Simactive’s software. Three vegetation indices and three texture features are calculated and the first two significant features are added to the mosaicked images. The Random Forest algorithm with relevant variables is used as the classifier to distinguish wild parsnip plants from other vegetation types. The optimal image resolution in parsnip analyses are undertaken by comparing accuracy assessments. The results provide an executable workflow to distinguish wild parsnip and show that UAV images, with a simple digital-light camera, are an appropriate and economic resource for small and irregular vegetation detection. The combined method yields reliable and valid outcomes in detecting wild parsnip plants and shows good performance in mapping vegetation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the Fall of 1655, Queen Christina of Sweden (1626-1689)-the former ruler of a Lutheran nation-crossed into the Papal States as Pope Alexander VII Chigi's (1599-1667) most important Catholic convert. Her arrival was his personal victory over the Protestant Reformation (1517-1521), giving rise to a series of elaborate celebrations that lasted weeks. On the road to Rome, status, prestige, respect and hospitality were expressed through extravagant performances of power, which included ephemera, art objects, music, dance, poetry, and food. They played a central role in introducing the queen to the riches of her new homeland while also allowing the queen to carve out a unique position of importance at Pope Alexander VII's court. This dissertation explores ephemera's role in shaping Queen Christina's first journey to Rome, a short period of time filled with festivities that were as opulent as they were political. Printed treatises, drawings, and never-before published records of these sumptuous gatherings reveal how such seemingly frivolous and indulgent celebrations in fact helped establish a new social hierarchy, which inserted the queen into the competitive world of seventeenth-century Rome. Decorative objects set new rules of decorum into motion and mediated social relationships like props on a stage. Imbued with the power to reflect the social statuses of those present, Pope Alexander VII spent exorbitant sums of money on staging these elaborate performances. Procuring only the highest quality materials, provisions and hiring skilled servants as well as actors, artisans and artists of the highest calibre to participate in her grand welcome, ephemera left a powerful mark on nearly all aspects of urban life. The most important palazzi (palaces) and piazze (public squares) were transformed into monumental stages where every citizen of Rome-men and women, rich and poor, young and old-participated. From Ferrara to the tiny town of Terni, ephemeral artworks were hand crafted, and displayed as tools the court of Rome used to perform their statuses. They were used to transform Queen Christina of Sweden into Rome's "regina" (its "pseudo-queen").</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Algonquin Park (herein called the “Park”) is one of only two parks in Ontario that allows private cottages, with the first leases offered in 1905. In total, 22 lakes in the Park have a total of 303 cottage lots in their catchments, with 326 cottages holding commercial leases. In addition to the cottages, the Park has 12 campgrounds that are accessible by car, with over 1200 campsites. With the recent decision to extend leases until December 31st 2038, the provincial government is gathering information to determine if water quality has been adversely affected by current shoreline development. Furthermore, long-term data on cumulative impacts from multiple stressors are scarce in the Park, and so paleolimnological data and modeling are used here to provide information on: 1) how these lakes have changed since pre-industrial times, relative to a set of reference lakes; and 2) the sensitivity of the lakes to increased nutrient loading. This thesis has two separate but related research chapters. The first chapter focuses on diatom assemblages preserved in the modern (surface) and pre-industrial (bottom) sediment intervals of the 53 study lakes (i.e. 22 lakes that support shoreline cottages, and 31 lakes that are used as reference sites) to help determine whether the present-day limnological conditions differ from pre-industrial conditions, and if so, to examine the nature and magnitude of these diatom changes. This study tracks increases in the relative abundance of Asterionella formosa and Discostella diatom taxa since pre-industrial (ca. A.D. 1850) times in both cottage and reference lakes in Algonquin Park, that are likely due to climatically-induced limnological changes associated with longer ice-free periods and/or longer periods of thermal stratification. No clear signal linked to the cottages could be determined. The second chapter uses the Lakeshore Capacity Model (LCM), developed by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, to calculate total phosphorus (TP) budgets for the 53 Algonquin Park study lakes, and assesses the relative sensitivity of these lakes to increased phosphorus loading. When applied to the study lakes, the LCM suggests that current TP concentrations in the lakes are below the Provincial Water Quality Objective (PWQO) for TP for lakes within the Precambrian Shield, with the majority of lakes showing low to moderate sensitivity to TP loading. Collectively, my studies show that cottages do not appear to have significantly altered the lakes in Algonquin Park; however, with the prevalence of multiple environmental stressors in a warming climate, a precautionary approach should be taken when considering the management of these lakes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A major problem in public health is low participation in physical activity. Games incorporating physical activity, exergames, have potential to combat this issue because they are engaging. A primary quality that makes games engaging is agency, the ability to make choices. Agency poses challenges to the design and play of exergames. First, exercise can be so rigid that it is challenging to design exergames that provide agency. Second, people have a fundamental agency to choose to play an exergame or not, and how long, how often, and how vigorously to play them. It is challenging to motivate people to play and keep playing exergames to reap health benefits.&#xD;
	This research explores these challenges through two studies. In the first study, we developed game design techniques to balance agency with the constraints of rigid exercises. We illustrated these techniques through a novel game we developed for muscle-strengthening, Brains &amp; Brawn. Results from the study demonstrated that players experienced agency during gameplay, were incented to exercise with correct form, and showed favourable attitude toward the game. &#xD;
	To address the second challenge, we conducted a six-week nonrandomized control trial that examined adherence behaviours. The study showed that our exergame promoted high adherence levels compared to past interventions. A core motivator that might influence adherence is the potential for social interaction. Thus, we additionally examined agency through the lens of social play by comparing adherence between a single-player and multi-player condition. Social play did not augment adherence. However, players in the multi-player condition who actively engaged in social play (Groupers) had significantly higher adherence than those who did not (Loners). Opposing situations between the multi-player (high Grouper adherence; low Loner adherence) and single-player (low Grouper adherence; high Loner adherence) conditions were a possible reason social play did not augment adherence. The two groups in the multi-player condition differed solely in program belonging, which suggests that forming social groups is important to adherence. Results from the two studies showed that agency can be provided for rigid exercises, exergames can promote high adherence, and fostering a sense of belonging might aid adherence in future studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Street harassment, also known as public harassment, sexual harassment in the public, and stranger harassment, is defined as physical and verbal unwanted behaviours done by a stranger in the public sphere. Sexual harassment in the workplace is defined as unwanted verbal or physical sexual advances and requests for sexual favours that impact an individual's employment or academic performance and create a hostile or offensive environment. Street harassment stands apart from sexual harassment in the workplace because street harassment is usually done in the public sphere by a stranger. In addition, the general public has normalized street harassment where some men perceive it as positive and complimentary. Yet, sexual harassment is perceived as socially unacceptable and illegal. How can these two types of harassment be seen so differently? Moreover, there is limited knowledge on the impact of personality traits on one's attitudes to street harassment. The current study aimed to investigate the definition of street harassment and create an empirical street harassment measure, which currently does not exist in the literature. Furthermore, the relationship of normal personality traits, measured by the HEXACO personality inventory, and of sub-clinical Dark Triad personality traits to men's attitudes of street harassment and sexual harassment was examined. The pilot studies illustrated that a unique set of street harassment behaviours characterized by perpetrator identity and context could not be created; however, a range of harassing behavioural items was created. The main study revealed that Conscientiousness, Openness, Agreeableness, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy personality traits are significant predictors of men's attitudes on a range of harassing behaviours. The findings of this research give rise to some conceptual questions about the street harassment construct and how to better measure the construct. Furthermore, the study informs the discourse surrounding men's attitudes on a range of harassing behaviours by situating the behaviours within the context of both normal personality and a set of socially malevolent traits. These findings provide a greater understanding of the psychological profile of men at risk for engaging in a range of harassing behaviours.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation studies problems of dynamic observation in discrete-event systems.&#xD;
In discrete-event systems, agents exist that observe events generated by a system.&#xD;
The agents have some task to fulfill that requires observing the behaviour of the system, such as control of the system or diagnosis of failures in the system.&#xD;
Traditionally in discrete-event systems, agents observe all occurrences of a given event, or no occurrences of that event.&#xD;
&#xD;
In problems of dynamic observation, certain occurrences of a given event may be observed whereas other occurrences may not be observed.&#xD;
An example scenario of dynamic observation is when an agent uses sensors for observing events which the agent may turn on or off at its leisure.&#xD;
Another example scenario is when the agent receives messages from another agent indicating that certain events in the system have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation studies problems related to the above two scenarios, as well as more general scenarios where dynamic observation occurs.&#xD;
First, we study the problem of computing a finite-state representation of how an agent uses its sensors for making event observations.&#xD;
We show that such a representation may be computed in polynomial-time when certain restrictions on how an agent may use its event sensors are imposed.&#xD;
We show that a simple generalization of these restrictions results in the problem of computing the representation being PSPACE-complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, we study the problem of computing indistinguishable state pairs of finite-state automata.&#xD;
Indistinguishable state pairs are used in the verification of properties involved in solutions to problems of dynamic observation.&#xD;
We demonstrate how indistinguishable state pairs may be computed and how they may be used to verify such properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
Third, we study cases in dynamic observation where observing more event occurrences permits agents to more precisely estimate the state of the system.&#xD;
We apply these results in the solution to a problem where two agents must accomplish their tasks while communicating as little as possible to one another.&#xD;
&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD;
There are two similar but competing legal regimes in the international domain that protect people: human rights law and humanitarian law. Currently, the two regimes are in tension. In the last four decades, international human rights norms have expanded to occupy the field previously dominated by humanitarian law and have become the primary legal regime for governing the use of force in non-international armed conflict. The reasons are the changing nature of warfare and its participants and slow modernization of humanitarian law conventions. The tension has created divergent standards of interpretation of the two regimes, which has led to the inconsistent application of human rights and humanitarian law norms.  Proponents of international human rights law maintain that it is the only regime capable of adequately protecting the victims of violence in non-international armed conflict. They state that the humanitarian law conventions developed to mitigate the deleterious effects of conventional international armed conflict are ineffective in controlling the consequences of contemporary asymmetric warfare. Human rights conventions have much more rigorous protections for those victims, and access to accountability mechanisms. However, the continuing expansion of human rights norms into the realm of armed conflict is ineffective. While humanitarian law norms applicable to non-international armed conflict lack density in topics such the use of lethal force and the treatment of detainees, rejuvenation of humanitarian law would be a more effective solution. Humanitarian norms were specifically developed to moderate the application of lethal means, to protect the victims of armed conflict, and to govern the treatment of detainees. The key to reducing the tension lies in leveraging the fundamental principle of humanity, though the creation of a universal framework for the use of force based on the unifying principle of humanity that would apply to every person, at all times, irrespective of characterization of the conflict. Such a framework must reflect the highest norms of precautions and protection found in both regimes, and must be simple understand and apply.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The spectral energy distributions of galaxies inform us about a galaxy’s stellar populations and interstellar medium, revealing stories of galaxy formation and evolution. How we interpret this light depends in part on our proximity to the galaxy. For nearby galaxies, detailed star formation histories can be extracted from the resolved stellar populations, while more distant galaxies feature the contributions of entire stellar populations within their integrated spectral energy distribution (SED). This thesis aims to resolve whether the techniques used to investigate stellar populations in distant galaxies are consistent with those available for nearby galaxies. As the nearest spiral galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the ideal testbed for the joint study of resolved stellar populations and panchromatic SEDs. We present the Andromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS), which adds new near-UV to near-IR (ugriJKs) imaging using the MegaCam and WIRCam cameras at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope to the available M31 panchromatic dataset. To accurately subtract photometric background from our extremely wide-field (14 square degree) mosaics, we present observing and data reduction techniques with sky-target nodding, optimization of image-to-image surface brightness, and a novel hierarchical Bayesian model to trace the background signal while modelling the astrophysical SED. We model the spectral energy distributions of M31 pixels with MAGPHYS (da Cunha et al. 2008) and compare those results to resolved stellar population models of the same pixels from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey (Williams et al. 2017). We find substantial (0.3 dex) differences in stellar mass estimates despite a common use of the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function. Stellar mass estimated from the resolved stellar population is larger than any mass estimate from SED models or colour-M/L relations (CMLRs). There is also considerable diversity among CMLR estimators, largely driven by differences in the star formation history prior distribution. We find broad consistency between the star formation history estimated by integrated spectral energy distributions and resolved stars. Generally, spectral energy distribution models yield a stronger inside-out radial metallicity gradient and bias towards younger mean ages than resolved stellar population models.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Life history theory seeks to explain how organisms optimize their fitness in the presence of extrinsic and intrinsic challenges. Like many organisms with complex life cycles, holometabolous insects often face different environments and uncertain future conditions as they differentiate and grow. These extrinsic factors interact with tradeoffs within stages, such as the rate of growth and size at each transition point. Here, I study the effects of larval crowding on populations selected for rapid development and extreme early life fertility (FAST) and relaxed development rate and late life fertility (SLOW) during larval and pupal (pre-adult), and adult stages of Drosophila melanogaster. I do so by quantifying pre-adult developmental time and viability, as well as adult size at eclosion and reproductive success. Additionally, I tease apart sex differences in terms of sex ratio at eclosion and weight changes with increased larval crowding. I found the following: larval development time increased for both selection regimes, but this change was more pronounced in the SLOW selected populations. Additionally, the SLOW selected populations exhibited prolonged pupal development at high larval densities of 200 and 400 per vial. The most significant decrease in pre-adult viability was predominantly during larval development for both selection regimes. Size at eclosion decreases as larval density increases, and is closely correlated with a decrease in fecundity. Yet, there were few differences in the response to crowding between the males and females for both selection regimes in terms of eclosion time or weight loss due to density. My results support other studies on the effects of larval crowding, as well as offering new insights into the physiological plasticity and trade-offs that the two selection regimes exhibit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Archaea are ubiquitous single-celled microorganisms that have often adapted to harsh conditions and play important roles in biogeochemical cycles with potential applications in biotechnology. Methanococcus maripaludis, a methane-producing archaeon, is motile through multiple archaella on its cell surface. The major structural proteins (archaellins) of the archaellum are glycoproteins, modified with the N-linked tetrasaccharide: 4-deoxy-5-O-Me-ManNAc β1-4 ManNAc3NAmA6Thr β1-4 GlcNAc3NAcA β1-3 GalNAc β-Asn, where the sugar 4-deoxy-5-O-Me-ManNAc is found exclusively in this species. The attachment of the N-linked tetrasaccharide to archaellins is required for proper motility of M. maripaludis. The aglW gene encoding the putative UDP-Glc/GlcNAc 4-epimerase AglW plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the unique terminal sugar residue found in the N-linked tetrasaccharide. The goal of this study was to biochemically demonstrate the 4-epimerase activity of AglW, and to develop glycosyltransferase (GT) coupled assays to determine its substrate specificity and properties. We carried out coupled assays using UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc and GlcNAc/GalNAc-diphosphate – lipid as substrates. We established that AglW is active without the addition of divalent metal ions or NAD+ and has a broad specificity towards UDP-sugars. We also showed that tyrosine-151 within a conserved YxxxK sequon is essential for the 4-epimerase function of AglW. The GT-coupled assays are generally useful for the identification and specificity studies of novel 4-epimerases. The results of this work provide insight into the synthesis of complex N-glycans in M. maripaludis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: At the start of exercise, the energy demand of the muscle increases. To meet this demand, energy production using oxygen increases. More oxygen is brought to the muscle mainly by a widening of the blood vessels. In small muscle mass exercise, it is generally accepted that oxygen delivery is tightly coupled to the demand of the muscle (Wagner, 2012, Wajner &amp; Goodman, 2011). Recently however, individual differences in oxygen delivery demand matching have been revealed, and these differences predict performance. (Kellawan et al., 2014; Bentley et al., 2014; Bentley et al., 2017).&#xD;
Objectives: 1) Quantify an individual’s oxygen delivery (O2D) to oxygen consumption (V̇ O2) ratio using a range of exercise intensities 2) Quantify the association between the oxygen delivery to oxygen consumption ratio and exercise fatigability.&#xD;
Methods: 10 participants performed multiple incremental rhythmic forearm handgrip exercise tests until exhaustion to quantify individual oxygen delivery to oxygen consumption ratio. These participants were divided into high and low responder groups, where ‘high responders’ were defined as having higher oxygen delivery relative to oxygen consumption and ‘low responders’ had lower oxygen delivery relative to oxygen consumption. A fatiguing exercise test, using intermittent maximal contractions, was used to quantify fatigability. Oxygen delivery was determined by measuring forearm blood flow with ultrasound and by estimating the oxygen content of the blood through venous blood sampling. Forearm oxygen consumption was calculated as the product of forearm blood flow and arterial-venous oxygen content difference.&#xD;
Results: High responders experienced less fatigability than the low responders. High responders had greater absolute change in O2D (p &lt; 0.01), forearm blood flow (FBF) (p&lt;0.05) and in forearm vascular conductance (FVC) (p&lt;0.05), reflecting a greater widening of the blood vessels.&#xD;
Conclusions: In forearm handgrip exercise, the high responders demonstrated less exercise fatigability. High responders had greater widening of the blood vessels, suggesting the potential for relative enhancement of the blood vessel response to the same exercise demand.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation is a study of Spinoza’s method.&#xD;
&#xD;
I begin with Spinoza’s own views on method. I show that he begins with a largely Cartesian outlook, while acknowledging a debt to Bacon, and adopts a monistic framework which consists of three parts: distinguishing true perceptions from false ones, prioritizing the whole over the parts, and avoiding wearying the mind with useless things.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 2 I argue for two theses: First, that there is no clear understanding of what Spinoza’s method is, nor of how precisely it fits together with its antecedents. Second, I argue that, while prior accounts have often rightly noted the philosophical debts Spinoza owes to Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, and others, Spinoza’s own view has not been, and indeed cannot be, clearly understood through these previous methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 3 I argue that Spinoza is committed to two interpretive principles: Meaning Requires Use (MRU), and Meaning Requires Knowledge (MRK). I suggest that these principles can usefully be applied to our interpretation of Spinoza himself. Next, I employ a database-driven reconstruction of the structure of the Ethics to argue in Chapter 4 that uncited elements constitute a problem for the logical interpretation of Spinoza’s method, which holds that the geometrical order of the text is intended to represent the order of nature. I also argue that even if we do not hold to a strictly logical interpretation of the geometrical order, there is still a problem of interpretation of Spinoza’s Ethics that arises precisely because of his use of that order.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 5 develops the data-driven approach I have taken in the analysis of the geometrical order to arrive at a rather exhaustive account of what appear to be intentional philosophical endpoints of Spinoza’s system, and which can thereby be analyzed for consistency and cogency, and thereby illuminate the core doctrines of Spinoza’s philosophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
In light of the foregoing analysis, in Chapter 6, I consider the threat of nihilism that falls out of Spinoza’s necessitarianism, which underlies his method, and try to determine how Spinoza’s Ethics can be an ethics after all.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The demographic composition of Canadian society is undergoing a significant change in that immigrants are becoming the fastest growing visible group. While the size of Chinese immigrants in Canada is significant, this is not reflected in outdoor recreation participation. Studies have outlined the constraints for immigrants to participate in outdoor recreation, and based on those studies, several outdoor recreation introductory programs (ORIPs) have been developed to encourage immigrants’ outdoor recreation participation. However, little is known about recent Chinese immigrants’ lived outdoor recreation experiences and their perception of outdoor recreation participation, and that has limited the impact of research on the design, implementation, and marketing of ORIPs targeting Chinese immigrants.&#xD;
&#xD;
To address the gaps in the literature, this study contributes in-depth qualitative data about recent Chinese immigrants’ lived outdoor recreation experiences and their perception of outdoor recreation participation. Narrative inquiry was used as methodology, and data was collected through interviews with eight recent Chinese immigrant families and individuals in the Greater Toronto Area. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically using an inductive approach. Findings revealed that the participants represented four recent Chinese immigrants segments (i.e., Newcomer Parents, Established Parents, Settling Adults, and Still-exploring Youth). A real-life context framework with three top priorities and three guiding values was identified to examine and interpret recent Chinese immigrants’ lived outdoor recreation experiences, as well as their perception of outdoor recreation participation. Implications for the development of ORIPs targeting recent Chinese immigrants were also discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
This study contributes to the existing understanding of Chinese immigrants’ outdoor recreation participation and has uncovered implications for various associated stakeholders including researchers, outdoor educators and other practitioners who work with Chinese immigrants.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The research presented in this thesis focuses on developing a water-use forecasting method using an agent-based model. The novelty of this method is that it allows for a given population to be represented heterogeneously and that the household are connected amongst themselves and can transmit information and modify their behaviours. The model is showcased using a case study in Kingston, Ontario where households are modeled at the individual level as agents that separate water use into 6 household fixtures. Agents are given a set of attributes that enable them to make decisions and adapt behaviour based on social-networks and communication. Available data from Statistics Canada is used to characterize 40 neighbourhoods within Kingston, Ontario. The modelling framework is utilized to test population responses and potential water savings achieved through conservation campaigns. The research consists of evaluating the change in water demand using the model and running the results into a pipe-network hydraulic solver (EPANET 2.0) to calculate the change in energy use from the distribution system associated with conservation programs. The model and the case study are used to answer a series of research questions concerning the sensitivity of the ABM to social communication parameters, the potential water and energy savings that are achievable in the Kingston distribution system and finally, how the spatial distribution of water savings affects energy savings in the Kingston system.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores forest science and management issues in the Central Interior of British Columbia through a historical-geographical lens. I gather evidence that illustrates the combined socio-ecological nature of forest loss, degradation and industrial (i.e., timber supply) crises in the province, and use the most recent mountain pine beetle outbreak as an exposition of several managerial failings. Contra ahistorical and apolitical approaches to resource management, I show how the politics of nature have been at play over the last seventy-three years (1945-present), and make the case that current landscapes can be read as material histories of past management decisions. As a case study, I focus on the Thompson Rivers Forest District in traditional Secwépemc territory as an ideal place to investigate how forest values have changed over time, and employ a mixed-methodological approach including qualitative interviews, data collected via public consultation, archival research, and review of government documents. I suggest several findings based on my research. I propose that BC’s forest management history since WWII is characterized by three paradigms: (1) maximum sustainable yield forestry; (2) ecosystem-based management; and (3) an in-the-making management regime in the era of anthropogenic climate change. I document how different scientific models have been used to legitimate sustainable management practices in different time periods, but argue that the appropriation of nature and the capitalist imperative have remained entrenched as the core drivers of management decisions. This has led to the (re)production of anthropocentric cultures of management even as new ecological monikers have been employed by industry and government in the name of sustainability. The research highlights major historical shifts in management that can be used to inform current transitions within the context of climate change and uncertain, unpredictable forest dynamics. Forest history, politics, philosophy and policy are fused in this project, generating cross-disciplinary geographical scholarship that is useful within contemporary resource management and policy decisions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research builds upon contemporary understandings of the roles of race, whiteness, and antiracism within the practice and profession of geography in North America. A Foucauldian approach to intellectual genealogy, Critical Race Theory, and the experiences of geographers of colour are used to trace the development of antiracist thought within dominant approaches in human geography. The biographies, personal narratives, and professional genealogies of antiracist geographers of colour in the United States and Canada reveal the connections between personal experiences of racism and a relentless push for antiracist research and practice. An in-depth analysis of the scholarly contributions of three prominent antiracist geographers of colour further highlights the relationship between identity and personal experiences in the advancement of geographic theory. In identifying geographers as geographic subjects, an emphasis is placed on the hierarchy of racial knowledge and the importance of the location from where, and by whom, geographic knowledges are produced.&#xD;
	While efforts to attract more people of colour into the profession of geography have been made since the 1960s, the practice and production of geography in the United States and Canada remains deeply racialized. The consistently small number of geographers of colour in North America geography departments and geography’s limited engagement with critical race research points to the continued power of whiteness in shaping the production of both geographers and geographic knowledge. Despite the more than 50-year age span between the youngest and oldest geographers interviewed, troubling thematic trends of experiences of racism as geography graduate students and as faculty members emerged. Whiteness and racism continue to pervade the discipline of geography in North America and the barriers discouraging the practice and development of antiracist geographies remain strong.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Prosthetic foot systems are typically composed of both structural keel and foot shell components. The interaction between these components is considered by the prosthetic device industry with respect to designing higher performance systems with strategically paired components. However, the influence of foot shells on prosthetic foot system mechanical performance is limited in academic literature. &#xD;
&#xD;
The overall goal of this study was to inform future prescription guidelines and design practices of prosthetic foot components by quantifying the effects of foot shells on mechanical properties of prosthetic foot systems. A methodology was proposed enabling characterization of midstance properties that was adapted from a protocol used to predict continuous deformation characteristics of prosthetic feet throughout stance. The proposed method was validated against previous results, and successfully detected differences related to foot design during midstance loading. Specifically, increased deformation corresponded to earlier double-keel loading initiation and later transition into single-keel forefoot loading. &#xD;
&#xD;
The new protocol was implemented to quantify effects of various foot shell designs on predicted deformation and stiffness characteristics of prosthetic foot systems. Observed effects on the system included path-dependent changes to the force-displacement curves, instances of both decreased and increased stiffness up to 73% and 49%, respectively, and up to 13% increased durations of double-keel loading. Varied effects were observed depending on keel and foot shell design, and phase of stance. &#xD;
&#xD;
In a final study, effects of isolated foot shell design features on mechanical performance of prosthetic foot systems were investigated.  Results indicate a complex interaction likely exists between keel and foot shell components, and should therefore be taken into further consideration in the evaluation, design, and prescription of prosthetic foot systems.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In order to maximize the educational benefits of simulation based medical education (SBME) on an individual level, medical educators can manipulate simulation scenarios in real time, using the fundamentals of cognitive load theory.  This approach requires accurate measurement of cognitive load.  In this study, we investigate whether self-reported assessment of cognitive load using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and measurement of the galvanic skin response (GSR) are able to reliably and accurately measure cognitive load during SBME.  Five separate experimental conditions are reported, and self-reported VAS and GSR measurements of cognitive load are compared before and after interventions designed to either increase or decrease cognitive load. Twenty-one junior postgraduate medical trainees participated in this study.  Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANCOVA.  VAS and GSR were highly correlated with each other, and with increasing numbers of recall items in a standard visual spatial memory task.  While VAS was more sensitive for discriminating between varying levels of cognitive load during the visual spatial memory task, both VAS and GSR were able to do so. In two simulation scenarios designed to increase cognitive load, increases in VAS measures of cognitive load were statistically significant, while GSR measures were not.  GSR decreased significantly in an exercise designed to decrease cognitive load, while VAS did not.  Introduction of the worked examples effect in final simulation exercise resulted in statistically significant reductions in both VAS and GSR measures of cognitive load.  Limitations and applications of the results are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) degrade water quality and may produce toxins. The distribution of CHABs can change rapidly due to variations in population dynamics and environmental conditions. Biological and ecological aspects of CHABs were studied in order to better understand CHABs dynamics. Field experiments were conducted near Hartington, Ontario, Canada, in ponds dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa during the summers of 2015 and 2016. Mixing of the water column followed by calm conditions resulted in over 90% of the Microcystis floating on the surface.  Microcystis surface appearance formed four different assemblages: aggregate, ribbons, patches, and mats.&#xD;
 Presence of CHABs on the water surface also depends on environmental influences such as direct and indirect wind effects. Surface coverage of CHABs was found to be reduced to half within an hour at wind speeds of 0.5 m/s.&#xD;
Our findings indicated that blooming involves surface display of cyanobacteria, therefore using surface imagery to quantify CHABs was justified. Traditional detection methods do not provide accurate distribution information, nor do they portray CHABs events in a real-time manner due to limitations in on-demand surveillance and delays between sample time and analyzed results. Therefore, a new CHAB detection method using small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with consumer-grade cameras was developed. When cyanobacteria were floating on the surface, CHABs detection through RGB band cameras and spectral enhancement techniques was efficient and accurate.  sUAS were capable of providing coverage up to 1 km2 per mission and the short intervals between sampling and results (approx. 2 h) allowed for the rapid analysis of data and for implementing follow-up monitoring or treatments. sUAS were able to measure growth and decline curves of CHABs throughout 2016 which were then compared to water chemistry results. sUAS were cost-effective (estimated $50 CAD per mission) with an average cyanobacterial detection accuracy of 86% (8% of the error were false negatives, and 6% were false positives). Thus, it is a good candidate method to fill the urgent need for CHABs detection, providing cost effective, rapid, and accurate information to improve risk management at a local level and to help quickly allocate resources for mitigation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Field mapping and microstructural characterization of metamorphic rocks exposed in the Karnali and Jajarkot klippen in the western Nepal foreland highlight the presence of a top-to-the-southwest shear zone at the base and a top-to-the-northwest shear zone at the top of the metamorphic rocks, correlative with the Main Central thrust and the South Tibetan detachment, respectively. This structural geometry implies that these metamorphic rocks are the southern continuation of the Greater Himalayan sequence (GHS) exposed in the hinterland to the north, and are key locations to improve our understanding of mid-crustal evolution in continental collisions. New pressure–temperature–time–deformation data demonstrate that GHS rocks in the Karnali and Jajarkot klippen escaped the Miocene high-temperature metamorphic overprint pervasive in the hinterland, and consequently reveal the Eocene-Oligocene stages of the evolution of the metamorphic core. In the Karnali klippe, prograde metamorphism occurred between 40 and 35 Ma and P–T conditions peaked at &gt;0.7–1.0 GPa and &gt;650–700 °C between 35 and 30 Ma. Starting at 30 Ma, GHS rocks underwent cooling, decompression and melt crystallization associated with the onset of shearing along the top-to-the-NE normal-sense South Tibetan detachment. The GHS cooled below ~450 °C progressively from the south flank (20–17 Ma) to the north flank (17–14 Ma) of the Karnali klippe. In the Jajarkot klippe, prograde metamorphism occurred from 45 to 25 Ma, when peak P–T conditions of 0.75–1.2 GPa and 550–600 °C were attained. Peak metamorphism was followed rapidly by cooling below ~450 °C at 25–20 Ma. In marked contrast, GHS rocks now exposed in the hinterland were still buried, hot, and actively deforming while the foreland was cooled and exhumed. The klippen therefore preserve a snapshot of the early (i.e. Eocene-Oligocene) evolution of the Himalayan metamorphic core. Along-strike variations in the tectonometamorphic evolution of the two klippen are interpreted to reflect the geometry of the basal detachment of the orogen and suggest the presence of an east-dipping lateral ramp between the Karnali and Jajarkot klippen during the Oligocene.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The foreclosure crisis that followed the depression 2007–08 created a number distressed communities in two of the hardest hit cities across the United States, Chicago, and Jacksonville. Homeownership has long been the primary means for households to accumulate wealth within American society. Owning a home also assumes tremendous cultural weight; is often associated with achieving the American dream. Becoming a homeowner is said to allow first-time buyers to embrace the values of freedom and individualism; however, since 2007, a disproportionate number of racialized people have been evicted from their homes at an unprecedented rate because they were unable to continue making payments on their mortgages. Subprime loans were introduced to the lending market as a lucrative business strategy to expand lending activities to those who would otherwise be denied access to credit. Instead, they allowed financial institutions to exploit and prey upon the historical misfortunes of African Americans and other racialized groups. This study uncovers some key findings that indicate how organizations working in different geographical regions navigate through the foreclosure crisis in order to keep at-risk homeowners inside their homes. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of community organizations and their influence in shaping the foreclosures for racialized people, low-income families, and economically disadvantaged communities. &#xD;
In keeping with the traditions of anti-racist theory, I situate race at the forefront of my analysis of the policies and programs introduced to stem the rise of foreclosures. By doing so, I develop an analysis of the cyclical nature of institutional racism as it operates in the U.S. housing market. More importantly, I situate the foreclosure crisis as the most recent installment in the long history of racial inequality in the American housing market. I draw on theoretical perspectives on neoliberalism and financialization to identify the products and processes that precipitated the collapse of the U.S. housing market. &#xD;
I use secondary data and a small sample of semi-structured interviews with homeowners, housing counselors, and lawyers, and the research reveals a number of factors influencing the way some African-American households experience foreclosures. The research also pinpoints some of the best ways to keep distressed homeowners inside their homes. Above all, this study provides racialized homeowners with a voice, dispelling popular narratives that portray them as irresponsible borrowers who bought more than they could afford. Instead, everyday Americans were victims of a discriminatory financial system that preyed upon the historical disadvantages of African Americans in their efforts to attain equal access to the housing market.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the present study, I examined how students build comprehension with different types of text. Poor comprehenders and typically-achieving comprehenders, as determined by a standardized measure for general reading comprehension, were compared in their reading comprehension and reading strategy use across narrative, expository, and graphic text. I also examined the influence of cognitive functioning on reading comprehension, and to what extent cognitive functions can explain the difference in reading comprehension between poor and typically-achieving comprehenders. This research was partially exploratory, where I aimed to validate existing research on cognitive functions, reading strategies, and reading comprehension of text, as well as to contribute new research that distinguishes between text types. Past research has shown that cognitive functions predict reading comprehension and that poor comprehenders have poorer cognitive functioning and use fewer reading strategies than their peers. However, no research to date has made distinctions between different types of text, specifically graphic text, and how cognitive functioning and reading strategy use relate to comprehension. &#xD;
A group of poor comprehenders (n = 24) and typically-achieving comprehenders (n = 38) completed measures of cognitive functioning and read narrative, expository, and graphic texts aloud before answering comprehension questions. Participants were asked to ‘think-aloud’ during reading, which allowed me to make comparisons between the two groups on reading strategy use. Poor comprehenders used fewer cognitive strategies than their typically-achieving peers while reading narrative and expository text, and fewer evaluative strategies with graphic text. Typically-achieving comprehenders also outperformed poor comprehenders on comprehension of each style of text. Participants’ abilities to recognize abstract patterns predicted comprehension of each text type, while participants’ abilities to exercise inhibition also predicted expository text comprehension. The same variables accounted for a significant portion of the variance between poor and typically-achieving comprehenders, though graphic text had the most variance unaccounted for. The findings from the present study highlight the importance of distinguishing between text types in research on reading comprehension, and suggest that more attention should be paid to dynamic reading comprehension instruction and support.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Commercial bioproduction of succinic acid has been stimulated by its use as a precursor in the synthesis of commodity chemicals, and the benefits of bioproduction compared to traditional chemical synthesis. However, inefficiencies remain in the downstream recovery of succinic acid from fermentation medium. The use of chemically reactive sorbents (chemisorbent) can streamline downstream succinic acid recovery, reducing costs. In this study, Poly[N,N-dimethyletheyleneacrylamide-co-Tris(2-aminoethylacrylamide)] (PMTA) was synthesized and characterized for the downstream recovery of succinic acid. PMTA sorbs succinic acid through acid-base reactions, sequestering it as an ammonium succinate salt. At a 0.02 dry weight (DW) phase fraction (PF) PMTA chemisorbed 0.45 g of succinic acid from a 35 g/l solution, the highest capacity known. PMTA was found to be stable in aqueous solution after 10 days, an improvement over polyacrylate type chemisorbents. Complete desorption of succinic acid from 1g DW polymer was achieved with 50 ml of a 3 M KOH solution, at a 0.02 PF. Despite this elevated concentration of KOH, the polymer retained its sorption capacity after 3 cycles of sorption and desorption. PMTA was found to chemisorb all three acids found in succinic acid fermentations, including formic, acetic and succinic acid, preferentially sorbing the most concentrated acid. However, at equal molar concentrations of these acids, formic acid, having the lowest pKa, was preferentially sorbed. PMTA has properties applicable to the downstream recovery of succinic acid including resistance to hydrolysis, reusability, and high succinic acid sorption capacity. PMTA was applied as an alkaline extractant in an in situ product removal (ISPR) system. To simulate bioproduction, succinic acid was fed into a bioreactor; the drop in pH activated a pump directing bioreactor contents through a vessel containing water alkalized by the presence of PMTA, and this water was displaced into the bioreactor increasing the pH. The pH was further modulated by the sorption and sequestration of succinic acid from the bioreactor contents pumped through the ISPR system. However, it was found that the alkalinity of the tertiary amine functional group of PMTA was insufficient to maintain the bioreactor pH at the set point.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The “Multiple-plan integration” planning is proposed by the Chinese government to coordinate various planning projects in managing spatial development and protecting agricultural and ecological resources. It can be treated as a multi-objective land allocation (MOLA) problem that aims to optimize the land allocation pattern to maximize land suitability for agriculture, construction, and conservation while encouraging compact land allocation. However, there is a lack of applicable methodology or frameworks to support the “Multiple-plan integration” planning at the county level. &#xD;
This dissertation is intended to develop and test a framework to solve this “Multiple-plan integration” problem with improved spatial optimization algorithms. The criteria for land suitability evaluation in China’s county-level “Multiple-plan integration” were first reviewed and established. Then, the performance of three classical heuristic optimization algorithms including simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was compared in solving a simplified MOLA problem. The comparison results show that classical NSGA-II in the GA family performs the best, but its computational cost is high in maintaining compact land allocation. Next, an improved knowledge-informed NSGA-II was developed by integrating patch-based, edge growing/decreasing, neighborhood, and constraint steering rules. The improved algorithm is more effective and efficient than classical NSGA-II in encouraging compact land allocation while its capability of maximizing land suitability is not sacrificed. Finally, a Multiple-plan Integration with Spatial Optimization (MPI-SOP) framework was proposed to support China’s “Multiple-plan integration” planning at the county level. This framework is composed of five steps: mathematically formulating the spatial optimization problem, land suitability evaluation, optimization problem solving, post-processing of land allocation solutions, and applying post-processed solutions to planning. The spatial optimization problem was solved by a patch-based and knowledge-informed NSGA-II. The case study in Dongxihu District of Wuhan City shows that the framework is feasible and effective in supporting the “Multiple-plan integration” decision making. &#xD;
This dissertation has made two major contributions. Practically, it has proposed and tested a framework to support China’s “Multiple-plan integration” planning with spatial optimization at the county level; methodologically, knowledge-informed heuristic optimization algorithms have been developed to solve the MOLA problem more effectively and efficiently.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The concept of security in web applications is not new. However, it is often ignored in the development stages of the web applications. Being multitiered and spread across different domains, it is challenging to come up with a security solution that works for all web applications. Moreover, developers are more inclined to produce working features for the applications in the rapid development approaches that are chosen, than providing security for the code and often do not practice secure coding. Therefore, countless web applications are launched with security vulnerabilities which manifest later in their life cycle. Integrating security features should be part of the development process for these web applications to prevent unwanted attacks. Along with cross-site scripting, injection attacks and resource alterations; code tampering on the client side is a serious security risk for web applications. Without practicing secure coding and having an integrity verification system in place, it is difficult to defend these unwanted attacks. We present a system that integrates security measures on the client side code based on the best practices of secure coding and an integrity verification system. The proposed approach can be integrated with both new and existing web applications to provide security against prevalent attacks and make the client side tamper resistant. We implement our approach for JavaScript-based applications for which the security flaws are the most common.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Android is the most popular mobile platform powering hundreds of millions of mobile devices. Android provides an API that helps developers create Android applications by simplifying the reuse of core system components and services. Different developers may use the Android API in different ways for several reasons, including: their background, their knowledge of the platform and their team's policies. This variety in how developers interact with the Android API, makes Android API use analysis an interesting research topic.&#xD;
Android is owned and maintained by Google. In each release of the Android API, Google introduces new capabilities and deprecates some of the old ones. In this thesis, we investigate the fact that, since Google is itself both maintaining and using the API at the same time, it may be using Android differently than other developers.&#xD;
In order to explore our research questions, since existing methods could not address some of the challenges in our study, we proposed a new method for analyzing Android API use in closed source Android applications. This method works on obfuscated applications and radically reduces the noise produced by embedded API calls in the unused parts of third-party libraries.&#xD;
Using the proposed method, we conducted an experiment for comparing Android API use in 19 popular Google applications to 19 non-Google similar applications and answered four specific research questions that show the differences between these two groups of applications.&#xD;
The analysis in this thesis can be helpful for Android developers to find out how Google, as the owner and maintainer of Android, is using the Android API. Additionally, Google can use this information to observe how the changes they make affect the developers' interaction with the Android API.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For all serving military personnel, transition to civilian life is inevitable; however, a release may come as a surprise for the approximately 2000 service members who retire annually as a result of a medical condition (Department of National Defence, personal communication, 28 June, 2017).  These Veterans will leave the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) under vastly different circumstances than those who voluntarily release.  A medical release can be a result of a visible or non-visible wound suffered in an operational theater, a training injury or a chronic disease diagnosis.  In a follow-up to landmark cross-sectional survey, Veterans Affairs Canada (2017a) concluded that 32% of releasing Veterans experience a difficult transition to civilian life; which, indicates the need for tailored transition services and research into the causes of these struggles.  The trinity of an unexpected truncation of one’s career, a medical diagnosis coupled with an uncertain health status, and a precarious future signal the start of a soldier-to-civilian transition that many Veterans are ill-prepared to confront. &#xD;
Service members finding themselves on this trajectory are faced with a myriad of decisions that impact the totality of their lives.  Aspects of military life are not limited to a predictable daily regime, rather service extends beyond the uniform affecting family and friends; a truly a unique way of life.  One condition of military employment is that soldiers and families must move to various Canadian Forces Bases located in both major metropolitan areas with the associated high cost of living to rural locations with limited prospects for spousal employment, school choices for children, reduction of some community services offered in either French or English, or readily available access to family health care.  When soldiers are leaving the CAF for civilian life, some of these considerations must be addressed to contribute to a successful transition.  This study investigated the individual decision-making process surrounding a mandatory career change with a view to better inform policy-makers and transitioning Veterans.  Findings indicate that a more deliberate institutional approach to transition will empower Veterans to realize their post-military potential with the assistance of a tailorable transition decision-making aid.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study explored thriving in the context of graduate studies as perceived by four female students attending master’s and doctoral programs in a Canadian university. Thriving is an all-encompassing approach that extends beyond meeting the academic objectives (Schreiner, Pothoven, Nelson, &amp; McIntosh, 2009). Recently, there have been extensive studies regarding thriving in the undergraduate context (e.g. Berea, Tsvetovat, Daun-Barnett, Greenwald, &amp; Cox 2015; Schreiner, 2010a; 2013; Schreiner, Kammer, Primose, &amp; Quick, 2011). Despite the uniqueness of the graduate demographic compared to the undergraduate (Gansemer-Topf, Ross &amp; Johnson, 2006), little is known about graduate students’ thriving processes and their fulfillment with their academic experience. The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand graduate students’ perceptions and experiences of thriving, as well as the factors that influenced their thriving in graduate school. Data were collected from four female graduate students through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using a deductive thematic approach. Thriving Perceptions and Experiences, Supports for Thriving, and Barriers to Thriving were the pre-determined themes utilized for this study. Supports and barriers were further branched into intrapersonal, interpersonal, and institutional factors.&#xD;
The findings of this study are presented in two sections. The first section highlighted thriving conceptualization in graduate studies through individuals’ perceptions and experiences. These findings illustrate that thriving in graduate studies is unique, multi-faceted, and malleable. For master’s participants in particular, thriving additionally signified a profound academic transition. In the second section, I presented the conditions that affected thriving, which included notions of connectedness, contribution, mentorship, compartmentalization, and imposter syndrome. Although similar to undergraduate students in many ways, there were distinct characteristics pertaining to thriving among the participants of this study, leading to implications for future research and practice.&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Where am I? This question continues to be one of the fundamental challenges posed in robotics research. The ability of a robot to localize itself and map its environment has proven to be a difficult and rich research problem. While significant progress has been made it still remains a difficult task to perform in dynamic, 3D environments, over long distances. Stereo cameras are a proven workhorse for the task of Visual Odometry (VO) and three-dimensional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), but they require reliable lighting conditions and matching regions in both images. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors provide an alternative; they are lighting-invariant, provide dense depth information directly, and intensity information that resembles grayscale camera images. In many cases where lighting is unavailable or inconsistent, such as underground mining or planetary exploration, LiDAR is particularly suited for the task of localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
Both VO and SLAM can use a type of nonlinear optimization called bundle adjustment (BA) to solve for the optimal sensor pose and landmark positions given a set of matched observations at two or more separate poses. This thesis develops a version of BA, called IntenseBA. The algorithm estimates a map of landmarks, augmenting the standard three-dimensional point landmark with surface normal and reflectivity states. Because LiDAR intensity observations are dependent on the sensor pose and these landmark states, it is able to use observations of the landmarks to probabilistically determine the most likely estimate of the sensor pose and landmarks. The problem is shown to be observable in all states and an analysis of its sensitivity to noise in each observation is done through a simulation. A calibration procedure and analysis of modern keypoint algorithms is presented which allows the theoretical model to be applied to real data from a SwissRanger SR4000 Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. Experiments were conducted in the European Space Agency's Planetary Utilisation Testbed, which emulates a Martian terrain. These experiments tested the IntenseBA algorithm (used to perform VO) and show the algorithm can accurately map all state estimates and improve upon accuracy compared to traditional and state-of-the-art approaches by incorporating these additional observations.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For the SNO+ experiment's search for neutrinoless double beta decay, radioactive background reduction and understanding of detector systematics are key. Indirect background measurements and energy systematics have been studied. A quality assurance testing system was created and implemented. The system detects the oxygen contamination of liquid scintillator as an indirect measurement of radon-222 contamination from air exposure during transport. The technique can measure ppm order oxygen contamination with a resolution of ~60ppm. In addition, the impact of non-&#xD;
gaussian tails in the energy response function on the half-life limit for neutrinoless beta decay was studied. If the tails were not applied to the energy response function the sensitivity is expected to be reduced by 0.5x10^26y. If the tails are applied to the response function, the half-life limit would be approximately 1.7x10^26y after one live year of data. For tellurium to be loaded in the detector, an organometallic complex is formed. The impact of the complex on acrylic was studied with the engineer of record approving the use of tellurium loaded scintillator for ten years with minimal&#xD;
deterioration expected.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rare-event searches in particle physics put immense effort into precisely controlling their backgrounds.&#xD;
However, not always considered is the effect of fractoluminescence if the active material&#xD;
fractures. The effect of atmosphere on the fractoluminescence of the scintillator BGO (Bi4Ge3O12)&#xD;
has been studied by stressing samples in a double-cleavage drilled compression (DCDC) geometry&#xD;
to fracture. A system has been developed to fracture samples in a controllable atmosphere and analyze&#xD;
the light and acoustic emissions. By analyzing the fracture of BGO, it has been demonstrated&#xD;
that the force required and the energy dissipated in fracture are increased as the water vapour in&#xD;
the atmosphere is reduced. It has also been demonstrated that the quantity of emitted photons&#xD;
increases in nitrogen rich atmospheres. These results demonstrate the importance of controlling&#xD;
both the atmosphere and stresses inside particle detectors. In addition, in order to study the effect&#xD;
of cryogenic temperature on fractures in particle detectors, a microfabricated polysilicon fracture&#xD;
apparatus has been designed and subjected to first tests.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My doctoral work examines the reception, imitation, appropriation, and transformation of Netherlandish painting in Portugal around the turn of the sixteenth century through a study of surviving documents, visual evidence, and available (technical) studies. In chapter two, I discuss the limitations of the existing literature concerned with the painting production in Portugal in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, caused by its political seclusion from the nineteenth century until the 1970s. Diplomacy, trade, and immigration were the most important points of contact with Netherlandish painting in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and are the focus of chapter three and four. Chapter three reveals how Netherlandish luxury goods became part of Portuguese collections, while chapter four focuses on Lisbon artists that were a part of the network of court painter Jorge Afonso (c. 1470–1540). These artists were responsible for the production of some of the most prestigious royal altarpiece commissions of the first decades of the sixteenth century. Chapter five centres around the Évora Altarpiece, a nineteen-panel Netherlandish altarpiece produced around 1500. Here, I tentatively argue that the altarpiece was commissioned from Gerard David and then shipped to Portugal. David might have subcontracted several painters to complete the commission. In chapter six, I discuss three paintings that hung in two Colettine convents and depict the same unique iconography, an angel appearing before three kneeling Clarisse saints. Two paintings stylistically relate to Quinten Metsys, while the other was part of an altarpiece and is attributed to Jorge Afonso. The paintings were probably commissioned by Queen Eleanor who founded the convents and instigated the Colettine reform movement in Portugal. She might have been inspired by her contacts in Burgundy, perhaps Margaret of Austria, who was an active promoter of Colette’s reform. The paintings discussed in this dissertation exemplify how the import of Netherlandish paintings, the arrival of Netherlandish painters, and the favourable artistic climate in Portugal impacted the local production of altarpieces. Collaboratively produced by local master painters and their workshops, these heterogeneous altarpieces combine elements of Netherlandish (style, technique), Portuguese (cultural references, colour use), and Spanish (format) origin.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In cases of severe arthritis, a metal-on-ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the primary solution. Wear of UHMWPE is a concern as it causes poor bearing performance and a decrease in the device’s lifespan. In this study, UHMWPE surface texturing has been proposed as a way to improve tribological conditions. Surface texturing has been studied previously under steady-state conditions, which is not representative of the harsh kinematic conditions occurring in daily living activities. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that the proposed novel texturing approach improves tribological conditions during intermittent stop-dwell-start (SDS) motion by measuring the traction coefficient during the SDS phases. &#xD;
	A custom waveform in a pin-on-disc friction and wear tester was created to simulate SDS loading conditions. Untextured and textured UHMWPE specimens were tested under three lubricating conditions (unlubricated, water and glycerin). Then, a method was developed to extract meaningful traction coefficient data from the SDS test results. Lastly, factors affecting the tribological conditions in the metal-UHMWPE system were investigated based on traction coefficient and wear analysis observations. &#xD;
	The factors affecting the traction coefficient and wear were the introduction of texturing and the viscosity of the lubricant. The presence of a lubricant dominated when attempting to reduce the traction coefficient and wear. A significant reduction in traction coefficient was observed with both water and glycerin compared to unlubricated conditions in all phases of SDS motion, regardless of the surface geometry. Also, the higher the lubricant’s viscosity, the lower the traction coefficient and amount of wear.&#xD;
	The introduction of the textured surface resulted in a significant reduction or no change in traction coefficient in the stop and start phases in the unlubricated and glycerin conditions. Also, no additional wear was observed when the surface was textured compared to untextured. Therefore, when the bearing system is properly lubricated, texturing is a promising approach to reduce traction and wear. It is therefore proposed that textured UHMWPE be further investigated as a solution to extend the lifespan on TJA.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation examines the racialized power dynamics in cultural production in Canada by offering a re-reading of critical multicultural discourse through black and Indigenous studies. Although dominant modes of artistic creation circulate in and through colonial logics of domination, my research demonstrates the capacity for concert dance performance to destabilize the uneven power dynamics that shape such practice. Through a case-study approach, augmented by a self-reflexive research-creation component, I interrogate the ways in which current creative practices offer some trajectories for working towards more ethical and decolonial approaches to the creation of artistic work. What emerges is a scholarly analysis and critique of the ways in which hegemonic whiteness within concert dance in Canada persists, as well as a self-reflexive study that suggests some ways forward. I argue that concert dance is a productive and important site of scholarly critique and creative practice that, despite having been largely overlooked in the majority of academic study that attends to identity, power, and social justice, offers a way of re-thinking the decolonial potential of concert dance and dance performance. </dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Crustal-scale basement faults persist as long-lived structures that localize deformation and can enhance permeability in the Earth’s crust. The NNW-striking left-lateral Bathurst fault in the eastern Slave craton displaces the 1.9 Ga Kilohigok basin and the ca. 2.07-1.96 Ga Thelon tectonic zone by up to ~ 115 km. The Bathurst fault intersects the 1.7 Ga Thelon basin, where unconformity uranium occurrences are spatially associated with basement faults. This thesis investigates the deformation-temperature-time history of the Bathurst fault rocks using field structural and microstructural observations paired with U-(Th-)Pb and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. Highly-strained hornblende-bearing granitoid rocks with minor phyllosilicate-rich layers are predominant along the Bathurst fault and show ambiguous sense of shear suggesting flattening by coaxial deformation. Quartz and feldspar microstructures show ductile deformation conditions ≥ 500°C. Along the main fault trace, the pervasive ductile flattening fabric is overprinted by brittle fractures, cataclasis, and hydrothermal alteration. In situ U-Th-Pb dating of syn-kinematic monazite suggests ductile fabric formation at ca. 1933 ± 4 Ma and 1895 ± 11 Ma, whereas zircon from a cross-cutting dyke constrains the brittle deformation to ≤ 1839 ± 14 Ma. 40Ar/39Ar analyses of fabric-defining minerals yield cooling ages of ca. 1920-1900 Ma and ca. 1900-1850 Ma for hornblende and muscovite, respectively, and a maximum cooling age of ca. 1840 Ma for biotite. The ductile flattening fabric developed between ca. 1933-1895 Ma, and is associated with the orthogonal collision and indentation of the Slave craton into the Thelon tectonic zone and Rae craton. Brittle deformation on the Bathurst fault was localized parallel to the ductile flattening fabric after ca. 1840 Ma and preceded Thelon basin deposition. Brittle deformation features in Bathurst fault rocks demonstrate fluid-rock interaction and enhanced basement permeability. Thus, the Bathurst fault is a possible conduit basement structure for unconformity-associated uranium mineralization.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As Canadians continue to live longer, more older adults are undergoing surgical procedures. These procedures can leave patients at an increased risk for medical complications, and there has been growing interest in a potential association between surgery and dementia. When further examining this relationship, attention has been given to the potential role that anesthesia may have on risk for development of dementia. There are two main types of anesthesia administered for many surgeries, general (GA) and regional (RA). This thesis explored the association between surgery, anesthesia, and dementia by comparing for potential differences between GA and RA on the development of dementia following surgery. &#xD;
	Using a retrospective cohort study design, older adults aged 66 years and greater who underwent elective surgical procedures were followed-up for up to 5 years following their index surgery. The surgical procedures that were included in this thesis were hip replacement, knee replacement, inguinal hernia repair, hysterectomy, and prostatectomy, since each are common procedures and can be completed using either GA or RA. Statistical analyses consisted of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models, where the hypothesis was that GA would lead to greater risk for the development of dementia following surgery compared to RA.  &#xD;
	To control for any potential differences in baseline characteristics that may bias the associations of interest and the outcome of dementia, matching was done on age, sex, index year, surgery, and propensity score. The final matched sample consisted of 14,998 individuals. A total of 725 people developed dementia throughout follow-up, 362 who received GA and 363 who received RA. After comparing people administered GA to those receiving RA, there was no significant difference in risk for development of dementia following surgery (HR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8 – 1.2, p = 0.9). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses supported these results, with no significant differences found between anesthesia groups. &#xD;
	Therefore, this thesis found that there was no significant difference in dementia development following surgery when comparing people receiving GA and RA. Future studies should consider a randomized trial design and access more detailed data on the depth and duration of the anesthesia exposure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>It has been reported that estimated pavement lifecycles have been reduced by 50-60 % in Ontario over the last 25 years (Auditor General of Ontario, 2016). This raises issues of concern with respect to durability and performance among others. This document aims to comparatively study the effects of physical and chemical aging on the performance of extracted and recovered loose-mix and core mix samples from some provincial and municipal contracts in Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this study, four loose-mix (plant-aged) and eight core-mix (field-aged, 4 - 5 years) samples were cautiously extracted and recovered using dichloromethane and standard rotary evaporation in a moderate to high vacuum, nitrogen atmosphere and final bath temperature of 160 °C for one hour. The binders recovered from the loose-mix samples were taken through laboratory aging using the standard Superpave® pressure aging vessel method and all the samples were evaluated for their performance using conventional Superpave® methods such as Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) and the improved Ministry of Transportation of Ontario methods (LS-308 Extended Bending Beam Rheometer (eBBR) and LS-299 Double-Edge Notched Tension (DENT) test). Chemical test methods like Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis were used to determine the presence of carbonyls, sulfoxides, zinc and molybdenum which result from chemical oxidation and the addition of recycled engine oil bottoms (REOB).&#xD;
&#xD;
The significant amount of zinc and molybdenum found in all the samples could be a result of addition of REOB, which is known to accelerate the process of physical and chemical aging. All the binders recovered from the loose-mix samples showed better performance based on their performance grading using the dynamic shear rheometer, extended bending beam rheometer and double-edge notched tension test at low, intermediate and high temperatures. Their durability is however suspect since they contained significant amounts of zinc, molybdenum, carbonyls and sulfoxides known to be ‘aging accelerators’. All the field-aged (4-5 yrs.) samples but one showed poor performance at low, intermediate and high temperature which is explained by the comparatively higher amount of zinc, molybdenum, carbonyls and sulfoxides found in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
The extended bending beam rheometer (eBBR) method was seen as a more efficient quality control indicator since some of the samples which passed the regular bending beam rheometer method failed the extended bending beam rheometer test based on the grade losses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The appearance of excessive and premature cracking on asphalt pavement after the winter&#xD;
seasons has been a major challenge and concern to transportation agencies in Canada and&#xD;
the northern U.S. states. At low temperatures, thermal stresses develop in the pavement&#xD;
causing detachment of the binder from the aggregates and a subsequent deterioration in&#xD;
stiffness which eventually leads to gross thermal cracking. Further distresses are induced&#xD;
on these roads in the form of wheel path fatigue by heavy vehicles leading to alligatortype&#xD;
cracks. Governments spend large portions of their yearly budgets on the maintenance&#xD;
and reconstruction of damaged roads. Through the collaborative efforts of government&#xD;
agencies and research institutions various laws and specifications have been implemented&#xD;
to ensure durability of asphalt pavement across various provinces.&#xD;
In this study, approved American Association of State and Highway Transportation&#xD;
Officials (AASHTO) and Ministry Transportation of Ontario (MTO) methods namely&#xD;
dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), extended bending beam rheometer (EBBR), and double&#xD;
edge-notched tension (DENT) tests were used to evaluate the rheological properties and&#xD;
long-term performance of recovered binders with 3 to 7 years of service. The recovered&#xD;
samples showed similar properties as their corresponding tank samples even though there&#xD;
exists a difference in their performance due to extent of aging which is only poorly&#xD;
simulated by the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) aging and pressure aging vessel (PAV)&#xD;
treatment of the tank samples. Easier, more automated test methods were attempted in this&#xD;
study to replace or complement the EBBR and DENT. Gel point temperature and Glover-&#xD;
Rowe analysis were conducted on all recovered samples. An r-squared value 0.72 was&#xD;
obtained for the correlation between EBBR and gel point temperature while that between&#xD;
iii&#xD;
critical tip opening displacement (CTOD) from DENT test and the Glover-Rowe&#xD;
parameter was 0.96. These results look promising and would require further studies to&#xD;
come to more precise decisions. Chemical analysis using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and&#xD;
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were compared with rheological and physical tests, and&#xD;
able to distinguish good performing binders from poor ones.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In nineteenth-century Britain, the omnibus, a horse-drawn public bus, profoundly changed the nature of urban space. It was the first mass public transport technology in London and as such, fulfilled the mobility needs of the growing middle classes. Because of its novel function and eventual ubiquity on the streets of the capital, it appears as the subject for a variety of visual materials produced during the period. This project examines Victorian paintings, illustrations, sheet music, and print materials that depict people in and around omnibuses from the perspective of their production, content, circulation, and critical reception. It identifies a number of themes that can be organized along spatial, gender, and class lines and which, taken together, point to the concerns and anxieties felt by the passenger populace. Overall, this project looks to visual culture to explore how the Victorians navigated what was becoming a more spatially democratic world, and how different urban spaces structured the experience of the modern city.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers (PEMEs) are the key to integrating renewable energy generation with energy storage to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change. The commercialization of large PEME systems, however, requires improvements to electrode design, performance, and reduction of material costs. In particular, reducing the precious metal loading at the oxygen producing electrode (anode) is critical to making PEME commercially competitive. &#xD;
&#xD;
Measuring the electrode potentials separately is imperative to understanding and improving cell performance. A reliable reference electrode (RE) can provide much more precise information about the anode performance. A RE was developed for PEME application. The efficacy of the RE was confirmed by two parametric studies. The first parametric study served to demonstrate that the combined individual electrode potentials measured with the RE were exactly consistent with the overall potential difference of the cell. A second parametric study confirmed sufficient hydrogen polarization of the RE for operating conditions at low current density, low temperature, and low water feed rates. &#xD;
&#xD;
Application of the RE was successfully demonstrated through investigation of the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction mechanisms occurring at the anode and cathode, respectively. Tafel slopes were calculated and the rate determining steps were determined that support specific proposed reaction mechanisms reported in literature. This investigation revealed important characteristics of each electrode. In particular, it was shown that the cathode overvoltage should not be assumed negligible for the ohmic controlled operating region and more precise information can be observed for the anode performance. These results demonstrate the necessity of the in-situ RE to improving PEME performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study is to interrogate the composition and influence of courtroom sketches from an art historical perspective with the aim of demonstrating not only their importance in the public’s understanding of the Canadian legal system, but also their ability to shape and challenge our perception of the individuals that appear before the courts. Specifically, this study focuses on the ways that art historical portrait theory can contextualize the construction and legibility of a courtroom sketch. The question of how courtroom sketches use the visual elements of portraiture to represent participants at a trial is applied to three case studies: the sentencing hearing of former colonel Russell Williams, the trial of Jian Ghomeshi, and the trial of Senator Mike Duffy. Each case took place in the Ontario criminal justice system and produced significant media attention resulting in a large number of sketches from various artists. The correlations identified and discussed in this study between the courtroom sketch and the practices of portraiture demonstrate that the historical conventions of representations are inextricable from the construction of images in contemporary media. In addition, this analysis serves to extricate the courtroom sketch from its traditional role as support for a textual report of legal events to a more accurate role as a primary source of information dissemination to the public.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As the police organization evolves to meet the ever-changing needs of the 21st century, policing styles and philosophies continue to innovate in an attempt to reduce crime and maintain order. Each fluctuation in policing style has affected the public, particularly minority groups, in its own specific manner. This paper discusses these fluctuations in policing in Canada with a focus on the most recent and popular styles of policing: community-oriented and intelligence-led policing, as implemented under the Ontario Mobilization and Engagement Model (OMEM) in 2010. Specifically, through a survey study with officers from Waterloo Regional Police Services this work seeks to examine whether police officers who have been hired and trained under OMEM are more supportive of community-oriented and intelligence-led policing styles than officers hired previously, and whether these officers differ in their perceptions of the relationships between police and minority communities. Empirical work is framed though a procedural justice lens, and posits that police legitimacy, and thus community relations and public support, are directly affected by officers operating in a procedurally just manner. It is argued here that procedural justice is inherent in community-oriented policing activities, and thus, officers who are trained under OMEM will be supportive of community-oriented policing and will behave in a more procedurally just manner, increasing police legitimacy and improving community relations. Results indicate that full organizational change did not occur following OMEM, with officers hired after OMEM showing more support for some COP and ILP activities but not necessarily engaging in them more. In some cases, officers hired after OMEM were more likely to be critical of community relations and to report greater divisiveness with different minority groups. This suggests that while OMEM may raise awareness and support, there is still a lack of full organizational engagement with COP and ILP. These results have implications for policy, suggesting that a greater proportion of resources need to be committed to long-term community-oriented policing activities, with particular attention paid to new immigrants in the region, in order to fully incorporate COP and ILP activities into all aspects of police work.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the role of constitutional thought in the development of colonial American resistance to the authority of the British state. It argues that beginning in 1765 American colonists recognized the need for constitutional reform in order to mitigate imperial power from London. At the same time, these debates had between colonists on the continent, and Britons in the metropole, were the product of a growing democratic spirit. This spirit that past historians have argued to have only been present in people who took up the revolutionary cause was likewise informing more moderate ideologies that sought out peaceable reform over a violent independence. At the onset of war, American colonists who refused to take up arms against the British became the enemies of the larger republican movement, which moderates had interpreted as jeopardizing the degree of liberty guaranteed by a connection to the British Constitution. By 1783, thousands of American colonists who refused to join in the rebel cause entered into an exile that propelled them into the British Atlantic world. Of the nearly fifty thousand who would leave the newly independent Thirteen Colonies, nearly thirty thousand would arrive and settle on the shores of the Fundy coast. Once there, American refugees continued to exhibit principles and beliefs that were democratic in nature, mirroring those of their more rebellious counterparts. In doing so, the refugees that arrived in the Atlantic region of modern-day Maritime Canada demonstrate the enduring legacy of American-born democratic attitudes, which shaped the development of new colonial societies throughout their diaspora.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The goal of this dissertation is to enhance our knowledge of the three-dimensional impulsive strength capacity available at the upper cervical spine and its anticipatory neuromuscular control of the superficial neck muscles by characterizing relevant strength- and muscle activity outcome variables.&#xD;
A scoping review was conducted to critically appraise the level and quality of evidence relating neck strength and neck muscle resistance training to the incidence of concussion in contact sports. Our analysis did not support the position that peak isometric strength lowers the impact severity of hits to the head. We identified the need to investigate short-latency, impulsive strength capacity and feedforward muscle activity as a potential strategy to decrease risk of head injury.&#xD;
The first study characterized the effects of head posture on the multidirectional modulation of neck strength. Results demonstrated that the upper cervical spine has a significantly decreased strength capacity compared to the lower portion, due to smaller mechanical moment arm. Impulsive static strength capacity was also significantly decreased when exerting efforts along diagonal planes and positioned in 20˚ head flexion posture. &#xD;
The second study characterized the anticipatory neuromuscular activity of the superficial neck muscles during multidirectional, ballistic-intent static contractions. The central nervous system utilizes simplifying intermuscular coordination synergies during the anticipatory phase of a ballistic-intent muscle contraction. The feedforward activities of posterior muscles frequently predict high magnitudes of static impulse generation at the upper cervical spine and are most influenced by peripheral sensory inputs induced by head flexion posture.&#xD;
The third study evaluated the effects of a simple repetitive ballistic-intent training stimulus to facilitate an acute increase in early-phase neck strength capacity and muscle activation. The single-bout of ten ballistic-intent static maximal efforts produced significant and clinically meaningful acute increases in early-phase neck strength capacity and feedforward muscle activity that persisted for at least two days post-training. &#xD;
Through our biomechanical platform, we have enhanced our understanding of how neck muscle strength capacity and activation contribute to the stability of the upper cervical spine, which serves to increase our ability to diagnose, rehabilitate, and ultimately develop strategies to prevent head and upper cervical spine injuries.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Conserving genetic diversity within a population increases both its fitness and adaptability to environmental change; however, conservation management units frequently mismatch underlying genetic structure. Further challenges are introduced when quantifying genetic diversity, as the sex ratio and geographic distribution of samples can bias measures of population differentiation. Smallmouth Bass (SMB: Micropterus dolomieu) are an economically and ecologically valuable species of territorial freshwater fish. Regulated as a single unit across Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, SMB are subject to regular anthropogenic dislocation through recreational angling. Since sex is not readily discernible from external morphology, and the genetic mechanism of sex determination is presently uncharacterized, typical SMB sex identification requires lethal autopsy. For this thesis I investigated the association of genomic markers with sex and geography for Smallmouth Bass in Eastern Lake Ontario, to improve the accuracy of phylogeographic study and subsequent conservation in the area. I hypothesized that Smallmouth Bass have an XY chromosomal system, and that genomic markers alone could identify sex. This hypothesis was tested using next-generation DNA sequencing of MluCI-SphI restriction digest associated loci from tournament-angled SMB mortalities. Although no sex-specific markers were present in males (or females), refuting the XY (and ZW) chromosome hypothesis, a leave-one-out predictive model generated with seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) correctly predicted the sex of all 23 SMB and a reference female Florida Bass (Micropterus floridanus). Flanking DNA associated with these SNPs was then BLAST-searched against an assembled SMB transcriptome and NCBI’s swissprot database; however, no homology to sex-determining factors was found. I also hypothesized that genetic structure existed within tournament mortalities, which was confirmed following hierarchical K-selection analysis of 2,138 SNPs, indicating an optimal group number of two. Although some group assignments at higher K-values corresponded to approximate geographic location, the sample size of these subpopulations was too small to draw meaningful conclusions. To address this limitation, DNA was also quantified from 228 SMB angled across Lake Ontario to facilitate future fine-scale population structure analysis. Overall, these findings can be used to better manage the SMB fishery in Eastern Lake Ontario and provide a basis for further study.</dcterms:abstract>

The current research contributes to our understanding of self-perception in children with ASD by examining whether self-perception of academic competencies differs in children with ASD compared to typically-developing (TD) controls. It also examines whether estimations of competency change after providing feedback on a task, and if parameters such as reaction time and confidence relate to perceptions. Finally, it explores other possible factors that are related to self-perception. &#xD;
 	Sixty participants, 10 to 15 years of age, completed academic tasks that consisted of verbal and math questions. Participants were asked to predict their performance before and after the tasks and were asked to rate their confidence in these predictions. The ASD group significantly overestimated their performance compared to the TD group, before and after completing the academic task. Overestimation occurred regardless of whether they were asked how many questions they would answer correctly or incorrectly. There were no differences between the groups on their confidence ratings of their performance on the tasks, suggesting that children with ASD are not overly confident in their predictions. When provided with feedback, the ASD group did not differ from the TD group in their perceptions. The ASD group was significantly more accurate with their perceptions when receiving feedback compared to no feedback, which suggests that they are able to process concrete feedback. Confidence ratings were not related to making more accurate predictions, and the length of time participants took to predict their performance did not affect accuracy in either group. Finally, the project examined two factors related to self-perception: episodic memory and social motivation did not predict self-perception in either group. &#xD;
This research provides insight into how individuals with ASD overestimate their academic competencies and helps us understand more about whether children with ASD process concrete feedback when self-evaluating. Future research should attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms and function of overestimations of competencies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The current study examined inclusive education in Ontario public schools, as it is experienced by students with invisible disabilities and their families. Invisible disabilities are those that are not immediately visible to the naked eye. Some invisible disabilities that commonly affect children include (but are not limited to) high functioning autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder, externalizing behaviours, depression/anxiety, and oppositional defiant disorder. Most literature to date focuses upon teacher/administrative perspectives of inclusion, while experiential data from families is absent. Parents, recruited through various community organizations and Quintilian Private School, completed of a survey on their families’ experiences within the Ontario public school system. Students with invisible disabilities completed an adapted photovoice exercise, where they shared a visual and textual summary of their feelings about public school and specialized private school, respectively. It was discovered that inclusive education for children with invisible disabilities is more an illusion than a reality in Ontario public schools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Between 1939 and 1945, Canada welcomed more than 10,000 British guest children into the country to escape the threats to their safety posed by the Battle of Britain and by German hostilities generally. For these children, the Canadian government loosened immigration restrictions, provided free transport from Britain, and took responsibility for arranging their schooling, housing, and medical treatment. Many Canadians supported this effort and welcomed the guest children into their homes. This outpouring of support for British evacuees contrasts sharply with Canada’s treatment of other asylum seekers in the Second World War period. As Irving Abella and Harold Troper famously argue in None is Too Many: Canada and the Jews of Europe 1933-1948 (1982), the Canadian government was specifically unwelcoming to Jewish immigrants and refugees fleeing the Holocaust —often coming from Central and Eastern Europe—when they needed protection most. Yet hundreds of the British children who were evacuated to Canada were Jewish, and their presence in this movement has thus far been understudied and unaccounted for by historians of Canadian immigration.&#xD;
This study investigates the movement of these fortunate British children, and especially of the British Jewish children; how their evacuation to Canada was justified by both British and Canadian governments; and why they were deemed worth saving when others were not. It explores the government policies of Britain and Canada that made this evacuation possible, even desirable; the work of agencies that facilitated the children’s settlement, such as Children’s Aid Societies and the Canadian Jewish Congress; and the decisions of the individual families that welcomed the children. It also explores the experiences of the children themselves who, far from home, adapted—or not—to the new homes where they settled “for the duration” of the war.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nietzsche’s idea of the overman has been interpreted in several ways and is often misunderstood.&#xD;
Observing people’s tendencies to act in specific ways along with the common forms of social&#xD;
organization and development provide us with a general overview of the collective&#xD;
consciousness, which suggests that many individuals are uncritical, conformist, and unhappy. The&#xD;
present work argues that the overman is a concept that aims toward the spiritual growth of the&#xD;
individual: overcoming the human means to reconcile with our true nature and achieve mastery&#xD;
of oneself. As an ideal, the overman has the potential to serve as a guide that helps the subject to&#xD;
better live their lives, regardless of its particular traits. If one succeeds in the task, the individual&#xD;
will empower him- or herself, and this leads to better societies eventually.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Internet has been repeatedly demonstrated to be insufficiently secure for transferring sensitive information worldwide. This insecurity is an inherent characteristic as the Internet did not make any security considerations in its initial design. Rather, as is famously known, it was designed to connect “mutually trusting users”. Such void motivated a long and extensive history of a variety of trust measures to secure Internet communications at its different levels or layers. To date, however, the proposed security measures have been identified as computationally demanding, especially as they utilize cryptographic computations. In light of the evolution of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and therefore the growing reliance on elements with limited capabilities (in terms of computing and/or energy), facilitating security becomes an equally increasing challenge. Such elements include embedded systems, sensors/actuators, small-scale mobile and wireless devices, in addition to various elements utilized in real-time and/or delay-critical applications. Considerations must therefore be made for addressing the computational challenge while providing the required security. In the meanwhile, any meaningful security solution must be global (i.e., Internet-wide) in its operation.&#xD;
Our objective in this thesis is to demonstrate that an adaptive, end-to-end security solution for the next generation Internet is viable. Integral to our thesis is a holistic and innovative proposal for a Context-Aware and Real-time Entrustment framework or (CARE). The framework comprises a set of security components and modules designed to satisfy the observed and expected needs of next generation computing networks and their elements. While introducing the components and operations of our framework, we showcase how they can help into providing security services for the futuristic NGI communication trends. We then introduce a new approach in empirical analysis for cryptographic functions through which their use of computation resource can be identified and/or predicted. The outcome of this approach is applied in designing a robust security adaptation strategy for the CARE framework. A complementary resource-aide system is also presented in order to facilitate the secure end-to-end operation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a literary, oral, historical, and political observation and analysis of Argentinean life. When responses to the Argentine dictatorship of the 70s and 80s are viewed through a feminist lens, patterns are discovered. These are confirmed in interviews with four women who experienced the dictatorship in different ways. The interviews support the conclusion that education, building a social movement, opening creative spaces, and understanding the effects of dominance and toleration are vital to understanding a community’s responses to the dictatorship. It is through an exploration of these main themes, together with an account of Argentinian independent literature, a victims’ report, and the current status of activist circles that a clearer picture of the country’s status can be imagined. Further ideas are explored such as the conditions required for civil conflict to arise, and how women’s experiences with activism and emotion may be analyzed and understood.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Lexicon of Festus has never been published in English translation. Although several modern editions were prepared in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Festus is accessible only to those who can read him in the Latin original or who can read a nineteenth-century French translation based upon a now-obsolete Latin edition. While this state of affairs may have sufficed in the past, the general decline of Latin reading ability and the delaying of Latin language study to the university undergraduate level has rendered this untranslated text inaccessible to a large swathe of students and enthusiasts in the English-speaking world. This is unfortunate not only because the Lexicon of Festus is a fascinating text in its own right, being an early example of a dictionary and encyclopedia, but also because it contains much information which will be of use to those interested in the institutions and religion of Rome, the peoples of ancient Italy, and Latin linguistics, among other topics. My edition of translated selections includes scholarly notes and a full introduction setting the Lexicon in its historical context. It makes parts of this text accessible for the first time to those without Latin reading ability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2) is a driver and clinical target in a subset of breast and ovarian cancers with high rates of metastasis. Metastatic cancer cells require rapid actin polymerization and remodeling. This vulnerability can be exploited with marine macrolide toxins targeting actin; however, to achieve clinical benefits, we must overcome the limited availability and delivery mechanisms for these actin toxins. The goal of this thesis is to test the vulnerability of metastatic HER2-positive (HER2+) cancer cells to the marine macrolide toxin Mycalolide B (Myc B) and a series of novel synthetic analogs. The effects of Myc B and analogs on HER2+ breast and ovarian cancer cell lines (HCC1954, SKOV3) were measured in cell viability, motility and invasion assays. Myc B showed potent growth suppressive and cytotoxic effects on HER2+ cancer cells. At sub-lethal doses, Myc B caused rapid loss of leading edge protrusions, and sustained defects in HER2+ cancer cell motility and invasion. Myc B treatment was compatible with killing of HER2+ cancer cells by the clinically used HER2 inhibitor Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1). In a HER2+ tumor xenograft model, intratumoral injections of Myc B reduced tumor growth and metastasis, and was most effective when combined with Trastuzumab. To address the limited availability of Myc B, we screened a panel of synthetic analogs of Myc B, and identified several capable of promoting the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton in HER2+ cancer cells, leading to increased cytotoxicity, growth suppression and impaired cell motility. With further optimization of Myc B analogs, we can develop delivery systems, including novel antibody-drug conjugates that limit metastasis in HER2+ cancers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Master's Report - School of Urban and Regional Planning -- This Master’s report analyzes CEPs in two Ontario communities through the lens of a planner, to investigate the role of professional planners in developing these plans.  This study will identify the key elements of CEPs, as related to the planner’s role, with the following specific objectives:&#xD;
•	Identifying the role of the planner in creating the CEP&#xD;
•	Recognizing how land use planning terms and concepts, such as land use, neighbourhoods, transportation and buildings, are incorporated into the documents&#xD;
•	Highlighting how planners are contributing to plan implementation&#xD;
•	Exploring opportunities and limitations to integrate energy considerations into the practice of professional planners&#xD;
Using a comparative case study approach, this report consists of a literature review, CEP document analysis and interviews with municipal planners and project leads associated with the case study’s CEPs.  The case studies include two large cities with CEPs in place that emphasize land use as a determinate of energy usage, London and Windsor, Ontario.  CEPs provide an opportunity to incorporate energy planning into the municipal decision-making process to build more efficient, and more sustainable communities.  This study is meant to inspire the planning profession to expand its role further into energy planning and to better understand how planners are to work with an increasingly popular, comprehensive form of energy planning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This work describes and demonstrates, through simulation and field trials, a technique for autonomous wheeled vehicle path following that uses iterative learning control (ILC) performed in a feedback linearized space to augment a base feedback linearization (FBL) path-following controller. The goal of ILC is to iteratively adjust steering rate inputs to account for unmodelled vehicle dynamics, environmental disturbances, and extreme path geometries. One fundamental advantage of this approach is that ILC can be used without having to employ approximate linearization at every time step, rendering the approach easily implementable and computationally inexpensive when compared with traditional approaches. The technique was validated by performing field trials using large industrial-scale autonomous underground mining vehicles. The presented work not only demonstrates the underlying technique in the field on commercial vehicles, but also proposes and validates a method for parallel speed learning, wherein the speed can be adjusted over subsequent learning trials to improve productivity. Finally, a method for pre-learning through simulation prior to deployment in the field is introduced in order to reduce initial path-following errors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Oil sands mining operations in Canada produce large volumes of waste tailings that are difficult to dewater using commercial polyacrylamide-based flocculants. Recently, a novel hydrolytically-degradable polymer was synthesized through micellar radical polymerization of short-chain polyester cationic macromonomers. Poly(PCL2ChMA), made of polycaprolactone choline iodide ester methacrylate with two polyester units, effectively treated mature fine tailings (MFT) solutions as evaluated by measuring initial settling rate, supernatant turbidity, and capillary suction time (CST) of the sediments. Moreover, the novel materials become more hydrophobic with time, leading to an 85% reduction in CST after accelerated degradation for one week at 85 °C. The achievements described in this follow-up work are twofold. First, a procedure was developed to directly measure the extent of sediment dewatering that results from the polymer degradation, as previously the performance was indirectly inferred through CST measurements. Second, an investigation of the relationship between macromonomer structure and the performance of the polymer flocculant has led to the development of an improved material. Neither the substitution of PCL with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) units or replacement of the methacrylate functionality with acrylate greatly affects the ability of the resulting cationic flocculants to settle and separate the sediments in diluted MFT solutions because the synthesized polymers had similar charge densities and molecular weights. However, the faster degradation rates of the PLA-based materials lead to significantly faster dewatering of the sediments. 50% compaction was observed in PLA-polymer flocculated samples held for 5 days at 50 °C, whereas it was necessary to increase the temperature to 85 °C to achieve the same dewatering with the PCL-polymer flocculated samples. As a comparison, it was found that dewatering did not occur when the MFT material was flocculated with a non-degradable cationic polymer, non-ionic PAM, and commercial anionic FLOPAM A3338. A similar 50% compaction occurs in MFT sediments flocculated with LA-based polymers held at room temperature over several weeks, indicating that these materials degrade at a fast enough rate to provide solids compaction under field conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Canadianization movement emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s from Canadian universities and has been treated as a brief moment in the historiography of Canada’s 1960s, post-secondary education in Canada and broader Americanization of Canadian society. The historical figureheads of the movement, Robin Mathews and James Steele, advocated for the hiring of Canadian faculty and increased Canadian content in universities across Canada. When a broader lens is used to view the Canadianization movement, it becomes apparent that the movement was the beginning of efforts to develop Canadian Studies as an interdisciplinary project in Canadian universities. Canadianizing efforts examined course content, curricula and personnel (including faculty, graduate students, and administrators) in order to foster a unique Canadian identity through the promotion of Canadian education. These studies were the origins of a number of Canadian university hiring policies and practices in place today. The Canadianization movement needs to be considered a broader movement–both chronologically and outside the involvement of Mathews and Steele–because, when it is expanded to encompass other organizations and reports that supported explicit Canadianization goals, such as the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), the Committee for an Independent Canada, the Symons’s Report, and David Cameron’s Taking Stock, the movement’s importance to Canadian education and Canadian identity becomes readily apparent.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Jews and their city of Jerusalem have been a perpetual source of discussion within Christendom. The English Reformation became more established under the Elizabethan settlement of 1559. This fundamental change in religious practice and belief also reflected a difference in how Jewish people and their holy city of Jerusalem were portrayed within sermons and other tracts written by preachers. This project explores the place of Jews and Jerusalem in the sermons of early modern English preachers. It examines questions relating to the how Jews and Jerusalem factor into the content of English sermons written between 1558-1630, focusing on four distinct themes. The first section examines the heavenly versus the earthly Jerusalem, tracing the division of the city between an earthly and heavenly place from early Church figures through to English preachers. The next section follows the usage of Jewish figures and Hebrew texts, primarily pursuing inquiry relating to two major figures, Josephus and Maimonides. Further, this project contributes to scholarship that has recognized the antisemitism prevalent throughout early modern Europe. It examines how Jews were made other and insulted in sermons, as well as compared to Catholics. It pays particular attention to how attributes assigned to biblical Jews continued to impact their early modern descendants. Finally, this project considers the replies from Catholic English Jesuits to the English Protestant settlement. It investigates how Catholics reacted and responded to Protestant claims to Jerusalem by bolstering their own associations with the city. Further, it studies how Catholics in turn would associate Protestants with Jews and "Judaizing" practices. Above all, this project's aim is to place further attention upon the uses of Jews and Jerusalem within this turbulent and formative period within English Reformation history.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Context: Greater continuity and access to primary care results in improved patient health, satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. Although patient rostering is considered to be a cornerstone of a high performing primary care system and is believed to improve continuity and access, few studies have examined these relationships.  &#xD;
Objective: Examine the impact of the adoption of a patient rostering enhanced fee-for-service model (eFFS) on continuity, coordination of specialized care, and access. &#xD;
Design: Population-based longitudinal study using health administrative data. Setting: Urban family practices in Ontario, Canada. Participants: Family physicians that transitioned from traditional FFS (tFFS) to eFFS between 2004 and 2013 were followed overtime. Physicians providing comprehensive primary care that had at least four years of pre-transition and two years of post-transition data were eligible. Patients were attributed to physicians on an annual basis by determining the provider that billed the largest dollar amount over a two year period.  Outcomes: 1) Continuity (usual provider of care index (UPC)), 2) Coordination of specialized care (Referral index (RI): % of total primary care referrals for a physician’s roster made by main provider), 3) Emergency department visits for family practice sensitive conditions (FPSCs). Analysis: Mixed-effects segmented linear and logistic regressions were used to examine changes in outcomes while controlling for patient and provider contextual factors. &#xD;
Results: Prior to transitioning, UPC was decreasing at a rate of 0.27%/year (95% CI: -0.34 to -0.21, p&lt;0.0001). Following the transition, UPC began decreasing by an additional 0.59%/year (95% CI: -0.69 to -0.49, p&lt;0.0001) compared to the pre-transition rate. RI decreased by an additional 0.34%/year (95% CI: -0.43 to -0.24, p&lt;0.0001) relative to the pre-transition period, where it had been stable. The transition had minimal impact on FPSC ED visits. &#xD;
Conclusion: Continuity and coordination of specialized care slightly decreased upon transition from tFFS to eFFS. This is likely due to physicians working in groups and sharing patients following the transition to the eFFS model.  Adoption of an enrolment model with after-hours care did not decrease non-urgent ED use, which may reflect the small impact that primary care access has on these types of ED visits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The branching ratio of the direct decay of 40K to the ground state of 40Ar through electron capture has never been experimentally measured. This rate has been shown to be vital in constraining the DAMA/LIBRA (DArk MAtter/Large sodium Iodide Bulk for RAre processes) dark matter signal claim and is a rare example of a unique third forbidden decay. The KDK (pun for Potassium Decay) project attempts to measure the ratio of electron capture to the excited state of 40Ar versus the electron capture to its ground state. The experiment will combine an enriched 40K source attached to a low energy x-ray detector surrounded by an almost 4pi coverage gamma ray detector. The low energy x-ray detector will be a Large Area Avalanche Photodiode, while the gamma ray detector will be the Modular Total Absorption Spectrometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This thesis focuses on the development, characterization and feasibility of avalanche photodiodes as low energy x-ray detectors for the KDK measurement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this thesis was to determine the feasibility of an injectable delivery formulation based on low molecular weight poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) for localized delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Formulations based on modified conjugated PTMC, ester or anhydride-linked PTMC, and poly(trimethylene carbonate-co-5-hydroxy trimethylene carbonate) (P(TMC-co-HTMC)), were synthesized. Polymers/copolymers were amorphous and injectable viscous liquids at 37 ºC. In vitro degradation study of the conjugated PTMCs showed that the anhydride bond cleaved within 24 hours, generating acidic products that lowered the pH of the buffered degradation medium. In contrast, hydrolysis of the ester bond did not result in an acidic pH; however, it degraded too slowly for the intended application. Preparing P(TMC-co-HTMC) using different catalysts revealed that HCl·Et2O is able to provide a random comonomer distribution and low toxicity burden. In vitro degradation of the resulting random copolymers was tailored by adjusting the initial HTMC content, initial molecular weight and the choice of initiator. During in vitro degradation, the pH of the medium surrounding the copolymer always remained near neutral. In vivo degradation study of P(TMC-co-HTMC)s at the molecular weight range of 1000-2000 Da with 30 mol% initial HTMC content revealed rapid degradation of the HTMC units followed by gradual elimination of the short chains produced via HTMC degradation. The inflammatory response to the injected copolymers subsided by time but was still ongoing after 22 weeks. The observed tissue response was comparable with the tissue response of a commercial MONOCRYL suture indicating that the copolymer can be considered biocompatible. In vitro protein release from the same copolymers was characterized by using lysozyme, bovine serum albumin and VEGF. This study revealed that the rate of protein release was controlled by the solubility of the lyophilized protein in the aqueous environment within the copolymer, the concentration of the salt included in the lyophilized powder, and the flexibility of the copolymer chains to form superhydrated regions. The released VEGF showed greater than 80% bioactivity throughout the release period. This delivery formulation can be used to deliver acid sensitive proteins for short or long-term delivery approaches depending on the protein physical properties.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Therapies aimed at remediating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia vary widely in their approach and delivery of cognitive training. In healthy populations, rest breaks have been shown to improve attention, performance, and subjective experience of work or cognitive tasks. Neurophysiological research has demonstrated a relationship between on-task band power, performance, and working memory load. &#xD;
Objectives: The current study aimed to assess the effect of rest breaks during cognitive training in schizophrenia through examination of cognitive performance and improvement, mean theta and alpha power, and subjective measures focused on acceptability and intrinsic motivation. &#xD;
Methods: 24 participants with schizophrenia completed three working memory tasks to assess baseline functioning and were randomized into either interval or continuous cognitive training on the N-back task, each with a total of 10-minutes of on-task training. Immediately following training, subjects completed the three working memory tasks again to assess immediate change in performance, and again following a 30-minute period of respite to assess durable change. Continuous EEG was recorded throughout, and following completion participants’ subjective experience of training was assessed with a self-report questionnaire.&#xD;
Results: The interval training group performed significantly better than the continuous training group during the training period, however this did not lead to improvement differences at post-testing on the training task. For tasks not trained on, there was a trend for significantly greater improvement following interval training with medium effect size. No differences were observed in theta or alpha band power between groups during training, nor was band power found to be significantly correlated with task difficulty or performance. There were no significant differences between groups for subjective training experience.&#xD;
Discussion: Results suggest that incorporating rest intervals in cognitive training leads to greater performance during training and enhanced skills transfer to other domains of working memory. This observation could be due to memory retention benefits of the spacing effect in the interval condition. Alternatively, results could be due to mental fatigue and/or ego depletion in the continuous condition, leading to a reduced capacity for performance and improvement on non-trained tasks. Further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanism of improvement and transfer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Azobenzene derivatives have been subject to many studies in the field of all-optical surface patterning due to their unique photoresponsive properties. Photoinduced mass movement of azobenzene enables inscription of surface relief gratings (SRG) under exposure to an interference pattern of light. Interestingly SRGs can form under single beam irradiation, where no external interference pattern is applied, and thus the structures form spontaneously. Herein, Photoinduction of spontaneous SRG (SSRG) on thin films of a disperse red 1 functionalized glass-forming compound is investigated. Glass-forming small molecules yield more homogeneous samples and it allows to mitigate the impact of the rheological effects of polymers.&#xD;
SSRG formation is assumed to initiate from an interference pattern formed between the incident beam and scattered beams at grazing angle by surface defects. Formation of SSRG’s takes place in three stages: nucleation, growth, and saturation. Herein, the grating formation procedure is studied by monitoring the surface topology of thin films exposed to one writing beam for various periods of time, under both linear and circular polarizations, using AFM. Even in the absence of surface defects on the initial film, irradiation produces light-induced surface defects due to the reorientation and mass movement of the azo molecules. These defects act as seeds for SSRG around which gratings gradually emerge and propagate throughout the sample. To consolidate this hypothesis, the formation of gratings was studied on samples with controlled surface roughness. Pore-shaped defects do not diffract light on top of the sample, and thus have no impact on SSRG growth, while for hill-shaped defects, the growth rate decreases sharply with defect sizes larger than the writing beam wavelength. The saturation stage has been studied using different intensities of the writing beam. The rate of grating growth increases as a function of laser intensity, but the gratings saturate at the same modulation amplitude, independent of the laser intensity&#xD;
Two other analogous glass-forming azobenzene derivatives were studied, and in all cases, SSRG formation was correlated with the induction of birefringence in the early stages of the irradiation. The orientation of SSRGs is influenced by the polarization of the writing beam. The direction of the gratings is determined by the optical anisotropy induced by a polarized beam. Real-time anisotropy experiments are presented to predict the grating direction. Furthermore, self-organized surface relief gratings formation under different polarizations at different incident angles was studied. Oblique irradiation of a beam polarized with a combination of p- and s-polarizations yields crossed SSRG with different pitches, forming planar chiral structures. Azimuth rotations up to 10° have been observed, and the absence of 3D chirality has been confirmed. This method thus allows generating non-reciprocal planar chiral objects by a simple, single irradiation process on a thin film of a material that can easily be processed over large areas or onto small objects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Switchable-hydrophilicity solvents (SHSs) are amine and amidine solvents that can be reversibly switched between two forms: one that forms a biphasic mixture with water and another that forms a monophasic mixture with water. The addition or removal of CO2 from SHS-based systems acts as the trigger to switch between these two forms. SHSs have attracted attention as alternative solvents for a variety of applications because their switchable behaviour allows them to be used in energy- or material- efficient ways. One such application is distillation-free solvent-solute separations. The present research builds an understanding of the properties of amines that determine whether they are SHSs or not. It also applies this understanding to the development of new SHSs with fewer health and environmental hazards, such as decreased acute toxicity and decreased volatility, as well as improved performance with respect to solvent-solute separations.&#xD;
The relationship between the pKaH and log Kow of an amine and the ability of the amine to act as a SHS is established. A mathematical model is described that can be used to predict whether an amine acts as a SHS based on these two properties. Furthermore, the influence of CO2 partial pressure and the water/amine volume ratio on these pKaH and log Kow requirements are investigated. The model acts as a guide when identifying new SHSs.&#xD;
Many new SHSs are identified with a variety of beneficial properties. SHSs that have oxygen-containing functional groups have decreased environmental, health, and safety risks than trialkylamine SHSs. Secondary amine SHSs are shown to switch to their hydrophilic state more rapidly than tertiary amine SHSs. Diamine SHSs can be more completely separated from solutes than monoamines, resulting in a more pure isolated solute after a SHS-based separation. A virtual screening approach to the design of SHSs is presented that can be used to rapidly screen thousands of compounds to identify those that are estimated to be SHSs with few environmental, health, and safety risks. The identification of new SHSs increases the options when selecting a solvent for a SHS-based process and provides data to improve the understanding of SHSs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Scoliosis is a disease characterized by spinal deformation which typically appears during adolescence and growth. Regular assessment to monitor the progression of the disease is important to ensure timely intervention. Routine assessment is performed with X-ray but other techniques are used for preliminary screening or advanced assessment. The limitations of various imaging modalities leave a need for a method for producing 3D patient-specific spinal visualizations suitable for scoliosis assessment using ultrasound imaging. This thesis presents a collection of techniques which, taken together, constitute such a method. After exploring the related background material, a method for producing visualizations from ultrasound-accessible skeletal landmarks is presented. The method uses the transverse process locations to deform a healthy-shaped spine model to match patient anatomy. Visualizations were generated and compared to CT to validate the method. Subsequent developments to the ultrasound assessment process were aimed at reducing operator interaction by automatically segmenting the spine from ultrasound, and generating landmarks to use with the visualization method. A bone segmentation method recently integrated into PLUS  was used to identify the bone surfaces in ultrasound scans. Then a variation on k-means estimates the landmark locations. Automatically generated landmarks are prone to containing defects, so a Slicer  module offering various correction operations was developed. An ultrasound scan was used to produce a visualization with automatically generated, and subsequently repaired, landmarks. Initial results demonstrate the challenges of automatically generating 3D spinal visualizations from ultrasound data. Landmarks are essentially an under-sampling of a segmentation, and degrade results through a loss of information. Furthermore, operator controlled reparation operations reintroduce user interaction. There is still promise in the overall workflow. The landmark-based visualization method has been used in published work, and modular and incremental developments may improve segmentation generation and interpretation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) can result in a continuum of neurological, behavioural, physical and learning deficits collectively referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Eye movement tasks have been shown to be a promising approach to assessing brain dysfunction in children with FASD. However, these studies were limited to school-aged children because of the nature of the structured tasks. Our objectives were to investigate whether (i) a set of standardized screening tools (Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ)) were able to identify specific patterns of developmental delay in young children who have a history of PAE, and (ii) the pattern of eye movement behaviours obtained from watching video clips could be used to differentiate young children 10-78 months with a history of PAE from control participants.&#xD;
Methods: Sixteen children with a history of PAE and twenty-one control participants watched 6-16 minutes of video clips comprised of 2-4 second clipets that were semantically unrelated. Eye movements were recorded using the Eyelink 1000.&#xD;
Results: The overall gaze distributions of children with a history of PAE did not differ from controls. Data were analyzed for both developmental and group effects. The average amplitude of saccades increased with age in the control, but not the PAE, group. Both groups exhibited developmental effects of age on fixation duration and the number of saccades per movie. Group differences were also observed; children with a history of PAE exhibited smaller amplitude saccades. Further analysis revealed that in typically developing children, the frequency of smaller amplitude saccades decreased with age. This developmental change was absent in children with PAE. Results from the ASQ indicate that children who scored poorly across one domain tended to score poorly across multiple domains. &#xD;
Conclusions: The results of this study extend previous findings that eye tracking has the potential to quantify brain damage associated with PAE. Future studies should continue to explore free viewing as a means to identify children with PAE who would benefit from further diagnostic assessment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Oxygen electrochemistry on platinum comprises of three well-known phenomena - oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), platinum oxide growth and reduction during cyclic voltammetry (CV) and logarithmic growth of oxides potentiostatically at high potentials. Many of the elementary reaction steps are common to the three reaction systems but usually separate kinetic models for the three phenomena are reported in the literature. In this thesis, we present a single reaction framework comprising multistep mechanism, that captures the key characteristics of ORR, CV and potentiostatic oxide growth. Comparison between experimental data and proposed model as well as other models is presented in this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, a mechanism for platinum dissolution was developed within the reaction framework. The proposed dissolution model captured transient platinum dissolution trends reported experimentally. &#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, an impedance model for the cathode catalyst layer was developed assuming the agglomerate structure. Analytical solution to oxygen transport within the catalyst agglomerate were derived.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Among the most common and disabling symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
are problems with balance, during both stance and gait. Balance during gait is highly dependent on stability in the mediolateral (M-L) direction. It is currently unknown how M-L stability is affected in those with low levels of disability due to MS. The objective of this multiple case series was to explore how M-L stability during gait is affected in persons with early-stage MS using narrow-base walking. Narrow-base walking has not previously been used in the MS population. The secondary objective was to explore the other common symptoms of this disease that may contribute to the experience of postural instability, using of both commonly used and novel testing techniques for the MS population.&#xD;
Methods: Three individuals with early stage MS (MS1 = female aged 25, MS2 = female aged 33, MS3 = female aged 23) were included in this study and compared to healthy age and sex-matched controls. Balance during gait was assessed using a narrow-base walking paradigm on a path 25cm in width while participants were instrumented with body-worn motion sensors. Center of mass (COM) displacement and velocity as well as head movement were assessed during these trials. Standing balance was assessed using a force-plate to derive center of pressure (COP) displacement and velocity data. Levels of fatigue, muscle weakness, sensory function, physical activity, falls frequency, and mood were also assessed.&#xD;
Results: All three participants with MS showed slight changes in M-L stability during gait as compared to healthy controls. This was evidenced in differing ways between participants and included increased peak and average M-L COM velocity and decreased gait speed. All participants with MS showed an increase in sensory thresholds on a measure of ankle proprioception and increased COP displacement while standing with their eyes closed on a foam surface.&#xD;
Conclusion: Subtle differences in M-L stability could be detected using the narrow-base walking paradigm. Using body-worn motion sensors to assess stability during gait in the MS population may be a useful technique in detecting small changes to stability early in the disease.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recent technological advancements in next generation sequencing techniques, enabling the use of thousands of genetic markers across an individual’s genome, and continued improvements to the spatial resolution and information content of remote sensing data, present a unique opportunity to investigate the finest geographic scale at which genetic structuring within and between populations becomes detectable. However, in order to exploit the integration of both high resolution genetic and geospatial data, an understanding of the uncertainties associated with both data sets, and the accuracy requirements of landscape genetic analyses of geospatial models, is required. In this thesis, I begin by highlighting some sources of uncertainty and bias in landscape models derived from high resolution LiDAR data which have the potential to impact downstream analyses of the correlation between patterns of genetic structuring and landscape heterogeneity. I then investigate the patterns of genetic structuring between breeding aggregations of the spring peeper, Pseudacris crucifer. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
I discovered that while different methodologies to derive land cover from airborne LiDAR data may result in similar overall accuracy, the configuration of landscape heterogeneity within the landscape, and class-specific recall and precision differed between models. A significant finding is that some classification methodologies did not accurately represent the contiguity of a road, which is often considered a putative barrier for amphibians. While ddRADseq could not resolve signatures of fine-scale genetic differentiation between breeding aggregations of Pseudacris crucifer within distances of &lt;10 km, some differentiation between sampling locations separated by 60 km was detected. This grants some insight into the scale of genetic structuring of Pseudacris crucifer, and provides some representation of hylids in the population genetic literature. Ultimately this thesis highlights the importance for communication and collaboration between biologists and geospatial scientists to ensure the optimal modeling of heterogeneity with landscapes to address a wider array of applications in ecology and landscape genetics, as well as an accurate representation of uncertainty in geospatial models in ecological and landscape genetic analyses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Energy efficiency has been a long standing issue faced by municipal managers when dealing with water distribution systems as these systems are energy intensive.

Also, common practice unit headloss thresholds as well as replacement approaches are put into perspective from an energy standpoint.&#xD;
Chapter 3 introduces a set of pipe-level energy metrics and shows how location and flow intensity (as a result of diurnal changes of demand) can affect energy metrics in pipes. Technical Chapter 4 illustrates that energy indicators such as Net Energy Efficiency (NEE) and Energy Lost to Friction (ELTF) would be driven by average unit headloss. Subsequently, using regression analysis mathematical relationships between unit headloss and the two metrics of NEE and ELTF are explored to assess common-practice unit headloss thresholds as well as stricter ones, regarding efficiency. Stricter levels of NEE and ELTF energy based upon thresholds of unit headloss are expected, though at high cost. PCA results in technical Chapter 5 reveal relative importance of hydraulic parameters in energy efficiency. Also, some factors such as diameter and CHW are not as key as typically expected by water utilities in earmarking low-efficiency pipes. Further, efficiency as a missing link in common-practice replacement approaches can add value to bigger asset management landscape.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Consumers who desire consumption items are thought to engage in a process of steps allowing them to seek out information, engage in transactions and thereby gain value from their consumer journey. However, not all desired consumption items are immediately accessible to, or realistic for, all consumers and may be deemed “unattainable” by consumers, even though they are also desired and explored via the imagination. Thus, might it be possible for some consumer journeys to exist solely in the mind of the consumer? &#xD;
This dissertation conceptualizes how consumers engage in imaginative mental experiences to create alternative consumer journeys for desired yet unattainable consumption items by integrating prior literature. Evidence derived from exploratory interviews suggests consumers do explore their desired yet unattainable consumption items through imagination, prompting three successive research questions that are the focus of this dissertation. First, when consumers explore desired consumption via imaginative mental experiences, what factors influence their engagement in imaginative mental experiences? Second, when consumers engage in imaginative mental experiences, what are the experiences of consumers who create alternative consumer journeys via imaginative mental experiences? And, third, what outcomes do consumers gain from creating alternative consumer journeys via imaginative mental experiences when consumption is deemed unattainable? &#xD;
Empirical testing of the extended conceptual framework includes a consumer survey, interviews and experimental designs. When consumers identify desired consumption items as unattainable, they are likely to increase their engagement in activities which support and coincide with imaginative mental experience engagement. The imaginative mental experiences consumers create involve an immersive exploration of the experiences they wish to have when they attain their consumption desires. These experiences incorporate their prior knowledge and prior experience. Imaginative mental experiences offer consumers who find their desired consumption to be unattainable the ability to create alternative consumer journeys.  This dissertation contributes an augmented understanding of the consumer journey framework by suggesting imagination as an important touchpoint of consumer journeys. As well, this thesis contributes an understanding of the outcomes consumers can experience relating to their imaginative exploration of desired, yet unattainable, consumption items even though they are not engaging in consumption at this time.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Andean lakes are hotspots of biodiversity and serve as critical freshwater resources for millions of people. However, little information is available regarding their ecological responses to anthropogenic climate change, which is occurring rapidly in the Andes. Recent paleolimnological work has revealed marked shifts in diatom species in relation to enhanced water column stratification, caused by warming air temperatures and declining wind speeds. However, the response of higher trophic order consumers in the lakes is not well understood. A paleolimnological examination of Cladocera from four lakes in Cajas National Park, southern Ecuador, recorded relative increases in Daphnia and decreases in Bosmina during the period of recent warming. Cajas lakes were formerly believed to be polymictic, however many now thermally stratify by several degrees for large portions of the year. The deployment of temperature data loggers in four Cajas lakes revealed maximum thermal stratification between November to May, when air temperatures were highest and wind speeds were lowest. The mechanism driving cladoceran assemblage shifts is likely a combination of direct thermal response, as well as indirect bottom-up (food supply) and top-down (predation) factors. In a further examination of three shallow (&lt; 5 m) non-stratified Cajas lakes, climate-related cladoceran shifts did not occur, though long-term assemblage changes appeared to track size of the littoral area, perhaps reflecting water level shifts caused by catchment alteration and/or precipitation shifts. To determine climate change impacts elsewhere in the Andes, three non-stratified lakes were examined from the Cordillera Vilcanota, Peru. The cladoceran assemblages from the two deepest lakes showed marked shifts in the past (i.e., &gt; 150 years ago), possibly related to glacier activity and water level changes. However, none of the three lakes experienced marked cladoceran shifts over the past century, despite climate stations ~60–70 km away recording temperature increases. The relatively stable assemblages over the last century may be due to the lack of thermal stratification, caused by a climate-moderating effect from nearby glaciers. Collectively, this thesis provides among the first paleolimnological cladoceran data from the Andes and highlights the potential importance of lake stratification and related limnological changes in driving cladoceran assemblage composition.</dcterms:abstract>

I consider the presence of humour, humility, sanctimony, and devotion in Henry III’s ideals of kingship and as demonstrated through repeated iconographies in the king’s halls. I propose new avenues of inquiry and interpretation, rather than submitting a comprehensive survey of Henry III’s artistic and architectural patronage.&#xD;

This dissertation begins with an examination of the documentary, architectural, archaeological, and antiquarian evidence of Henry III’s wall painting commissions (Chapter 2), followed by an in-depth discussion of the methodological approaches and analyses explored throughout (Chapter 3). Three iconographical case study chapters are at the core of this dissertation, each examining a favoured narrative or allegory. The first (Chapter 4) concerns Henry III’s commission of the parable of Dives and Lazarus in his great halls at the castles of Ludgershall, Guildford, and Northampton. The second (Chapter 5) reviews the narrative painting of the Dialogue of Solomon and Marcolf in the lesser hall at Westminster Palace. The third (Chapter 6) is a study of Henry III’s choice of painting the Wheel of Fortune in the great hall at Winchester Castle and the king’s hall at Clarendon Palace. These chapters highlight the subversive nature of Henry III’s wall painting commissions as they relate to the playful reversal of social hierarchies and a deviation from traditional models of kingship.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The performance of dynamic prosthetic foot devices is influenced by both the functional design and alignment of the device in the prosthetic system. Although this is recognized, studies of the interaction of these factors are limited. One measure of performance in unilateral transtibial amputee gait is the progression of the centre of pressure (COP) throughout stance. Recently, Klenow et al., developed a method of quantitatively identifying the “dead spot” phenomenon (DSP), described as an interruption of the forward progression of prosthetic foot COP during stance in amputee gait, as measured by COP progression velocity. The aim of this study was to isolate the effects of sagittal alignment changes on three DSP measures in the rearfoot and forefoot. These were: 1) DSP Time – the duration of the interruption in forward progression, 2) DSP Magnitude – the minimum forward velocity during the interruption and 3) DSP Progression – the displacement of the COP during the interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
A study was designed in which a cohort of patients representing a range of prosthesis users were assessed in a clinical setting at the time of alignment of their prosthetic system. A custom portable gait analysis system was fabricated and commissioned to analyse over-ground walking trials of eight unilateral transtibial amputees fitted with prescribed prosthetic devices. Rearfoot and forefoot DSP of the intact and affected limbs were analysed during pre-alignment and post-alignment conditions using the three DSP measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
DSP Progression was determined to be a clinically appropriate measure, capturing the effect of clinical alignment in the sagittal plane with the presence of observed DSP. Observed effects of alignment corresponded with clinical goals in forward progression and limb symmetry. Based on the analysis of aligned systems completed by the partnered prosthetist, recommendations of clinically significant values were determined to be 4mm of rearfoot DSP Progression and 3.5mm of asymmetry in rearfoot DSP Progression. Forefoot DSP Progression was observed to increase on average of 4mm in the intact limb.  The recommended DSP values can be used as a clinician tool to confirm alignment changes and to help develop prosthetic foot prescription guidelines related to DSP.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: In exercising skeletal muscle, oxygen delivery (O2Del) increases in proportion to oxygen cost (O2) to support aerobic production of the cell’s energy currency, ATP, and sustained exercise efforts. When O2Del/demand matching is acutely reduced within an individual, even if VO2 is maintained, greater fatigue occurs.  Whether functionally significant differences in O2Del/demand matching exist between individuals, and whether these also impact fatigue, remains unknown. Purpose: 1. Identify inter-individual differences in exercising leg O2Del across a range of work rates (WR). 2. Determine whether those with relatively lower delivery exhibit increased fatigue progression. Methods: Ten healthy men completed multiple trials of progressive isometric knee extensor exercise (IKEE) to exhaustion to quantify individual O2Del/WR relationships. O2Del was determined as leg blood flow via ultrasound x arterial oxygen content (blood sampling). Higher and lower responder identification was based on O2Del/WR responses.  A submaximal exercise fatigue test (SEFT) at 70% of peak, with intermittent maximal effort contractions, was used to track fatigue. Results: Higher versus lower O2Del/WR response individuals (p &lt; 0.001) were identified and grouped accordingly.  Differences in vasodilation accounted for O2Del/WR differences (p &lt; 0.05). However, there was no between group difference in fatigue index (FI) (p = 0.43). This may have been because of the large variation in exercise efforts during the SEFT, confounding fatigue assessment.  In a follow up study, it was determined if practice would improve repeatability and accuracy of exercise efforts to guide future study design.  Participants performed 3 SEFTs on separate days. Initial MVC demonstrated good repeatability between trials (COV &lt; 10%) but this did not improve with practice (p = 0.2).  FI repeatability was problematic (COV &gt; 10%), and did not improve with practice (p = 0.258). No significant interaction between the trial number and MVC interval on the average WR efforts (p = 0.673) suggests that the WR performed remained consistent within and between trials. Conclusion: In IKEE, there are inter-individual differences in O2Del/WR, which are attributable to differences in vasodilation. The SEFT did not detect any impact of O2Del/WR on fatigability, perhaps because of poor repeatability of FI, that was not improved with practice.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inconel X-750 is an age-hardened Ni-based superalloy with high mechanical strength and creep resistance. The X-750 alloy is extensively used in the cores of reactors, such as spacers in CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) fuel channels. The recent mechanical tests on the ex-service Inconel X-750 spacers indicate significant embrittlement and reduced load carrying capacity compared to as installed condition. The primary degradation mechanism remains unclear, and thus provides the focus of this investigation. Heavy-ion irradiation was employed as an emulator for neutron irradiation to explore the microstructural evolution and mechanical property degradation in X-750 Ni-based superalloy. The ion-irradiation has been conducted at different temperatures and up to different doses. In addition, helium-implantation prior to heavy-ion irradiation was used to investigate the effect of helium on microstructural changes. The discussion of the microstructural evolution is focused on characterization of irradiation-induced defects, including dislocation loops and cavities along with examination of the stability of strengthening phase γ'-precipitates. A major contribution of this work is to utilize a focused ion beam (FIB) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to perform precise defect characterization. The microstructure is correlated to the mechanical properties obtained via nano-hardness test on irradiated materials. In order to estimate the individual contribution of defects in radiation-induced hardening, three different obstacle-hardening models have been applied to fit TEM-obtained microstructural data. The superposition of contributions is made in each model and compared with nano-scale experimental results. This approach is unique to the literature since it demonstrates both the individual and the combined effects of the microstructural features on mechanical behavior. Furthermore, the effect of gamma-prime instability on mechanical properties of irradiated X-750 was investigated and the strength softening raised from disordering and also dissolution of gamma-prime was evaluated.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background:  In the Mammary Prevention.3 (MAP.3) randomized placebo-controlled trial of exemestane, postmenopausal women experienced a loss in bone mineral density (BMD). UGT2B17 facilitates excretion of androgens and exemestane. For Caucasian postmenopausal women, this gene deletion is hypothesized to have 1) a protective effect on BMD and 2) worsened BMD in exemestane users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objective: The study objectives include studying the relationship between UGT2B17 genotype and 1) total hip and lumbar spine BMD at baseline with effect modification by previous bone medication or HRT use and 2) a meaningful decline total hip and lumbar spine BMD after two-years with effect modification by exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: The BMD of all MAP.3 participants was assessed at study entry, and two-year follow-up BMD was obtained from two bone sub-studies, MAP.3 Bone Strength Substudy and MAP.3 Bone Substudy.  The relative risk was calculated from multivariate modified Poisson regression models to assess the association between the UGT2B17 genotype and BMD with interaction by previous bone medication or HRT use and two-year change in BMD with interaction by exemestane. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Amongst women who never used bone medications or HRT, the UGT2B17 deletion polymorphism had a borderline significant association with lumbar spine BMD at baseline (RR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.51-1.00), but the relationship was null with the total hip. There were no statistically significant associations between the UGT2B17 gene deletion and change in the total hip and lumbar spine BMD two years from baseline (RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.64-2.12 and RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.58-1.64 respectively), nor was there a significant interaction with treatment (pinteraction = 0.57 and pinteraction = 0.18 respectively).  &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: While the UGT2B17 deletion polymorphism was associated with a borderline protective effect in lumbar spine BMD amongst postmenopausal women who never used bone medications or HRT, it was not significantly associated with two-year change in BMD. There was no evidence of a statistical interaction by treatment between UGT2B17 genotype and two-year change in BMD. Future goals of research pertaining to the UGT2B17 gene deletion should focus on its effect on endogenous estrogen availability in relation to BMD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The interface transmissivity (θ) and hydraulic conductivity (k) of conventional and multicomponent geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) were examined for a range of normal stresses (i.e., 10 kPa, 25 kPa, 50 kPa and 150 kPa) when placed in contact with smooth and textured geomembranes (GMBs). Solutions that vary in ionic strength and chemical composition (i.e., RO water, synthetic landfill leachate (SL3) and synthetic high saline solution (brine)) were examined to assess their effect on GCL interface transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity. In addition, several parameters including: GMB stiffness, GMB texture, bentonite enhancement, GCL pre-hydration condition, coating orientation and texture for multicomponent GCLs, and presence of defects were examined for different normal stresses. The interface transmissivity decreased non-linearly with increasing normal stress, with most of the decrease occurring for stresses up to 50 kPa; the effect was relatively small between 50 kPa and 150 kPa. The effect of GMB stiffness and texture was minor for the GCL-GMB combinations examined at high stress levels, but could be quite significant at low stress levels. High saline solutions suppressed the swelling capacity of bentonite leading to high interface transmissivity. Bentonite enhancement and pre-hydration of GCL with RO water improved the GCL performance when hydrated and permeated with brine leading to lower interface transmissivity (θ). Coating defects in multicomponent GCLs resulted in two modes of flow for which interface transmissivity: (i) flow at the GMB-geofilm interface (θGMB/Geofilm) and (ii) flow at the geofilm- rest of GCL interface (θGeofilm/GCL).&#xD;
 Assessment of leakage (Q) and contaminant concentration (cp) at the underlying aquifer for a hypothetical containment facility using semi-analytical and finite element approaches was conducted. The results highlighted the effect of interaction between interface transmissivity (θ) and hydraulic conductivity (k) on the estimated leakage (Q), hence the contaminant concentration (cp) at the aquifer level. The results also suggested that wrinkle and failed seam lengths have a significant effect on the performance of the contaminant facility but that this is also closely linked to the interface transmissivity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ability of individuals to change breeding time is predicted to be an important aspect of adapting to climate change. Changes in breeding time could occur through either behavioural adjustment of breeding time or evolution. To date, few studies have investigated these processes in Arctic environments, where temperature is rising at a greater rate than the global mean. I evaluated the contribution of behavioural adjustment of breeding time and evolution to changes in breeding time associated with annual variation in snow melt and female breeding age over a 42-year dataset from an Arctic population of Black Guillemots (Cepphus grylle mandtii). I used an Animal Model to decompose the variance observed in breeding time and I used three fitness metrics in a bivariate Animal Model to estimate selection on clutch initiation DOY. Finally, I examined the temporal trend in the genetic component of variation in clutch initiation date to determine if evolution contributed to the shift in breeding time. During the study period mean clutch initiation date advanced 7.8 days, snow melt date advanced 7.6 days, and the average female breeding age increased by 4.7 years. Earlier clutch initiation was associated with experienced mothers, earlier snow melt, and higher fitness. Individuals advanced clutch initiation at different rates as they aged but responded similarly to variation in snow melt. Heritability of clutch initiation date was negligible (h2 = 0.04, 95% CI [0.00-0.11]), and there was no evidence of evolution contributing to the change in breeding time. My results suggest that covariation between clutch initiation date and fitness is driven by environmental, but not genetic factors. Consequently, changes of breeding time in Black Guillemots are likely driven by plastic behavioural adjustment with limited potential for evolutionary change.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Over the past decade, significant advancements in main group chemistry have led to an exciting renaissance in the field. The pioneering discoveries made in the mid 2000s by Dr. Stephan and Dr. Erker have paved the way for the flourishing field of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysis that we are familiar with today. Continued efforts have been made in the field to find alternative Lewis acids that are more robust, synthetically simple and air and moisture stable than the highly fluorinated aryl boranes commonly employed as FLP catalysts.  A variety of group 14-16 element Lewis acids have been examined, however, to date none offer a competitive alternative. Recently, there has been interest in using carbon-based Lewis acids, specifically pyridinium based salts as FLPs. &#xD;
This thesis describes our attempts to synthesize carbon-based pyridinium Lewis acids and their application as FLP reduction catalysts. We report the synthesis of two 1,4-dihydropyridines and their corresponding pyridinium salts: N-phenyl Hantzsch ester (HE) and N-(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl HE. We examined the activity of both pyridinium salts for the hydrosilylation of many carbon-heteroatom double bonds and determined that N-(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl HE pyridinium was the most active catalyst. However, a troubling induction period was observed in all catalytic reactions. Upon changing the reaction solvent to 1,4-dioxane, the reaction rate was dramatically increased and no induction period was observed. &#xD;
Subsequently, while employing a control reaction, it was determined that N-(4-trifluoromethyl) phenyl HE pyridinium may not be the catalytically active species. Instead, in situ generated cationic silylium species, may be the active catalyst. More research must be completed to identify the catalytically active species and determine how these species are generated. &#xD;
A brief study of the potential of N-(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl HE pyridinium as a hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of aldimines has been presented. It was observed that the desired amine was generated in low quantities. Furthermore, N-(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl HE pyridinium has the potential to be an active catalyst however, further optimization of catalytic conditions must be accomplished. &#xD;
The research described herein will detail the work completed to identify the potential of carbon-based N-aryl HE pyridinium salts as Lewis acids for FLP-type reduction catalysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Inflammatory pain can occur following tissue insult, bacterial infection, arthritis and various autoimmune diseases and is initiated and maintained by a well-orchestrated response of recruited and tissue-resident immune cells. When activated, these immune cells secrete inflammatory factors that have the capability to modulate pain through excitation of nociceptive primary afferent sensory neurons (nociceptors). Current treatments for inflammatory pain include NSAIDs and opioids, which provide modest, short-term benefits, but adverse side effects. Thus, there is a need for novel, safe and efficacious treatments for inflammatory pain. &#xD;
     It is increasingly clear in the literature that interactions between nociceptors and immune cells regulate pain. The use of cell depletion strategies is necessary in order to assess the involvement of immune cells in inflammatory pain in pre-clinical studies. Previous work has considered the contribution of mast cells, αβ T cells, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages to inflammatory pain outcomes, and only a subset of myeloid cells were necessary contributors to mechanical hypersensitivity outcomes, but not thermal hypersensitivity. &#xD;
     We sought to understand the contribution of skin-resident γδ T cells in nociception and inflammatory pain. To achieve this, we used wild-type (TCRδ+/+), heterozygous (TCRδ+/-) and knock-out (TCRδ-/-) mice to determine if there is a link between γδ T cells and pain outcomes. Mouse responsiveness to pain was assessed using behavioural tests to measure mechanical and thermal sensitivity in both male and female TCRδ mice, before and after injury. The characterization of these cells in naïve animals demonstrated that γδ T cells are not necessary for modulating mechanical and thermal sensitivity in male or female mice, excluding the female response to high heat stimuli (55°C). Using three inflammatory pain models (formalin, incisional wound and Complete Freund’s adjuvant), hypersensitivity outcomes between TCRδ strains did not differ in their responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli after injury. Together, these results suggest that γδ T cells do not contribute directly to peripheral nociception and inflammatory pain in mice. Future studies should consider other skin-resident immune cells and their secreted factors as they may provide alternative results and potentially novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory pain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Gestagens are a class of steroid hormones capable of binding and activating progesterone receptors. Gestagens include endogenous progestogens, such as progesterone (P4), which have critically important roles in vertebrate physiology and reproduction and synthetic P4 analogues (progestins), such as melengestrol acetate (MGA). Both gestagens are administered as growth promotants in beef cattle and have been measured in surface water receiving runoff from animal agricultural operations. This project aims to understand the roles and the regulatory mechanisms of P4 in early amphibian development and to assess the consequences of exposures to environmental gestagens on the P4-receptor signaling pathways in frog embryos. We first established the developmental transcript profiles of the three P4 receptors in Western clawed frog (Silurana tropicalis) embryos. P4-receptor mRNAs were detected but differentially expressed throughout embryogenesis. Secondly, we conducted P4 and MGA acute exposures to an environmentally realistic range of concentrations to determine the effects of embryonic exposure to gestagens on development, mortality, and gene expression of reproduction-related genes. Acute exposure to P4 induced a 2- to 5-fold change increase of steroid hormone receptor mRNA levels, whereas MGA exposure induced a dissimilar transcriptional profile than P4. Therefore, we conclude that that MGA and P4 may signal through different molecular cascades in frogs. This is the first study to report developmental transcript profiles in embryonic frogs and to assess the molecular effects of MGA exposure in frogs. While our data suggests that P4 and MGA have dissimilar effects, exposure to either P4 or MGA induced multiple endocrine responses and adverse effects at environmentally realistic concentrations in S. tropicalis. Therefore, we conclude that environmental gestagen contamination may pose a risk to wild populations of amphibians.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Researchers have accurately quantified the Pivot-Shift Test of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury over the past decade using navigation systems, electromagnetic sensors and inertial sensors. However, these tests have been conducted under anesthetic, which negate the contribution of muscular guarding from structures surrounding the knee that could make it difficult to generalize the measures for a pre-operative diagnosis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the quantification of the Pivot-Shift Test differed between a non- anesthetized and anesthetized state (intra-operatively where no muscle activity is possible), and if the difference could be attributed to muscular guarding. To achieve this, 12 patients who had acquired a unilateral ACL-injury were tested on the day of their ACL reconstructive surgery. Acceleration and muscle activity were recorded over 10 consecutive Pivot-shift tests on their injured and uninjured knee pre-operatively and intra-operatively from 8 Delsys Trigno wireless EMG electrodes and 2 Delsys accelerometers. From the results, the slope of net tibial acceleration could differentiate between the injured and uninjured knee (mean difference, 2.14 g/s, p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the slope was larger in intra-operatively than in pre-operatively (mean difference, 1.92 g/s, p&lt;0.05) indicating that a difference between conditions. Non- normalized semitendinosus muscle activity explained a proportion of the difference in slope between the pre-op and intra-op (b = 0.6, p&lt;0.05), suggesting hamstring muscular guarding was at play. However, comparing muscle activity during the Pivot-Shift Test to the participant’s maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) produced results over 100%, suggesting that maximums were taken incorrectly. Thus, without normalizing, the generalizability of the muscular activity results is limited. Finally, no correlation between the slope and the clinical grade in either pre-op or intra-op was found. As a result, the objective quantification of the clinical grade was not possible. The lack of a correlation was speculated to be, in-part, due to the subjective grading scale that was the reference measurement for the grade of injury. Future research should consider changing the method by which MVICs are taken and the grade of injury should be based on diagnostic imaging.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation weaves Indigenous and decolonial scholarship together with recent work on ignorance to consider the constraints and possibilities of decolonizing education in the current Canadian context of reconciliation. While the study of knowledge and its nature has been the focus of Western thought since ancient times, it is only recently that scholars have begun to grapple with ignorance as a social and political phenomenon in its own right. Ignorance, as these scholars use the term, is not a neutral or incidental absence of knowledge, waiting to be filled. Rather, it is epistemological, a powerful organizing logic that emerges from and works to sustain strategic methods of not knowing that, consciously or not, function to perpetuate the status quo, privilege, and domination. Ignorance in this sense is deeply tied to settler colonialism. To survive as a political and economic system, settler colonialism requires normalization of the ways of thinking that legitimate denigration and subjugation of Indigenous nationhoods. This dissertation elucidates the role of formal education in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, in encouraging the formation of political subjects with deep, and often unacknowledged, investments in the maintenance of settler colonial relations of power. My colleagues and I worked with over 200 Indigenous educators to develop a research tool that seeks to assess how Ontario high school graduates are learning to think about colonialism and its relationship to First Nations, Métis and Inuit people(s) and Canadian society. This co-designed questionnaire was then disseminated to the first-year cohorts at 10 Ontario universities (over 42,000 students). Results from this study, together with findings from analysis of the most recent generation of Ontario K-12 curricula and textbooks, demonstrate the endurance of colonial modes of thought and their role in undermining the epistemological and affective orientations necessary for the development of decolonizing relations. I argue the importance of epistemic responsibility to enacting the decolonizing promise of new educational emphases. Moving racism and colonial violence to a different place in Canadian public consciousness requires disrupting the economies of value and attention that work to perpetuate colonial ignorance and legitimate ongoing Indigenous dispossession.</dcterms:abstract>
