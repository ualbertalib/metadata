      <dcterms:abstract>Sexual arousal involves changes in physiology, emotions, and cognitions, and is positively associated with sexual outcomes (e.g., sexual activity, sexual desire) and well-being (e.g., physical and mental health, overall quality of life). As such, factors that influence sexual arousal are expected to also influence sexual outcomes and well-being. Theoretical models propose that sexual arousal and subsequent sexual outcomes are the product of a cognitive-motivational processes; however, relatively little research has investigated these underlying processes in samples of men and women. This has resulted in a large body of literature documenting gender differences in sexual arousal and sexual outcomes, with little understanding of how these outcomes develop. My program of research seeks to understand the attentional processes involved in processing sexual cues, with a specific focus on elucidating cognitive-motivational factors contributing to the gender effects observed in sexual response patterns. Informed by cognitive-motivational models of sexual response, the three studies investigate different stages of attentional processing and examine how features of these stages influence sexual response in men and women. Results of these studies confirm gender similarities and differences in automatic, initial, and controlled attentional processing of sexual cues, as well as the stimulus features capable of capturing attention. The results of these studies indicate the presence of several distinct information-processing mechanisms that may be relevant to the regulation of sexual response (i.e., attentional orienting and capture, difficulty disengaging, and attentional adhesion). Implications of this research include greater understanding of the cognitive-motivational processes involved in sexual arousal contributing to normative sexual functioning and how this may differ for men and women. The paradigms and processes identified in the current studies may have direct implications for the development of new measures to assess sexual interest, identifying mechanisms underlying sexual function and dysfunction, as well as informing the development of attention-based interventions for individuals who have difficulties regulating their sexual arousal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, the automobile industry is integrating many new features into vehicles. To provide these features, various electronic systems are being added. These systems are coordinated by different ECUs (Electronic Control Unit). Vehicle ECUs are internally connected through multiple communication buses. Any ECU connected to the bus can read or send data to other ECUs. As a result, if an adversary can compromise one of the ECUs, then the adversary will be able to access and exploit data of other important ECUs. The absence of confidentiality is the main reason for that. Furthermore, the absence of data integrity and authenticity make the communications more vulnerable. In the past, it has been shown that an adversary can take control of the vehicle exploiting the inadequacy of CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticity). Moreover, an adversary can modify the stored data of an important ECU, if it is compromised. To solve these problems, we propose the use of symmetric key cryptography and elliptic curve-based Public Key Encryption (PKE) for ensuring confidentiality and the use of digital signature for ensuring integrity and authenticity. In addition, we propose the adoption of an identity-based access control in Mother ECUs (MECU, also known as a domain controller) to control the communication permissions. We also introduce Blockchain in vehicles to protect the stored data of ECUs. Finally, we integrate a watcher to monitor the stored data and report if it is modified. &#xD;
&#xD;
We implement the proposed technique in two platforms, namely Docker and the ARM architecture-based Raspberry Pi Board. Our experiments show that the proposed technique can improve security in ECU communications. The watcher reports when an ECU data is modified which helps limit the damage when an ECU is compromised.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Not only do adults with disabilities have a right to participate, they have the right to full participation. Enabling full participation means having access to and engaging in a range of opportunities that are satisfying and enjoyable, and generate personally valued outcomes. Currently, it is unclear how community-based physical activity programs provide individuals with developmental disabilities the opportunity to participate regardless of their abilities. Additionally, there is a need to understand how community-based physical activity programs promote full participation through increasing quality experiences. According to Martin Ginis and colleagues (2017) a quality experience includes one or more of the following elements: autonomy, belongingness, challenge, engagement, meaning and mastery. The purpose of this study was to explore the subjective experience of participation to understand how community- based physical activity programs for adults with developmental disabilities foster full participation. Eleven adults with developmental disabilities were given a disposable camera to take photos of their participation experience in a community-based physical activity program. Participants discussed their photos in a semi-structured interview; interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Three facilitators to physical activity engagement associated with community-based physical activity program emerged: the opportunity to participate regardless of ability, partnerships with community organizations and familial/caregiver support. These three strategies helped individuals with developmental disabilities overcome barriers to physical activity, allowing access to participation experiences. In relation to quality experiences, all six elements of a quality experience as identified by Martin Ginis and colleagues (2017) emerged. Three factors that foster quality elements were discussed: positive social relationships, the role of a volunteer and the adaptability of the program. Finally, two outcomes of quality experiences were discussed by participants: pride and fun. This study is the first to investigate the subjective experience of community-based physical activity program participation for individuals with developmental disabilities through a quality participation lens. Results highlight factors within a community-based physical activity program that are important for providing access to participation experiences and fostering quality elements among individuals with developmental disabilities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Insulin is a key hormone in the regulation of blood glucose levels in many animals. Dysfunctional insulin signaling is one of the leading mechanisms of interest for the pathogenesis of diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the claim of a link between diabetes and AD, the results in the literature have been incongruent. Some studies have claimed that insulin resistance is a major implication of AD, while others have reported that the risk is increased by excess insulin in the blood. Using the microscopic worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, we have developed a model to study the link between insulin signaling and AD pathologies, including changes in neuronal morphology and abnormal behaviour. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of hyperactive insulin signaling on the expression of the two characteristic proteins of AD, amyloid-beta and tau. By genetically modifying the key players of the insulin-signaling pathway and the 40 insulin-like peptides in C. elegans, we may be able to identify novel targets for the prevention or treatment of AD. In this research, we tested whether the 40 insulin-like peptides are inhibitors or activators of the insulin-signaling pathway, based on the aforementioned phenotypes associated with AD. Alternatively, some of these 40 insulin-like peptides may work through the non-canonical insulin-signaling pathway, with the potential of pointing us to novel genetic interactors. Our work has shown that of the 40 insulin-like peptides, some exacerbated AD-related pathologies, while others reduced them. Understanding the function of the components of the insulin-signaling pathway and the 40 insulin-like peptides in C. elegans may clarify the link between defective insulin signaling and AD and present novel treatment strategies for the disease.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Cultural production and entrepreneurship are two major components of today’s global economic system as well as important drivers of social development. Recently, Cuba has introduced substantial reforms to its socialist economic model of central planning in order to face a three-decade crisis triggered by the demise of the USSR. The transition to a new model, known as the “update,” has two main objectives: to make the state sector more efficient by granting more autonomy to its organizations; and to develop alternative economic actors (small private businesses, cooperatives) and self-employment. Cultural production and entrepreneurship have been largely absent from the debates and decentralization policies driving the “update” agenda. This is mainly due to culture’s strategic role in the ideological narrative of the ruling political leadership, aided by a dysfunctional, conservative cultural bureaucracy. The goal of this study is to highlight the potential of cultural production and entrepreneurship for socioeconomic development in the context of neoliberal globalization. While Cuba is attempting to advance an alternative socialist project, its high economic dependency makes the island vulnerable to the forces of global neoliberalism. This study focuses on Havana’s music sector, particularly on the initiatives, musicians and music professionals operating in the informal economy that has emerged as a consequence of major contradictions and legal gaps stemming from an outdated cultural policy and ambiguous regulation. The research privileges the analysis of alternative music scenes such as hip-hop, electronic dance music, rock and reguetón. Several case studies of cultural producers/entrepreneurs that operate at the margins of the state institutions are presented. By using a tailored variation of the creative economy paradigm applied to the Cuban context the study demonstrates the importance of recognizing the new models of cultural management that have emerged in Havana as legitimate economic actors. Although the potential of partnerships between private and state actors is acknowledged, the research concludes that the majority of these new models would have a larger positive impact by operating from a properly regulated non-state sector, where the most important incentives for artists and cultural entrepreneurs are currently located. This would require major transformations in Cuba’s cultural policy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Irradiation-induced dislocation loops are important defects that affect zirconium alloys used in the manufacture of major structural components of nuclear reactors. In this thesis atomistic simulations and theoretical modellings are performed to analyze and explain experimental observations made by other authors. The formation and growth of different types of dislocation loops are believed to be responsible for different stages of irradiation damage, and it is necessary to understand their formation and development. However, the fundamental mechanisms behind them are still not fully elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate formation and growth mechanisms of different types of dislocation loops under various complex irradiation environments.&#xD;
The background and importance of dislocation loops are introduced in Chapter 1, and a literature review is given in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, we use both a model of dislocation energy and MD simulations to explore the habit planes of 𝑎-type dislocation loops, while cascade simulations are produced to investigate the effect of irradiation on those loops. In Chapter 4, cascade simulations with different PKA energies were performed to interact with pre-existing 𝑎-type loops; 𝑐-component interstitial loops were only observed under the condition of high-energy PKAs. The role of Ni segregation on the stability of dislocation loops in the Zr-Ni binary system is elucidated by employing molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, the formation mechanisms of 𝑎-type and 𝑐-component dislocation loops in α-Zr were investigated by a combination of a fully constrained analytical model and molecular dynamics simulations. In Chapter 7, the effect of existing microstructural elements on primary damage production in α-Zr —and vice-versa—is assessed by molecular dynamics simulations. For better replicating in-reactor alloys, the influence of iron segregation to the dislocation loops is assessed. The main conclusions of this thesis are described in Chapter 8, and some interesting future work is also discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In biological systems, the self-assembly of intricate three-dimensional nucleic acid architectures, from double-stranded DNA duplexes to four-stranded DNA and RNA guanine quadruplexes, is driven by non-covalent interactions. The selective recognition of guanine quadruplexes by artificial binders through such interactions is a rapidly expanding field of research, inspired by the growing awareness of the regulatory roles these structures play in essential biological processes associated with the development of diseases such as cancer. This thesis describes three classes of organic and metallo-organic guanine quadruplex binders, many of which are obtained from organic chelates that either undergo dynamic self-assembly in the presence of labile or semi-labile metal ions or form inert coordination complexes. An alternate synthesis of a known binder is also reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapters 2 and 3, the synthesis of four novel ligands comprised of two 2-(1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine “Click” chelates connected to an aromatic unit by hinges of controlled length and flexibility has been reported. An exploration of the self-assembly of acridine-based ligands with semi-rigid or flexible hinges into dinuclear metallo-cylinders or mononuclear metallo-macrocycles in the presence of zinc(II), iron(II), copper(II), and copper(I) in Chapter 2 will inform the rational design of future ligands for predictable self-assembly into either architecture. In Chapter 3, the coordination geometries of zinc(II), copper(II), and palladium(II) have been used to tune metallo-macrocycle topologies, thereby creating a library of possible guanine quadruplex binders from a single ligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapter 4, an alternate synthesis of “gold standard” guanine quadruplex binder Phen-DC3 is described. This route minimizes the use of hazardous reagents and doubles the overall synthetic yield, promoting its use as a standard in biophysical assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Chapters 5 to 7, a novel platinum(II) platform has been identified as the first example of a planar metal complex capable of selectively recognizing quadruplexes with high affinity on a level comparable to Phen-DC3. The synthesis and biophysical studies of second-generation binders demonstrate that this platform can be readily derivatized with various chemical functionalities to enhance quadruplex binding affinity and selectivity. In the future, this may enable the specific targeting of particular quadruplexes and allow binder properties to be tuned for therapeutic applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this dissertation, I analyze Canadian cultural diplomacy through the international exhibition of art, with particular consideration for the various ways in which state institutions have utilized art as an expedient in this context. Through a historical analysis that considers the significance of liberal ideologies to hegemonic formations of the Canadian nation and culture, I examine what Canadian government institutions hoped to accomplish through the international exhibition of art, and why art exhibitions in particular were utilized as an expedient in this context. In the following chapters, I map out several distinct yet interrelated examples of cultural diplomacy, all of which involve key metropoles in the Western art world as well as significant allies within Canadian foreign policy. I discuss the earliest instances of Canadian participation in the Venice and São Paulo Biennials in the 1950s; the Canadian Cultural Centre in Paris and Canada House in London during the 1970s, which were government-run cultural centres closely associated with an attendant embassy; and 49th Parallel: Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art, a government-run commercial art gallery which operated in New York from 1981 to1992. &#xD;
I argue that the Canadian federal government mobilized visual art as a means of cultural diplomacy in a bid to project an image of Canada as culturally, and by extension, politically significant, in order to broker relations with a network of liberal-minded nation-states, and to project internationally a cultural image distinct from that of the U.S. Further, I argue that the Department of External Affairs was attempting to not only project Canadian culture abroad, but to actually create the nation’s status as a culturally significant middle power. To this end, the examples I discuss in this dissertation demonstrate that projects of Canadian cultural diplomacy involve complex dialogues with powerful cultural and political agents. These dialogues, thus, reveal some of the strategic intricacies of negotiating cultural, political, and economic interests related to Canada’s asymmetrical power relations with the U.S. and other states.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Avian aerial insectivores, a taxonomically diverse guild of birds, are facing dire population declines. The primary commonality among these birds is that they forage on flying insects, suggesting that diet has exposed these birds to environmental challenges that cause their decline, but it has been unclear how. For most aerial insectivores the demographic data necessary to isolate the cause of decline are lacking. However, using data from a tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) population that has been continuously monitored from 1975-2017, I investigated demographic and environmental causes of population decline. In my first chapter, I conducted a life stage simulation to determine which demographic transitions had the most influence on population growth rates, finding that juvenile and adult survival overwinter fledging success had the potential to influence population growth. In my second chapter, I found that both juvenile survival and fledging success declined concurrently with the overall population decline. Poor fledging success was associated with increased predation and rainy, cold weather during nestling development. When raining or cold, the flying insects nestlings rely on are inactive, likely causing temporary food shortages. Low juvenile survival overwinter was linked to poor weather conditions during the post-fledging period and perhaps to conditions on the wintering grounds. Finally, in my third chapter I show that the body mass of older nestlings that are approaching fledging has declined over time. In 2017, nestlings were lighter for their age after rainy weather, suggesting that increasingly poor growth could be explained by more spring rain. As a consequence of climate change, rainfall during nestling development had increased 9.3±0.3 mm/decade, explaining poor nestling growth, fledging success, and potentially juvenile survival. Overall, my findings show that declining nestling and juvenile survival may be driven by increasingly rainy weather, which may in turn cause decline in this tree swallow population and avian aerial insectivores more generally. Therefore, I suggest that tree swallows and other avian aerial insectivores be added to the growing list of species threatened by climate change.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The rate that reinforced concrete (RC) infrastructure is being constructed around the world continues to increase, placing significant stress on the environment. Thus, it is important that any inefficiencies in RC design and assessment be minimized by structural engineers moving forward. For progress to be made on this front, RC behaviour must be measured in a more comprehensive way to further understand its complex behaviour and explore avenues for refinement. This thesis investigates the use of novel sensors for this purpose, with a particular focus on distributed fibre optic sensors (FOS).&#xD;
	An experimental campaign containing 18 RC beam specimens was performed to assess the advantages of using FOS to measure RC behaviour. Practical methods were developed for measuring distributed deflections, crack widths, and distributed reinforcement strains. The results showed that full deflected shapes could be captured up until failure and all crack widths lower than 0.3 mm could be measured. Additionally, reinforcement strain profiles were accurately measured for steel reinforcement embedded in RC elements using FOS, amounting to hundreds of strain measurements spaced by 10 mm along each bar’s entire length.&#xD;
	A load test on an RC building in Ottawa, Canada, was performed. FOS were used to measure beam deflections, curvatures, and cracking behaviour, providing insight into element stiffness and support conditions. The detailed data set captured was used to evaluate finite element models based on current design approaches. This highlighted how the accumulation of common conservative assumptions can cause deflection predictions more than five times larger than those measured, potentially leading to excess material use in design. Closure strips in the RC building were also monitored using a method developed in this work, which was able to capture shrinkage and temperature movement of the floor slabs. The field data demonstrated that experience based design approaches appear to be overly conservative, suggesting that further research into closure strips could lead to significant cost reductions if design processes are refined. However, the instrumentation setup developed to monitor closure strips in this study requires durability improvements, as four out of five transducers installed were compromised on site.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Zr-2.5Nb-0.5Cu alloy is considered as a potential replacement of the current Inconel X-750 alloy for future spacer installations in CANDU® reactors. They are designed to be placed in the annular space between pressure and calandria tubes to support the pressure tube and prevent it from coming into contact with the calandria tube. During their service lifetime, they are exposed to a high flux of fast neutrons and multiple-directional loads. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of irradiation on the microstructure, microchemistry, and mechanical property of this alloy. In this dissertation, the effect of ion irradiation, heat treatment, alloying elements, pre-existing crystal defects on the microstructure and irradiation hardening was investigated to help us have a better understanding of this alloy before its application.&#xD;
Chapters 1 and 2 present a general introduction to the current investigated material and a literature review to previous related studies. Characterization of the microstructure and precipitates of the as-received material is presented in Chapter 3. Three types of microstructure and three types of second phase particles are detected in the as-received material. A comparison between annealing in TEM thin foils and bulk material is displayed in Chapter 4. The change of microstructure and precipitates is significantly slower in TEM thin foils than in bulk material, due to the presence of the foil surfaces. Chapter 5 reports the precipitate stability in the three types of microstructure under heavy ion irradiation. The starting microstructure shows a remarkable influence on the precipitate stability; the precipitates are more stable in the microstructure with a high density of point defect sinks. Chapters 6 and 7 cover the impact of alloying elements Nb and Cu on the loop formation and hardening in Zr alloys under self-ion irradiation. The existence of Nb and Cu exhibits a significant influence on the loop density and Burgers Vector of loops obtained, as well as ω precipitation and subsequent hardening behaviour. In Chapters 8 and 9, pure Mg was used as an analogue of Zr to provide additional insight into the influence that crystal internal defects, such as grain boundaries and gliding dislocations, have on the loop formation during irradiation. Noticeably different loop formation behaviour was observed in the vicinity of a grain boundary under electron irradiation. The pre-existing dislocations also displayed a noteworthy impact on the loop formation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>To know the history of the Pilgrim Trust is to also know Britain’s response to several of its greatest challenges of the twentieth century. Still in operation today, the Pilgrim Trust directly engaged at both national and local levels with some of the major events that we consider to define modern Britain, namely the unemployment of the 1930s, the Second World War, and the debate concerning the national character. As a charity it is perhaps most well-known for sponsoring the unemployment study Men Without Work, funding the Arts Council of Great Britain’s predecessor the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, and assisting in the preservation of some of the country’s most iconic architecture through restorations and pictorial records such as the Recording Britain series. However, a close reading of the Trust’s archive reveals a much more complex and intriguing history of an association of elite men operating at the highest national level with ample funds attempting to come to the “rescue of the things that mattered in our country” as a self-defined “salvage corps.”&#xD;
This thesis is not solely a history of a charity from 1930 to 1960, but also a case study for social and cultural histories of Britain. It examines how the charity interacted with consequential debates on matters such as charity law, unemployment relief, the voluntary sector in the welfare state, church and state relations, national character, and modernity. It also situates the Pilgrim Trust within the larger historiography on community, citizenship, nation, welfare, and heritage to argue that the Pilgrim Trust was an invisible hand in promoting an insular, rural, and nostalgic image of Britain as stewards of the nation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The term ‘Borderline Cinema’ may sound strange at first, even for scholars and film aficionados. It may also sound like something unprecedented, modern, a result of the changes and re-adaptations in the film industry that happen through the advances of digital media and new advertising markets. The term connotes a range of possibilities, from national borders to lines between cinema and other forms. In recent years, driven by the industrialization process and the rapid changes in digital technology happening around the world, new formats of film productions have emerged. One of these new production formats is Borderline Cinema. This type of cinema has existed for years specifically in the Brazilian suburbs, yet it remains largely unknown and marginalized. The process of creating a Borderline production involves more than technical knowledge, but also a social, political and economic conjuncture which is intrinsically linked to the history of Brazilian cinematography. Despite being marginalized by the mainstream film market, Borderline filmmakers are not entirely excluded from having access to cameras, media, and technology. This creates a form of social engagement with global and local cultures. Nestor García Canclini (1995) and Stuart Hall (2000) define this relation as a form of cultural hybridity that is capable of forming new spatial and social relationships, as well as creating new types of production models. With the implementation of the incentive law mechanisms in the 1990s, Brazil boosted its film production in the country and created new formats for the sponsoring of cultural activities. Once invisible, Borderline Cinema started to gain attention from the market, which was interested in promoting festivals and debates around these films. These changes raised questions, such as what are the incentives behind the promotion of Borderline Cinema festivals? Is the scenario for this type of film finally being legitimatized in Brazil? After the establishment of incentive laws mechanisms for the cultural sector in Brazil, the country was involved in a conjuncture where the cultural production is directly associated with marketing strategies and commercial appeal, placing Borderline Cinema in a critical position that needs to be analyzed and studied.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis aims to explore the evolution of social movements against animal performance, leading to its current social and political momentum. By mapping the historical trends of the activist campaigns, this thesis will explore the public attitudes and practices that have influenced the messaging employed by social movement organizations within the movement. The theoretical examination of this thesis is threefold, situating animal performativity, and the opposition to it, within extensive existing literature on social movements, animal/human sociology, and visual studies. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Through exploratory historical analysis, this thesis will critically examine discursive developments in the movement and the sites of production and circulation as they adapt to new technological forms. I have accomplished this exploration by conducting discourse and content analysis on archetypical images that have been created by activist organizations. Through this analysis, I propose that the majority of visuals used within the movement can be divided into four distinctive themes, three of which remain reliably consistent during the past 150 years. The thesis then explores the technological innovations that have affected the imagery of the movement and audience reactions to new forms of representation.&#xD;
&#xD;
	This thesis concludes by arguing that the social movements against animal performance has consistently adapted to its time while remaining true to its original themes and messaging. It has taken advantage of changing social attitudes rather than improving forms of image capturing and circulation. While behind-the-scenes footage may be eye-catching, it is the ability of the movement to capitalize on tangential social concerns and incorporate broader animal welfare into concerns that has remained the most consistent strategy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sandhoff disease (SD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the toxic accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the brain. This is due to a deficient enzyme, β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA), involved in the catabolism of GM2 gangliosides. A recently constructed isoenzyme analogous to HEXA, called Hexosaminidase M (HEXM), can efficiently catabolize GM2 gangliosides, while its gene can be compactly packaged into the self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (scAAV9). Previous gene transfer studies have shown a significant survival benefit of scAAV9-HEXM in the hexb(-/-) knockout SD murine model. However, subsequent analyses revealed that scAAV9-HEXM has the potential to provoke an immune response against the expressed human HEXM product. This undesirable immune response can prove to be an obstacle for the long-term treatment efficacy, especially in individuals who lack the native HEXA protein (e.g., in infantile forms of the diseases). We hypothesized that suppressing the immune system will allow the body to tolerate the scAAV9-HEXM treatment and the newly-produced HEXM protein. Rapamycin (R) and prednisone (P) are immunosuppressants with a regulatory T-cell sparing effect, and both are used clinically to suppress cytotoxic immune responses. In this study, the administration of R and/or P in conjunction with scAAV9-HEXM was studied in SD mice. It was observed that administering both R and P long-term with scAAV9-HEXM demonstrated a significant reduction in antibody and IFN-g T cell responses to HEXM. which persisted after R&amp;P administration ceased. This successful use of the R&amp;P and scAAV9-HEXM resulted in significantly higher hexosaminidase enzyme activity levels in serum, reduced GM2 accumulation in the brain, and an increase in biodistribution of the vector in the liver. These mice also showed an extended lifespan beyond that achieved by the gene therapy in the absence of immunosuppression, with mice living for up to 7 weeks longer. The outcomes of this study may provide a proof-of-concept toleration immunosuppression regimen for long-term efficacy of not only the scAAV9-HEXM treatment, but also other gene therapy studies using AAV.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in many societies, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (SA) has one of the highest incidence rates globally. In SA, close to 28% of women have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Saudi health authorities have established self-management programs in primary healthcare centres (PHCs) to educate patients, but these programs have many shortcomings. A new approach has emerged in the diabetes field using smartphone technology to enhance patient self-management. While studies have focused on evaluating the use of smartphone technologies among patients with chronic diseases, no study has examined the acceptance of smartphone applications among women with Type 2 diabetes in SA. &#xD;
Purpose: To test a theoretical model examining selected predictors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, patient-centred factors) of the future intention to accept and use smartphone applications for Type 2 diabetic self-management among Saudi women. &#xD;
Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey design was conducted with a sample of 98 women with Type 2 diabetes in public PHCs in Jeddah, SA. Participants were asked to complete a pen and paper questionnaire including smartphone use, modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Scale, and scales measuring patient-centred factors.&#xD;
Result: SA women in this study intended to accept and use smartphone applications for diabetes management in the future. The current use of smartphone applications in diabetes management influenced their intention to accept and use diabetes applications. Testing of the theoretical model found 32.1% of the variance in participants’ intention to accept and use smartphone applications to manage Type 2 diabetes was explained by the six predictors. However, only effort expectancy was a significant predictor in the final model.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>When shield tunnels are being excavated along varying geological conditions, it is essential to understand the behaviour of the material being excavated, as it influences excavation speed and ground stability, in addition to other operational issues. For an Earth Pressure Balance Machine (EPBM), this requirement is increased because the excavated material, combined with the rotation of the machine screw conveyor and the thrust of the hydraulic jacks, is responsible for holding the pressure ahead of the machine. For this system to function, this material needs to maintain certain engineering characteristics. In the absence of those key target properties, additives should be mixed with the excavated soil in front of the machine or in the conveyor system, a process called ground conditioning. &#xD;
There are numerous bodies of research concerning EPBM conditioning that mostly focus on either sandy or clayey soils, with relatively little published information regarding mixed ground. Terrains originating from the tropical weathering of rocks present these mixed ground characteristics. EPBM have excavated this type of ground in many areas around the world. &#xD;
The aim of this thesis is to investigate and characterize this type of terrain, exploring the particularities regarding its excavation by EPB shields, including the conditioning of those materials. The focus is on cohesive mixed soil, thus restraining the topic. This research includes two main subjects: the assessments of clogging behaviour and flow behaviour of cohesive mixed soils for EPBM excavation, drawing a parallel between them whenever possible. &#xD;
A laboratory routine was developed for investigating and characterising these mixed soils and their flow and clogging tendencies. Soils were assembled in the laboratory, allowing control of all the inspected elements. Several conclusions related to the clogging potential and flow behaviour could be achieved by changing certain variables: clay mineral, clay fraction, grain size of the sand fraction, water content, foam, and polymers. &#xD;
This laboratory routine and some of the achieved conclusions can be also applied to materials other than cohesive mixed soils. Some considerations for future work are provided, foreseeing the need for a future correlation and validation of the assumptions here made with real tunnel drives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In October 2015, the US military attacked a trauma center operated by the global aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières in Kunduz, Afghanistan.  Because medical facilities are protected pursuant to international law from being made the object of attack, the incident was widely condemned in global public discourse as a war crime.  The US military dismissed this characterization with one single sentence, asserting that “the label ‘war crimes’ is typically reserved for intentional acts” and that this attack does not qualify because the trauma center was not attacked “intentionally”.  Demands to allow for an investigation by an independent, international fact-finding commission went unheeded by the US military, which instead performed its own internal investigation.  The decision not to initiate criminal proceedings against any personnel involved in the attack prompted further public outcry.  The discord created by various competing narratives and perspectives involving this attack remains largely unresolved.&#xD;
	This thesis engages in a thorough and detailed analysis that is founded upon identified legal principles to evaluate whether the attack constitutes a war crime.  After concluding that the attack is not a war crime because the required mental element is not established, the examination goes on to assess whether personnel involved in the attack nonetheless violated applicable international law.  The assessment of compliance with the law of armed conflict (LOAC) concludes, contrary to the findings of the official military investigation, that the LOAC rules of distinction and proportionality were not violated, though specific personnel violated the requirement to take feasible precautions in the attack.&#xD;
	Existing narratives related to this attack typically are not founded upon a recognizable legal analysis or, as is the case with the official military investigation, are built upon an inaccurate or incomplete legal analysis.  This is so even though these narratives invoke inherently legal terminology such as “war crime” and “LOAC violation”.  An analysis based on identifiable and verifiable legal principles can provide a foundation for the effort to reconcile the various competing narratives and perspectives and perhaps assuage the discord that persists today.  The detailed legal analysis conducted in this thesis is intended to provide such a foundation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>When the United Nations moved to promulgate the ICCPR and ICESCR in 1966, the world seemed set on a path to an international regime of human rights. This regime, it was hoped, would provide sovereign nation-States with the necessary legal and political language with which to censure and/or regulate any State conduct deemed inimical to the standards set out in these human rights instruments. Yet, since the promulgation of these instruments, we still have as  many reasons for concern about the achievements of the IHRs regime as we have for optimism. Part of this concern arises from the relativist challenge to the assumption that IHRs are universal.    &#xD;
  &#xD;
In this thesis, I look at the universalism versus cultural relativism debate in the context of post-colonial Africa, and seek to advance three independent claims. First, contrary to the conventional relativist view that contemporary African societies are structurally communal societies, I claim that these societies are, in fact, modern nation-States. Based on this claim, I argue that IHRs standards are culturally suitable for application to modern Africa, pursuant to the modified modernization theory. Second, I contend that the extant pleading for cultural relativism in Africa is as much fixated on the relevance and significance of precolonial African structures as it is based on reified assumptions about the relative roles of the human individual and community. Finally, I proffer a claim for a theoretical justification for universality and, thus, the application of IHRs standards to all modern nation-States, including those in Africa.    &#xD;
  &#xD;
I, therefore, approach this debate from both practical and theoretical perspectives. Practically, I argue that the adoption of the Western models of socio-political governance and capitalism has structurally and socially transformed pre-colonial African societies into modern nation-States, thereby necessitating the adoption of human rights as both a prophylactic and a remedial response to the threats of modernity. I, further contend that a more compelling moral justification for the universality of human rights standards lies in understanding the nature of human rights as “sui generis universal legal and moral rights.” This contention serves to overcome the limitations inherent in contemporary minimalist morality theories &#xD;
which, in my view, under prescribe both the scope, and validity of human rights by reason of reference to specific cultural, philosophical, political and theistic justifications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a group-based, psychoeducational and behavioural modification intervention, Overcoming Stigma in Mood and Anxiety Disorders, in reducing the impact of mental-illness-related stigma. A secondary objective was to explore the nature of behavioural changes that follow the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: Qualitative data was collected from focus groups and coded to generate themes. Thematic analysis was used to develop and modify a Theory of Change model for future program development. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Seventeen themes were generated. The themes were exploratory in nature and were categorized under the following sections: living with mental illness, program evaluation, and behavioural change. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: The results of this study have been encouraging. Qualitative understanding of this anti-stigma intervention can assist with future program development. Understanding the nature of behavioural change can guide development of impactful quantitative surveys for use in a broader evaluation. Enhanced evidence-based anti-stigma interventions can help individuals overcome self-stigma in order to have a full and meaningful life.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sexuality is part of what structures politics. States rely on reproduction to replicate their populations. How sexuality is regulated is political, and it should be considered in political science literature. In recent decades there have been significant changes in rights for lgbt people globally, but also backlashes against them in states where rights have been won and where they have not. These backlashes are referred to as political homophobias, actions states take to dehumanize and police gender and sexual minorities. In this dissertation, I analyze how resistance occurs against these political homophobias, even in contexts where they appear to be highly popular amongst political leaders and the public. Through this analysis, I demonstrate that the perception that political homophobias can be used to gain cheap popularity for a government can be altered. Using literature on cross-movement coalitions, hybrid and authoritarian regimes, and international human rights activism, I argue that activism can change political processes on political homophobia legislation, specifically analyzing Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi as a shadow case, all East African countries that introduced political homophobia legislation in 2008 and 2009. Political processes produce conditions ripe for political homophobias in Uganda and Rwanda. Tracing decisions from colonialism to independence governing structures, structural adjustment to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, I argue that political decisions on how sexuality should be regulated created conditions to empower those promoting political homophobias in the twenty-first century. Using interviews and document analysis, I track why Uganda and Rwanda did not institutionalize political homophobias, despite the perception that the proposals were popular. I argue cross-movement coalitions coordinating resistance were central to the defeat of the proposals. Cross-movement coalitions use in-depth knowledge of the political system to advise international allies on how best to respond, given domestic considerations, including regime type. I demonstrate there is room to resist political homophobias, even in authoritarian regimes. Political homophobia literature should consider how these proposals interact with other political issues, and how activism can change political calculations about what is politically most advantageous.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Atomic-level understanding of the degradation of platinum (Pt) materials is important for rational design of nanoscopic Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cells. Studies employing Pt monocrystalline (single crystal) electrodes can lead to the understanding of atomic-level degradation. Electrochemistry studies on monocrystalline electrodes require well-ordered and highly reproducible surfaces. Therefore, it is of vital importance to understand, optimize, and control each step of single-crystal growth, orientation, and final preparation in order to obtain accurate and reproducible experimental results. Firstly, in-three parts, we report on the development of experimental methodology that allow one to prepare Pt single crystal surfaces and acquire cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles for hemispherical Pt(111), Pt(110), and Pt(100) as well as polyoriented monocrystalline Pt (Pt(spherical)) electrodes. Then, we report on the dissolution and structural transformation of Pt(spherical) electrode in 0.50 M aqueous H2SO4 upon potential cycling in the surface oxide formation-reduction region. The potential cycling is performed in the lower potential (EL) – upper potential (EU) range (EL = 0.07 V and 0.90 ≤ EU ≤ 1.50 V) to correlate dissolution and morphology data to EU. The amount of dissolved Pt is monitored using flow injection coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and structural changes, which modify cyclic voltammetry profiles, are examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the case of EU ≤ 1.20 V, there is minor dissolution of the (100) and (110) facets, while the (111) one remains stable. In the case of EU ≥ 1.30 V, all facets undergo significant dissolution. Changes in the surface morphology of Pt(spherical) upon repetitive potential cycling in the 0.07–1.50 V range were examined in relation to the number of transients (1 ≤ n ≤ 30000). The SEM images reveal the (111) facet develops pits, the (100) facet uniformly distributed hillocks (pyramids), and the (110) facet columns. We report structural changes for twenty-five basal, stepped, and kinked facets. Their analysis demonstrates that the (531) facet is the least roughened, thus the most stable. The original results reported in this article represent a major contribution to the current understanding of the interfacial electrochemistry and electrocatalysis of Pt materials.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research studied the effect of mixing tabs used in entraining diffusers in subsonic short air-air ejectors. Although numerous studies exist on mixing tabs in nozzles, none was found that placed tabs in an entraining diffuser system used with an ejector. Given that mixing tabs led to improvements at the nozzle, they were analyzed in entraining diffusers for this research.&#xD;
Numerical studies of tab performance were carried out using two-equation κ-ɛ turbulence models with enhanced wall treatment available in ANSYS Fluent on an ejector obtained from a prior thesis [1]. Only triangular tabs were considered on the ejector. Tab number was varied with 4, 8 and 12 tabs. Increasing tab number from 4 to 8 led to increased diffuser pumping while increasing to 12 tabs led to marginal decrease, although higher than the base case. Addition of 4 tabs led to unchanged overall pumping, while 8 and 12 tabs led to reduced overall ejector pumping performance. Tab blockage ratio was also varied at 1%, 2% and 4% blockage per tab. Increasing blockage ratios was associated with increasing diffuser pumping, but worsened pumping at standoff, however, total pumping was unchanged. A location study identified that the placement of tabs just before the diffuser is not as effective as tabs placed at the nozzle exit for similar blockage ratios. Additionally, tabs placed in the primary flow region were associated with higher back pressure penalties than those in the secondary flow region.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is split into two distinct sections. The first describes the design of a testing setup for applying simulated earthquake loads to a timber beam-hanger connection, and the second evaluates the performance of beam-hanger connections under this loading protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 2 describes existing testing protocols for subjecting timber connections to cyclic loading. The specific details of the current research are then outlined, including the loading protocol to allow for the application of interstorey drifts, and the details of the two specific beam-hanger connections tested for this research (“dove tail” and “bolted plate”). The structural design of a testing frame is then described and the final product of a steel wide flange section, W460x128, with 10mm plates is detailed. A test was then completed to evaluate the performance of the new testing frame. It was determined that the frame performed adequately by ensuring that the deflections incurred during the loading are primarily experienced by the connections.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 3 describes the laboratory testing of beam-hanger connections under applied interstorey drift deflections. The performance of the connectors was evaluated and it was determined that the Ricon Prototypes exhibited a combined tension and shear fracture of the collar bolts at an average shear of 210 kN and a rotation of 1.33°. The Megant connections failed due to combined tension and pull-out failure of the wood screws, and sustained higher shear, moments and rotations than the Ricon Prototype connections. The interstorey drift values at failure were also compared to the maximum interstorey drift value from the National Building Code of Canada (2.5%) and it was observed that the Megant 310x150 and 550x150 are the only connections that surpassed this value.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>“Art Botany in Nineteenth-Century Design Reform, 1830-1865” investigates the relationship between developments in botanical morphology and the increasingly codified principles of design reform, the state-sponsored movement to improve the competitiveness of British manufacturing by establishing design as a professional field. The literature of design reform tends to conclude that the movement’s main aim was to raise the quality of manufactured items and improve consumer taste. However, my study builds upon the few analyses that contend the theory of design reform became integrated into the principles of natural philosophy and industrial art, which were then folded together into a uniquely nineteenth-century conception of the vital affinities between natural and industrial ideals, a world in which the design principle “form follows function” is connected to botanical science and idealist philosophy.&#xD;
My thesis brings together the natural philosophy of design together with its material objects. While reformers aimed to produce objects that were ideal, based on a priori patterns or types, their designs were also meant to be popular and to do concrete work in the social realm. I investigate this tension between the ideal and the real by drawing upon dialectical models of material culture to examine four objects in relation to the stated aims of design reform and within the context of nineteenth-century natural science and liberal ideologies.</dcterms:abstract>

These elements were compared across gender, year of study, engineering discipline, problem-solving preference, and creative confidence, as well as frequency and duration of arts involvement, prevalent arts activities throughout time, and performance experience. A survey instrument was created, including the development of new scales. A mixed methods pilot study was conducted to improve it. It was then distributed to undergraduate students at nine Canadian engineering institutions, with 269 respondents. A qualitative phenomenological methodology was implemented, investigating student perceptions of creativity in engineering and art and any benefit of arts in creative development through 21 individual interviews.&#xD;
Results from the survey instrument suggested that students possess generally high creativity self-efficacy and tolerance of fears hindering creativity, and neutral creative mindset and creative personal identity. Thus, students may be internally motivated to engage in engineering creativity. Students involved in arts displayed higher creative personal identity, while male students had higher creative self-efficacy and tolerance of fears than female students. Students who preferred open-ended problems displayed higher instances of internally motivating characteristics than those who preferred closed-ended problems. &#xD;
Qualitative results indicate that students define engineering creativity as problem solving, while artistic creativity was described in terms of emotional response. Students identified barriers to creativity, including the fears of judgement, failure, and doing things differently, and lack of time, lack of opportunity, and lack of value from instructors. The arts were identified as useful in overcoming internal barriers to creativity, as well as development of self-confidence, perseverance, different perspectives, and communication skills.&#xD;
Universal understanding of engineering creativity would aid in combating student misconception and provide a foundation for assessment. Instructor support is key in fostering creativity of undergraduates. Creativity education should be implemented, and opportunities for creative engagement without risk of failure adopted in engineering education.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Settlement and integration of non-Romans within Roman territory, political institutions, and culture were driving factors in the success of the Roman Empire since its foundation. This paper aims to examine the changing dynamics of settlement through the fourth century. One such group that were settled in the Roman empire, first recorded in 284 CE, were called the laeti. Laeti had the obligation to serve in the army in exchange for land – a situation that recalls idealized solider-farmer in Roman thought. The land they were settled on, however, some of which had been abandoned by aristocrats. This land was appropriated by the state and give to settlers. The phenomenon of agri deserti “(deserted land)”, was land not enrolled on the tax register, and became a source of conflict between the state and aristocrats, as well as the newly settled non-Romans and the aristocrats who still claimed the land. The aristocrats had to abandon the cultivation of this land due to labour shortages since their tenants had to serve in the army.  Institutionalized settlement of non-Romans, such as the laeti, competed directly with the aristocratic economic aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
The institution of a new gold currency, the solidus, under Constantine, motivated the aristocrats to commute their in-kind taxation to gold (aderatio) due to the stability of the currency against inflation that the solidus brought. Landholders were willing to pay ten to twelve times the annual salary of a labourer in taxes to the state to retain these tenants. As less land was subsequently declared agri deserti, the state had large sums of money but few recruits. Furthermore, land that was traditionally given to non-Roman settlers was eliminated since tenants of large estates were not being recruited into the army. Thus, when the Gothic tribes sought asylum in the Roman Empire, the perfect source of manpower presented itself. However, after the almost complete destruction of the Roman army at the battle of Adrianople (378 CE) the process of aderatio was cemented as de facto state policy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Investor-state arbitration is in a phase of reform. One aspect of this reform process is that the recently-negotiated treaties and updated arbitration rules include mechanisms for the early dismissal of frivolous claims (including those manifestly without legal merit and those unfounded as a matter of law). Some ISA tribunals have also, without an express provision empowering them and only in narrow circumstances, dismissed investors’ claims as an abuse of process.&#xD;
The mechanisms for early dismissal of frivolous and abuse of process claims in ISA vary across investment treaties and arbitration rules, but they all share a fundamental characteristic borrowed from domestic legal systems: that the same tribunal empowered to rule on the merits is also charged with identifying such claims and curtailing them early in the arbitral process. The system of investment arbitration, however, radically departs from the structural organization of the domestic legal systems, with their integrated judicial hierarchies, application of precedent, judicial review of administrative actions, and traditions of job tenure and other career safeguards that protect judicial independence. The comparative law literature teaches that legal transplants often fail when attention is not paid to the structural and doctrinal context of the recipient legal order. &#xD;
This thesis situates the dismissal of frivolous and abuse of process claims within the broader context of the structures of the international investment regime and the incentives those structures create for decision-makers. It shows that the outcome of these factors is that arbitrators utilize and will continue to utilize the mechanisms for early dismissal only in overly narrow circumstances. This thesis then examines alternative mechanisms that may be used to identify and deter frivolous and abuse of process claims, and proposes a mandatory evaluative conciliation procedure prior to arbitration as the effective option to facilitate early dismissal of frivolous and abuse of process claims. This pre-screening mechanism would provide opportunities for assessment of claims in a flexible and non-adversarial context, and would take the gatekeeping function out of the hands of arbitral tribunals, which are not well placed to perform it.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The NEWS-G collaboration uses gas-filled Spherical Proportional Counters (SPCs) to search for low-mass dark matter. As one of several competing collaborations pushing the low-energy frontier of particle detection technology, NEWS-G now is preparing for an exciting new experiment at SNOLAB. In addition to an upgraded detector, an improved understanding of SPCs, and sophisticated analysis techniques are needed to continue the search for dark matter. This thesis presents work done to address several of the outstanding challenges that NEWS-G must face. The possibility of measuring the ionization quenching factor of gases with a neutron capture experiment is explored, but ultimately ruled-out. A likelihood analysis framework is implemented for NEWS-G, and validated through a case-study of the neutrino floor. Finally, the COM-Poisson distribution is proposed as a novel tool to model ionization statistics at the single electron-regime, and to assess the impact that the Fano factor may have on direct detection experiments.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Simulation and 3D animation have become a critical aspect of developing and testing hardware and software systems throughout many domains. The availability of compu- tational power, and development of techniques and tools has made 3D environments prevalent on even the most common devices. Embedded systems which control hard- ware from alarm clocks to rockets are increasingly starting to be developed using a Model Driven Development (MDD) approach. MDD currently suffers from a lack of supporting tooling and can stand to greatly benefit from the integration of simulation. This presents an opportunity for a tool that can quickly produce a 3D simulation and animation environment, and easily connect with generated applications to test these embedded systems.&#xD;
Significant parts of the process of creating simulations in Unity, one of the most powerful game engines in today’s market, were automated through the use of a Do- main Specific Language (DSL). Scripts generated according to the specification of the user expressed using the DSL, are used to automatically create a fully functional simulation environment. The simulation can be deployed on numerous platforms, and programs written in a variety of languages can be connected to it. The use of TCP connections allows for interactions of various programs across a network with the simulator. A fully configurable communication protocol enables users to connect multiple applications to various objects within the simulation. The produced tool, SimGen, is explained in detail and its use is demonstrated with a series of examples throughout this thesis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rare-event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter require very low backgrounds, as well as large volumes of material because of the low rate of signal. Scintillators are an excellent particle detector candidate for such searches because of the flexibility in material choice for the selection of different signals, as well as the possibility of purification to remove backgrounds. Cryogenic scintillation detectors employ further background discrimination by utilizing the signal of heat input when a particle interacts in the material. The ratio of light emitted to detected heat can be used as a selection criteria to remove backgrounds such as gamma radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
DAMA/LIBRA is a dark matter direct detection experiment that claims the detection of an annual modulation signal using thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillating crystals that is consistent with a dark matter hypothesis. Many other dark matter direct detection experiments have failed to verify this signal using other materials. One popular idea is to try to verify this signal using the same or similar materials to DAMA/LIBRA, such as alkali halide scintillators to remove any material-dependent assumptions. Several collaborations, such as SABRE and COSINUS, are currently developing experiments using NaI and NaI(Tl) to test DAMA/LIBRA in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
This dissertation will present the ability of a small detector with background discrimination, such as a cryogenic scintillation detector, to detect a modulating signal. These simulations indicate that even a relatively small exposure could investigate an annual modulation signal if the background was reduced. &#xD;
Towards the development of such a detector, this dissertation will also present measurements done using an optical cryostat at Queen's University to characterize the light emission characteristics of alkali halide crystals, including cesium iodide (CsI), NaI, and NaI(Tl) at low temperatures. Light yields and scintillation time constants are reported, as well as the ratio of light emission between alpha and gamma excitations as a function of temperature, a measurement available to our experiment because of a high light collection efficiency and novel data processing. It shows that CsI, NaI, and NaI(Tl) have sufficient light yield at low temperatures for use in a cryogenic scintillation detector to further understand the DAMA/LIBRA modulation claim.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Brittle fracturing within low confinement environments is the dominant failure mechanism of hard rockmasses under high magnitude in situ stresses around underground excavations. With an emphasis on the behaviour of slightly to moderately jointed rockmasses, this body of research investigates the influence of pre-existing joints on the fracturing mechanisms occurring and the excavation induced damage surrounding an underground opening. To achieve this goal, advanced numerical approaches involving the generation of discontinuity networks and discontinuum analysis methods were employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Discontinuity geometrical data obtained from laser scans of an unsupported tunnel served as input parameters for the generation of discrete fracture networks (DFNs), and the material properties of the massive granite encountered at the Canadian Underground Research Laboratory (URL) were used to develop a grain-based numerical model using the distinct element method (DEM) enriched with DFN geometries. The created synthetic rockmass models (SRM) were used to determine the effect of pre-existing structure on the driving failure mechanisms. Field observations from the URL were also used to calibrate a tunnel scale model by applying the finite-discrete element method (FDEM) to simulate the tunnel response within a massive rockmass, and serve as the reference model for subsequent analyses by integrating DFNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
SRM results provided useful insights and an S-shaped strength envelope derived from bi-axial tests revealed the role of low confinement in brittle fracturing. From the same tests, evaluation of the rockmass modulus resulted in a semi-empirical equation for estimating it based on discontinuity parameters. Following the validation of the ability of the FDEM method to capture brittle processes observed at the URL, results from the jointed models demonstrated the influence of discontinuities on the material response during an excavation. The strong impact of the joint network geometry and field stresses on the excavation induced damage and overall stability of an opening was revealed. Regarding strain bursting phenomena, the ability of discontinuities to dissipate and/or enhance them was examined. The capability of this approach to capture the complex energy storage and energy release, and fracturing mechanisms was demonstrated along with its potential practical application in engineering design.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As one of many evolutionary compensations for immobility, plants synthesize an array of natural products and metabolites which afford advantage against environmental stresses. The utility of these products is exemplified by stilbene and carotenoid-derived metabolites which are important in plant processes such as immune response and protection against UV-light damage. Not limited to plants, these metabolites even play roles in the maintenance of human health as antioxidants and in vision. Stilbene and carotenoid derivatives are generated by a family of non-heme, iron-coordinating enzymes, divided into two functionally distinct sub-families, including lignostilbene cleavage dioxygenases (LCDs) and carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CCOs). While these enzymes have highly similar structure and identical reaction mechanisms, LCDs and CCOs have widely different substrate specificities, mediated by factors that currently remain enigmatic. To gain insight into these factors, a previously characterized bacterial LCD from the bio-control agent Pseudomonas brassicacearum (PbLSD) was compared to an array of CCOs by amino acid sequence and structural alignments, as well as in silico docking. This yielded several target residues predicted to contribute to substrate selectivity within the binding pocket. These predictions were tested using an in vivo carotenoid-cleavage assay system combined with site-directed mutagenesis. Current results emphasize that the structure of the binding pocket plays a key role in mediating substrate specificities, with potential applications for the commercial production of desirable carotenoid derivatives. Additional work characterizing specificities and reaction products of purified PbLSD-mutants in vitro, by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopic methods is ongoing.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Many patient characteristics can affect joint function; yet the implications of this for musculoskeletal disorders and their treatment are not well understood. A better understanding of these relationships could aid in clinical decision making and make it easier to better tailor treatments to each patient. In this work, methods to enable the study of patient variability were proposed and used to investigate the relationship among patient characteristics, function, and surgical outcomes. A method to remove bias from waveform data using principal component analysis was introduced that could be used to combine motion analysis data from different laboratories, thus enabling multicentre studies and larger sample sizes. In a second study, patient characteristics and biomechanical measures associated with the ability of valgus unloader braces to reduce predicted medial compartment contact forces were identified. The hip adduction moment during unbraced walking was the best predictor of mechanical brace effectiveness. The remainder of this thesis focused on articular geometry, a source of patient variability that has previously been shown to be correlated with joint function and pathology. Here, a framework was proposed that can be used to predict the causal effects of geometry on function. Knee joint geometry was characterized and manipulated through statistical shape modelling and functional effects on knee kinematics, cartilage contact, and ligament forces were predicted using musculoskeletal simulation. This framework was used to examine the impact of knee joint geometry on functional outcomes of simulated tibial tubercle osteotomy, a surgery that realigns the patellar tendon to treat patellar instability. It was found that knees with shallow patellofemoral geometry were much more sensitive to medial/lateral placement of the patellar tendon insertion than those with deep geometry. Finally, the potential to use these techniques to inform clinical decision making through patient-specific modelling was explored in a case study of a tibial tubercle osteotomy patient.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) are low-cost, effective and sustainable passive wastewater treatment technologies. However, algal blooms may occur in WSPs under certain conditions, affecting the complex interactions between water quality parameters. This thesis is an investigation on the effect of algal blooms on water quality and treatment performance of a WSP located in a temperate climate. Studies were conducted at a WSP located in southeastern Ontario, experiencing reoccurring excessive algal growth and pH fluctuations, exceeding government regulatory limits. A full range of water quality parameters were monitored for the system and the biochemical dynamics in the WSPs were assessed through multivariate statistical analysis. One study was conducted to provide an enhanced understanding of the relationships between algal blooms, water quality and meteorological factors. Water temperature, pH, DO and NO3- were determined to be the most significant parameters describing the spatial variations in surface algal blooms. A second study examined the seasonal disinfection performance using Escherichia coli, and three novel bacterial indicators, Enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and total coliforms, in the presence and absence of the previously studied algal blooms. Temperature, pH and DO were shown to be significant (p&lt;0.05) factors in disinfection. A long-term assessment of seasonal fluctuations in treatment performance and water quality was also performed. Removal efficiency of nutrients and bacteria were observed to have strong seasonal fluctuations and water temperature, pH, DO and TP accounted for majority of the temporal variations observed in water quality. This research provides practical knowledge and uncovering key trends and factors involved in algal bloom dynamics and treatment performance, contributing to the continued improvement of WSPs design and performance in temperate climates.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Children with complex care needs sometimes have difficulty communicating with their parents, caregivers and teachers. For these children eye gaze assistive technology can be used to facilitate communication. The objective of this research was to enhance the evaluation process of eye gaze assistive technology through development of an evaluation framework. A systematic review was completed that aimed to explore eye gaze assistive technology outcome measures for children and youth with complex disabilities. Outcome measures as well as environmental and personal factors were mapped to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. &#xD;
The systematic review identified prohibitive costs, technical issues, and personal factors as barriers that impeded technology uptake. To begin to address the issues of prohibitive costs and technical issues, a reliability study and usability study were conducted using the low cost Tobii 4C eye tracker with typically developing children and adults. Results indicated that the low cost eye tracker was suitable for assistive technology applications and informed recommendations for device set up and calibration. The usability study also explored the personal factors of fatigue and frustration, by conducting a workload assessment using the NASA Task Load Index. Results indicated that fatigue is the largest workload contributor and that incidences of frustration may be over reported.&#xD;
The systematic review also identified professional support as the primary facilitator of technology success. It further recommended utilization of Goal Attainment Scaling and the Augmentative and Alternative Communication Therapy Outcome Measures when evaluating eye gaze assistive technology. A methodology was developed for clinicians that promotes the design of a user interface that is both functional and appropriate for the user by using the principles of cognitive work analysis. Findings were integrated into the proposed eye gaze assistive technology evaluation framework, specifically designed to support clinicians. This provides the individualized approach necessary for the heterogeneous population of eye gaze users. Additionally, by reporting outcomes in a standardized format that can be easily interpreted, this will encourage comparison between different users and studies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although reading is an important and generative skill that is important for a child’s future academic, economic, and social success, it remains controversial how it develops and what leads to reading difficulties. Furthermore, due to the multiple and complex components involved during reading, the neuroanatomical mechanisms that support the behavioral differences of reading ability are currently not well understood. Therefore, the overarching goal of this thesis was to further the understanding of reading and reading difficulties by integrating aspects of their neuroscientific, cognitive, and educational accounts, as illustrated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), eye tracking, and speech recording. &#xD;
To simplify the examination of the processes involved in reading, we focused on naming speed (NS) tasks, in which participants are required to name sets of simple stimuli as quickly and as accurately as possible, because these tasks have been shown to predict concurrent and future reading ability in both typically achieving readers and in poor readers. Using NS tasks, we examined improvements in behavioral performance associated with typical development from childhood to adulthood, and how this differed in children and adults with dyslexia. We also examined how behavioral and neural differences between typically achieving readers and readers with dyslexia were related, and how they were associated with compensatory strategies used by readers with dyslexia to account for their reading disability. &#xD;
Overall, the findings of the five studies presented in this thesis indicate how combining multiple techniques, such as fMRI, eye tracking, and speech recording, to study reading and reading deficits provides a better controlled, more global view of the processes that are involved and how these processes differ in individuals with reading difficulties. Future research that adopts this multidimensional approach to examining reading difficulties is important because it will not only lead to the optimization of current diagnostic criteria for dyslexia, but also has the potential to lead to the early identification of children who are biologically at risk for developing dyslexia. This in turn has the potential to lead to more effective and appropriate interventions which can positively impact and change the outcome trajectories for those with reading deficits.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Green Revolution reshaped rural livelihoods by introducing new, exogenously-generated, inputs and knowledge. Predicated on enhancing yields and food productivity, this had widespread implications on biodiversity conservation and food security, including the marginalization of traditional crop varieties.  In south Karnataka, India, these conditions provide the context for contemporary rural debates centered on alleviating rural poverty, attending to an epidemic of farmer suicides, enhancing food security, and confronting increasing climate uncertainties.  My research enters this debate by examining the relationship between seed choice, agricultural knowledge and cultivation practices among smallholder rice farmers across three districts in south Karnataka.  Specifically, seed choice serves as a principal lens for elucidating the broader conceptualizations of agricultural development, as well as the knowledge politics therein, across different actors and agricultural movements in south Karnataka.  Informed by a political ecology framework, these debates are investigated through a discursive literature review and fieldwork interviews in the case study location with Government officials, agricultural researchers, NGO representatives, organic entrepreneurs, and farmers.  My research highlights the agricultural knowledge dynamics, rural hierarchies, incentive structures and public-private partnerships that characterize mainstream agricultural development initiatives in south Karnataka.  Next, my research highlights how several local alternative agriculture movements have sought to contest these dynamics by proposing new agroecology-based strategies oriented-around traditional seed varieties.  Finally, my research elucidates the ongoing knowledge politics within these alternatives.  It highlights their commonalities and critical divergences, and examines their respective opportunities and constraints for enhancing rural livelihoods in south Karnataka.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health problem and a threat to the sustainability of the global healthcare system. It is not only detected in the clinical setting but also other environments including wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which are potential targets for surveillance and points of control for the environmental dissemination of AMR. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are potential candidates as indicator organisms for AMR in water environments. Identification methods for Enterococcus were compared and the groESL locus was the most accurate method. The enterococci/VRE from two WWTPs, a biological aerated filter (BAF) and a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system, from the same municipality collected over 2 years were characterized through quantification, speciation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and genomic analysis. The primary effluents (PE) of the two WWTPs were similar in the quantity, species composition, and frequency of AMR of enterococci. VRE were not selectively removed by either WWTP and the BAF system removed enterococci most effectively. Presumptive VRE isolated from the CAS final effluent (FE) included more E. faecium and had increased prevalence of nitrofurantoin resistance and decreased quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance compared to the CAS PE isolates. The BAF FE had a higher proportion of E. faecalis than the CAS FE and a decrease in levofloxacin resistance. The AMR profiles of the isolates after treatment differed from the pre-treatment isolates. Enterococcus isolates (n = 39) were sequenced and were compared with additional genomes from other sources. For E. faecium, wastewater genomes cluster separately from the clinical genomes while, for E. faecalis, wastewater genomes cluster with either clinical or agricultural genomes. Multiple multidrug efflux pumps were detected in the wastewater enterococcal genomes. The majority of virulence genes detected were associated with adhesion, biofilm formation, and capsule formation. Variation in genome size was correlated with the amount of genes associated with the mobilome in E. faecium and E. faecalis. The mobile genetic elements detected were shared among Enterococcus spp. Bacteriophage belonged to Siphoviridae and Myoviridae. Type II CRISPR-Cas arrays were detected in E. faecalis. Understanding the dynamics and characteristics of VRE in wastewater can improve environmental AMR risk assessment frameworks and migitation efforts.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During competitive interactions involving multiple agents, such as sporting competitions, the outcome of each&#xD;
individual’s actions is dependent not only on a historical sequence of their own choices, but on those of their&#xD;
opponents as well. Success in such rivalries often requires that individuals adopt a mixed-strategy wherein&#xD;
available actions are chosen dynamically and unpredictably. Action selection in mixed-strategy environments&#xD;
involves the coordination of widespread neural processes, spanning the cognitive, emotional, and limbic domains. More specifically, choice selection involves working memory, valuation and reward processes,&#xD;
reinforcement learning, and execution of motor responses.&#xD;
The three studies in this thesis investigated the neurobiological mechanisms involved in choosing in&#xD;
mixed-strategy environments, and how these processes change throughout the course of neurodegenerative&#xD;
and neuropsychiatric disease. In the first study, we examined the human brain network underlying mixedstrategy&#xD;
decision-making using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using a carefully controlled&#xD;
paradigm, we compared the network underlying strategic decisions to that involved in choosing in nonstrategic&#xD;
environments. This study allowed us to gain insight into the specialized cognitive circuitry involved&#xD;
in choosing dynamically within a strategic context.&#xD;
In the second study, we asked how dopaminergic transmission affected mixed-strategy decisionmaking&#xD;
by investigating how degeneration of the dopamine system in Parkinson’s disease (PD) affected&#xD;
strategic choice patterns. Further, we investigated the hypothesis that cognitive function is deleteriously&#xD;
affected by dopaminergic medication (levodopa and dopamine agonists) in patients with PD, and whether&#xD;
genetic mechanisms controlling dopaminergic transmission could explain susceptibility to medicationinduced&#xD;
cognitive deficits.&#xD;
ii&#xD;
In the final study, we examined mixed-strategy decisions in patients with borderline personality&#xD;
disorder (BPD), a heterogeneous disorder prevalent in adolescent populations. We explored how the core&#xD;
clinical features of BPD, namely impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, affected mixed-strategy decisions in&#xD;
adolescents showing the first signs of BPD.&#xD;
Together, these studies provide a detailed account of how mixed-strategy decision-making is&#xD;
implemented in the brain, and how the cognitive functions required for choosing in such environments&#xD;
become affected throughout the course of neurological illness. This work, as a whole, represents a significant&#xD;
contribution to our understanding of how the brain integrates diverse sources of information to execute&#xD;
mixed-strategy decisions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Vulvodynia (i.e., idiopathic chronic pain affecting the vulva) is a common but poorly understood pain condition, affecting 16% of women in the general population and leading to negative impacts in many life domains, including psychosocial function and reproductive potential (Pukall et al., 2016). An emerging body of research suggests that central factors (i.e., those involving the brain and spinal cord) may play a role in the etiology and/or maintenance of vulvodynia (Pukall et al., 2016). &#xD;
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have indicated that women with provoked vestibulodynia (PVD)—a form of vulvodynia characterized by provoked pain in response to pressure applied to the vaginal entrance—exhibit increased neural activity in response to both genital and non-genital stimulation in cortical areas related to pain modulation (Hampson et al., 2013; Pukall et al., 2005; Sutton et al., 2015; Pazmany et al., 2017). However, despite the fundamental role of the brainstem and spinal cord in descending modulation of pain, no studies have attempted to examine activation patterns in the spinal cord of women with vulvodynia. &#xD;
The aim of this study was to examine spinal cord and brain connectivity and activation in women with PVD during painful hand stimulation to evoke descending modulation, the process responsible for the descending control of pain involving brain, supraspinal, and spinal structures (Gebhart, 2004). We hypothesized that women with PVD would exhibit altered connectivity in regions of the brain and spinal cord, indicating diminished descending modulation, and would also have greater blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses in regions previously associated with pain processing. The results of this study examining the spinal cord/brainstem revealed alterations in the connectivity and BOLD responses of regions related to pain modulation. Investigation of the brain revealed similar regions of connectivity in women with PVD and control women; however, this study adds to a growing body of research that have found alterations in the fMRI response of these brain regions in women with PVD. Through furthering our knowledge of spinally-mediated pain mechanisms in PVD, this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the role of central processing in women with PVD.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The physical response of a profiled high-density polyethylene stormwater retention arch structure under shallow burial subjected to design truck loading was investigated, with an emphasis on finite element modelling of the soil-structure system. First, three-dimensional, geometric and materially nonlinear finite element analysis was used to model a physical test on an arch specimen prior to burial with the goal to develop and validate a structural model capable of simulating the response of the arch structure up to and past its ultimate limit state. The explicit three-dimensional geometry of the tested arch specimen was measured in detail using a laser scanner, and tensile index tests were carried out to calibrate a viscoplastic constitutive model. The analysis was capable of replicating the measured load-displacement response of the structure up to and past its ultimate limit state governed by buckling. Second, analysis of a previously conducted full-scale physical test of a single arch structure buried with 460 mm cover above the crown and subjected to cyclic design truck loading was carried out. Displacement measured in the first load cycle was notably higher than in subsequent load steps as the arch worked its way into position, which included the densification of the initially uncompacted gravel backfill and soil shear failure underneath the wheel pad. Time-dependent behaviour was noted under constant load holds, particularly during the first load cycle. The validated structural model was used in conjunction with a nonlinear, elastic-plastic soil model to explicitly model the laboratory setup and testing. The model was able to capture the behaviour of cyclic loading, including apparent stiffening of the soil-structure system after the first load cycle. It matched displacements and deformed shape at the start of the nominal design wheel load (71.2 kN) for all load cycles but was unable to match the measured results during constant load holds and at the larger partially factored design wheel load (90.3 kN).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Being bicultural, Chinese Canadian LGBTQ people face a double jeopardy in navigating a white heteropatriarchal society while striving for acceptance within their own Chinese Canadian communities. My project records the coming out and not-coming out stories of Chinese Canadian LGBQ women and non-binary people in order to interpret their understandings of the process of coming out/not coming out in relation to the formations of sexual, gender, racial/ethnic, and national identities in the context of diaspora. Based on interviews and a focus group conducted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, this project examines whether home, recognition, Chinese nationalism and familial values are sites of exclusion and if so, how youth reconcile these tensions. This research expands beyond the visibility of gay, bisexual, and queer men within extant social science accounts of Asian diaspora LGBTQ people by focusing on women and non-binary members of Chinese Canadian communities. I employ a queer diasporic approach centering female subjectivity and standards of femininity and masculinity to conceptualize diaspora outside of heteronormative and patriarchal structures of family and community (Gopinath, 2005). I examine diverse points of tension and reconciliation in the narratives of youth who have and who have not experienced “coming out”. The analysis is built from three major insights introduced by narrators to illuminate Chinese Canadian experiences of queer diaspora: the instability of queer (and) Chinese subjectivity; sense of belonging and acceptance; and logics of modernity, progress and queer liberalism as continued racialization, colonialism and imperialism in disguise. I document how tensions among Chinese Canadians regarding sexuality and embracing or resisting change articulate racial and colonial histories and the fraught locations of Chinese Canadians within a white settler state. I argue that histories of racism, colonialism, and migration place Chinese Canadian families in tension with forms of citizenship and national belonging that are defined by historical politics of sexuality. This research is also concerned with the ways in which these histories may inform the location of Chinese communities within contemporary Canadian multiculturalism, which perpetuates whiteness through its embrace of queer liberalism (Alexander, 2005; Eng, 2010; Lowe, 2015; Manalansan, 2003; Shah, 2001).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Intellectual property (IP), such as patents or copyrights, forms the basis of economic policy to encourage innovation, creativity, and growth. In this thesis, I show how the strategic usage of IP by rights holders plays a crucial role as intermediary between economic fundamentals, such as public policy or industrial characteristics, and economic outcomes, such as the structure of markets or the pace of innovation in an economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 2 demonstrates the importance of IP strategy as an intermediary in the context of patent–based measures of innovation. In a theoretical model of innovation, IP, and market interaction, I show that citation–weighted patent counts, the most common innovation measure, are generally valid as an innovation proxy only if the profit motive for innovation is complementary to the protection motive for IP usage. Otherwise, observed patenting could decrease in response to changing economic fundamentals even as innovative effort is increasing, and the inferred relationship between economic forces and innovation will be incorrect.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 3 tests these predictions empirically for the relationship between competition and innovation, an enduring interest of economists and policymakers. Consistent with the predictions of the model, I show that competition and citation–weighted patent counts have an inverse–U relationship, but that competition has a generally negative effect on research and development activity. Therefore, changes in observed patenting only correlate with changes in innovation at high levels of competition, when the likelihood of innovative success is low; otherwise, patent counts diverge from innovative effort and are invalid as a proxy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 4 examines the effects of copyright infringement on the market for recorded music. I show that music piracy has a modest negative effect on sales overall, but the size and magnitude of that effect differ across artists and sales format. The differential effects of piracy impact record labels’ optimal IP licensing strategy in the market for music streaming, determining market structure and the balance of market power.&#xD;
&#xD;
Taken together, the thesis highlights the important role that IP strategy plays as an intermediary between economic fundamentals and economic outcomes of interest, suggesting implications for economic policy and our understanding of innovation and creativity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Potable water in Canada leaves treatment facilities in pristine quality and excellent condition for both drinking and sanitation.   However, customer concerns related to discoloured drinking water continue to serve as a worldwide issue in urban drinking water distribution systems (DWDS).  Fundamentally, water discolouration is a result of the long-term accumulation of particulate material which is subsequently mobilized due to sudden changes in hydraulic conditions.  Field and laboratory studies have shown that cohesive layers on the pipe wall are adaptive to the respective environmental and hydrodynamic conditions.  The most readily used approach to manage the risk of water discolouration is unidirectional flushing of watermains.  The imposition of an increased hydraulic shear stress erodes these cohesive layers from the pipe wall into the bulk water.&#xD;
&#xD;
To examine the regeneration and mobilization of discolouration material a full-scale laboratory was designed to simulate the operation of a DWDS.  The laboratory consists of two identical pipe loops comprised of 108 mm diameter PVC pipes, each with a length of 198 m.  All components of the laboratory are located within a climate-controlled chamber to simulate seasonal temperature variation.  The laboratory is fitted with instrumentation to monitor turbidity, flow rate, pressure, and temperature in a real time manner. &#xD;
&#xD;
Three experiments of duration 40, 80 and 120 days allowed for the growth of cohesive layers under steady-state flow conditions.  Each growth phase was followed by 3 successive 15-minute flushing intervals to erode the layers.  Grab samples for TSS, metals composition and particle size distribution were scheduled throughout each experiment.  Results found that cohesive layers of various strength characteristics developed with an approximate linear increase in turbidity response with increased growth duration.  The strength of cohesive layers was observed to increase with increased growth duration.  The conditioning velocity during each growth phase had a negligible effect on both material accumulation and layer strength.  Turbidity was determined to be a good indicator of total suspended solids and iron in the water.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this thesis, I use machine learning techniques to solve issues in revenue management and public transportation design. The first two chapters relate to problems of revenue management and online learning. The problem of sequential learning and optimization of the demand function has been an important topic in revenue management. Finding the optimal policy faces numerical complexity and is prone to the curse of dimensionality. It is mostly solved using heuristics and restrictive assumptions. In the first chapter, I use a novel non-parametric approach to solving dynamic pricing and learning problems. I develop a flexible method to approximate the optimal policy using polynomial approximation, thus reducing complexity. I make use of the  Bayesian framework to update the probability model and make advances in numerical methods to solve this problem. In the second chapter, I use a machine learning heuristic called Thompson sampling. I improve the performance of the heuristic over short horizons by enforcing the decreasing nature of the demand function in the sampling algorithm. Using a stylized proof, I demonstrate the performance gains associated with this method and show the merits of ordered sampling with Thompson Sampling over short horizons. The last chapter makes use of a machine learning approach called data envelopment analysis (DEA), which I use in designing new public transportation routes in rural regions. I develop algorithms and heuristics to balance cost and equity under multiple objectives. The solution to this project was implemented in the city of Quinte West, Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In 1963, the journal Parti pris was founded in response to the bombings perpetrated by the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ). The journal published on a monthly basis from 1963 till 1968. This period in Quebec coincided with the Quiet Revolution, protests and dissent in Montreal, and the “modernization” project that accompanied the construction projects planned for the 1967 World’s Fair held in Montreal. Also coinciding during this period was the decolonization movement and the rise of the environmental movement – typically pointed to having commenced in 1962, with the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring. Parti pris held an important position in Quebec during the 1960s, its team (the Partipristes) propagated and shaped the understanding of decolonization in the province. Parti pris was radical, taking inspiration from the FLQ, the Partipristes argued that Quebec was a colonized society afflicted by English Canadian and American colonialism. The Partipristes did so by emulating the arguments from the French poststructuralists and voices from the decolonizing French Empire. Recent historiography has made the argument that these same voices from the decolonizing world helped influence the ideas that led to and shaped the environmental movement (entrenched in 1970 with the first Earth Day). This thesis looks at how Parti pris appropriated arguments from African and Caribbean theoreticians in order to make arguments about Quebec. While in the process of doing so, the Partipristes also discussed the Quebec landscape, nature, and the exploitation of the province’s natural ressources. This led some of the Partipristes (namely the two editors, Paul Chamberland and Pierre Maheu) to later join the environmental movement in the 1970s. For them, and for the many who felt affiliated with Parti pris’ philosophy, the environmental movement represented in 1970 a new opportunity for “revolution.” This was an attractive idea to the many Quebeckers who felt frustrated by the events of May 1968 and by the October Crisis in 1970.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Plants possess sophisticated mechanisms for responding to the threat of pathogens. Microbial patterns such as bacterial flagellin are perceived by receptor complexes located at the plant plasma membrane. This perception initiates a signaling cascade which culminates in a robust immune response including an influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol, an apoplastic burst of reactive oxygen species, and up-regulation of defence genes. The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 is activated by many different receptor complexes and is a key component of the immune system. Although necessary for survival, the plant immune response must be tightly regulated to avoid fitness costs and maintain normal growth and development. As an important component in several immune responses, BIK1 must be maintained at optimal levels; however, the mechanism for this is poorly understood. Previous work identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK28 to be a negative regulator of immunity and of BIK1 accumulation. It also provided evidence for proteasome-mediated turnover. Our collaborators identified the plant U-box proteins PUB25 and PUB26 as E3 ligases responsible for destabilization of BIK1 through polyubiquitination. The major objectives of my thesis were to determine which residues on BIK1 were polyubiquitinated, and to determine how CPK28, PUB25 and PUB26 regulate BIK1 turnover. I found that PUB25 and PUB26 associate with CPK28 and used epistasis analysis to place CPK28 upstream of PUB25 and PUB26 in this immune signaling pathway. This thesis also presents work toward determining CPK28- and PUB25- or PUB26-mediated BIK1 ubiquitination sites, as well as providing a dataset of ubiquitinated plasma membrane proteins through generation of a ubiquitome. Overall, the work presented in this thesis provides insight into the regulation of BIK1 turnover and contributes to our understanding of plant immune homeostasis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Primary care providers are failing to effectively promote physical activity (PA) to their patients. It has been shown that educational approaches promoting the uptake of strategies that are proven to increase patient PA levels are effective for improving primary care providers’ social cognitions and behaviour for discussing PA with patients. However, research on the effectiveness of such strategies among family medicine residents is limited. Utilizing the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), an interactive, educational intervention was developed to increase PA discussion between first year family medicine residents and their patients by focusing on effective PA promotion strategies (e.g., PA counselling). This thesis aimed to determine the impact of the intervention on the social cognitions and behaviour of residents discussing PA with patients. The intervention condition was comprised of 15 2017/2018 residents who received: (1) the full intervention, and (2) completed both the pre- and post- intervention TPB questionnaires assessing changes in PA discussion social cognitions, and (3) had their medical charts reviewed for PA discussion behaviour. Fifteen 2016/2017 residents who were randomly selected to have their medical charts reviewed for PA discussion behaviour comprised the non-intervention condition. A process evaluation confirmed the intervention was successfully delivered. The residents’ social cognitions for discussing PA with patients was not significantly changed by the intervention, however, the residents’ perceptions of feeling adequately trained to discuss PA did increase following the intervention (F(1,14) = 10.839, p = .005). The medical chart review indicated no changes in residents’ behaviour for discussing PA with patients from pre- to post-intervention within both conditions. A significant difference in post-behaviour between conditions was observed (t(28) = 2.778, p = .011), where PA was discussed at more patient visits within the intervention condition. In summary, the intervention did not increase, but did maintain the PA discussion behaviour of residents from pre- to post-intervention. An educational intervention may therefore be sufficient to prevent a decline in residents’ PA discussion behaviour. This research highlights the importance of educating and training residents to use strategies for PA discussion. Future interventions and research should be conducted to further improve these practices.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Hemilabile ligands are useful because the activity at the metal centre can be manipulated and controlled by the labile groups. P,N donors are widely used hemilabile ligands in coordination and organometallic chemistry. Phosphorus is generally considered a soft donor and inert. Alternatively, nitrogen is considered a moderately hard donor and is labile. Late transition metals can complex with either the P or the N as a monodentate ligand or through both the P and the N as a bidentate ligand depending on the hardness of the metal centre and the ligand sterics.  &#xD;
&#xD;
         Phosphaamidines [RC(PR2)=NR] and phosphaguanidines [R2NC(PR2)=NR] are small bite angle bidentate ligands and promising hemilabile ligands. Having strongly basic sites near the metal centre should promote heterolytic cleavage of H2 or proton transfer that can assist in homogenous catalytic reactions like CO2 hydrogenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A facile route is developed to prepare acyclic and aprotic phosphaamidine [PhC(PR2)=NR, R=Ph, iPr] and phosphaguanidine [Me2NC(PPh2)=NiPr] ligands that coordinate to Cu(I), Rh(I) and Ru(II) metal centres. Crystal structures are reported for all complexes. Coordination to Cu(I) occurs either through P in η1 mode or by both P or Nimine in a η2 mode. Coordination to Rh(I) occurs through η1or η2 modes while to Ru(II) occurs only through η2 mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
         Tests of CO2 hydrogenation using phosphaamidine complexes showed that Ru(II) phosphaamidines are active precatalysts than Rh(I) phosphaamidines. Substitution of phenyl with isopropyl doesn’t have significant impact on the TON or the yield of formic acid in the presence of DBU. However, using Ru(II) phosphaguanidine instead of Ru(II) phosphaamidine increases the yield. A Ru(II) phosphaguanidine complex is also a potential precatalyst for the hydration of benzonitrile.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is also shown that a guanidine [Me2NC(NPh2)=NiPr] and a structurally analogous phosphaguanidine [Me2NC(PPh2)=NiPr] both act as Brønsted bases and have almost same basicity in acetonitrile solution.  The proton coordinated to [Me2NC(PPh2)=NHiPr]Cl and therefore the basicity of the neutral form are both retained once the P is coordinated to Cu(I). The retention of basicity upon coordination of this salt to a metal centre is also supported by the observation of π electron delocalization within the amidine unit by X-ray crystallography.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation seeks to reestablish insomnia as an essential category of consciousness in the Romantic period on both local and universal scales. First, I establish the medical and cultural history of the disorder in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, showing that, during this period, insomnia not only emerged for the first time as a primary disorder with its own unique pathology and psychology, but was also consequently considered as a separate state of consciousness, situated liminally between sleeping and waking. Many poets of the period adopted this new conception into their poetry and, through this work, investigated both aesthetically and philosophically their creatively fulfilling negotiation of insomnia’s two conscious facets: sleep’s visionary potential and the waking poetic will. Second, I investigate insomnia’s creative capacity in the works of two of the period’s most important and medically-interested figures: John Keats and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Both poets and intellectuals, these two men navigated this new conception of insomnia in congruent and unique ways. Insomnia is figured in both of their works as an exaggerated analogy for the poetic and intellectual imagination, representing its capacity for both ideal poetic invention and unstable chaos, and for defining creative identity in general. Keats takes the experience of insomnia as an opportunity to revel in uncertainty. Coleridge seeks to reform that uncertainty into a unified selfhood. In both instances, however, insomnia shifts common readings of the established philosophies of these two great Romantic poets. This project will therefore provide new insight into some of the most recognizable Romantic thinkers.

      <dcterms:abstract>As the most bioavailable fraction of organic matter, dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the carbon (C) cycle. Heterotrophic microorganisms degrade DOM and release it to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) under oxygenated conditions. However, some DOM may be more readily bioavailable (i.e., labile) to microorganisms than other DOM. In the past, lability has been defined mainly by DOM molecular structure, but more recent research suggests that environmental conditions such as nutrient availability may also control lability. DOM lability has been investigated extensively in Arctic lake and large river systems, however relatively little research has investigated the lability of DOM in systems with more fine scale spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions, such as ponds and soils. &#xD;
&#xD;
Chapter 2 presents a study of environmental conditions and molecular structure as controls on the lability of DOM in six High Arctic ponds at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) through short-term incubation experiments, optical properties, and chemical analyses. Chapter 3 explores the role of soil DOM in soil C respiration at the beginning, middle, and end of the growing season across the five major land cover classes at the CBAWO: active layer detachment scar, mesic tundra, unvegetated polar desert, vegetated polar desert, and wet sedge. Soil CO2 emissions were measured over short-term soil incubation experiments and compared with the optical and chemical characteristics of soil water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) before and after incubation. Results indicate that pond DOM lability depends on both environmental conditions and DOM molecular structure, and is therefore dependent on geomorphic characteristics which determine subsurface water and nutrient delivery. The soils study confirms statistically significant variability in CO2 emissions between vegetation types. The study also indicates that WEOM is highly labile and makes an important contribution to total C respiration. Overall the results of this research contribute to the scientific understanding of DOM lability and, in turn, C cycling across relatively understudied media (pond water and soils) in the High Arctic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis aims to provide a detailed description of the microstructure and void&#xD;
damage evolution in a grade of hot-rolled complex phase (CP) sheet steel produced by ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AMD). The evolution of microstructure was studied through a series of dilatometer experiments, and the effects of matrix microstructure and TiN particle population on void damage evolution were studied through interrupted hole tension testing and micro-computed tomographic (microCT) imaging of both commercially produced sheets and sheets heat treated to produce polygonal ferrite (PF) and granular bainite (GB) model microstructures.&#xD;
&#xD;
Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams illustrate the phase transformations which produce PF, GB and lath bainite (B) in the grade of CP steel sheet under study. While the level of deformation achieved in industrial hot rolling processes is unattainable in laboratory-scale experiments, interpretation of CCT diagrams enables the understanding of how different microstructures develop in commercial CP steel sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the grade of CP steel under study, large 'primary' voids were found to nucleate&#xD;
at TiN particles through either fracture of large (&gt;100 µm) TiN particles or decohesion of the particle-matrix interface at smaller TiN particles. Voids develop ellipsoidal shapes in specimens deformed to moderate to high levels of plastic strain, with growth occurring primarily in the direction of tensile loading. A population of fewer, larger voids developed in deformed hole tension specimens is associated with a distribution of fewer, larger TiN particles or a high level of TiN particle clustering. In sheets containing large TiN particles, a GB model microstructure was found to result in a population of fewer, larger voids than those developed in PF sheets. The onset of coalescence was observed at high levels of plastic strain, with void damage development culminating in one or more large coalescence events. Coalescence mechanisms are dependent on void spacing and orientation with respect to the loading direction, both of which are influenced by the matrix microstructure and TiN particle population.&#xD;
&#xD;
A microstructure consisting of PF and GB containing a uniform distribution of small TiN particles is proposed to produce a combination of high strength and stretch flangeability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rockfall hazards on railway corridors create risk of derailment which can result in&#xD;
damage to property or the environment and cause injury or loss of life. There is interest&#xD;
in understanding the location and severity of such hazards so that management&#xD;
strategies can be implemented. Ongoing collection of high resolution 3D data from&#xD;
terrestrial and airborne platforms has proven to be an effective medium for achieving a&#xD;
better understanding of the spatial-temporal, geological and geomechanical properties&#xD;
of rockfall hazards. The limiting factor is that such data is time consuming to collect and&#xD;
process and needs to be specifically directed. This study aims to provide new officelevel&#xD;
screening tools which can be used to identify areas where more refined data&#xD;
collection may offer value.&#xD;
Airborne LiDAR and orthoimagery for the CN Thompson Fraser Corridor is used to&#xD;
develop new techniques for the classification and interpretation of topographic data for&#xD;
the study of rockfall hazards in the area. In Chapter 3, spectral reflectance in the visible&#xD;
range, extracted from orthoimagery, is used to classify colourized point cloud data in the&#xD;
interest of identifying areas of exposed rock. In Chapter 4, this technique is paired with&#xD;
existing techniques for the geomorphic classification of 3D information using slope&#xD;
angle and use as the main input to a probabilistic rockfall hazard assessment.&#xD;
Analysis of colour values, paired with conventional morphometric analysis using slope&#xD;
angle, shows promise as a means of classifying topographic data into geomorphic&#xD;
domains. The study successfully derives all inputs for the probabilistic assessment of&#xD;
rockfall hazard from the above mentioned airborne LiDAR and orthoimagery dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the first essay, we study a firm's dynamic pricing problem in a continuous-time setting where multiple market segments learn the product quality from post-purchase customer opinions and exert heterogeneous levels of social influence on other segments. To represent segment belief evolution in a continuous-time model, we approximate individual-level interactions with statistical averages and propose a fluid Bayesian updating process, which allows one to circumvent an NP-Hard problem of pricing on social networks. We use optimal control theory to derive the optimality condition and demonstrate in numerical study how the firm can improve revenue by performing price differentiation according to segment influence and learning behaviour. &#xD;
&#xD;
In the second essay, we modify the social leaning model proposed above and apply it to estimate the market belief evolution about a movie's quality for 157 movies that release between October 2013 and June 2015. We propose a two-step maximum likelihood estimation procedure to address the parameter identification problem. In the first step, we estimate each movie's true quality and initial population size along with seasonality effect by using each movie's daily sales and the number of theatres that play the movie. In the second step, we estimate market-level learning speed and belief evolution for each movie's quality by using tweets as a proxy for market opinions. Finally, the model that incorporates social learning achieves a better accuracy of forecast on the 7-day per-theatre sales than otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the third essay, we study the effects of multi-channel marketing and customer borrowing activities on the conversion behaviour. We model the prospective customer's willingness to convert as a continuous latent variable, propose a state-space formulation, and address major heterogeneity and endogeneity concerns. The empirical findings show that there is a potential antagonistic effect between SMS and other channels, and a customer's existing borrowing relationships may not prevent her from establishing a new borrowing relationship. In the one-month ahead prediction, the model achieves a conversion rate of 17.6%, better than 9.55% achieved by the bank's targeting strategies. Finally, we demonstrate how the marketing department can potentially use Q-learning to identify the best action for each customer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ion channel function and modulation determine the strength and duration of periods of enhanced neuronal activity and excitability that control and shape behaviour.  The bag cell neurons of the hermaphroditic sea snail, Aplysia californica, provide a model to examine the regulation of ion channel function.  Reproduction is initiated when bag cell neurons secrete egg-laying hormone during a protracted depolarization and afterdischarge.  Early in the afterdischarge, phospholipase C (PLC) hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).  In cultured bag cell neurons, activating PLC with N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonamide (m-3M3FBS), or adding a DAG analogue, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), induced depolarization and spiking, mediated by a large, prolonged, Ca2+-permeable, inward current (IOAG) through a non-selective, voltage-independent cation channel that reversed near -20 mV and was enhanced by intracellular IP3.  Furthermore, IOAG required basal PKC activity prior to the current, though OAG failed to trigger PKC.  Molecular biology revealed a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel in bag cell neurons with secondary structure conserved in other TRPC5 channels.  Designated ApTRPC5, when expressed in HEK cells it was a voltage-independent, non-selective cation current gated by PLC-coupled receptors or OAG.  A separate source of depolarization for the afterdischarge is a voltage-gated, Ca2+-activated, non-selective cation channel.  The effect of exogenous OAG and IP3, as well as PLC activation via m-3M3FBS, was investigated at the single channel level.  OAG transiently elevated open probability (PO), and co-application of IP3 boosted and prolonged this response.  Exposure to OAG and IP3 also left-shifted channel voltage-dependence; moreover, PLC activation using m-3M3FBS increased PO in excised patches, suggesting PLC may be physically localized to the channel.  The Ca2+-activation of this channel desensitized during continued exposure to high Ca2+, which is reminiscent of PIP2-mediated desensitization seen in some TRPM channels.  Accordingly, addition of a PIP2 analogue, di-C8-PIP2, ablated Ca2+ desensitization, while inhibiting the hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLC, with U73122, mirrored that effect.  The phosphoinositol signalling cascade regulates multiple TRP-like channels during the afterdischarge, providing a means to facilitate prolonged depolarization and reproductive behaviour.  Because TRP channels are modulated by phosphoinositols in numerous organisms, these results have implications for neuroendocrine function throughout the animal kingdom.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) function in the acquisition and recycling of inorganic phosphate (Pi), a crucial but environmentally-limiting macronutrient for plant growth. Among 29 predicted PAPs of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, AtPAP26 (At5g34850) functions as the principal intra- and extracellular PAP isozyme that scavenges Pi during Pi-deprivation or leaf senescence. A pair of secreted, 55 kDa AtPAP26 ‘glycoforms’ (AtPAP26-S1 and AtPAP26-S2) were resolved during lectin-affinity chromatography of cell wall extracts from Pi-deprived Arabidopsis suspension cells and purified. High resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) demonstrated that their glycans were comparable at Asn103, whereas Asn365 and Asn422 glycosylation sites were extensively modified in AtPAP26-S2 by the addition of up to seven terminal mannose residues (to N-acetylglucosamine) to form high mannose glycans. A 55 kDa protein that co-purified with AtPAP26-S2 was identified by LC-MS/MS as Arabidopsis GNA and apple domain-containing lectin-1 (AtGAL1). AtGAL1 (At1g78850) belongs to Arabidopsis’ Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) lectin family, whose GNA domain binds high mannose N-glycans. AtGAL1 cross-reactivity with anti-AtGAL1-IgG was markedly attenuated when the lectin was incubated in the presence of a thiol-reducing reagent (consistent with three predicted disulfide bonds in AtGAL1’s apple domain). Reciprocal far western immunodot blotting demonstrated a specific interaction between purified AtGAL1 and AtPAP26-S2, but not AtPAP26-S1. Analytical gel filtration FPLC indicated that AtGAL1 and AtPAP26-S2 associate to form a 112 kDa heterodimer. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays established that like AtPAP26, AtGAL1 is also targeted to lytic vacuoles of Pi-starved Arabidopsis cells, and that both proteins interact in vivo. AtGAL1 pre-incubation significantly enhanced the acid phosphatase activity and thermal stability of AtPAP26-S2, but not AtPAP26-S1. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS also revealed that purified AtGAL1 was bisphosphorylated at Tyr38 and Thr39. Secreted AtGAL1 polypeptides were upregulated to a far greater extent than AtGAL1 transcripts during Pi deprivation, indicating post-transcriptional control of AtGAL1 expression. I hypothesize that AtGAL1 plays a key role during Pi deprivation through its interaction with high mannose glycans of AtPAP26-S2, and consequent positive impact on AtPAP26-S2 phosphatase activity and stability. The current study appears to provide the first definitive evidence for involvement of glycoforms, lectins, or a phosphotyrosylated protein in plant Pi starvation responses.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Why would anyone form or support an opposition political party in a country where this might land you in prison, in hospital, or even in the grave? And how is it that some of these parties become so powerful and successful, while others do not? Almost all governments today are controlled by a political party. This makes sense in democracies, because parties give meaning to the choices we make in election booths. But political parties really do not need democracy the way democracy needs them. Indeed, most authoritarian regimes are run by political parties, as well as challenged by them.  We understand comparatively little about parties in these contexts, despite much research on democratization putting a premium on the agency of oppositions in transitions from authoritarian rule.  In this dissertation I investigate why some opposition parties in undemocratic regimes become successful and others do not.  I find that successful opposition parties in hybrid regimes have successfully used pro forma legal multipartyism to carve out ideological space for themselves on advocating for democracy, have demonstrated their credibility to voters as occupants of this space by enduring repression, and have convinced (strategic) voters that they are viable challengers to their competitors and the incumbent.  I back these claims with in-depth, multi-method case studies, based on field research on the National League for Democracy in Burma/Myanmar, the Cambodia National Rescue Party in Cambodia, and the Russian Democratic Party Yabloko and Team Navalny in the Russian Federation.  These studies utilize interviews and focus groups with party candidates and members, an original survey, other primary and secondary source research, “big data” analysis, and the secondary analysis of existing data.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the structural effectiveness of a new concrete sandwich panel with a shear connector made of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) pultruded channel sections intended to enhance composite action and flexural rigidity while minimizing thermal bridging. The flanges of the channel section are embedded in either wythe. Five half-scale panels (610x280x3050 mm) were tested in four-point bending, varying the connector configuration and type as well as the wythe reinforcement ratio. The connectors investigated were a continuous GFRP channel, a discrete GFRP channel consisting of multiple segments spaced apart and a control conventional steel truss. Ancillary push-off single shear tests were conducted on 500 mm long wall segments to examine GFRP shear strength and bond strength by varying boundary conditions. The panels with continuous and discrete GFRP channels achieved 2.8 and 1.3 times, respectively, the ultimate strength of that with a steel truss. The continuous GFRP channel contributed 59% of the total flexural capacity of the wall. As the wythe steel reinforcement ratio increased from 0.17 to 0.68% the ultimate load of panels with continuous GFRP channels increased by 33%. Failure modes were compressive flange crushing for the panels with continuous GFRP channel, web shear for the panel with discrete channel, and rupture of bottom wythe reinforcement for the panel with steel truss.&#xD;
An analytical model was developed in RESPONSE-2000 to evaluate the degree of composite action achieved by the GFRP shear connector. Both peak loads for theoretical fully composite and non-composite sections increased by 23%, as reinforcement ratio increased from 0.17 to 0.68%. Peak loads for specimens with discrete connector or truss connector were both only 45% and 20% of their fully composite and non-composite counterparts with a continuous connector. Specimens with continuous GFRP channel as shear connector exhibited higher degree of composite action (average of 38%) than the truss connector (32%). The GFRP-concrete bond strength was tested experimentally and was 0.28 MPa and the longitudinal shear strength of the channel was tested and found to be 39 MPa.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The recalcitrant nature of the carbon-rich plant cell wall is largely owed to its array of structural polysaccharides, which are efficiently hydrolyzed by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum via a multi-enzyme complex termed the cellulosome.  Cellulosome assembly requires various carbohydrate-active enzymes grafting onto a scaffoldin subunit through a high-affinity interaction between the enzyme-borne type-I dockerin modules and scaffoldin-borne type-I cohesin modules.  Type-I dockerins contain duplicated F-hand motifs that comprise a calcium binding loop and an adjacent helix, in which the sequential duplication is manifested into a near-perfect internal two-fold symmetry of the dockerin structure. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that cohesin binding can occur through either of its F-helices and a critical Ser/Thr pair, although substituting the second Ser/Thr sequence with alanine residues was required to observe the alternative conformation.  Thus, there has yet to be a direct structural observation of the type-I dockerin-cohesin dual binding mode in solution. &#xD;
The type-I dockerin from Cel48S and the seventh type-I cohesin from the scaffoldin of C. thermocellum were recombinantly expressed in E. coli as uniformly 13C/15N-labeled and unlabeled forms, respectively. Alanine substitutions were introduced to the first and second set of critical Ser/Thr pairs of Cel48S dockerin via site-directed mutagenesis and were similarly expressed to serve as controls for the individual binding modes.  Wild-type and mutant Cel48S dockerin and type-I cohesin modules as separate entities and as 1:1 complexes were purified via Ni2+-affinity and size exclusion chromatography.  1H-15N HSQC NMR analyses indicated that although the bound wild-type Cel48S dockerin spectrum comprised fewer resonances than those of the dockerin variants fixated into a single orientation, the visible resonances were intermediate to those of the mutants.&#xD;
These observations are consistent with an interaction undergoing chemical exchange on the intermediate to fast NMR time scale. Weaker signal intensity would also be consistent with the Cel48S dockerin construct existing in two orientations. Thus, these findings collectively indicate that Cel48S dockerin interacts with its cognate cohesin module in more than one orientation. The dockerin dual binding mode would overcome steric hindrance associated with neighbouring enzymatic subunits assembling onto the cellulosomal scaffoldin subunit.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Primary care nurse practitioners (NPs) in Ontario are central to care for transgender clients in Ontario regarding social and legal transition, medical transition and referrals for gender-affirming surgeries. Transgender people face discrimination in health care resulting in poorer health outcomes for this population. Health policy makers in Canada call for cultural safety as a client outcome without fully addressing how to achieve this goal. Cultural humility is a model that incorporates reflexivity by the practitioner of both their own actions with clients as well as on power and bias within the health care system. It offers a dynamic practice that is grounded in health equity that promotes culturally safe care environments. &#xD;
&#xD;
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to develop a baseline understanding of Ontario NPs’ transgender health related attitudes and awareness from a cultural humility perspective. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: A predominantly post-positivist approach was used that incorporated an autoethnobiographical narrative to frame the study context. Research questions address associations between critical self-reflection, and transgender health related attitudes, knowledge,  resource and policy awareness while controlling for confounding variables. Data was gathered using an exploratory, cross-sectional, online survey design. Interpretation included exploring alternative formats of the conceptual framework. &#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Participants in this study were strongly self-reflective and had moderate to highly positive attitudes towards transgender people.  Awareness of clinically relevant and currently available resources was low even among a sample that was biased towards having positive regard for transgender clients and having had experience with transgender clients.  Exploratory analysis of the confounding variables suggest that life experience influences one’s reflexivity. These results also highlight the sharp learning curve that exists for NPs with the initial clients they treat with a new issue or condition. &#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion: The results of this study indicate the need for increased cultural humility and transgender health specific content in NP curricula, policy, research and practice. Future avenues of research include examining the relationships of self-reflection, rumination, and insight. The cultural humility model can also be modified to reflect new understandings of internal and external processes of clinical interactions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Identity and narrative work both refer to the internal and external efforts social actors actively and passively engage in to negotiate and reconcile their self-concepts and experiences, as well as to alleviate emotional disturbances when faced with inconsistency or disappointments. Situating psychological theories in a sociological framework, this thesis studies how undergraduate students emotionally appraise academic disappointments (as threats to their senses of self), how they cope with or react to these disappointments, and the factors that influence both. An online questionnaire was randomly distributed to 200 undergraduate students at a university located in Ontario—a province where students have reported the highest prevalence of elevated distress nationally. Univariate and bivariate results were obtained from 47 respondents. The results suggest students most commonly employ a mix of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. Results posit the student behaviours/attitudes variables are the most widely associated with the frequency of using various coping strategies, followed by well-being/mental health and institutional factors. However, whether a student regularly uses these strategies was most strongly associated with well-being/mental health variables. Surprisingly, a slight majority of respondents found below average grades greatly to extremely upsetting, regardless of assessment type. The student behaviours/attitudes variables, as well as social influences variables were associated with all threat appraisals, while well-being/mental health variables were not. The univariate results replicate some of the forms of identity/narrative work found in the literature, namely those suggested by Snow and Anderson (1987) and Perinbanayagam (2000); while bivariate results partially support sociological and psychological literature, with some differences. Results substantiate the strength of socialization and institutional factors for the study of identity work. A few preliminary insights for university professors and support staff are offered and further courses of inquiry are suggested.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Radiation therapy treatment techniques have become more complex to offer optimal tumour control while preserving patient quality of life by avoiding damage to healthy tissue. This increased complexity requires more thorough quality assurance (QA). External beam radiation therapy has seen an increase of QA of individual patients’ treatments for complex deliveries. This is known as patient specific quality assurance. High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatments have become more complex, but patient specific QA has not been adopted. One reason for this is the lack of inexpensive, simple to use, accurate, and complete dosimeters for brachytherapy. Radiochromic gel dosimeters with optical computed tomography (CT) readout would provide such a dosimeter, but the insertion of brachytherapy catheters into the gel cause streak artifacts in the reconstructed dose distributions, ruining the dosimeter’s accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
The objective of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using radiochromic gel dosimeters for HDR brachytherapy dosimetry. This work focused on the initial step for making radiochromic gel dosimeters compatible with brachytherapy irradiations: the removal of the streak artifacts in the reconstructed dose distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
First the cause of the artifacts was investigated. It was found that photon starvation caused the streak artifacts present when using the standard Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) reconstruction algorithm. This work then investigated using the Ordered Subsets Convex algorithm with Total Variation minimization regularization (OSC-TV) instead of the FDK algorithm to suppress the artifacts. Three variants of the OSC-TV algorithm were also developed. These variants introduced reconstructing using flood field images (OSC-TV-FF), rejecting data from rays that passed through the catheters (OSC-TV-RR), or both (OSC-TV-FF-RR). Using controlled external beam irradiations, the OSC-TV and OSC-TV-RR algorithms were both found to remove the streak artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
The OSC-TV and OSC-TV-RR algorithms were then used for a set of HDR brachytherapy dosimetry experiments. Both the OSC-TV and OSC-TV-RR algorithms produced artifact free dose distributions of gels with a single catheter inserted. The OSC-TV-RR algorithm also removed artifacts from gels with multiple catheters. Therefore it was concluded that the OSC-TV-RR algorithm could be used with radiochromic gels to provide a feasible method for patient specific HDR brachytherapy dosimetry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Class A component of the International Military Proceedings for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trial, has had a central—and at times overbearing—presence within the legacy of the tribunal. Documents from the very beginning of the legal proceedings have established a clear prioritization by the Allied forces to target the ‘arch criminals’ accused of committing the newly coined charges of ‘crimes against peace’. Important historical figures involved in the trial, as well as subsequent historians and legal scholars, have continued to problematize and attack the trials for this focus. This criticism, while at times legitimate, has helped solidify the legacy of the Tokyo Trial as ‘victor’s justice’. Due to this focus, usually at best the Tokyo Trial is dismissed or devalued; at worst it has become a tool of Japanese war crimes apologists and deniers. The legal emphasis on Class A war crimes did have significant flaws and weaknesses which are important to highlight. However, historical analysis has become stuck in a ‘victor’s justice’ time loop, limiting the historical scope of the Tokyo Trials for too long. There is an urgent need to move beyond this concept within the scholarship of the IMTFE, while also understand the impact of this focus. The fixation with ‘victor’s justice’ has been seared into specific national narratives of remembrance, victimhood and trauma. While it will also touch upon the transnational factors that contributed to Japan’s process of silencing and remembering, this paper will explore the ways in which Class A war crimes have come to define and construct the legacy of the Tokyo Trial and its place in Japan’s national wartime narrative. Though there is a place within the historical discussion of the IMTFE for concepts such as ‘victor’s justice’ and criticism of crimes against peace, this paper will conclude with a discussion on how scholars can move beyond this limiting perspective and reach a more complex understanding of the Tokyo Trial and its legacy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Camp Mohawk aerodrome (1917-1918) was situated on Tyendinaga Territory in Ontario during the First World War (1914-1918). In recognition of its 100th anniversary, researchers have been exploring the history of the aerodrome and its contributions to the war effort. What is missing in the research are Haudenosaunee perspectives of the origins of the aerodrome and events that shaped cultural revival in a Mohawk community subject to the oppressive realities of the Indian Act, 1876. This thesis furnishes an Indigenous context and addresses two gaps in research to date: (1) the relational events of people and place that shaped the period, especially the years 1917-1918; and (2) the effects of Indigenous empowerment to revive a traditional governance system that had long since been removed by Canadian government legislation. An Indigenous methodologies approach to data collection is adopted, including the use of oral storytelling. Research reveals two findings of significance: (1) a motion to grant land on the reserve for the establishment of an aerodrome was done so under duress and was a mere formality predetermined by Indian Affairs; and (2) the influence of the Thunderwater Movement in Tyendinaga was the catalyst to empowering Mohawk women to reclaim their matriarchal duties in defiance of the Indian Act. Much of the previous literature on the subject offers historical perspective, but through the lens of colonial bias, reflecting a time of Indian prejudice in Canada.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Railway bridge transitions are locations of abrupt track support stiffness change arising from the difference in support stiffness between the relatively softer foundation materials of the track approaching the bridge and the relatively stiffer bridge structure. This phenomenon is believed to amplify dynamic train wheel loads, which contribute to the development of persistent problematic differential track settlements that are difficult to resolve despite major research efforts by the railway geotechnics community. Novel sensing technologies such as Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and distributed fiber optic strain sensing offer a unique opportunity to further understand railway bridge transition behaviour by providing the ability to obtain simultaneous field measurements of railway track displacements and loads applied to sleepers (i.e. “rail seat forces”) for reduced requirements in terms of rail surface preparation and sensor installation time relative to other sensing technologies. &#xD;
&#xD;
This research involved the use of distributed fiber optic strain sensors to develop and evaluate a method of calculating rail seat forces applied to the track, using measurements obtained during static train load testing in a controlled environment. The experiment allowed the presence of vertical force equilibrium between the applied train wheel loads and the resultant rail seat forces to be verified, which subsequently permitted a method of evaluating the rail seat force calculations to be developed and tested. &#xD;
&#xD;
DIC and distributed fiber optic strain sensors were then used to instrument a railway bridge transition that was experiencing differential track settlement. The collected monitoring data, including measurements of railway track displacements and rail seat forces, were used to interpret track defects observed during a visual site inspection and determine their relevance toward the behaviour of the railway bridge transition under loading. It was found that measurements of gaps between the rail and sleeper plates could be used to obtain first-order approximations of both the shape of the differential track settlement profile and maximum rail bending stresses. The limitations of this work are discussed and potential avenues for future research in this field are presented.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Beyond their important role in reproduction, estrogens contribute in various adaptive and maladaptive physiological phenomena including, but not limited to, appetite, stress response, and the development of compulsive behaviours. There are estrogen receptors throughout the brain, including in regions and circuits contributing to maladaptive behaviours. Thus, pharmacological interventions targeting estrogens result in considerable undesirable side effects. Traditionally considered a female steroid hormone, estrogens are also potent neuromodulators in the male vertebrate brain. In comparison to female rats, peripherally administered estrogens have negligible effects as the male rat brain likely relies on brain-derived de novo estrogens synthesis. While the neurophysiological effects of estrogens are well characterized in the hippocampus of both sexes, nothing is known about their effects in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria-terminalis (ovBNST), a key region that integrates sensory information within the appetite, anxiety, and compulsion circuits. The ovBNST is rich in estrogen receptors and has the capability of synthesising estrogens in both sexes. Using brain slice voltage-clamp electrophysiology, we characterized the effects of estrogens on inhibitory synaptic transmission within the rat ovBNST. These studies will demonstrate that Estradiol (E2) had a potent, but sexually dimorphic effects on both inhibitory synaptic transmission and plasticity at GABA synapses within the ovBNST. These effects of E2 were sensitive to changes in the rats metabolic-state and intriguingly, a form of compulsive behaviours in rats was associated with a dysfunction in the endogenous estrogenic system within the ovBNST. This dysfunction appears to be caused by a weakening of the paraventricular thalamus circuit with the ovBNST that may cause changes in E2 synthesis.  Thus, we discovered that brain-derived estrogens are potent modulators of inhibitory synaptic transmission within the ovBNST and they gate a metabolic-state induced bi-directional plasticity that is associated with the development and maintenance of maladaptive compulsive behaviours in male rats. These studies lay the foundation in understanding how the endogenous estrogenic system within the male brain is integral in influencing state-dependent behaviour.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Arctic mercury (Hg) contamination is an ongoing threat to human populations and ecosystems alike. Compared to preindustrial levels, elevated concentrations of Hg in air and water samples have been observed across the high latitudes with recent estimates demonstrating substantial Hg storage in Arctic soils. Climate change is expected to have a strong impact on the stability of permafrost landscapes potentially releasing large quantities of Hg from thawed soils to surface waters. This study investigates multi-year, seasonal, and diel dynamics of total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations, particulate partitioning, and flux from two small High Arctic rivers, subject to permafrost disturbance, at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory, Nunavut, Canada. Water samples were collected from the outlet of the rivers during the melt season (2007-2017; excluding 2011, 2013-2015), and from several small hillslope tributaries with various levels of permafrost disturbance (2009, 2016, 2017). Results indicate that there are large diel and inter-annual variations in THg concentration and flux, in part due to climate-driven changes in discharge and the physical disturbance of active layer and permafrost soils. A large proportion of THg (30.5-72.5%) was particulate bound, and significant positive relationships were observed between THg, suspended sediment, discharge, and organic carbon concentrations in both rivers. MeHg concentrations were low for both rivers (0.05 ng L-1) and were poorly correlated with discharge, suspended sediment concentration or organic carbon. The timing and intensity of runoff was a dominant driver of THg flux in all years with the&#xD;
majority of discharge and peak THg concentrations occurring during either the brief nival freshet or uncommon late season rainfall events. These results provide a critical link between Hg stored in Arctic soils, permafrost disturbance and fluvial Hg export, with important implications for Hg cycling in a changing Arctic.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Dynamic computer experiments which refer to computer experiments with&#xD;
time series outputs have increasingly gained popularity in both&#xD;
science and engineering. Analysis of dynamic computer experiments&#xD;
through statistical emulators or surrogate models emerges as an&#xD;
important topic in statistical literature. This thesis is devoted to&#xD;
three research topics in modeling and analysis of dynamic computer&#xD;
experiments. We propose new methodologies for (a) efficient inference&#xD;
of Gaussian process models for large-scale dynamic computer&#xD;
experiments; (b) the inverse problem for small-scale dynamic computer&#xD;
experiments, that is, when a target response is available, we aim to&#xD;
estimate the inputs of the computer simulator that produce a response&#xD;
matching the target as closely as possible; (c) the inverse problem in&#xD;
large-scale dynamic computer experiments, which requires fitting the&#xD;
Gaussian process emulator efficiently given a large input data set to&#xD;
obtain the estimated solution to the inverse problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
For the large-scale dynamic computer experiments, we propose a local&#xD;
approximate singular value decomposition based Gaussian process&#xD;
(lasvdGP) model, which is shown to provide accurate and efficient&#xD;
emulation for the dynamic computer simulator. For the small-scale&#xD;
inverse problem, we introduce a sequential design approach which&#xD;
selects follow-up design points as per a proposed expected improvement&#xD;
criterion. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by both the&#xD;
theoretical study of convergence and the empirical study compared with&#xD;
existing alternative methods. For the inverse problem in large-scale&#xD;
dynamic computer experiments, we propose an approximate Bayesian&#xD;
inference algorithm using the proposed lasvdGP model. This approach&#xD;
gives promising results to address the computational challenge of the&#xD;
large input data set of the dynamic computer simulator.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) pipe is a light weight alternative to steel pipe for oil and gas distribution pipelines that is corrosion resistant but whose material properties vary based on production technique and whose failure mechanisms are not well understood. These pipelines may cross through unstable terrain and be subject to flexural bending caused by ground motion causing split and leakage of their contents into the environment. This study examines the response of GFRP pipe to permanent ground deformation and the failure mechanisms exhibited by GFRP material. A series of full-scale tests were performed using the Split Box at the Queen’s University GeoEngineering Laboratory, a facility that can simulate a normal ground fault to mimic permanent ground deformation. Three 5.6 m long GFRP pipe segments were pressurized to zero, 300, and 1000 kPa respectively and subject to 120 mm of differential settlement, causing longitudinal bending at the crown and invert near the fault line. Fibre optic sensors installed longitudinally along the length of the buried samples reveal zones of peak strain and curvature. These zones located on either side of the fault line are shown to be asymmetrical with higher strains recorded on the stationary side of the fault line. The position and magnitude of peak curvature zones changed with increased pressure, shifting further away from the fault line with decreased curvature. The samples did not reach an ultimate limit state, however at 110 mm fault offset the buried pipe wall split resulting in water leaking at the peak curvature zones and pressure loss.  Three four-point bending tests were also performed on similar pipe segments 1.8 m long. The flexural tests were used to establish a relationship between curvature and moment for the GFRP pipe which was then used to estimate the lengthwise moment distribution of the buried samples.  Comparisons were also made to the flexural responses of the buried pipe.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The prohibition on retroactive law is a fundamental principle of international criminal law. It is also a fundamental principle in many domestic legal systems. The principle prohibits authorities from convicting individuals for acts (or omissions) which were not criminal at the time they were committed. In international law, the prohibition is stated in absolute terms. Crimes against humanity are undoubtedly crimes but, they began their life as retroactive criminal law. Currently, the crimes against humanity prohibition on unspecified “other inhumane acts” seems to invite the continued articulation and application of new types of crimes against humanity. If this is accepted, it calls into question our commitment to the absolute prohibition on retroactive criminal law. In this thesis, I use the theories of Lon L. Fuller and the crimes against humanity prohibition on other inhumane acts to explore the prohibition on retroactive law. The theories of Fuller and the example of crimes against humanity suggest that the prohibition on retroactive law is not as absolute as assumed. Equally, the prohibition and the theories of Fuller show problematic shortcomings in the current approach to the crimes against humanity prohibition on other inhumane acts. In this thesis, I explore how these two criminal law prohibitions can illuminate and inform each other and contribute to the legitimacy of international criminal law.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Physical activity is an effective strategy for mitigating the negative physical and psychosocial effects of breast cancer treatment. Accordingly, physical activity programs have been developed to enhance clinical cancer care; however, many communities in Ontario remain without such programs. Further, it is unclear what factors constitute an optimal physical activity program for breast cancer survivors. An integrated knowledge translation approach, defined as the involvement of knowledge users in the co-creation of knowledge, can assist in identifying optimal aspects of physical activity program delivery for breast cancer survivors. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to explore optimal physical activity program delivery for breast cancer survivors across multiple stakeholder groups in the cancer care community, and to develop specific recommendations that can be used to inform the development of physical activity programs for breast cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors, health care professionals (e.g., oncologists, nurses, and allied health care professionals) and community-based physical activity program providers participated in four 60-minute heterogeneous focus group discussions. Broad discussions about an optimal program environment, program delivery team, and core program practices were encouraged. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to inductive thematic analysis. Participants recommended that physical activity programs for breast cancer survivors should improve cancer literacy, provide opportunities to participate with peers, and foster feelings of self-efficacy. Further, when possible, programs should be delivered in the community, accessible from an environmental and financial perspective, and integrated within the regional network of cancer care. These findings can be extended to provide a foundation for researchers and providers aiming to establish, deliver, and evaluate optimal physical activity interventions and programming for breast cancer survivors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multi-material topology optimization remains an active research topic. This work enriches the key techniques of multi-material topology optimization, such as the multi-material property determination, topology optimization problem statements, stiffness constraints, sensitivity analysis, and optimization algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Firstly, the multi-material updating (also known as material interpolation) scheme is established, which is the fundamental basis of multi-material topology optimization. The interpolated properties contain Young’s modulus, constitutive matrix, weight, and cost. To avoid the limitations of handling the various materials with the conventional material updating scheme, we enhance the element interpolation to update the material properties. The element interpolation method transforms a multi-material topology optimization problem into a single-material problem, which has no limitation on handling the various materials and is easy to solve according to the current research literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Secondly, the multi-material topology optimization problem statements for practical lightweight design are defined. Compliance minimization is the typical problem statement in academic research.  However, in practical applications, compliance minimization is improper because compliance lacks clear physical meaning. Therefore, weight/cost minimization with stiffness constraints, which has clear physical meaning for product design, is proposed as the primary problem statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Thirdly, sensitivity analysis based on the typical responses is provided. The typical responses in this thesis include compliance, weight, volume (or volume fraction), displacement, stress, and cost. The responses are generalized into one universal expression, and then their sensitivities are derived. The equations of the responses and sensitivities are summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Fourthly, the multi-material weight minimization considering stress constraints is discussed. The multi-material weight minimization considering stress constraints is addressed, with the transformation from the multi-material problem to the single-material problem using element interpolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Finally, the Method of Moving Asymptotes is selected as the optimizer because of its stability and efficiency. Nevertheless, the traditional Method of Moving Asymptotes may fail when handling a high-resolution finite element model (i.e., the mesh size is small). The failure is caused by the null search direction due to the small sensitivities. Thus, I introduce the primal-dual interior-point method with a scaling mechanism into the Method of Moving Asymptotes to eliminate the small-sensitivity issue.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Total body irradiation (TBI) is used in the treatment of certain types of blood cancers. It involves irradiating the whole body of the patient with high energy x-rays or gamma rays in order to kill cancer cells and suppress the immune system in preparation for a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The challenge in TBI is delivering a uniform dose throughout the whole patient. Most conventional cancer treatment units are not able to provide a sufficiently large uniform radiation field to enable TBI without complex movement of the beam or the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
Recently, a dedicated Co-60 TBI unit was developed in Canada by BEST Theratronics (Kanata, ON). It uses gamma radiation from a Co-60 source housed in an extended gantry to irradiate a stationary patient lying on a couch below the source. The radiation beam of the source needs to be modified by a filter between the source and the patient to ensure uniform irradiation over the whole patient length as the distance from source varies considerably over the treatment volume. The amount of filtration required may also change over time to ensure an appropriate dose rate is maintained as the source decays.&#xD;
&#xD;
To assist BEST Theratronics with filter design, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the TBI unit were run to test the effectiveness of filter shapes that they had calculated by hand. This was a time consuming, trial-and-error process which required specialised training. It was the motivation for the development of a filter optimisation program which uses a radiation transport model based on primary and first scatter dose contributions that is quicker and easy to use. It was found that the relative dose distributions calculated by this program matched the MC-calculated distributions within about 3%. The absolute dose calculated was accurate for a small field and phantom, but for the TBI unit and a large phantom, the absolute dose was underestimated by 24-38% because of the missing higher order scatter. However, the amount of underestimation is predictable, so it is possible to use the program to calculate acceptable beam flattening filter shapes for a particular desired dose rate.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Task-based Language Teaching (TBLT), an influential teaching approach used mostly for teaching English and other European languages as a second language, has been advocated for teaching Chinese as a second language (CSL) by policy makers and pedagogical theorists. To realize TBLT innovation, one group of critical stakeholders is classroom teachers because they put into practice the principles and procedures devised or mandated by textbook writers, pedagogical experts and educational officials. Therefore, this study aimed to understand how native Chinese-speaking teachers practise CSL teaching in relation to TBLT in university settings in China and to make sense of their teaching practice from the perspective of teacher cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
To better understand teachers’ teaching practice and teacher cognition, this study adopted Activity Theory as the conceptual framework. As a qualitative case study, the study was bounded in a Chinese university located in Sichuan Province. The participants of the study included 25 teachers (including 8 key teacher informants), 2 directors and 17 students. Data were collected through teacher questionnaires, interviews and classroom observations with the key teacher informants, and interviews with the directors and students. Questionnaire data was analysed using descriptive statistics; qualitative data were analysed first by a thematic analysis followed by an activity system analysis. &#xD;
&#xD;
The findings revealed that the teachers adopted TBLT mainly to transfer declarative knowledge to procedural knowledge. Task-like activities and communicative activities were not peripheral in terms of the number of times they were observed and the time spent on them but took on complementary status in addition to the traditional classroom instruction. Teachers’ understanding of TBLT diverged from how TBLT has been described by theorists in the literature. The major differences pertained to what TBLT is, the perceived value of TBLT, and the applicable scope of TBLT. The teaching activity shaped teachers’ cognition about TBLT through direct and indirect mediations at the cultural-historical, ontogenetic and microgenetic layer of the context. To alleviate the challenges brought up by the tensions existed in the teachers’ activity systems, teachers adjusted and readjusted their teaching, resulting in the classroom practice of predominantly applying the traditional approach and supplementing it with TBLT.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mobile app stores (such as the  Apple App Store and the Google Play Store) provide a unique updating mechanism that helps app developers to distribute their updates efficiently. In addition, after downloading a new update, users are able to review the latest update so other users could benefit from the posted reviews. Such unique reviewing and updating mechanisms enable users and developers to interact with each other through the store.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we study user-developer interactions through the updating and reviewing mechanisms of app stores. Our studies can help store owners to acquire a global view about user-developer interactions.  Such a global view about user-developer interactions can help store owners to improve the quality of the offered apps in their stores. For example, store owners can leverage our findings to identify the common release mistakes that are made by app developers and improve the app updating mechanism to prevent developers from making such mistakes in their updates. In particular, we study the user-developer interactions along three perspectives: (1) study the common developer mistakes that lead to emergency updates, (2) study how the reviewing mechanism can help spot good and bad updates, and (3) study the dialogue between users and developers to help design next-generation app reviewing mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this thesis, we identify eight patterns of emergency updates in two categories "Updates due to deployment issues" and "Updates due to source code changes". Our studies show that it can be worthwhile for app owners to respond to reviews, as responding may lead to an increase in the given rating. In addition, we identify four patterns of developer responses. Our work demonstrates the necessity of an update-level analysis of reviews to capture the impressions of an app's user-base about a particular update. An app-level analysis is not sufficient to capture these transient impressions.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Practical energy storage systems are essential for matching the intermittent production of renewable power sources with the time dependent power demand of residences and businesses. This study assesses the technical viability of battery and hydrogen energy storage systems, scaled for a Canadian residential dwelling with low annual electric power consumption. The simulated consumption is an electric load, encompassing all major electricity demands within the house. The simulated load does not include space heating or cooling requirements. The conceptual dwelling uses a PV array to provide power to the load and storage system. System architectures were evaluated based on their ability to capture the maximum amount of energy from the PV array over the course of the simulated year.&#xD;

Transient modelling was performed to thoroughly study two system architectures; an all-battery energy storage system, and a hybrid energy storage system, combining battery and hydrogen gas storage. The simulated systems were sized to meet a minimum load reliability of no greater than 15 load faults (no-power events) for the simulated year. Simulation of the all-battery storage system indicated that for a 10kWp PV array to meet the load demand with the required reliability, a 172.8kWh lead-acid battery bank was required. The battery system was capable of capturing 25% of every kWh of PV production, and had an overall electrical efficiency of 78%.&#xD;
&#xD;
Simulation of the hybrid energy storage system indicated that the 10kWp PV array, combined with an 11kW PEM electrolyser, a 6 kW PEM fuel cell, a 20kWh lead acid battery bank, and a 10m3 hydrogen storage tank exceeded the reliability requirement, with only 6 load faults in the simulated year. The hybrid storage system was able to capture 58% of every kWh of PV production, and had an overall electrical efficiency of 48% (weighted average of battery and hydrogen efficiency).</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Sensitive clay landslides represent a significant geohazard in Eastern Canada and Scandinavia, often exhibiting complex lateral spreading or flow-like retrogressive behavior. The upslope extent of this hazard is represented by the retrogression distance, which can be upwards of hundreds of meters from the top of the original slope to the crown of the post-failure slope (e.g. the zone of depletion). The ability to estimate the retrogression distance is essential for risk management and effective risk communication concerning these types of landslides. To understand the site-specific risk, it would be desirable to estimate retrogression distance from soil properties and topological characteristics. Empirical correlations with Taylor’s stability number, Ns, have been developed, however, field data using these relationships shows considerable scatter, which could overestimate or underestimate retrogression distance. The large geotechnical centrifuge at C-CORE in Newfoundland, Canada, was used to conduct several physical model experiments aimed at investigating the relationship between stability number and the observed retrogression distance in a controlled laboratory environment. Before testing physical models, an artificially sensitive material was developed. A mixture of 12% cement and Speswhite kaolin with a design water content of two times the liquid limit was selected for the physical model experiments. Five centrifuge tests were conducted to investigate the change in retrogression behaviour of slopes of varying stability number and ease of flow of the remolded material. This was achieved through designing mixes to vary the peak undrained shear strength in the former, and the addition of a 5-degree slope angle for the remolded material for the latter. The addition of a 5-degree slope angle incited notably larger retrogression distances. Undrained stability analyses were performed for each observed failure stage. These analyses were remarkably accurate in representing the observed failure geometry and factor of safety. The relationship between Taylor’s stability number and the observed retrogression distance increased, as expected. The results of this research indicate that the geometric characteristics and material properties of a retrogressive landslide may be able to explain one component of the scatter when correlating the Taylor stability number with retrogression distance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Child abuse remains a public health and human rights issue with severe consequences. Natural disasters can cause physical, social, and psychological stressors, which may lead to an increase in child directed abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
Objective: The aim of this study was to i) investigate the social and living conditions of households in Haiti pre- and post 2010 Haiti earthquake, ii) to determine the household prevalence of emotional, physical, and severe physical abuse in children aged 2-14 post-earthquake, and iii) to explore the association between earthquake-related loss and experiences of emotional, physical, and severe physical child abuse in the household.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methods: A nationally representative sample of Haitian households from the 2005/6 (n=9888) and 2012 (n=13181) cycle of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) was used. Descriptive analysis was  summarized using frequencies and measures of central tendency. Chi-squared and independent T-tests were used to compare data that was available pre-and post-earthquake. Associations between earthquake-related loss and emotional, physical, and severe physical child abuse was assessed using multivariate log-binomial regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results: Comparing pre-post-earthquake, noteworthy improvements were observed in the educational attainment of the household head (9.1% decrease in “no education” category) and in possession of the following household items: electricity, television, mobile-phone, and radio. The prevalence estimates of emotional, physical, and severe physical abuse, in the month prior to the 2012 survey, was 78.5%, 77.0%, and 15.4% respectively. Two years following the earthquake, death of a household member was associated with a higher likelihood of a child being victim to emotional (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.05-1.17) and severe physical abuse (RR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.14-1.94). Conversely, injury of a household member was associated with a lower likelihood of a child experiencing emotional abuse (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.52-0.87). Visual mapping revealed that the prevalence of severe physical abuse in settlement camps was notably higher (25.0%) compared to the overall prevalence in Haiti (15.4%).&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusions: Results of this study highlight a need to better protect children in Haiti from abuse. We found associations between some forms of earthquake related loss and child abuse patterns that would warrant further study and consideration in other contexts of natural disaster.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>At the heart of one’s decision to seek medical assistance in dying lie a person’s autonomy and bodily integrity. In Carter v Canada (Attorney General), the Supreme Court of Canada applied this reasoning to hold that every adult person, who has a grievous and irremediable medical condition and is enduring intolerable suffering has the right to a physician-assisted death. I argue in this paper that if a life is no longer worth living due to the very high price to pay to live it, then a person should be permitted to “waive” his/her right to life. In my view, just bearing the grievous and irremediable medical condition that has the effect of causing enduring intolerable suffering to an individual constitutes a very high price to pay. Expecting that individual to have a reasonably foreseeable natural death as well is an affront to that person’s autonomy, bodily integrity and human dignity. I contend that this is the effect of Bill C-14, Parliament’s response to Carter, and Quebec’s Act Respecting End-of-Life Care. Both laws require a patient to prove the elements of a grievous and irremediable medical condition, as the condition is defined in each respective legislation, but in addition, this patient must prove that his/her natural death is reasonably foreseeable and, in Quebec, that he/she is at the end of life. I argue that both laws contravene the essence of Carter and the Canadian constitution on both grounds of federalism and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter). &#xD;
As the notion of dialogue or Charter dialogue often surfaces to describe the relationship between the courts and a competent legislative body, this paper invokes this notion as the basis for its theoretical framework. This paper adopts a normative perspective in anticipation that the SCC will take another look at the issue of medical assistance in dying. It argues what Parliament should have done, or, perhaps, more accurately, what it should not have done in response to Carter. I raise similar arguments in the case of the Quebec legislation. In my opinion, the two laws could successfully be challenged in court.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis project was intended to take an exploratory look at blockchain technology using an interdisciplinary social lens. Drawing on a variety of sources, including Actor-Network Theory, multiplicity, prefigurative politics, Marx’s early writings on technology, and ideological aspects of both hacker culture and free and open source software development, a complex but useful theoretical framework is proposed. Using a multiple methodological approach combining digital ethnography, semi-structured interviews, and content analysis, social aspects of the blockchain space are explored and an initial first description of demographics and characteristics of the blockchain community is proposed. The thesis finds that the utilization of blockchain technology is playing out in many ways, and there are widely varying positions taken from different groups on development and essential technological characteristics as well as potential motivations. The blockchain area is rapidly evolving, and interest from institutions has been growing. Given the potential prefigurative attributes of the space, there is the potential for institutional and capitalist interests to co-opt and integrate within the space, but this could stand to fundamentally change the uses of the technology. The thesis concludes that it is absolutely imperative that social scientists begin to think seriously about this technological development and its social characteristics and implications prior to widespread and institutional adoption.&#xD;

      <dcterms:abstract>Cast iron represents one of the oldest materials used in water distribution networks across North America. However, aging cast iron water pipes breaking and/or leaking is an increasingly important issue as most are beyond their expected service life. One potential reason for these leaks is the presence of corrosion reducing the wall area. To explore the impact of corrosion and bending on pipe behaviour, a control specimen and a deteriorated specimen were exposed to differential ground motion in the split-box facility at Queen’s University. The data indicated that the curvature of the two specimens was not linearly related to the ground displacement and the effect of a simulated corrosion pit in the form of a hole was localized and had a negligible effect on the curvature on the moving side while causing an increase of 4.3% in the curvature and 61.0% in the maximum strain at the hole location on the stationary side. The axial strains along the neutral axis featured zones of compression and tension near the fault line where it was expected that zero strain would develop (i.e. pure bending was expected), requiring further investigation.&#xD;
          Since the effects of deterioration appeared to be localized to the deteriorated area, a series of four-point bending tests were conducted on a control pipe with no deterioration and three other specimens with idealised deterioration. Distributed fibre optic strain measurements were used to explore both the behaviour of the pipe and the localized strain distribution in the vicinity of the simulated corrosion pits. The test results indicated that strain at the invert of the intact sample was higher than the calculated strain based on the beam theory, and the strain at the centroid (springline) of the pipes was non-zero contrary to what elastic beam theory would suggest. These deviations from the expected theoretical behaviour will require further study. A method of installing optical fibres inside and outside of the pits was developed. The measured strain distributions around each simulated corrosion pit were compared to the Kirsch solution. The Kirsch solution provided good visual agreement with the measured strains in the case of a full thickness hole but the overall agreement was not as good when the corrosion pit did not fully penetrate the wall section. However, the Kirsch solution did provide accurate estimates of the maximum strain in all cases suggesting that it could be used to estimate peak stresses if the corrosion geometry is known.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Worldwide, diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of emergency room admissions, long hospital stays, and long-term disability for individuals living with diabetes. Of all individuals with diabetes, 15–25 percent develop a DFU at some time in their lives; and 25 percent of these foot ulcers end in lower extremity amputation (LEA). While many investigators of DFU have been focused on pharmacological and technical approaches, little attention has been given to non-pharmacological approaches such as self-care management (SCM). The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop a theory that explains the process of engagement in SCM for individuals with DFUs and to identify the contextual factors influencing their engagement. &#xD;
Methods: A constructivist grounded theory, informed by Charmaz, was used to guide the study design. Theoretical sampling and intensive semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 individuals with active DFU attending a wound care clinic in southeastern Ontario, Canada, in August of 2017. Data analysis was conducted alongside data collection in a cyclic research process, which began with initial coding, and proceeded to focused coding or selective coding that resulted in a model representative of the theory. &#xD;
Results: The study results draw attention to the complexity that exists for individuals seeking to balance life and manage diabetes and DFU. The categories and their set of concepts comprise the theory called “The Journey Toward Engagement in SCM”. The process involved five phases: 1) perception of illness, 2) noticing foot changes, 3) realizing seriousness, 4) beginning to learn about SCM, and 5) engaging in SCM. The process is influenced by multiple contextual factors, including aging and/or living with multiple chronic conditions, motivations, self-efficacy, SCM knowledge, SCM support, and access to services and resources. &#xD;
Conclusion: The results of my doctoral study showed the pathway participants used to learn about SCM practices and how engagement in day-to-day management of DFU occurred. It has also helped to uncover inequities in accessing formal SCM education and specialized services and resources, which in turn contribute to inform nursing practice, education, and health policy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The primary aim of this thesis is to evaluate the position known as ‘epistemic disjunctivism’ and its relation to the traditional epistemological framework it is meant to replace.&#xD;
In particular, this will involve the investigation of the points at which John McDowell takes disjunctivism to conflict with traditional empiricist approaches to epistemology with an eye to whether or not any substantive conflicts necessarily arise between these two positions. In the course of this thesis, I shall explain the disjunctivist position, directly address McDowell’s arguments to the effect that traditional empiricism is in need of replacement by disjunctivism, and then draw my conclusions in light of the earlier discussion. In the course of arguing against the traditional approach, McDowell considers two positions which he takes to characterize empiricist accounts of epistemology. He calls these positions the ‘highest common factor’ conception and the ‘hybrid’ view, and argues that they are not only insufficient for a satisfying epistemological account, but undermine the possibility of any account constructed upon them to be satisfactory. These positions are both fundamentally motivated by familiar sceptical arguments and seem to lie at the heart of empiricism. As we shall see, however, should both of these characteristically empiricist positions be interpreted charitably, they need not conflict with disjunctivism, or at least not as McDowell defines it. Indeed, it would seem that the only direct conflicts between the two accounts in question are ultimately semantic, and that the epistemic stories told by the empiricist and the disjunctivist are fundamentally compatible.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is an economic analysis of two of the ways in which the Canadian government has fallen short of providing a treaty right to education.  Chapter 2 lays the foundation of the thesis by introducing the reader to contemporary differences in educational attainment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.  I focus on the results of a math test administered to a national sample of off-reserve students.  After establishing that a large gap in test scores exists on average, the chapter shows that accounting for both the level of and returns to observable characteristics eliminates this gap for low performing students, but a sizeable gap remains in the right tail of the test-score distributions.  The next chapter analyzes one of the largest national student aid programs in Canadian history.  The Post-Secondary Educational Assistance Program was implemented in 1977 to assist Status Indian and Inuit students with financing their post-secondary programs; however, financial constraints led to cutbacks in this program in the late 1980s.  I show that these cutbacks not only led to a reduction in community college completion, but also resulted in a large decline in high school graduation rates.  This finding highlights an important indirect effect associated with varying the costs of higher education.  The final chapter examines the intergenerational effects of Canada's residential school system.  From the late nineteenth century until the end of the twentieth century, the Canadian government, in collaboration with Christian churches, removed Indigenous children from their families and placed them in live-in boarding schools. While economists have shown the schools led to an increase in the educational attainment of those who attended, residential school attendance is negatively correlated with the educational attainment of subsequent generations. This is at odds with the literature on the intergenerational transmission of human capital. The fourth and final chapter explores this puzzle.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>When planning for care for the aging population, the aging-in-place movement aims to keep older adults at home if possible – but how feasible is this method for the rural population? Previous research has shown that rural older adults tend to have poorer health, less access to health care, and be more isolated than their urban counterparts. The question arises as to whether small rural communities can work together to provide comprehensive programming and services to support their growing older adult population. &#xD;
To understand how different demographic factors can relate to accessing senior services, 73 older adults in South Frontenac Township were surveyed, and 16 interviewed about their use of services, barriers to services, and desire to be involved in the planning of services within their communities. The most common utilized service among respondents was health services, followed by library services and physical recreation services. When interviewed, the most common concerns included lack of reliable transportation for those unable to drive, lack of awareness and confusion around what services were available, and concerns around funding needed to have free or low-cost services.&#xD;
The most important barrier to accessing services in this sample was access to a personal vehicle. For rural communities to fully support the health of their aging residents, service providers will have to coordinate transportation efforts to reach those most isolated and in need. Further research should investigate how a more comprehensive rural transportation network might operate to bring isolated older adults to services offered in communities beyond their own.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>There is considerable heterogeneity in observed cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) responses to standardized training.  Evidence from twin and family training studies demonstrates a strong link between an individual’s genetics and the observed CRF response to standardized training, supporting the hypothesis that true individual differences in training responsiveness exist.  If true individual differences do exist, it would be reasonable to speculate that the observed CRF response to an initial period of training would predict the observed response to an identical period of training separated by an adequate washout period.  Thus, the current training study exposed a group of 14 recreationally active males to the same four-week treadmill running training program twice, separated by a three-month washout period.  Baseline CRF at training periods one (PRE1) and two (PRE2) were very strongly correlated (r = 0.94, p &lt; 0.01) and were not significantly different at the group level (p = 0.056).  A significant main effect of time (PRE vs. POST) (p &lt; 0.001) and period (training period one vs. training period two) (p &lt; 0.001) were observed for CRF (training period one: +4.04 ± 2.29 mL/kg/min, training period two: +2.83 ± 2.74 mL/kg/min) with no significant interaction effect (p = 0.13).  At the individual level, the observed CRF response in period one did not predict the response in training period two (r = 0.4, p = 0.15).  The results from this study suggest that either true individual differences in training responsiveness do not exist or that random within-subject variability and technical error mask the ability to detect individual differences.  Future training studies should examine potential combinations of behavioural/environmental factors, which may influence the observed CRF response to standardized training.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>While growing up in rural Newfoundland, I often felt that my identities as a rural Newfoundlander and a queer person were in conflict. Inspired by my own experiences and those of my loved ones, I began this research with the primary goal of documenting the experiences of rural Newfoundland’s queer youth in such a way that carefully maintained the autonomy of my participants and their voices. However, as the study progressed it became clear that my broad exploration was trying to answer one question: given the difficult – often painful and traumatic – experiences of queer youth in rural Newfoundland, could our identities as rural Newfoundlanders and queer people easily coexist?&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis attempts to document the experiences of queer rural Newfoundlanders while asking why and if the identities of queer and rural Newfoundlander are irreconcilable. This work is based upon narratives and experiences I have collected from seven queer youth who have lived or are currently residing on Newfoundland’s rural west coast. I have coupled my participant’s narratives with my own in recognition that this research has been a profoundly personal act of introspection for me. I analyze our experiences in reference to structures of feeling, a concept coined by Marxist Raymond Williams to describe one way that culture and power interact.&#xD;
&#xD;
My findings suggest that queer youth, from diverse backgrounds and of diverse identities, have extreme difficulty reconciling their identity as a rural Newfoundlander with their queer identity. My findings also suggest that many queer youths in rural Newfoundland are as strongly affected by homonormativity and metronormativity as they are by cis-heterosexism and queerphobia. Finally, this research has shown that queer youth in rural Newfoundland, and likely elsewhere, would benefit from readily visible queerer forms of queerness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) performance is said to rely on adequate hydration from the subgrade which is controlled by factors such as the properties of the GCL, subgrade and permeant, and their exposure to solar radiation. Much research has been conducted on this topic, however, this thesis examines several significant knowledge gaps and, in particular, the performance of partially hydrated GCLs when permeated with synthetic municipal solid waste leachate. In addition, the components affecting moisture retention or loss of GCLs when subjected to simulated thermal cycles are examined for GCLs that were deconstructed by cutting of the needle-punched fibres to allow each component to be studied in isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The findings from column hydration tests performed on GCLs placed on a silty sand subgrade of varying density, compaction conditioning time, and grain size distribution due to silt aggregation are reported. For the isothermal tests, the columns were stored at 25±4°C for four weeks. For cyclic tests, the column airspace was subjected to thermal cycles up to 60°C for the fifth week.  Results suggest that silt aggregation can inhibit moisture uptake if not sufficiently broken down by compaction and a GCL that appeared to retain moisture on a typical subgrade lost moisture when placed on a subgrade characterized by high silt aggregation, low density, and long conditioning times.  A GCL with fine-grained bentonite that initially lost moisture under thermal cycles also began to retain moisture when the bentonite was ground to a powdered form. &#xD;
The swell index and cation exchange capacity of the bentonite and the hydraulic conductivity of various GCLs (in terms of bentonite granularity, geotextile type, and construction) were obtained after prehydration at 5% and 16% subgrade water contents. The lowest hydraulic conductivity was for a thermally treated GCL with powdered bentonite (4.5 x 10-11 to 8.4 x 10-12 m/s) and the highest was for a non-thermally treated GCL with coarse-grained bentonite (6.0 x 10-08 to 5.1 x 10-10 m/s). The significance of subgrade water content to GCL performance was mostly due to cation exchange and varied with the type of GCL and permeant.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>With cloud computing taking roots, Software as a Service (SaaS) is transforming the future of Information Technology (IT). SaaS is a modern pervasive software delivery model in the Cloud in which software providers host applications and provide them to consumers over the Internet. The Cloud brings operational and analytical applications together to empower software innovation. SaaS has become indispensable to the advancement of applications spanning different domains such as business, banking, and health. Although the glory of SaaS grows in popularity, an important question remains: how secure are cloud SaaS applications? Cloud SaaS applications are highly accessible, and the vast amount of sensitive data they manipulate makes them an attractive target by attackers. Nevertheless, software providers and consumers overlook critical security measures as they move to the Cloud, obliterating any gains made. &#xD;
In this thesis, we address these concerns and aim to advance security services for cloud SaaS applications. Cloud Security as a Service (SecaaS) model expands the horizon to deliver security solutions over the Internet. Motivated by the rise of the SecaaS model, this research proposes a platform introducing Information Flow Control as a Service (IFCaaS) notion. The platform embeds robust and effective IFC-based security services in different phases of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to govern end-to-end protection of cloud applications. Further, the platform is augmented by the Cloud capabilities to provide efficient and scalable security services. Data breaches due to security vulnerabilities, insecure APIs and interfaces as well as insecure computations and unauthorized access are prevalent security issues to cloud applications. Hence, this research expands on targeting two different types of applications in the Cloud: operational and analytical. It presents two different security services and builds a framework for each service. They aim at mitigating the aforesaid security issues regarding each application type. Extensive evaluation of the proposed frameworks is conducted over benchmark applications in real-world settings. The experimental results reveal that the presented frameworks provide robust, effective, and yet efficient protection for cloud applications against prevalent security breaches. They offer significant improvement in terms of detection accuracy, performance, scalability, and resource consumption.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is a condition that affects 20-40% of patients that&#xD;
undergo cataract lens replacement surgery. The design of the replacement intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
(for instance material, shape, and surface chemistry) is thought to be one of the main&#xD;
contributing factors to its development. Following the implantation of a biomaterial, there is a&#xD;
response by the immune system, activating cells and the release of various factors. The&#xD;
neutrophil is one of the first immune cells to respond and consequently has an effect on local&#xD;
cells and downstream immune cells. Also, neutrophils release a meshwork of DNA and proteins&#xD;
termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are present during the inflammatory&#xD;
response and can affect downstream immune cells (i.e. macrophages) and the local cells.&#xD;
Therefore, it is hypothesized that the lens surface chemistry and the immune response of the&#xD;
neutrophils affect the behaviour of lens epithelial cells (LECs) and macrophages in the wound&#xD;
healing response.&#xD;
In this research, NETs were isolated from an HL60 cell line and used to investigate their&#xD;
effect on macrophages (activated THP1 cells) and LECs in vitro. Cell viability and behaviour of&#xD;
these cell types were assessed to determine the effects that NETs have on local and immune cells&#xD;
involved in PCO and the wound healing response. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) disks&#xD;
were functionalized with amine or carboxyl surface groups to explore how the surface chemistry&#xD;
can affect LEC behaviour and viability in vitro. Lastly, in vivo analysis of functionalized&#xD;
PMMA beads investigated the healing response and neutrophil presence to different surface&#xD;
chemistries.&#xD;
When THP1 cells were incubated on tissue cultured polystyrene (TCPS) pre-treated with&#xD;
NETs, the NETs increased monocyte differentiation and TNF-α production when paired with&#xD;
iii&#xD;
activation with phorbol 13-myrstate 12-acetate (PMA) but there was no significant increase in&#xD;
THP1 cells differentiation when they were incubated on NETs only. It was also found that there&#xD;
were paracrine effects on the activated macrophages, leading to increased cell activation when&#xD;
THP1 cells were seeded onto TCPS at a higher cell density. When LEC were incubated on&#xD;
TCPS with pre-adsorbed NETs, the NETs decreased LEC viability but, interestingly, increased&#xD;
the production of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of epithelial to mesenchymal&#xD;
transition.&#xD;
When LEC were incubated on PMMA, the PMMA surface chemistry altered the viability&#xD;
of LECs and α-SMA production, with increased viability and α-SMA expression on aminated&#xD;
PMMA. When PMMA beads were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6J mice, there was&#xD;
increased neutrophil presence and vessel formation 7 days after injection as well as differences in&#xD;
these two measures surrounding the aminated and carboxylated PMMA. Neutrophil presence&#xD;
was increased surrounding PMMA-COOH and vessel structure formation was increased&#xD;
surrounding PMMA-NH2 at 1 day and 7 days after injection.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Mobile application (app) markets, such as Google Play Store, are immensely competitive for app developers. Receiving high star-ratings and achieving higher ranks are two important elements of success in the market. Therefore, developers continuously enhance their apps to survive and succeed in the competitive market of mobile apps. We investigate various artifacts, such as users' mobile devices and users' feedback, to identify the factors that are statistically significantly related to star-ratings and ranks. First, we determine app metrics, such as user-interface complexity, and device metrics, such as screen size, that share a significant relationship with star-ratings. Hence, developers would be able to prioritize their testing efforts with respect to certain devices. Second, we identify the topics of user-reviews (i.e.,~users' feedback) that are statistically significantly related to star-ratings. Therefore, developers can narrow down their activities to the user-reviews that are significantly related to star-ratings. Third, we propose a solution for mapping user-reviews (from Google Play Store) to issue reports (from GitHub). The proposed approach achieves a precision of $79\%$. Fourth, we identify the metrics of issue reports prioritization, such as issue report title, that share a significant relationship with star-ratings. Finally, we determine the rank trends in the market. We investigate the most important factors that are statistically significantly related to the changes in the ranks, such as release latency. The outcome of this thesis helps app developers to be more successful in the market. Having the knowledge of the factors that are statistically significantly related to star-ratings and ranks helps developers to make wiser decisions to develop a successful app.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Rockfall presents an ongoing challenge to the safe operation of transportation infrastructure across Canada, creating hazardous conditions which can result in damage to roads and railways, as well as loss of life. Conventional rockfall risk assessment frameworks involve the determination of several pieces of information relevant to hazard management including where rockfalls might come from, how frequently they will fall, and how large the falls will be. Another important piece of information is the likelihood that a given fall will reach the road or railway. One method of estimating this likelihood is the use of rockfall runout programs which simulate the 3D trajectories of volumes of falling rock. The focus of this research is the development and testing of a new rockfall simulation workflow which uses the Unity3D game engine and other complimentary 3D modelling software packages. &#xD;
&#xD;
	The simulation method developed has been applied to two different rockfall field studies from the literature, one in Ehime Japan, and one in the Port Hills region of New Zealand. Rockfall runout information collected at these sites including translational and rotational velocity, and deposition location, has been used to test the ability of our technique to simulate rockfall trajectories which are realistic compared to rockfall events on real slopes. A parametric investigation into the various inputs necessary to setup a basic rockfall simulation was also completed in order to identify any key sensitivities in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
	The workflow necessary to produce 3D rockfall simulations using Unity3D is outlined. The technique is capable of simulating the trajectories of multiple moving fragments at once and supports the use of high-resolution 3D geometry extracted from remote sensing datasets. Using this workflow five fragmental rockfall events from our field study sites in South-Central, British Columbia were simulated. The results of this work demonstrate the capability our rockfall simulation tool to model complex rockfall scenarios using high-resolution (&lt;10 cm) terrestrial laser scanning inputs.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSP) are effective secondary or tertiary treatment systems, however simple water quality models that assume the ponds behave as either completely stirred tank reactors (CSTR) or plug flow systems are commonly used in design. These models consider a WPS to be a homogeneous or a one-dimensional system, respectively, and critically neglect spatial variability in hydrodynamics that leads to poor characterization of variability in residence time, biogeochemistry and removal efficiency. Despite these shortcomings, CSTR and plug-flow models are still used for pond design because of their simplicity. This thesis explores the application of fully three-dimensional (3D) computational models capable of being applied to develop better design guidelines that will assist municipalities in meeting effluent regulations.&#xD;
Some 3D models that have been applied to WSPs, neglect complex biochemical reactions and are limited to use first order decay removal. To date, no calibrated water quality model that can simulate complex biochemical processes and is coupled with a calibrated 3D hydrodynamic model has been applied to a WSP. The present study focuses on development of a 3D water quality model of a secondary facultative pond coupled with a 3D hydrodynamic model. The calibrated water quality model was also coupled with CSTR (0D) and plug flow (1D) hydrodynamic models to show the disadvantages of these simplified and widespread assumptions in WSP modelling. &#xD;
The 3D numerical model reproduced the observed WSP effluent nutrient, dissolved oxygen, pH, and phytoplankton seasonal dynamics and quantitatively reproduced nutrient removal (5-7% error). The model was extended to investigate the effect of physical changes in pond design (inlet location, baffle configuration, wind sheltering, depth) on performance, which revealed that increasing the depth of the pond and constructing wind sheltering improved pond performance. Removing baffles had no impact on nutrient removal efficiency and relocating the inlet to the surface reduced the pond efficiency. The 0D and 1D models over-predicted effluent concentration of all substances, with the exception of pH and dissolved oxygen since the nutrients were typically sequestered near the bottom of the pond during stratified conditions. Mixing events from wind and buoyant inflows caused the model predictions to converge with consistent vertical distributions. The numerical results from this thesis provide a detailed view of biogeochemical processes in WSPs and suggest that future designs should consider the influence of 3D hydrodynamics on nutrient removal and pond performance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation investigates the emergence and transformation of national identification (ID) systems in modern Japan. I focus on colonial techniques of the ID systems in Northeast China under Japanese occupation in 1931-1945. Colonial ID techniques paid particular attention to identifying individuals and tracking their movements. Most prominently, fingerprinting, the forerunner of biometrics, was employed. Fingerprinted ID cards in occupied China were used for two primary purposes: pre-empting potential rebellion among the local Chinese, and mobilizing them as cheap labour power. Biometric ID systems became a powerful means of population control, which helped the Japanese to classify the Chinese as “desirable” or “undesirable”, and reduce them to resources, not subjects, of the Empire. As a result, the colonized population experienced the ID systems as part of overall, targeted inequality and violence against the Chinese. The worst cases of Japanese surveillance may be the Chinese dissidents who were sent to Japanese Army Unit 731, a secret facility for biochemical warfare. They were used as living ingredients for bacterial experiments and human dissection. Under colonial surveillance, Chinese bodies were classified according to their best use by the Imperial political economy and its cruel, racist science. &#xD;
My theoretical frame critically engages with biopower (Foucault), the state of exception (Agamben), and necropolitics (Mbembe) in sequence, to analyze nation-state and colonialism as a simultaneous process of modernization. Methodologically, I combined a genealogical approach, institutional ethnography and semi-structured, in-depth interviews, to learn about Chinese experiences with Japanese colonial surveillance, in my three-month fieldwork in Northeast China in 2016.&#xD;
This project makes three major contributions to Surveillance Studies and society at large. First, I demonstrate how earlier colonial ID techniques are passed on to postwar Japan, and what are the implications for electronic mass surveillance systems globally proliferated today. Second, surveillance experiences in the former colonial zones have been marginalized, and little explored, so my research helps fill in this gap in our knowledge. Lastly, my ultimate goal is to contribute to bringing ethical considerations to ID systems both for individual liberty and dignity, and to constructing more respectful and peaceful relationships among global communities.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The 170 English state lottery-loans held from 1694 to 1826 were a key method of modern longterm debt-based public finance, utilized as an important emergency contingency in times of war. This dissertation examines the neglected contribution of longterm lottery-loans to Anglo- American public finance in the long eighteenth-century. The implementation of the lottery-loan program in England had substantial political, economic, and legal consequences in domestic England, as well as in colonial America. The significant role played by the English state lottery- loans in the financial revolution has been overlooked. This thesis establishes state lotteries as integral to the post-1688 financial revolution and re-evaluates major claims of the revolution thesis in regards to public finance innovation and state stability. By the end of the eighteenth century English and American public finance would firmly embrace the liberal fiscal principles that supported public debt as an integral part of the modern state.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis consists of two main parts. The first part is composed of two essays. The first essay addresses the common movements of employment growth within and across 12 countries in the European Monetary Union after the formation of the currency union. A Bayesian dynamic factor model is used to analyse fluctuations in European employment cycles and the co-movement of sectoral employment growth across industries and countries, so as to derive the sources of these fluctuations. The findings suggest that these co-movements did not tend to increase after the introduction of the euro. The results for sectoral employment growth indicate that the idiosyncratic factor accounts for a large share of the fluctuations in employment growth.  For the variance that is not due to the idiosyncratic factor, the common-European factor accounts for the largest share of these fluctuations. &#xD;
&#xD;
The second essay uses a vector autoregressive model to estimate the effects of each country's country-specific mark-up and technology shocks. The model separately identifies each country's mark-up and technology shocks by imposing restrictions on the sign of each country's impulse responses. The study finds that these shocks are equally important,  quantitatively, for explaining the fluctuations in the relevant macroeconomic variables. &#xD;
&#xD;
The second part presents the final essay, which examines applications of a recently developed fractionally cointegrated vector autoregressive model to commodity spot and futures prices. This essay, co-authored with Morten Ørregaard Nielsen, Paresh K. Narayan, and Ke Xu, models and forecasts commodity spot and futures prices using FCVAR models to accommodate fractional integration. The findings illustrate that, on average, the fractional model generates higher profits compares to non-fractional cointegrated VAR model, especially when analysing futures markets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Introduction:  Age is associated with changes in tissue stiffness as well as higher muscle activity and an increase in the prevalence of low back pain. With increased worker age globally, and with the increased incidence of occupational sitting, it is important to understand how trunk stiffness changes with age and how this trunk stiffness is affected by sitting in older, sedentary workers.&#xD;
Methods: 37 women (aged 20-65 years) participated in the current study. Age was classified two ways: Chronological Age and Fitness Age (based on performance in fitness battery). Trunk stiffness was measured using a passive trunk flexion apparatus described in literature. Participants sat for 60 minutes at a computer workstation throughout which, at 10-minute intervals, seated spine posture, perceived low back discomfort, and muscle activity (EMG) for 6 bilateral trunk muscles were recorded. Correlations were used to assess relationships between age and stiffness, perceived discomfort, posture, and EMG variables; and ANOVAs were used to detect differences in stiffness, posture, and muscle activation between age and discomfort groups.&#xD;
Results: Trunk stiffness increased significantly with age, with the strongest of these relationships measured with Fitness Age (r = 0.517, p = 0.003). Age was not related to posture or to the magnitude of movement displayed while sitting; however, trunk stiffness was negatively correlated with seated spine motion (r = -0.435, p = 0.023). There was no relationship between age or discomfort with muscle activation patters.&#xD;
Conclusions: Age showed a positive relationship with stiffness, which was stronger when examining Fitness Age than Chronological Age.  This suggests that age-related research could be improved using measures of fitness rather than age (based on year of birth). Furthermore, the decreased movement while sitting with elevated spine stiffness suggests that altered tissue material properties could affect the manner in which people perform seated work, leaving them more susceptible to the effects of static postures including reduced blood flow, nerve impingement, and associated discomfort or injuries. Further investigation is warranted to find an easy way to monitor trunk material properties in the workplace in order to control for their effect on worker health.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Synaptic plasticity in the neocortex of mammals is influenced by various neuromodulators and metaplasticity mechanisms. These regulatory processes allow synaptic networks to operate and adjust to various behavioral states and the constantly changing inputs from the sensory environment. The neurochemical milieu created by neuromodulators is an important regulator of synaptic plasticity at the time of induction, while metaplastic-processes regulate neuronal networks based on their history of activity. This thesis investigated the effects of the neurochemical milieu and past experiences (learning) on long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses in vivo in the primary visual cortex (V1) of adult rats. Initial experiments revealed that the application of the neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) in V1 was ineffective at altering LTP. However, LTP was facilitated in the presence of a 5-HT1A-receptor antagonist. Interestingly, in juvenile rats, the same antagonist exerted the opposite effect (i.e., inhibited LTP), indicating an age-specific role of 5-HT1A receptors in the gating of V1 synaptic plasticity. Next we examined the role of visual experience (visual discrimination training) on LTP in the adult V1. Rats trained to discriminate visual cues in a Y-shaped water maze apparatus subsequently exhibited enhanced LTP compared to naive or control (visually untrained) rats. The facilitation of LTP in visually trained rats was reversed by an antagonist of GluN2B subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in V1. Consequently, we examined potential changes in NMDAR functioning in rats trained in the visual discrimination task. Patch clamp recordings of principal neurons in V1 revealed that behavioral training enhanced GluN2B-mediated NMDAR conductance. Finally, we examined the behavioral consequences of blocking GluN2B receptors during visual discrimination training, using a sequential task that involved two distinct rounds of training (involving different sets of visual cues). Results of these experiments showed that systemic GluN2B antagonism during the second round of visual training impaired task&#xD;
acquisition relative to controls. Together, the experiments in this thesis highlight the importance of neuromodulation and metaplasticity in V1 for the gating of LTP, one of the principal mechanisms of learning and memory storage in the cortex of mammalian species.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, occurring frequently in the medial compartment of the knee. As the onset and progression of medial knee OA has been associated with abnormal and excessive loading of the joint, non-invasive treatment options often focus on joint load reduction to slow the progression of the disease. However, a need persists for further development of methods for analysing the effectiveness of existing and potential treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Unloader braces are one common form of treatment for knee OA, which primarily function by applying a moment at the knee to reduce loading and increase joint separation in the medial compartment. We developed a novel method based on measuring brace deflection using motion capture techniques to estimate the mechanical effect of valgus braces. Brace moments computed using the motion capture method for three subjects during static and walking trials were validated using strain gauge instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
A second, promising treatment option we explored was biofeedback-assisted gait retraining, which uses live feedback to guide subjects towards an optimal and novel gait pattern that lessens medial compartment loads. We developed a biofeedback system that uses real-time kinematic and kinetic input measures to provide a live estimate of knee joint loading using a statistical regression model. By using a large group of training subjects with a variety of gait styles to generate the regression model, the system that was developed can provide feedback of an estimate of the joint contact forces in the knee for a variety of gait patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
In summary, we developed (1) a method for measuring the mechanical effect of valgus bracing and (2) a biofeedback system that can be used in gait retraining to provide live feedback of an estimate of knee joint loads. These developments will provide us with the ability to further investigate the effectiveness of these non-invasive strategies for treating medial knee osteoarthritis. In doing so, we will be able to continue developing these treatment options towards providing more pain relief and improvements in function for a larger group of individuals with knee OA, potentially delaying or preventing the need for surgical interventions.</dcterms:abstract>
