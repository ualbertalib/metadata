   <description>We use Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to construct dynamical models for the spiral galaxy NGC 6503. The constraints include surface brightness profiles which display a Freeman Type II structure; HI and ionized gas rotation curves; the stellar rotation, which is nearly coincident with the ionized gas curve; and the line of sight stellar dispersion, which displays a $\sigma-$drop at the centre. The galaxy models consist of a S\'{e}rsic bulge, an exponential disc with an optional inner truncation and a cosmologically motivated dark halo. The Bayesian/MCMC technique yields the joint posterior probability distribution function for the input parameters, allowing constraints on model parameters such as the halo cusp strength, structural parameters for the disc and bulge, and mass-to-light ratios. We examine several interpretations of the data: the Type II surface brightness profile may be due to dust extinction, to an inner truncated disc or to a ring of bright stars; and we test separate fits to the gas and stellar rotation curves to determine if the gas traces the gravitational potential. We test each of these scenarios for bar stability, ruling out dust extinction. We also find that the gas cannot trace the gravitational potential, as the asymmetric drift is then too large to reproduce the stellar rotation. The disc is well fit by an inner-truncated profile, but the possibility of ring formation by a bar to reproduce the Type II profile is also a realistic model. We further find that the halo must have a cuspy profile with $\gamma \gtrsim 1$; the bulge has a lower $M/L$ than the disc, suggesting a star forming component in the centre of the galaxy; and the bulge, as expected for this late type galaxy, has a low S\'{e}rsic index with $n_b\sim1-2$, suggesting a formation history dominated by secular evolution.</description>

   <description>Two driving forces behind high-performance clusters are the availability of modern interconnects and the advent of multi-core systems. As multi-core clusters become commonplace, where each core will run at least one process with multiple intra-node and inter-node connections to several other processes, there will be immense pressure on the interconnection network and its communication system software. &#xd;
     Many parallel scientific applications use Message Passing Interface (MPI) collective communications intensively. Therefore, efficient and scalable implementation of MPI collective operations is critical to the performance of applications running on clusters. In this dissertation, I propose and evaluate a number of efficient collective communication algorithms that utilize the modern features of Quadrics and InfiniBand interconnects as well as the availability of multiple cores on emerging clusters. &#xd;
     To overcome bandwidth limitations and to enhance fault tolerance, using multiple independent networks known as multi-rail networks is very promising. Quadrics multi-rail QsNetII network is constructed using multiple network interface cards (NICs) per node, where each NIC is connected to a rail.  I design and evaluate a number of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) based multi-port collective operations on multi-rail QsNetII network. I also extend the gather and allgather algorithms to be shared memory aware for small to medium messages. The algorithms prove to be much more efficient than the native Quadrics MPI implementation.&#xd;
     ConnectX is the newest generation of InfiniBand host channel adapters from Mellanox Technologies. I provide evidence that ConnectX achieves scalable performance for simultaneous communication over multiple connections. Utilizing this ability of ConnectX cards, I propose a number of RDMA based multi-connection and multi-core aware allgather algorithms at the MPI level. My algorithms are devised to target different message sizes, and the performance results show that they outperform the native MVAPICH implementation.&#xd;
     Recent studies show that MPI processes in real applications could arrive at an MPI collective operation at different times. This imbalanced process arrival pattern can significantly affect the performance of the collective communication operation. Therefore, design and efficient implementation of collectives under different process arrival patterns is critical to the performance of scientific applications running on modern clusters. I propose novel RDMA-based process arrival pattern aware alltoall and allgather for different message sizes over InfiniBand clusters. I also extend the algorithms to be shared memory aware for small to medium messages under process arrival patterns.  The performance results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the native MVAPICH implementation as well as other non-process arrival pattern aware algorithms when processes arrive at different times.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores a pedagogical enquiry that has transformed the way I think and the way I teach. I used a variety of critical and theatre theories to frame my enquiry and for four years consecutively, visited a non-government organization (NGO) in India that uses theatre as an alternate pedagogical tool. I reflected upon the methodological differences between the theatre practices of the NGO and my practices. I then turned my enquiry inward to consider how my learning informed my teaching practices. I then created an alternate theatre project for some students in the American Midwest with Ashok, an artist from India. Ashok spent twelve days training the students in what I refer to as action theatre, while I coordinated, observed and reflected. This theatre is a form of social activism; it is designed to provide a forum for the students to express their socio-political views and raise individual and collective social awareness in the process. After the training period, the students presented a play using these theatre methods. They engaged in discussion with their audience directly after their play. After the training period, Ashok returned to India. He took on the role of mentor and informant to my ongoing enquiry. My enquiry then shifted from an introspective one to a practical one. Some of the students who wished to do so continued creating plays in this fashion. I took over the leadership of the group at their school. A new theatre troupe was created and I used the concepts learned at the NGO and from Ashok in an American suburban context. The theatre troupe created plays for three years. When I moved back to Canada, the troupe stopped its operations. Some students in the group continued activist work using art as a medium by finding other opportunities. I turned my enquiry inward once again to reflect upon how these processes have changed the way I think and the way I teach.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we develop a feedback-invariant theory of local controllability for affine distributions.  We begin by developing an unexplored notion in control theory that we call proper small-time local controllability (PSTLC).  The notion of PSTLC is developed for an abstraction of the well-known notion of a control-affine system, which we call an affine system.  Associated to every affine system is an affine distribution, an adaptation of the notion of a distribution.  Roughly speaking, an affine distribution is PSTLC if the local behaviour of every affine system that locally approximates the affine distribution is locally controllable in the standard sense.  We prove that, under a regularity condition, the PSTLC property can be characterized by studying control-affine systems.&#xd;
&#xd;
The main object that we use to study PSTLC is a cone of high-order tangent vectors, or variations, and these are defined using the vector fields of the affine system.  To better understand these variations, we study how they depend on the jets of the vector fields by studying the Taylor expansion of a composition of flows.  Some connections are made between labeled rooted trees and the coefficients appearing in the Taylor expansion of a composition of flows.  Also, a relation between variations and the formal Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula is established.  &#xd;
&#xd;
After deriving some algebraic properties of variations, we define a variational cone for an affine system and relate it to the local controllability problem.  We then study the notion of neutralizable variations and give a method for constructing subspaces of variations.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, using the tools developed to study variations, we consider two important classes of systems: driftless and homogeneous systems.  For both classes, we are able to characterize the PSTLC property.</description>

   <description>The current program of research investigated factors that influence students’ perceptions of everyday moral violations, as well as their own inclinations to engage in immoral behaviours.  In Experiment 1, I demonstrated that participants’ evaluations of a hypothetical student who contemplated plagiarizing an assignment depended on both the choice that was ultimately made and the length of time spent deliberating about it (cf., Tetlock et al., 2000).  Specifically, when participants were informed that the student ultimately elected to refrain from cheating, the length of time that this individual spent considering the decision had no impact on their subsequent behavioural or character evaluations.  However, when participants were informed that the student had succumbed to the temptation to cheat, they evaluated the individual more harshly if the decision to cheat had been made after a period of deliberation than if the decision had been made blithely, without any forethought.  Experiment 2 extended this program of research by showing that stable and transient variations in construal level interact to influence participants’ perceptions of students who engage in acts of plagiarism.  Specifically, participants with low levels of personal agency evaluated a hypothetical student who had plagiarized an assignment relatively charitably, regardless of how they were prompted to construe the situation.  Furthermore, these participants felt a greater affinity for the student after being induced to construe the student’s actions in low-level terms.  On the other hand, participants with high levels of personal agency who were induced to construe the student’s actions in high-level terms were less positive in their evaluations, and also felt less of an affinity for the student.   Experiment 3 assessed the extent to which stable and transient variations in construal level interact to predict actual cheating behaviour during an evaluative task.  The results of this investigation revealed that priming participants with low levels of personal agency to adopt high-level construals lessened the incidence of cheating among members of this group.  In sum, the results associated with the current program of research suggest that transient shifts in construal level interact with stable levels of personal agency to influence students’ perceptions of peers who engage in academic dishonesty.  Furthermore, they provide evidence that these two factors play a role in the extent to which students behave dishonestly in evaluative settings themselves.  Potential applications that could be derived from the current findings and possible avenues for future research are discussed.</description>

   <description>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children under&#xd;
the age of 15. At present, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decisions are made&#xd;
based upon blood and bone marrow laboratory testing. With advances in microarray&#xd;
technology it is becoming more feasible to perform genetic assessment of individual&#xd;
patients as well. We used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on Illumina SNP,&#xd;
Affymetrix and cDNA gene-expression data and performed aggressive attribute se-&#xd;
lection using random forests to reduce the number of attributes to a manageable&#xd;
size. We then explored clustering and prediction of patient-specific properties such&#xd;
as disease sub-classification, and especially clinical outcome. We determined that&#xd;
integrating multiple types of data can provide more meaningful information than&#xd;
individual datasets, if combined properly. This method is able to capture the cor-&#xd;
relation between the attributes. The most striking result is an apparent connection&#xd;
between genetic background and patient mortality under existing treatment regimes.&#xd;
We find that we can cluster well using the mortality label of the patients. Also, using&#xd;
a Support Vector Machine (SVM) we can predict clinical outcome with high accu-racy. This thesis will discuss the data-mining methods used and their application to&#xd;
biomedical research, as well as our results and how this will affect the diagnosis and&#xd;
treatment of ALL in the future.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-14 11:03:29.635</description>
   <description>Although most governments sell their bonds through a share auction, little is known about behaviour of bidders in these auctions. This thesis analyzes the literature&#xd;
on government securities auctions, focusing primarily on structural empirical estimation.&#xd;
Additionally, it examines bidders behaviour in Colombian government bond auctions during 2007, including the additional sale done after the auction.&#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis summarizes the different structural methodologies that have been developed to determine what the best auction for a particular case is. It discusses the&#xd;
advantages and disadvantages of each methodology and explores assumptions and robustness when confronted with data. To make these comparisons more straightforward,&#xd;
a unified notation is introduced and several methods are applied to the same auctions,&#xd;
uniform price auctions conducted by the government of Colombia.</description>

   <description>On the basis of the well-known preservative properties of Sphagnum moss, a potential opportunity to use moss polysaccharides (Sphagnan) in art conservation was tested. Polysaccharides were extracted from the moss (S. palustre spp.) in the amount of 4.1% of the Sphagnum plant dry weight. All lignocelluloses were removed from this extract as a result of the treatment of the moss cellulose with sodium chlorite. The extracted polysaccharide possessed a strong acidic reaction (pH 2.8) and was soluble in water and organic solvents. The extract was tested on laboratory bacterial cultures by the disk-diffusion method. The antibacterial effect was demonstrated for E. coli and P. aeruginosa (both gram-negative) while Staphylococcus aurelus (gram-positive) was shown to be insensitive to Sphagnum polysaccharides. The antifungal effect of Sphagnum extract was tested by the disk-diffusion method on the spores of seventeen fungal species. These fungi were isolated from ethnographic museum objects and from archaeological objects excavated in the Arctic. Twelve of these isolates appeared susceptible to the extract. The inhibiting effect of the extract was also tested by the modified broth-dilution method on the most typical isolate (Aspergillus spp.). In this experiment, in one ml of the nutritious broth, 40µl of 3% solution of polysaccharides in water killed 10,000 fungal spores in 6 hours. The inhibiting effect was not connected to the acidity or osmotic effect of Sphagnum polysaccharides. As an example of the application of Sphagnum polysaccharides in art conservation, they were added as preservative agents to conservation waxes. After three weeks of exposure of microcrystalline wax to test fungi (Aspergillus spp.), 44% of wax was consumed. When, however, ~ 0.1% (w/w) of Sphagnum extract was mixed with wax, the weight loss of wax was only 4% in the same time interval. On the basis of this study it was concluded that Sphagnum moss and Sphagnum products can be recommended for use in art conservation as antifungal agents.</description>

   <description>Children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder differ on neuropsychological tasks and measures of eye movement control. M.Sc. Thesis, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, January 2010.&#xd;
&#xd;
Background: Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) accounts for the majority of diagnoses associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.  Unfortunately, ARND frequently poses a significant clinical challenge as these patients lack the visible physical characteristics associated with alcohol teratogenicity.  Moreover, the cognitive and behavioural disabilities are complex and overlap with those of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Furthermore, co-morbid ADHD is prevalent in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.  While early and accurate diagnosis provides the best prognosis for those affected, there is a lack of tools for differential diagnosis between these two disorders.  The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that children with ARND exhibit different performance from children with ADHD on computer-based neuropsychological tests and eye movement tasks.  Methods: Our study group was composed of 42 children with ARND and 31 children with ADHD aged 8-15 years, male and female.  Children completed four tasks selected from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB®) that provided measures of attention, planning, strategy and spatial working memory.  Subjects also performed pro- and anti-saccade tasks, and eye movements were recorded using a mobile eye-tracking system.  Results: Children with ARND demonstrated elevated decision times on a visual matching test of attention and longer response times on a task of spatial working memory, although the two groups had similar errors scores.  Also, compared to children with ADHD, children with ARND had greater anticipatory errors in both the pro- and anti-saccade tasks.  Conclusion: This study demonstrates that there are measurable differences in executive function and eye movement control between children with ARND or ADHD.  Greater deficits in visuospatial processing in ARND may underlie these differences.  These findings demonstrate that the neurobehavioural phenotypes of children with ARND or ADHD have distinct features, which may be accounted for by differences in the patterns of brain injury underlying these two disorders.</description>

   <description>Wildfire is an ecological disturbance that plays an important role in ecosystem function and interacts with climate and vegetation, relationships that may be altered by ongoing climate change.  Insights from paleoecology can provide context for environmental change, including the natural range of variability.  Here, the Holocene fire history of a small watershed in eastern Ontario, Canada is reconstructed.  A high-resolution macroscopic charcoal series was derived from the lacustrine sediment of Mud Lake, north of Gananoque, Ontario and within the Frontenac Arch.  Analysis of the charcoal record estimates a mean fire-return-interval (FRI) of 175 yr/fire around Mud Lake during the Holocene, and similar mean FRIs during different time periods indicates that it has been a largely stationary fire regime.  The analysis suggests that fire activity may have recently increased, but a lack of documentary fire records for the area leaves this uncertain.  There is no indication that humans have significantly impacted the fire regime, though anthropogenic ignition could have played a role in the area’s recent fires.  The fire regime around Mud Lake does not appear to have shifted in association with major changes in regional vegetation.  Fire activity does correlate with some paleoclimate trends.  The estimated fire frequency decreased around 7500 yr BP, when wetter summers became more common in eastern Canada, and a recent increase in fire frequency would parallel with more frequent incursions of dry and cool air masses into the region.  During other parts of the record, however, the fire activity does not appear to reflect the major climate impacts.  The fire history of Mud Lake is relevant to the ecological management of eastern Ontario’s St. Lawrence Islands National Park and its restoration of a rare, fire-dependent tree species, the pitch pine.  Though predictions vary, this area’s climate may become more favorable to fire through an increase in temperature and a decrease in summer precipitation.  By providing information about the natural variability of fire activity in eastern Ontario, this research can be applied towards setting appropriate management goals during future environmental change.</description>

   <title>The Impact of Clinical Factors and Sociodemographic Variables on Health-Related Quality of Life in Venous Leg Ulceration</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-16 13:11:38.045</description>
   <description>Leg ulceration negatively affects quality of life (QOL). The relationship between important clinical attributes such as ulcer severity, pain and health related quality of life (HRQL) is poorly understood. The Wilson and Cleary model of Health Related Quality of Life (WC model) is a guiding framework that links clinical measures to QOL.&#xd;
Thesis Objectives: I describe the relationship between ulcer severity, comorbidity, etiology and pain and HRQL.&#xd;
Methods: An integrative mixed-methods approach was used: a systematic review of studies that examined the relationship between clinical variables and HRQL or QOL as outlined in the WC model (n=22); a review of studies (n=11) that compared the HRQL of persons with leg ulcers to population normative scores; and, an analysis of the relationship between clinical factors and HRQL in a cohort of 564 persons with venous leg ulcers drawn from two randomized control trials.&#xd;
Results: There is empirical support for the causal linkages between disease severity, symptoms, function, health perception and QOL that comprise the causal pathway as outlined in the WC model. Venous ulcers are associated with a poor quality of life, and numerous aspects of functioning are impaired, in particular physical function. In 564 individuals with venous ulcers, pain was present in 78.8%. Those younger than 65 years were 1.5 times more likely to be in the higher pain group compared to those 65 and older. Physical HRQL was significantly impaired. Predictors of poor physical HRQL included venous-arterial ulcers, a more severe ulcer, arthritis and a higher level of pain. Poor mental HRQL was associated with the younger age group, a comorbid condition and a higher level of pain. Increasing ulcer duration negatively affected mental state, but the findings were of borderline significance.&#xd;
Conclusion: The WC model is a clinically useful framework to select variables to represent HRQL and to base hypotheses about causal associations between clinical variables and QOL. Future research should focus on specifying the measurement models to represent disease severity, symptom status and functional status. Clinically the WC model is a useful bedside heuristic to explore the impact on leg ulceration on daily life and wellbeing.</description>

   <description>The intellectual history of the Canadian Army from 1946 to 1995 can be traced through the curriculum utilized by the Canadian Army Staff College and the Canadian Forces College to educate the Canadian Army staff officer in conducting warfare within theatres of war. This body of knowledge was analogous to what today comprises the operational level of war. It is a structured vision of conducting conflict that was reaffirmed and sustained by institutional memory created in the crucible of the Second World War and traces its antecedents to the military operations of the Napoleonic Age.  These ideas were preserved almost unchanged throughout the Cold War until the introduction of operational art in the late 1980s, as a result of United States influence. The ability of the Canadian Army to maintain this professional knowledge, as a coherent, unchanging whole throughout a period buffeted by social and political change indicates the separateness of the military profession within Canada. This arose from the absence of consistent and durable political guidance during the immediate post war era. As a result the use of the Canadian military as an instrument of national power became disjointed. By default, the unifying factor in Canadian defence activities was maintaining relevance within alliances, particularly in supporting the Pax Americana. This influence can be discerned by applying theories of knowledge transmission and change to the Cold War curriculum used to educate Canadian Army staff officers.</description>

   <title>RET receptor activation targets expression of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-11</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Pathology &amp; Molecular Medicine) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-20 12:37:55.613</description>
   <description>The RET receptor has diverse roles in development and disease, modulating proliferation, survival, and migration of cells. Ligand-independent constitutively active forms of RET can lead to thyroid neoplasia. Missense mutations are causative agents in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), featuring medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), whereas RET fusion oncoproteins generated by gene rearrangements are associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In gene expression screens, interleukin-11 was identified as a RET-responsive gene. We sought to characterize the expression of IL-11 in response to activation of the RET receptor, and determine how IL-11 might contribute to RET-mediated cell behaviours. Analysis of HEK293 cells expressing RET, by qRT-PCR and ELISA, established that activation of wild-type RET, MEN 2- and PTC-associated RET upregulated IL-11 transcription and secretion. RET induction of IL-11 gene expression appears to be affected directly and indirectly, and is dependent on activation of the RAS/ERK1/2 signalling pathway. Examination of thyroid carcinoma cell lines with activated RET indicated that PTC-derived TPC-1 cells express IL-11. Addition of exogenous IL-11 stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in thyroid cancer cell lines, though IL-11 did not affect the proliferation, adhesion, or survival against anoikis in the cells. Immunohistochemical analyses of human thyroid tissues revealed that RET, IL-11, and IL-11Rα are expressed in thyroid cells of the normal thyroid, MTC and PTC.  Expression of the three molecules was also detected in immune cell infiltrates in PTC.  Although we were unable to confirm that the autocrine IL-11 stimulation might affect the behaviour of thyroid cancer cells, it is likely that IL-11 exerts paracrine immunomodulatory effects, and acts downstream of RET in normal biological processes.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the associations between sleep problems, sleep hygiene and ADHD symptoms in young adults. The first chapter of this dissertation provides an overview of ADHD in adulthood, and a review of the literature that has associated ADHD and sleep problems. This chapter also highlights the need to develop a valid and reliable instrument to assess sleep hygiene. The second chapter presents a manuscript which outlines the development of a new self-report measure of sleep hygiene in young adults. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to develop two sleep hygiene scales (substance abuse and poor sleep scheduling) and overall results indicated that the new instrument has sound psychometric properties, as well as good construct and convergent validity. The third chapter presents a manuscript which outlines two empirical studies that examined the associations between sleep problems, sleep hygiene and ADHD symptoms in young adults. Results indicated that young adults with elevated ADHD symptoms reported more sleep problems (specifically insomnia and sleepiness) and poorer sleep hygiene (specifically substance abuse and poor sleep scheduling) than young adults without elevated ADHD symptoms. Young adults with ADHD also reported more sleep problems even after accounting for substance abuse and poor sleep scheduling, suggesting that poor sleep hygiene is not responsible for the sleep problems of young adults with ADHD. The fourth chapter presents a summary of the research findings, as well as a discussion of the methodological limitations and directions for future research.</description>

   <description>In this work we address the problem of object recognition and localization from&#xd;
sparse range data. The method is based upon comparing the 7-D error surfaces of objects in various poses, which result from the registration error function between two convolved surfaces. The objects and their pose values are encoded by a small set of feature vectors extracted from the minima of the error surfaces. The problem of object recognition is thus reduced to comparing these feature vectors to find the corresponding error surfaces between the runtime data and a preprocessed database.&#xd;
&#xd;
Specifically, we present a new approach to the problems of pose determination, object recognition and object class recognition. The algorithm has been implemented and  tested on both simulated and real data. The experimental results demonstrate the technique to be both effective and efficient, executing at 122 frames per second on standard hardware and with recognition rates exceeding 97% for a database of 60 objects. The performance of the proposed potential well space embedding (PWSE) approach on large size databases was also evaluated on the Princeton Shape Bench-&#xd;
mark containing 1,814 objects. In experiments of object class recognition with the Princeton Shape Benchmark, PWSE is able to provide better classification rates than&#xd;
the previous methods in terms of nearest neighbour classification. In addition, PWSE&#xd;
is shown to (i) operate with very sparse data, e.g., comprising only hundreds of points per image, and (ii) is robust to measurement error and outliers.</description>

   <description>I tested a prevalent assumption in glucocorticoid research that states that each species has a dominant glucocorticoid, and cortisol and corticosterone are interchangeable steroids. A comprehensive analysis of historical and current data failed to support this assumption and revealed evidence of drift away from exploration of cortisol and corticosterone as dual, important adrenal products to the exclusive quantification of one, dominant glucocorticoid. Originating approximately 30 years ago, the dominant glucocorticoid/ interchangeability assumption is now portrayed in textbook images used to represent adrenal steroid biosynthesis and is widespread throughout empirical research. Less than 1% of over 50,000 published papers relating to the glucocorticoids have considered the potential for independence in glucocorticoid signaling by quantifying both cortisol and corticosterone within a sample. A dispersed literature shows independent regulation of cortisol and corticosterone, extensive inter-species variation in glucocorticoid concentrations and cortisol: corticosterone ratios and adrenal synthesis of the non-dominant glucocorticoid during early development. We hypothesize that there is a functional duality in glucocorticoid signaling and use mass spectrometry to explore the glucocorticoid profile of the full-term human (n = 125) and guinea pig (n = 28) fetus (both cortisol-dominant species). The sample preparation method yielded poor steroid recoveries (~ 4-28%), which made quantification by mass spectrometry challenging, but in both species corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in fetal blood compared to umbilical venous or umbilical mixed blood (p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting fetal corticosterone enrichment. Within an individual, cortisol was not an accurate predictor of corticosterone for either species (human, r = 0.001, p > 0.05; guinea pig, r = 0.14, p > 0.05) and our data suggests independent glucocorticoid responses; in humans, cortisol was significantly higher in vaginal deliveries relative to elective Caesarian sections (p &lt; 0.0001) but corticosterone was unaffected. Guinea pig fetal corticosterone was not affected by daily maternal stress during gestation but cortisol was significantly lower in stressed fetuses (p &lt; 0.05). While these preliminary data require further investigation, we conclude that fetuses from the human and guinea pig actively secrete the non-dominant glucocorticoid in late gestation and suggest that there is a functional duality in glucocorticoid signaling.</description>

   <description>The subject of this dissertation is the calculation and visualization of intraoperative measurement uncertainty in computer-assisted surgical procedures. Error is the difference between the observed or measured value and the true value (called ground-truth) of a quantity. Uncertainty is the unknown difference between the measured and true values, and exists in the absence of knowledge of ground truth.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
If one has an algorithm for computing the ground truth then one can get an accurate estimate of error. However, in computer-assisted surgery, the ground truth is often unknown.  The introduction of error to surgical procedures is inevitable: it cannot be avoided by simply taking very careful measurements, providing more accurate algorithms, or by improving instrument calibration. One can only reduce errors as much as reasonably possible, calculate a reliable estimate of the uncertainty, and provide a meaningful way to convey this uncertainty information to clinicians. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In this dissertation, I demonstrate that the visualization of registration uncertainty improves surgical navigation and that real-time computation of intraoperative measurement uncertainty is possible. In an extensive user study of surgeons and surgical residents, I compare methods of visualizing intraoperative uncertainty and determine that there are several methods of effectively conveying uncertainty in surgical navigation.</description>

   <description>Transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels are a class of steels with exceptional formability properties, due mainly to the presence of meta-stable retained austenite which transforms to martensite under loading, locally hardening the steel.  The volume fraction and mechanical stability of the retained austenite play an important role in producing the high formabilities of TRIP steels.  In this thesis, two separate morphologies of retained austenite, equiaxed versus lamellar, have been produced through thermo-mechanical processing of a single common TRIP steel chemistry.  The sheet formability characteristics of these two microstructures were examined, with varying volume fractions of retained austenite, through uniaxial tensile and in-plane plane-strain (IPPS) testing.&#xd;
&#xd;
It was found that higher levels of retained austenite produced better formability properties for both microstructures and strain paths.  In uniaxial tension it was seen that the the lamellar microstructure attained higher strains at maximum load, and exhibited more sustained instantaneous n values than the equiaxed structure, despite having a lower volume fraction of retained austenite.&#xd;
&#xd;
IPPS testing was performed using an optical measurement of local strain and a comparative forming limit based on differences in strain rate between a developing neck and the surrounding material.  It was found that the lamellar microstructure performed better than the equiaxed microstructure for this strain path, achieving higher strains before reaching the comparative forming limit.</description>

   <title>Moment Connections of Concrete-Filled Fibre Reinforced Polymer Tubes to Reinforced Concrete Footings</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-28 16:09:40.606</description>
   <description>Fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) are increasingly being accepted in structural engineering applications.  One promising system involves the use of concrete-filled FRP tubes (CFFTs) as bridge piers, columns or piles.  While CFFT members have been extensively studied under various loading conditions, very little attention has been given to their connections to other structural components such as footings and beams.  This study explores two different moment connections for CFFT members, using 13 medium-scale specimens and seven ancillary tests.&#xd;
The first connection involves embedment of the FRP tube into the concrete foundations during casting.  Five-219 mm diameter (D) precast CFFTs were embedded into 500x500x500 mm concrete foundation each, at different embedment lengths ranging from 0.3D to 1.5D and tested in flexure as cantilevers with 1100 mm spans.  The study showed that the optimal embedment length was 0.73D.  This was essentially the minimum embedment length necessary to produce tension failure of the CFFT member outside the footing, rather than premature bond failure that would otherwise occur at lower loads.  Additionally, six push-through tests were conducted on CFFT stubs embedded into footings.  The average bond strength was found to be 0.75 MPa.&#xd;
The second connection involved adhesive bonding of hollow FRP tubes to short reinforced concrete circular stubs protruding from concrete footings. The remainder of the tube was then filled with concrete, without the need for shoring.  Four-169 mm diameter FRP tubes were first adhesively bonded onto footings with heavily steel-reinforced concrete stubs varying in length from 0.5D to 2.0D, and tested as cantilevers with 1300 mm spans. The optimal bond length that would lead to flexural failure of the tube just outside the stub, rather than bond failure, was about 1.1D.  Based on this, two additional specimens with 1.5D stubs having varying steel reinforcement ratio (ρ) in the stubs were tested. It was shown that the optimal ρ was 2.5%.  Finally, the effect of low cycle reversed bending fatigue was studied using two additional specimens, including one with a sustained axial load of 15-19% of the CFFT axial capacity.  Remarkable levels of ductility associated with the plastic hinge forming in the stub were observed.</description>

   <title>To the Global Village and Back: International Indigenous Rights and Domestic Change in Nicaragua and Ecuador</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-26 01:37:46.203</description>
   <description>International indigenous rights represent a special category of human rights, offering a potent tool in the community-based defense of indigenous lands and livelihoods. State sovereignty has, however, historically been used to trump indigenous claims.  New transnational advocacy networks have formed to promote and support indigenous rights claims in international law. In the Americas, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (CIDH) has assumed a lead role in issuing important rulings that validate new international norms for indigenous rights. The challenge, identified in this thesis, is the implementation of these rulings through effective domestic policy.  &#xd;
&#xd;
	To realize effective implementation of international rights, domestic political realties cannot be sidestepped or ignored. This thesis focuses on indigenous property rights in the Americas. These rights are always contentious. Natural resources like oil, minerals and timber attract many powerful interests. There is an urgent need for a careful and systematic investigation into domestic level variables that can either hinder or help norm implementation. &#xd;
&#xd;
	Even universal human rights present a challenge for state compliance. A number of scholars have explored the problem of human rights norm implementation and identified a number of important variables. These include the domestic structural context, norm salience, material constraints and international influences. This thesis builds on Thomas Risse and Kathryn Sikkink’s Spiral Model of Human Rights Change (1999) by applying it to the specific case of indigenous rights to property in a comparative case study. Beginning with two important IACHR rulings for indigenous property rights, the Sarayaku case in the oil-rich Ecuadorian Amazon and the Awas Tingni case in the mahogany forests of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, the Spiral Model is used to highlight key variables that can impact the process of implementation at the level of the state.</description>

   <description>As part of Parks Canada’s management initiatives, St. Lawrence Islands National Park (SLINP) funded this study to learn more about the natural local fire regime, learn about the risks associated with fire in a changing climate scenario, and to aid in protection efforts of the fire-dependent species Pinus rigida (pitch pine), which is listed provincially as a species at risk.  The study site selected was Little Black Lake (44º 32'45.20" N, 76 º 03'12.06” W), which is ideal because of its small size and isolated watershed.  A 4.5 m Livingston-piston core and a 0.5 m Glew gravity core were extracted from the lake basin.  Charcoal macrofossils >125 µm were quantified at 0.5 cm intervals to produce a high-resolution (14 years) fire record.  A chronology was created for each of the two cores together using a combination of 13 14C dates and 20 210Pb dates to complete a record spanning from 2008 to >11000 Cal yrs BP.  In general, the fire regime appears to be non-stationary with overall low CHAR (charcoal particles per cm2 of sediment per year) throughout the Holocene.  The mean fire return interval for the entire record was on the century scale, at 244 years.  The early- and mid-Holocene show low CHAR and few peaks during a period dominated by spruce and pine.  Contrastingly, the late Holocene shows an increase in CHAR and peaks during hardwood dominance, which may be due to a change in fuel, as suggested by charcoal morphotypes.  A detailed look at the Late Holocene through an analysis of the Glew gravity core, shows a shorter mean fire interval.  Comparisons of the Little Black Lake fire record with other vegetation and charcoal records from this region indicate interactions between climate and changing fuel sources may be explanations for the non-stationarity of the fire regime.  Management steps for St. Lawrence Islands National Park could include continuing small, isolated and infrequent burns and continued monitoring of local Pitch Pine populations provided spatial and temporal heterogeneity are taken into account.</description>

   <description>This dissertation critically interrogates the assumptions, agendas and relations of power that shaped Bill C-45, An Act to Amend the Criminal Code (criminal liability of organizations), revisions to the Criminal Code of Canada aimed at strengthening corporate criminal liability. Colloquially referred to as the Westray bill, the legislation was passed in the fall of 2003 in response to the deaths of twenty-six workers at the Westray mine in 1992, a disaster caused by unsafe and illegal working conditions. &#xd;
Using twenty-three semi-structured interviews with individuals with knowledge and insight into the evolution of Canada’s corporate criminal liability legislation, and transcripts from Canada’s Parliament regarding the enactment of this law, the dissertation critically explores the constitution of corporate criminal liability – the factors that produce legal categorizations of corporate harm and wrongdoing. Of particular interest are the official discourses that shaped conceptualizations of corporate crime and corporate criminal liability and how these discourses correspond to the broader social-political-economic context. Drawing theoretical inspiration from Foucauldian and neo-Marxist (Althusserian) literatures, the dissertation argues that particular legal, economic and cultural discourses shaped, but did not determine, corporate criminal liability in Canada. In turn, these discourses are constitutive of class struggles over the role of the corporate form in extracting surplus labour and accumulating capital, the results of which helped stabilize, reproduce and transform the class-based capitalist social formation.&#xd;
Overall, the dissertation suggests that the assumptions that animated Canada’s corporate criminal liability legislation and the meanings inscribed in its provisions throw serious doubt on its ability to hold corporations legally accountable for their harmful, anti-social acts. There is little reason to believe that the Westray bill will produce a crackdown on safety crimes, or seriously challenge corporations to address workplace injuries and death. While it will hold some corporations and corporate actors accountable – and thus far it has been the smallest and weakest – the primary causes of workplace injury and death (e.g., the tension between profit maximization and the costs of safety and the relative worth of workers/employees versus owners and investors) will continue.</description>

   <description>Microorganisms have developed ways to preserve cellular functions under low temperature conditions using a variety of biochemical adaptations including the modification of ice formation. In order to conduct a limited survey of microbial ice-associating strategies, a bacterial community associated with frost-exposed leaves was assessed by the construction of a 16S rDNA library, followed by the characterization of some isolates. Fifteen different species were identified based on their 16S rDNA. Among these, Pseudomonas syringae J6 had ice nucleation activity (INA), which promoted ice formation close to 0ºC, whereas Erwinia billingiae, Flavobacterium sp. and Sphingobacterium kitahiroshimense inhibited the recrystallization of small ice crystals at temperatures close to melting. The Erwinia billingiae isolate showed adhesive and swarming behaviour, which can be associated with biofilm formation. Visualization using negative staining, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of flagella in addition to the presence of slimy biofilm architecture in these Erwina billingiae cultures. Subsequent purification of the  extracellular polymeric substance followed by mass spectrometry allowed the identification of a putative outer membrane protein A, which may be involved in the protection of this bacterium to freeze-thaw cycles. &#xd;
To further explore bacterial ice nucleation activity, an ice nucleation protein was cloned from Pseudomonas borealis, a bacterium originating from tundra soil, using degenerative PCR and chromosome walking. The sequence of the putative ice nucleation protein gene (inaPb) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its identification was confirmed in the recombinant cells. Although the INPPb was more divergent than other plant-related bacterial INPs, it retained the highly conserved, repetitive core region. The protein may fold so that it has two flat faces, one for protein-protein interactions and the other for ice binding. Expression of the INPPb coding region fused to jelly fish green fluorescent protein showed a temperature-dependent polarized distribution of the recombinant protein in E. coli. &#xd;
In summary, results from this thesis suggests that low temperature survival may be associated with a number of ice-associating adaptations including the presence of biofilm formation in Erwina billingiae amongst other bacteria, INA in P. borealis and INA-expressing recombinant E. coli.</description>

   <title>A Framework for Peer-to-Peer Computing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-27 12:16:25.352</description>
   <description>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications are enormously popular on the Internet. Their uses vary from file sharing to Voice-over-IP to gaming and more. Increasingly, users are moving toward wireless networked devices and wish to continue using P2P applications in these new environments. A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an infrastructureless network which allows users to dynamically form a mobile, wireless network. Though P2P and MANETs share some similarities, such as self-organization, dynamism, and resilience to failure, it is necessary to create new P2P algorithms that take advantage of the realities of MANETs. These algorithms must account for the numerous challenges found in these networks, including node mobility, resource constrained nodes, and the necessity of fully distributed algorithms.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose a framework for mobile P2P computing in MANETs (P2P-MANETs). Our proposal includes the following components. First, nodes must be able to locate and join the P2P overlay. We therefore propose a fully distributed bootstrapping algorithm in which nodes multicast join requests and cache responses. Next, the overlay peers must form a topology of connections between themselves. We propose a fully distributed topology control heuristic which supports the dynamic nature of the P2P-MANET. It is important that peers contribute to the network by sharing their resources and forwarding traffic for others. We therefore propose a dynamically priced incentive scheme which rewards users for contributing to the network. We also propose a path selection algorithm to allow peers to select how many parts of a file to download from which servers and which paths to satisfy the user's preference for download time and cost. Finally, we propose a content distribution system that allows users to download large files through the use of network coding and multicasting. Each of these components is the first proposed for its respective place in a P2P-MANET architecture. Simulation results show that each of the proposed components achieves the goals set out for it and outperforms the comparison schemes. The results also show that the overlay topology and path selection heuristics provide good approximations compared to the optimal solutions.</description>

   <description>There are mounting concerns to ensure that children are prepared for the literacy demands of the 21st century. Reading inability at 9 years of age portends a lifetime of illiteracy for the majority of struggling readers. Given the greater weight placed on expository text from the junior grades onwards, children with reading disabilities become increasingly constrained by their reading deficits, putting them at risk of falling ever further behind their normally achieving peers. This ethnographic study, extending over an 8 month period and finishing on the last day of the school year, targeted older poor readers at the junior level. Less is known about their reading deficits, relative to younger struggling readers. Therefore, the first of three principal objectives aimed to extend understanding of the processes whereby older poor readers interact with expository text by providing a qualitative finer-grained assessment of their particular difficulties than presently exists. The second objective was focused on developing and implementing a cohesive program of research-based interventions that targeted critical requirements of successful interactions with expository text, including the ability to summarize, locate information, and attend to text structure. The third objective involved establishing and describing a collaborative, intensive research partnership with two classroom teachers at the junior level to implement and evaluate research-grounded interventions for their students with reading difficulties, working within the context of the regular classroom. The dual researcher role, as collaborator with the teachers and instigator of the intervention program, shaped a reconfigured model of special education, responsive to a diverse range of student needs and abilities, and situated within a content-rich, challenging curriculum. Parallel lessons afforded the opportunity to tier instruction with increasing intensity for the children with the highest needs. Results showed the critical importance of aggressively promoting self-efficacy, self-regulation, and metacognitve awareness for older struggling readers. As these children’s strategic repertoire increased, so, too, did their comprehension and comprehension-monitoring. Differentiated instruction that was tiered, flexible, and responsive supported social inclusion and social collaboration. Social context and authentic content became interwoven and instrumental in engaging the children, maintaining their motivation and sustaining their commitment to read to learn.</description>

   <description>This multiple-case study examined the factors that influence activist artists in the production of their work. Four artists who were well established in their careers took part. The research was designed to gain insight into what motivates artists to become activists. The research methodology was rooted in qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological traditions with a descriptive, interpretative and exploratory approach, using data collected from in-depth interviews. This study sought to explore and synthesize common patterns and similarities of activist artists. Seven themes emerged: identity, place, and personality as style, life experience, world issues, community and change. Regarding activist artists using a variety of what is typically considered “style” to present their work, this study concluded that there are similarities that support the notion that activist artists can be seen as a group.</description>

   <title>Rockslides in a Changing Climate: Establishing Relationships Between Meteorological Conditions and Rockslides in Southwestern Norway for the Purposes of Developing a Hazard Forecast System</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-28 08:12:43.316</description>
   <description>The steep, mountainous terrain of southwestern Norway is prone to a high frequency of rockslides. It is known that many of these rockslides are triggered by meteorological conditions, yet there have been few studies dedicated to quantifying the link between rockslides and the runoff conditions and freeze/thaw processes that trigger failure. With recent climate research indicating that southwestern Norway will experience warmer temperatures and increased precipitation, it has become apparent that a better understanding of this link is required to help prepare for future events.&#xd;
&#xd;
Rockslides in Norway lead to road closures, property damage and fatalities every year, and one of the biggest challenges for Norwegian authorities is to react to rockslides as they happen and to reopen roads as soon as possible. This is especially true when several rockslides occur on the same day in multiple locations. As a result, authorities wish to implement a hazard mapping system that uses a weather forecast to predict when and where geohazards are likely to occur. To this end, this thesis is aimed at providing a rockslide forecast map that changes every day based on the weather forecast.&#xd;
&#xd;
By comparing a rockslide database to historic weather records, the work carried out for this thesis has indicated that extreme runoff during winter storms is responsible for triggering the majority of rockslides in the region. Using this knowledge as a basis, two potential hazard mapping systems are proposed, one based on trigger threshold exceedance and the other based on weights-of-evidence susceptibility mapping. Both of these methods operate by mapping areas experiencing extreme runoff conditions. Several runoff parameters were tested for possible inclusion, and it was found that 48-hr antecedent runoff, normalized by mean monthly precipitation had the best correlation with rockslide occurrence. Verification of these methods indicates that both approaches are successful in predicting days with extreme conditions, thereby alerting authorities that a high frequency of rockslides is likely.&#xd;
&#xd;
Due to the complex nature of rockslide triggering, it is not fully understood how climate change will affect future rockslide activity; however, this thesis attempts to answer these questions and to provide a basis for future studies.</description>

   <description>Experimentally determining the biological function of a protein is a process known as protein characterization.  Establishing the role a specific protein plays is a vital step toward fully understanding the biochemical processes that drive life in all its forms.  In order for researchers to efficiently locate and benefit from the results of protein characterization experiments, the relevant information is compiled into public databases.  To populate such databases, curators, who are experts in the biomedical domain, must search the literature to obtain the relevant information, as the experiment results are typically published in scientific journals.  The database curators identify relevant journal articles, read them, and then extract the required information into the database.  In recent years the rate of biomedical research has greatly increased, and database curators are unable to keep pace with the number of articles being published.  Consequently, maintaining an up-to-date database of characterized proteins, let alone populating a new database, has become a daunting task.&#xd;
	In this thesis, we report our work to reduce the effort required from database curators in order to create and maintain a database of characterized proteins.  We describe a system we have designed for automatically identifying relevant articles that discuss the results of protein characterization experiments.  Classifiers are trained and tested using a large dataset of abstracts, which we collected from articles referenced in public databases, as well as small datasets of manually labeled abstracts.  We evaluate both a standard and a modified naïve Bayes classifier and examine several different feature sets for representing articles.  Our findings indicate that the resulting classifier performs well enough to be considered useful by the curators of a characterized protein database.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the host-guest chemistry between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and various series of guests, including neutral polar organic solvents, bis(pyridinium)alkane dications, local anaesthetics, acetylcholine analogues, as well as succinylcholine and decamethonium analogues, in aqueous solution. A focus of this thesis is the effects of varying the chemical structures within different series of guests upon the nature of the host-guest chemistry, such as the relative position and orientation of the guest relative to the CB[7] cavity, and the strengths of the binding affinities. The binding affinities of polar organic solvents with CB[7] depend upon the hydrophobic effect and dipole-quadrupole interactions. The polar guests align themselves so that their dipole moment is perpendicular to the quadrupole moment of CB[7]. The binding strengths of acetone and acetophenone to CB[7] decrease in the presence of alkali metals. Discrete 1:1 and 2:1 host-guest complexes are formed between CB[7] and a series of bis(pyridinium)alkane guests. In most cases the CB[7] initially occupies the aliphatic linker when the 1:1 complex is formed and migrates to the terminal regions as the second CB[7] is added. When bulky, hydrophobic tert-butyl substituents are present, however, the CB[7] occupies the terminal pyridinium region and not the central linker. Supramolecular complexes between CB[7] and a series of local anaesthetics have binding affinities 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than reported values with beta-cyclodextrin. The first pKa values of the guests increase by 0.5-1.9 units upon complexation. The binding positions of the guests within CB[7] differ in neutral and acidic media, with the systems thus behaving as pH-activated switches. With supramolecular complexes between CB[7] and various cationic cholines and their phosphonium analogues, the CB[7] cavity is occupied by the charge-diffuse cationic region. The binding affinities and positions vary depending on the nature of the onium group as well as the substituents within the guest molecule. Host-guest complexes between CB[7] and dicationic acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have very strong 1:1 binding affinities, with 2:1 binding being significantly weaker. These binding affinities are related to the nature of the cationic onium groups, and the length and hydrophobicity of the connecting linkers.</description>

   <description>Ca2+ functions as a second messenger in all eukaryotes.  Such Ca2+ signaling is used to coordinate plant responses to numerous stimuli, both developmental and environmental.  Ca2+ signals are often transduced via the action of the ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM).  CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation forms an important component of such signal transduction pathways, including that regulating the initiation and development of symbiotic rhizobial nodules in legumes such as soybean (Glycine max).  To further understand the role of Ca2+/CaM during nodule organogenesis, a nodule cDNA expression library was screened using radiolabeled CaM as a probe to identify novel CaM-binding proteins (CaMBPs).  This screen resulted in the identification of a previously uncharacterized receptor-like kinase, termed GmCaMK1.  The CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) of GmCaMK1 is located in a 24 residue region of GmCaMK1, which overlaps with the subdomain XI of a conserved Ser/Thr kinase domain.  This CaMBD bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and with high affinity (Kd = 1.4 nM).  Furthermore, two hydrophobic residues (V372 and L375) were identified as critical for GmCaMK1-CaM interaction.  Recombinant GmCaMK1 exhibited protein kinase activity in vitro, with autophosphorylation activity unaffected by the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM.  GmCaMK1 expression is enriched in developing nodules and main roots, and highest expression level was observed in lateral roots.  While the function of CaM-binding to GmCaMK1 remains unclear, the affinity and Ca2+-dependence of the GmCaMK1-CaM interaction strongly suggests that GmCaMK1 is a physiologically relevant CaM target.  The Arabidopsis ortholog of GmCaMK1, AtCaMK1 also bound CaM when expressed as a recombinant protein.  GmCaMK1 is part of a multi-member family in soybean, as are putative homologs across taxa, suggesting that this is a novel, conserved family of CaMBPs.</description>

   <description>As the effects of global warming and the exhaustion of natural resources become more and more evident, the importance of low-impact construction alternatives is becoming increasingly apparent. Conventional construction not only irreversibly drains natural resources; it is also responsible for the great amount of energy consumed in the production of building materials.   Natural renewable materials that offer low-impact, low-embodied energy construction alternatives have promising potential for the construction industry.&#xd;
This thesis provides an insight into construction with natural materials, with particular emphasis on straw bale construction, by undertaking an embodied energy analysis. Firstly, the existing published sources were studied to obtain the embodied energy values of various construction materials relevant to conventional residential and straw bale construction. The embodied energy values for straw bales were found to have great variation from source to source. To obtain the value appropriate for the Canadian situation, the analysis completed in this thesis utilizes published material on straw and biomass. Secondly, a comparative analysis of embodied energy for various wall systems was completed. This analysis proves that straw bale construction is an effective low impact alternative to conventional residential construction styles. In particular, the embodied energy of the straw bale wall section is six times smaller than that of the most common conventional construction style - wood-frame with brick siding. Finally, the component of the straw bale wall that has the highest embodied energy – plaster – was examined to investigate further reduction of the embodied energy of the straw bale wall.  As a result of this investigation it was found that the plaster mix containing increased amounts of cementitious materials (for example, equal parts of cement and lime) has smaller embodied energy value. &#xd;
The findings of this work can be utilized both in the conventional construction industry as a guide to making environmentally mindful decisions, as well as for natural building construction to further improve the performance of straw bale structures.</description>

   <description>Load and resistance factor design (LRFD) (often called limit states design (LSD)) has been mandated in the AASHTO Bridge Design Specifications and will be adopted in future editions of Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code for all transportation-related structures including reinforced soil retaining walls. The ultimate objective of this thesis work was to carry out reliability-based analysis for load and resistance factor design calibration for rupture and pullout limit states for steel and geosynthetic reinforced soil walls under self-weight and permanent surcharge loading conditions. In order to meet this objective it was necessary to generate large databases of measured load and resistance data from many sources and in some cases to propose new design models that improve the accuracy of underlying deterministic load and resistance models. Numerical models were also developed to model reinforced soil wall performance. These models were used to investigate load prediction accuracy of current analytical reinforcement load models. An important feature of the calibration method adopted in this study is the use of bias statistics to account for prediction accuracy of the underlying deterministic models for load and resistance calculations, random variability in input parameter values, spatial variation and quality of data. In this thesis, bias is defined as the ratio of measured to predicted value. The most important end product of the work described in this thesis is tabulated resistance factors for rupture and pullout limit states for the internal stability of steel and geosynthetic reinforced soil walls. These factors are developed for geosynthetic reinforced soil wall design using the current AASHTO Simplified Method, a new modified Simplified Method, and the recently proposed K-Stiffness Method. Useful quantitative comparisons are made between these three methods by introducing the concept of computed operational factors of safety. This allows designers to quantify the actual margin of safety using different design approaches.&#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis format is paper-based. Ten of the chapters are comprised of journal papers that have been published (2), are in press (2), in review (3) and the remaining (3) to be submitted once the earlier background papers are accepted.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2010-01-28 23:01:15.735</description>
   <description>First proposed in the late 1990's, a nanomechanical electron shuttle is a device where an electrically isolated island moves a definite number of electrons between two leads, producing a current that is directly related to the number of electrons moved in a cycle and to the vibration frequency of the island. Since nanomechanical structures can have very well defined vibration frequencies, a device of this type is useful as, among other things, a current standard for metrology. The experimental shuttle implementations to date have had large island-lead spacings, which has limited their performance. The work presented here takes the first steps towards the fabrication of a nanomechanical electron shuttle using the process of electromigration to define very small lead-island gaps with conductivity on the order of the conductance quantum G_0=2e^2/h. These small gaps, coupled with the high vibration frequencies achievable with nanostructures, will allow investigation deeper into the realm of quantum effects.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, the fabrication steps for the creation of these devices were developed. Electromigration of a single junction was successfully achieved to the 10--100\,k\ohm range. The simultaneous and symmetric electromigration of two junctions, as required for the shuttle, has not yet been achieved. The development of a fast electromigration cut-off circuit, however, gives hope that double-breaking success will be achieved soon.</description>

   <description>This research takes a multidisciplinary approach to comprehensively investigate the material and mechanical properties as well as pore water chemistry of the Bearpaw shale. This made it possible to characterize how these properties relate to the mechanical strength of this material. The results of this research challenge our ideas of the hydrogeology and of the geological history of the region. Core samples of the Bearpaw Formation and the overlying glacial till were collected from a field site in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. A combination of laboratory tests including multi-staged oedometer tests, constant rate of strain oedometer tests, specialized triaxial swell tests, along with pore water chemistry and finite element modelling were used to meet the following objectives: (1) To investigate the material properties and compression behaviour of the Bearpaw in addition to assessing disturbance due to specimen size; (2) Examine the time dependent behaviour of the Bearpaw and the transferability of time rate models developed for soft soils to stiff soils; (3) Examine the swelling potential and behaviour of the Bearpaw Formation and the influence of boundary conditions on this behaviour, while assessing the applicability of the swell concepts developed for compacted materials to a naturally swelling clay material; and (4) Constrain the depositional age of the till overlying the Bearpaw Shale. &#xd;
Contrary to what is seen in soft soils, smaller sized specimens were found to reduce disturbance, and produce more accurate and consistent results. Creep was found to follow the same laws as it does in soft soils, calling into question whether the use of preconsolidation pressure to predict geological history in stiff clays is appropriate. There was significant variation in the observed swell pressures of samples of the same size and depth. Finally, the glacial till at site was found to belong uniquely to the Battleford Formation and ranges in age from 22,500 to 27,500 years which is much younger (over 100,000 years younger) than previously believed.</description>

   <description>Bythotrephes longimanus is an invasive, macroinvertebrate from Eurasia that was introduced into the Great Lakes region in the mid 1980s. Bythotrephes introductions into lake ecosystems have resulted in substantial changes in zooplankton communities, including declines in species richness, abundance, biomass and production. Changes in zooplankton communities may alter the quantity and quality of prey to other predators such as cisco (Coregonus artedii), a pelagic forage fish. Here, I conduct a current day comparison of cisco populations to determine if prey consumption by cisco differs in the presence of Bythotrephes, and whether changes in diet result in energetic consequences (changes in growth and condition) for cisco. Effects of Bythotrephes on native zooplankton communities have resulted in substantial changes in the variety and proportion biomass of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate prey types in cisco stomachs, which have in turn modified growth of cisco. Cisco taken from invaded lakes achieve greater total lengths but changes in condition were not detected. This effect may be driven by improved growth in the second and subsequent growing seasons, suggesting that growth consequences for young fish (that do not feed on Bythotrephes) are different than for older individuals. Length-at-structure age data indicate that by the end of the first growing season (age 1) cisco achieve comparable total body lengths in invaded and reference lakes, suggesting that food consumption by young cisco remains unchanged by Bythotrephes. Alternatively, young cisco forage may be reduced in the presence of Bythotrephes, resulting in decreased survival and similar growth among individuals that survive to age 1. In contrast, despite changes in the zooplankton community; growth of older fish (≥ age 2) was enhanced in lakes that have Bythotrephes. Improved growth among older cisco (≥ age 2) in invaded lakes may be related to the presence of a newly attainable,  high energy prey source (Bythotrephes). Alternatively, enhanced growth may be explained by lower competition due to reduced recruitment of young cisco (≤ age 1) in invaded lakes. Increased knowledge regarding the effects of Bythotrephes on growth of cisco is important in furthering our understanding of its impact on lake ecosystems.</description>

   <description>A scoping review was used to identify community-based out-of-school programs which employed occupation as a means of intervention to support positive youth development for at-risk children and youth.  The purpose of the review was to explore how programs, via their structure and philosophy, may facilitate well-being and positive youth development.  Organizations that ran programs which were accessible to children and youth in the boundaries of KFL&amp;A Public Health Unit were located through internet search, word of mouth, and printed resources in the community.  Nine programs (Boys and Girls Club, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Camp Outlook, Outward Bound, Tim Horton’s Children’s Foundation Camp, Children’s Aid Society, Youth Diversion, Girls Inc, and Katarokwi Native Friendship Centre) were identified and the associated documents were analyzed.  A search of scholarly journals was completed to locate peer-reviewed publications which evaluated the above programs.  Six publications were located which evaluated the effectiveness of the Boys and Girls Club (n=3) and Big Brothers Big Sisters (n=3).  These evaluations indicated that the programs produce positive effects for youth behaviours and reduce negative attitudes and risk behaviours.   Four common goals were identified through the analysis of the program documents: developing confidence/worth, safe supportive environment/relationships, skill development, and positive future outlook/place in the world.  From the program documents, key phrases were identified that related to one or more of the components of well-being, namely; physical health (healthy lifestyle and participation), self-esteem (view of self and succeed at new things/skill development), belonging (safe supportive environment, citizenship, relationships/safe adult relationship), security (personal and economic), and self determination (skill development, positive future outlook, choices, self-reliance).  Multiple links were observed between the goals and the components of well-being.  The component of Belonging appeared to have the greatest emphasis, with all program documents containing at least one statement related to this component.  This review provides insight into the role that youth programs which utilize occupation as the means of “intervention” can play in fostering a state of well-being and positive youth development among participants.</description>

   <description>Structured sports are the most common activity in which youth participate.  Research links sport participation to positive and negatives outcomes; however few studies have investigated the processes that affect positive and negative experiences.  Considering that enjoyment, motivational climate, and coach behaviors are factors that are known to affect participation, it is of interest to determine if these factors can contribute to increased positive experiences for youth sport participants.  &#xd;
	Study 1 investigated the psychometric properties of the Youth Experience Survey 2.0 with a group of athletes.  This instrument was originally designed to investigate experiences across a range of structured activities; however its psychometric properties had yet to be reported.  Results of confirmatory factor analyses did not show strong psychometric support for the instrument.  Follow-up exploratory analyses resulted in the instrument being modified and renamed the Youth Experience Survey for Sport.  The revised scaled showed improved psychometric properties compared to the original instrument which makes it a preferred tool for investigation of personal development of youth sport participants.    &#xd;
Study 2 explored the role of enjoyment and motivational climate on the personal development of team sport athletes.  Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationships.  Results demonstrated that positive experiences in sport were most strongly predicted by affiliation with peers, self-referenced competency, effort expenditure, and a task climate.  Negative experiences were most strongly predicted by an ego climate and other-referenced competency.  &#xd;
Study 3 examined differences on personal development and motivational climate for athletes in programs where coaches received positive youth development training and athletes in programs that did not provide training to coaches.  Results showed that personal and social skills were higher for athletes of trained coaches.  Cognitive skills and task climate did not reach significance but can be considered as marginal effects. &#xd;
Results from these studies provide researchers with an instrument to measure positive youth development in sport.  In addition, results demonstrate that enjoyment, motivational climate, and coach training are important factors in promoting personal development.  Youth sport program administrators that wish to incorporate positive development in their programs should consider these findings.</description>

   <description>Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) help cold-adapted organisms survive below 0 ◦C by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals.  In this way, AFPs depress the freezing point of aqueous fluids below the melting point of ice (thermal hysteresis; TH).   They also have the ability to inhibit ice recrystallization in the frozen state (ice recrystallization inhibition; IRI).  Some AFPs show an order of magnitude higher TH activity than others, and are termed ‘hyperactive’.  One of the objectives of this thesis was to see if IRI activities of the hyperactive AFPs are also an order of magnitude higher than the moderately active AFPs.  Using a capillary-based assay for IRI, the activities of three hyperactive and three moderately active AFPs were determined.  There was no apparent correlation between hyperactivity in TH and high IRI activity.  However, mutations of residues on the ice-binding face (IBF) of both types of AFP reduced IRI and TH activities to a similar extent.  In this way, the use of IBF mutant AFPs showed that the IBF responsible for an AFP’s TH activity is also responsible for its IRI activity.  &#xd;
Analysis of the diverse AFP structures solved to date indicate that their IBFs are relatively flat, occupy a significant proportion of the protein’s surface area and are more hydrophobic than other surfaces of the protein.  The IBFs also often have repeating sequence motifs and tend to be rich in alanine and/or, threonine.  The de novo design of an ice-binding protein was undertaken using these features to verify the underlying physicochemical requirements necessary for a protein’s interaction with ice.  Using site-directed mutagenesis, a total of sixteen threonine substitutions were made on one of the four faces of a cyanobacterial protein with no endogenous TH activity.  The inclusion of eight paired threonines on one face of this quadrilateral helix gave the engineered protein low levels of TH activity, but at the cost of destabilizing the structure to some extent.  The results of this study have validated some of the properties needed for the ice-binding activity of AFPs.</description>

   <description>This work studied the effects of step size, angle, spindle speed, and feed rate on the external surface roughening, orange peel effect, observed in single point incremental forming (SPIF).  Experimental results were used to estimate models to categorize the extent of orange peel roughening based on visual inspection and on surface roughness measurements.  Tests were performed at very high rotational speeds and feed rates and showed various influences on surface roughness, thickness distribution, and grain size.&#xd;
Friction at the tool-sheet interface was also studied with a completely instrumented tool that measured and recorded torsion and forming forces through deformation strains.  Coefficients of friction for each part were determined and through statistical analysis, the influence of each of the following forming parameters was established: material thickness, formed shape, tool size, step size, forming speeds (feed rate and rotational speed), and forming angle.  Multidimensional response surfaces were generated to show when and under what condition friction was minimized.  &#xd;
A new contact zone representation for SPIF was also established.  This formulation used common forming parameters and geometric considerations to determine the contacting zone between the sheet and the tool.  Area models were proposed for both the tangential and torsional component of friction in SPIF.</description>

   <description>Wheelchair users are exposed to whole-body vibrations, particularly when traversing rugged terrain such as in less resourced areas. Suspension systems have been added to wheelchair systems to protect occupants from secondary injuries associated with whole-body vibration.  Current suspension systems need to be further developed in order to optimize the protection against these secondary injuries. Until further research finds conclusive evidence for comfort&#xd;
level, and the onset of injury due to vibrations, it has been recommended to reduce whole-body vibration exposure to the lowest possible level. A versatile testing apparatus and method were designed and built to detect the acceleration and frequencies a wheelchair occupant would be exposed to while riding on simulated rough terrain. A novel dummy was instrumented with accelerometers to measure the accelerations and frequencies experienced by the wheelchair user.  The apparatus and method was able to detect peak acceleration magnitudes, and was able to detect resonant frequencies and their intensities with either a PSD or FFT analysis. The minimum&#xd;
observable effect of change between two test conditions ranged from 6.0% for peak acceleration analysis when using six tests and a light dummy; to 41.0% for PSD analysis when using three tests and a heavy dummy. This adjustable testing apparatus and method can be used to tune a wheelchair system suspension design because it can elucidate whether or not a design is able to reduce accelerations and attenuate resonant frequencies experienced by a wheelchair occupant.</description>

   <description>As the speed and power demands on Buck converters continue to increase, it has become time to replace the linearly-controlled conventional Buck converter. Digital circuits, such as microprocessors, are requiring higher dynamic currents, at lower voltages, than ever before. &#xd;
&#xd;
Traditionally, such Buck converters have been controlled by linear voltage-mode or current-mode control methods. While these controllers offer such advantages as fixed switching frequencies and zero steady-state error, their reaction speed is inherently limited by their bandwidth which is a fraction of the converter switching frequency. Therefore, to improve the transient response of a Buck converter in a practical manner, four novel ideas are presented in this thesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first contribution is an analog “charge balance controller”. The control method utilizes the concept of capacitor charge balance to achieve a near-optimal transient response for Buck converters undergoing a rapid load change. Unlike previous work, the proposed controller does not require expensive and/or slow analog multipliers/dividers. In addition, the nominal inductance value is not required by the proposed controller. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in transient performance over that of a linear voltage-mode controller. &#xd;
&#xd;
For low duty cycle applications, the unloading transient performance of a Buck converter tends to be poor when compared to the corresponding loading transient performance. Therefore, the second contribution is an auxiliary circuit and an analog auxiliary controller which drastically improves the performance of a Buck converter undergoing an unloading transient. Significant overshoot reduction was observed over that of a linearly-controlled conventional Buck converter.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third contribution is a digital implementation of the aforementioned “charge balance control” concept. Through digital implementation the control law is extended to include load-line regulation. Unlike previous work, large lookup tables are not required to perform complex mathematical functions, thus the number of required gates is significantly reduced. &#xd;
&#xd;
The final contribution is a digital implementation of the “charge balance controller” capable of operating with the previously-mentioned auxiliary circuit. This complete solution is capable of improving the voltage deviation caused by loading and unloading transients. In addition, the combined auxiliary circuit and control law is extended to load-line regulation applications.</description>

   <description>The allylic bromide functionality within brominated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene), or BIIR, alkylates primary amines repeatedly to generate thermoset products at reaction rates that are too fast to support commercial rubber processing operations.  The objective of this work was to assess the utility of latent N-nucleophiles as curatives and modification reagents for BIIR.  Ideally, BIIR formulations containing these latent amines would not cure at standard compound mixing temperatures, but support high crosslinking rates and yields upon heating to conventional vulcanization temperatures. &#xd;

Carbon dioxide-derived salts of ammonia, including (NH4)2CO3, (NH4)HCO3 and (NH4)H2NCO2, can be mixed with BIIR without incurring crosslinking at temperatures below 100oC, but they generate adequate crosslink yields upon heating to 160oC.  The corresponding CO2-derived salts of primary amines decompose below 100oC and, therefore, do not provide adequate scorch protection when mixed with BIIR. Latency was conferred on primary amines using imine derivatives, in particular N-alkylbenzaldimine and its substituted analogues. These latent curatives are activated by hydrolysis, thereby providing a means of controlling active nucleophile concentrations, and minimizing crosslinking activity at 100oC without impacting negatively on cure rates at 160oC.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The scorch problems generated by primary amines extend to BIIR cure formulations employing conventional sulfur and ZnO curatives.  In contrast, imine analogues are shown to provide low temperature scorch stability without impacting negatively on high temperature cure rates and extents.</description>

   <description>Chapter 1&#xd;
Hydrocarbon autoxidation, a free radical chain reaction, is believed to play a key role in the onset and developments of most degenerative diseases and disorders. The two propagating steps: 1) H-atom abstraction from the hydrocarbon by a hydrocarbon-derived peroxyl radical, and 2) addition of oxygen to the resultant alkyl radical to form a new peroxyl, play a role in determining the rate of hydrocarbon autoxidation, as well as the regio- and stereochemistry of the product hydroperoxides. In the current study, we carried out a set of calculations to provide a detailed framework for understanding the mechanism of the first two steps of autoxidation.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapter 2&#xd;
Radical-trapping chain-breaking antioxidants inhibit hydrocarbon autoxidation. Phenols are the prototypical radical-trapping antioxidants and are employed in nature, as well as in industry, to inhibit the autoxidation of hydrocarbons. The mechanism of inhibiting radical chain propagation has recently been suggested to be a PCET on the basis of theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the antioxidant activitiy of phenols is increased in the presence of either protic acids or alcohols, but the basis of this acceleration is not well understood. In the current study, we used computational methods to investigate the effects of acids and alcohols on the PCET pathway for the reaction of phenol with a peroxyl radical.&#xd;

Chapter 3&#xd;
The antibiotic pyrrolnitrin [3-chloro-4-(2’-nitro-3’-chlorophenyl) pyrrole] (PRN) is biosynthesized from L-tryptophan in four steps, catalyzed by the enzymes PrnA, B, C and D encoded by the prn operon. Two of the four gene products, PrnA and PrnC, are flavin-dependent halogenases, a recently discovered and highly interesting class of enzymatic halogenation catalysts. Their activities have never been unequivocally demonstrated by reconstitution of the activity from a recombinant protein. Herein, we report the results of our efforts to clone the genes encoding PrnA and PrnC, and overexpress, isolate and purify the proteins from E. coli. We were able to successfully reconsistute halogenation activity of both and have obtained the first kinetic data for PrnC, which shows kinetics similar to other flavin-dependent halogenases, along with substrate inhibition.</description>

   <description>Increased impulsivity and alterations in reward sensitivity co-occur in many psychiatric disorders.  Moreover, individuals reporting more impulsive traits are less efficient in learning stimulus-reward associations.  This suggests that impulsivity and reward sensitivity may be linked, consistent with evidence that the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) is implicated in both processes.  This study examined the relationship between impulsive traits, assessed by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Eysenck (EIQ), and performance on three behavioral tasks that measure impulsivity and reward sensitivity.  The tasks included a Conditioned Pattern Preference (CPP) task, which measures the preference for abstract visual cues as an index of implicit emotional learning, a Probabilistic Reversal Learning (PRL) task that assessed the ability to alter behaviour when reward contingencies change and an Emotional Stroop task which assessed attentional control in response to emotionally salient stimuli.  This study provided novel information on the relationship between processes that mediate impulsivity and reward sensitivity. In brief, subjects that were considered to have some explicit knowledge of experimental conditions showed a higher preference formation for the pattern paired with the reward on 90% of the conditioning trials. Although there was no overall effect of impulsivity, the medium impulsive group displayed the strongest preference formation (highest score for the 90% pattern and lowest score for the 10% pattern) compared to the low and high groups. Furthermore, there was an overall effect of Word Category in that participants made more errors for the emotional words (positive and negative) than the neutral words. There was no overall effect of Impulsivity on Stroop performance in this sample. Finally, for the PRL task more participants in the high impulsive group did not meet criterion for the Acquisition stage while more low impulsive subjects did not meet reversal criterion. Furthermore, high impulsive subjects made more overall errors in the Acquisition stage but not Reversal stage. In brief, low and high impulsive subjects performed sub-optimally on the CPP and PRL tasks but not on the Stroop task.  This pattern reflects an inverted-U shaped relationship of the effects of impulsivity on associative learning.</description>

   <description>The natriuretic peptide system (NPS) is a hormonal system critical to mammalian cardiovascular homeostasis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of ANP during early postnatal cardiac development by i) monitoring the development of cardiac hypertrophy during early postnatal development of the ANP-/- mice, and ii) comparing morphologic, morphometric and molecular differences in ANP+/+ mice compared to ANP-/- mice during this developmental period. Age matched male ANP+/+ and ANP-/- mice, aged day 1 and weeks 1 to 5, were evaluated. Body weight, organ weights and hematocrit were recorded. RNA was isolated and quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to monitor cardiac gene expression. An additional cohort of animals was used for morphologic and morphometric analysis. Heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) was dramatically higher in ANP-/- animals at all time points, indicating cardiac hypertrophy is established before the advent of adult blood pressure. Molecular analysis of gene expression revealed a compensatory response of the NPS in the ANP-/- mice. Specifically an up-regulation of BNP expression in ANP-/- mice was noted throughout postnatal development. Similarly, NPR-A and NPR-C demonstrated compensatory action for the lack of ANP, as expressional levels also varied throughout development. Morphological analysis of cardiac vasculature revealed striking structural differences between ANP+/+ and ANP-/- mice. Quantitative stereological analysis of LM images indicated a greater vessel volume in ANP-/- compared to ANP+/+ mice. This study demonstrates that alterations in early molecular events, such as changes in NPS expression, may be responsible for the maintenance and progression of cardiac hypertrophy during early postnatal development in the ANP-/- mice. The absence of ANP during this critical period of development has a profound impact on final cardiac structure leading to future pathological states.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-02-08 22:07:52.331</description>
   <description>Commodity markets are fundamentally cyclical, exposing mining companies to large swings in profitability during periods of economic boom and bust. Although this is well documented, companies continue to produce mine plans based on present market conditions that fail to acknowledge long-term metal price variability. The purpose of this thesis is to adapt McIsaac’s (2008) mathematical model for determining the most robust underground mining plan under conditions of metal price uncertainty for application in an open pit environment. &#xd;
&#xd;
An overview of conventional open pit algorithms is given to demonstrate that a circular analysis precludes the determination of an optimal solution when metal prices are uncertain. Under the proposed methodology, the optimal solution is achieved by selecting the cutoff grade and production rate under stochastic metal prices such that the net present value and probability of a positive net present value are maximized. &#xd;
&#xd;
The mathematical model was formulated with costs represented as a function of the level of production, rate of production or both. Revenues are achieved from either a mill, heap leach or stockpile process dependent on the level of production and metal price in the year of consideration. Metal prices are generated annually according to a stochastic model that balances short-term volatility with long-term trends. The compiled cash flow model determines the optimal net present value for a given production profile under input metal prices. &#xd;
&#xd;
The feasible area of production is established based on mine life, resource and financing constraints. Net present values are generated for a broad search grid, which converges towards a unimodal solution according to a golden search algorithm. The process is then repeated many times in order to identify the production profile at which the optimal solution is repeatedly reached. As a visual representation, the solutions are plotted on a bubble graph where the size of the bubble corresponds to the frequency of the solution; the largest bubble is associated with the optimal solution. The methodology is tested on two massive copper porphyry deposits, contained within a single claim, for which a Preliminary Economic Assessment has been completed.</description>

   <description>While college and university students have long been associated with newfound&#xd;
independence, alcohol and unrest, the phenomenon of celebratory rioting, which combines these key elements of student culture, is relatively new. While incidents have occurred since 1985,&#xd;
their recent escalation in size, frequency, and property damages continues to raise public concern&#xd;
in many college and university towns across North America. Research indicates that celebratory riots result from large non-protest related assemblies of mostly students where alcohol is consumed freely, participants spontaneously engage in unruly behaviour, and police intervention&#xd;
invites resistant and aggressive responses from crowd members. However, such outbursts are often difficult to predict since they may emerge from a myriad of possible trigger events. In order to further interpret celebratory rioting, this thesis examines a number of individual-centred and event-centred crowd theories to determine what is known about crowd behaviour. This study&#xd;
concludes that the analysis of a celebratory riot event requires a process-rooted approach, such as the Value-Added model, to account for the situational factors which shape the event’s precursors, transactions and aftermath.&#xd;
This thesis focuses analytical attention on the annual Queen’s Homecoming Aberdeen&#xd;
street party in Kingston, Ontario which became riotous in 2005. This case study comprised an extensive media content analysis, Queen’s archival research, and direct observation at a number of student focus groups, committee meetings and student gatherings. This study, which concludes with an analysis of the non-riotous Homecoming celebrations of 2006, revealed that the riot of 2005 was hardly unique; instead, it followed decades of intermittent student&#xd;
disturbances in the Queen’s student neighbourhood. Furthermore, the 2005 Aberdeen Street riot ultimately parallels the story of so many celebratory riots which have recently occurred and continue to emerge in a number of college and university towns across North America.</description>

   <description>Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A) and mammalian transient receptor potential melastatin-related 7 (TRPM7) are two divergent members of a family of atypical protein kinases called the alpha kinases.  The crystal structures of the alpha-kinase domains of MHCK A (A-CAT, residues 552-841) and mouse TRPM7 (TRPM7-CAT, residues 1548-1862) are very similar.  In both cases a C-terminal tail (C-tail) sequence (A-CAT, residues 806-841 and TRPM7-CAT, residues 1819-1862) is missing from the crystal structure.  Here I show that the unstructured C-tail is required for the catalytic activity of A-CAT and TRPM7-CAT.  Truncation of the C-tail of A-CAT to residue 823 decreased kinase activity by ~98% and ATPase activity by ~97%. Truncation of the C-tail of TRPM7-CAT to residue 1827 decreased kinase activity by ~97% and ATPase activity by ~58%. Ligation of the C-tail sequence of MHCK B (residues 326-354) to A-CAT-802 (residues 552-802), fully rescued kinase activity. Alignment of the C-tail sequences of MHCK A-D revealed a conserved Gly-Thr-hydrophobic motif. Previous work has shown that in A-CAT, the conserved threonine (T825) is a site of autophosphorylation. Mutation of the T825 to alanine reduced A-CAT kinase and ATPase activities by 97%, whereas mutation to serine decreased kinase and ATPase rates by 85% and 60%, respectively.  This result is consistent with the finding that A-CAT strongly prefers to phosphorylate threonine residues. Surprisingly, mutation of T825 to glutamic acid reduced kinase activity by ~93% and ATPase activity by ~96%.  This result suggests that glutamic acid does not properly mimic phosphothreonine in this situation, or that the free hydroxyl group of T825 is required for the catalytic activity of A-CAT. Mutation of T825 to alanine or glutamic acid in full-length MHCK A reduced kinase activity by ~90% and ATPase activity by ~40%.  Further studies are required to determine if the C-tail of TRPM7-CAT also contains an essential threonine residue.</description>

   <description>The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCA1, plays a pivotal role in reverse cholesterol transport, which is the elimination of excess sterols from peripheral cells and their transport to the liver for elimination.  Early studies failed to detect significant ATPase activity, prompting the suggestion that ABCA1 was an ATP-regulated receptor, rather than an active transporter.  We have provided evidence that ABCA1 can bind ATP and trap its hydrolysis product, ADP, in the presence of either ortho-vanadate or beryllium fluoride and Mg2+ or Mn2+.  We have also shown that both nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) trap nucleotide comparably, suggesting that ABCA1 is a functional ATPase.  In addition, we have shown that ABCA1 can directly transport 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) in an ATP-dependent manner using a membrane vesicle uptake assay, and can do so when the physiological substrate acceptor apoA-I is replaced with BSA as a non-specific binding protein.  &#xd;
Although more than 50 naturally occurring missense mutations and polymorphisms in ABCA1 have been identified in individuals with HDL-C levels within the lowest 5th percentile of the general population, the extent to which many of these mutations affect ABCA1 function is not known and cannot be predicted.  Naturally occurring extracellular loop (ECL) mutations W590S and C1477R have both been shown to effectively eliminate the ability to mediate lipid efflux, despite the fact that the W590S mutant protein retains the ability to bind apoA-I.  We show that neither mutant can transport nor efflux 25-OHC, whether in the presence of apoA-I or BSA, despite apparently full retention of the ability to bind and trap nucleotide.  This suggests that these two ECL mutations inhibit transport by a mechanism that is independent of their effect on apoA-I binding.  By introduction of naturally occurring mutations in the NBDs, we show that although some mutations associated with Tangier Disease, such as N935S, essentially eliminate nucleotide trapping and substrate translocation, other polymorphisms such as L1026P and T2073A associated with low HDL-C, appear to be fully functional.  Lastly, we observed differences in the behaviour of both wild-type and mutant forms of ABCA1-GFP depending on whether they were expressed in insect or mammalian cell lines.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-02-18 09:49:52.336</description>
   <description>Free radical polymerization is the most common polymerization technique that is used for the manufacturing of polymers, due to the ease of the polymerization initiation, wide latitude of the material design for a large variety of monomers, and the excellent process robustness for commercial production.  In the 1990’s, research activities for the precise control of radical polymerization process resulted in the discovery of ‘Living Radical Polymerization’.  The discoveries opened the door for the next generation of radical polymerizations. Extensive research has been conducted to understand the mechanisms and kinetics for numerous practical applications, particularly for polymerization in bulk and solution systems. However, despite the interest of industry, the mechanistic understanding in aqueous dispersed systems such as emulsion and miniemulsion polymerization is far behind the aforementioned two systems. There are still major challenges from the production viewpoint. One reason for the poor understanding is the complexity of the heterogeneous system, which includes multiple　reaction phases that are accompanied by the segregation and transfer of the reaction species among different phases.  &#xd;
The purpose of this research was to investigate living radical polymerization or “Stable Free Radical Polymerization” (SFRP) in aqueous dispersed systems to obtain better mechanistic understanding of how the heterogeneous nature of the system interacts with the novel living radical chemistry. The theoretical and experimental feasibility of the SFRP emulsion process were studied in this research, in particular, focusing on the compartmentalization effect. Particle size influence on the polymerization kinetics and the polymer livingness was experimentally confirmed, and compared to bulk polymerization.  In addition, a comprehensive mathematical model including all major chemical and physical events was developed to further our mechanistic understanding. Based on the results from the experimental and modeling studies, it was shown that rate reduction in the smaller particles is the primary cause of difficulty in implementing a conventional emulsion process (i.e. ab initio emulsion polymerization). Finally, for overcoming this difficulty, a new approach using a combination of TEMPO with highly hydrophobic 4-stearoyl TEMPO was proposed for a coagulum free ab initio emulsion process.</description>

   <description>Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) is activated by a number of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, while a constitutively active form of Stat3 alone is sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation.  Results presented in this thesis reveal that Stat3 can also be activated through homophilic interactions by the epithelial (E)-cadherin and cadherin-11, two members of the classical type I and II cadherin family of surface receptors, responsible for the formation of cell to cell junctions.  Indeed, by plating cells onto surfaces coated with fragments encompassing the two outermost domains of these cadherins, we definitively demonstrate that cadherin engagement can activate Stat3, even in the absence of direct cell to cell contact.  At the same time, levels of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk)1/2, which is often coordinately activated by growth factor receptors and oncogenes, remain unchanged upon cadherin ligation.  Most importantly, we report, for the first time, an unexpected surge in total Rac1 and Cdc42 protein levels, triggered by cadherin engagement, and an increase in Rac1 and Cdc42 activity, which is responsible for the Stat3 stimulation observed.  Inhibition of cadherin interactions reduced Rac/Cdc42 and Stat3 levels and induced apoptosis, pointing to a significant role of this pathway in cell survival signalling, a finding which could also have important therapeutic implications. &#xd;
To better understand the role of Rac/Cdc42 in the cadherin-mediated Stat3 activation, we compared Stat3 activity in mouse HC11 cells before and after expression of the mutationally activated, RacV12.  We demonstrate a dramatic increase in protein levels and activity of both the endogenous Rac and RacV12 with cell density, which was due to inhibition of proteasomal degradation.  Moreover, we clearly show that RacV12 expression can activate Stat3 through an increase in expression of members of the IL6 family of cytokines, known potent Stat3 activators.  In fact, knockdown experiments indicate that gp130 receptor function, and Stat3 activation, are essential for the migration and proliferation of RacV12-expressing cells, thereby demonstrating that the gp130/Stat3 axis represents an essential target of activated Rac in the regulation of both of these fundamental cellular functions.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines site specific works produced in hotel buildings by exploring the multiple and contending narratives which gave meaning to city spaces where divergent communities lived, worked and socialized. I analyze the ways in which artists altered urban sites on a visual, sensorial and perceptual levels by focusing on installations produced in three hotels from 1980 to the present: the Embassy Hotel in London, Ontario, and the Cameron House and the Gladstone Hotel in Toronto, Ontario. By facilitating critical interventions in these architectural spaces, artists responded to the conflicting agendas of varying constituencies—from city planners and artists to hotel owners and residents. These commercial establishments, which combined bars, cafés, performance venues, galleries and room rentals, demonstrate the ways in which art and cultural production reflect broader social patterns and urban life: economic shifts, questions of diversity, activist struggles, consumerism, unemployment, and community. In addition to providing spaces for creative practices and art installations, the hotels each went through a series of renovations, transforming the once derelict buildings where low income tenants formerly resided into gentrified buildings, thus changing the social, symbolic and historical significance of the architectural sites.                  Working across these complex socio-spatial patterns creative communities re-envisioned urban geographies through contemporary art practices which impacted how and why people perceived, conceived and experienced the surrounding environment. By producing and exhibiting works in city spaces artists participated in urban regeneration in the local neighborhoods of London and Toronto; yet this was necessarily coupled with gentrification, and the displacement of local residents (including creative communities and people living in poverty) who could not afford rental increases. I evaluate the critical aesthetics shaping site specific installations by drawing attention to the contradictions and tensions underlying city revitalization which concurrently enabled and disenabled community formations. I argue that artists contended with the geo-politics of identification, dis-identification, belonging and unbelonging by negotiating differing subject positions through which tenants and workers made claims to property rights and ownership. They produced what Michel Foucault referred to as “heteropias” by representing, contesting and inverting the hotel sites, thus creatively and critically engaging with – rather then simply supporting or opposing – the paradoxical possibilities of urban regeneration (Foucault, "Of Other Spaces", 24).</description>

   <description>Proper embryonic patterning requires precise spatio-temporal regulation of retinoic acid (RA) activity. Morphogenesis can be regulated at the level of RA distribution, mainly via its synthesis and catabolism by the RALDH and CYP26 enzymes respectively, and at the level of RA-mediated transcription through activation of its cognate nuclear receptor, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) α, β, and γ. Loss of Cyp26b1 leads to increased local levels of RA in tissues such as the limb and craniofacial structures, and results in neonatal lethality. Visible gross phenotypic defects in neonates include phocomelia (shortening of the limbs), adactyly (missing digits), micrognathia (shortened lower jaw), and open eyes at birth. In addition, these embryos exhibit cleft palate and have a paucity of vibrissal (whisker) and pelage (hair) follicles. We have previously shown that ablating the gene encoding RARγ in a Cyp26a1-null background was able to rescue the caudal abnormalities associated with improper RA exposure in these embryos by limiting aberrant RA signalling, and thus rescuing expression domains of target genes involved in caudal development. I show here that ablating Rarg in a Cyp26b1-null background is able to partially rescue the defects associated with loss of CYP26B1. These include a reduction in the severity of limb defects, rescued vibrissae, fused eyelids, and recovered aspects of axial skeletal development. This compound-null murine model illustrates that RARγ plays a specific role in transducing the RA signal within tissues that are affected by the loss of CYP26B1. Further molecular analysis of the pathways responsible for directing limb bud outgrowth and eyelid fusion provided insight into pathways regulated by RARγ in these rescued tissues.</description>

   <description>The etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia are poorly understood, although increasing evidence suggests an important role for altered GABA neurotransmission. Animal models of schizophrenic symptoms include administration of noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists, such as dizocilpine (MK-801), and post-weaning social isolation.  The present study tested the hypothesis that a “double-hit” model, in which subchronic MK-801 administration and post-weaning social isolation are combined, produces greater behavioural and neurochemical effects than either insult alone. As a secondary objective, the present study also assessed whether the timing of the subchronic MK-801 injections (early adolescence vs. early adulthood) influences these measures. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 74) were obtained at weaning (P21) and were either socially isolated (n = 42) or group housed (n = 32) for the duration of the experiment. Subgroups received subchronic treatment with MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg ip) or saline injections (1.0 ml/kg ip) twice daily for seven days either during early adolescence (P25-P32) or early adulthood (P56-63). At P70, all groups were tested for locomotor activity and subsequently sacrificed to assess the function of the GABA membrane transport protein, GAT-1, and GABAA receptor expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. For animals treated in early adulthood, post-weaning social isolation, in comparison to group housing, resulted in an increase in (1) locomotor activity (2) GAT-1 activity in frontal cortex and hippocampus and (3) GABAA receptor expression in the frontal cortex. MK-801 treatment in early adulthood increased GABAA receptor expression in the hippocampus, whereas post-weaning social isolation had no effect on GABAA receptor expression in the hippocampus. Previous studies have demonstrated that increased GAT-1 activity is associated with suppression of GABA-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission.  Furthermore, increased GABAA receptor expression may be a compensatory response to decreased availability of GABA. These data indicated that combined post-weaning social isolation and subchronic MK-801 treatment do not produce additive or synergistic effects on locomotor behaviour or GABA signalling, but rather induced differential effects on GABAA receptor binding.</description>

   <description>Recent advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology and integration&#xd;
have resulted in vehicle-borne platforms for urban LIDAR scanning, such as Terrapoint Inc.'s TITAN system. Such technology has lead to an explosion in ground LIDAR data. The large size of such mobile urban LIDAR data sets, and the ease at which they may now be collected, has shifted the bottleneck of creating abstract urban models for Geographical Information Systems (GIS) from data collection to data processing. While turning such data into useful models has traditionally relied on human analysis, this is no longer practical.&#xd;
This thesis outlines a methodology for automatically recovering the necessary&#xd;
information to create abstract urban models from mobile urban LIDAR data using&#xd;
computer vision methods. As an integral part of the methodology, a novel scale-based interest operator is introduced (Di erence of Normals) that is e cient enough to process large datasets, while accurately isolating objects of interest in the scene according to real-world parameters.&#xd;
Finally a novel localized object recognition algorithm is introduced (Local Potential Well Space Embedding), derived from a proven global method for object recognition (Potential Well Space Embedding). The object recognition phase of our methodology is discussed with these two algorithms as a focus.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I present the work performed towards a proposal to couple a piezoelectric, nanomechanical beam to a radio frequency single electron transistor (RF-SET). Lumped element RF circuit theory is applied to 50 kOhm single electron transistors acting as the resistor in an RLC circuit. It is shown that for the expected inductances and stray capacitances, at an operating frequency of 1.25 GHz, the RF-SET is expected to have a usable half-bandwidth of 175-200 MHz and a charge sensitivity on&#xd;
the order of 10^(−5) e/√Hz. A fabricated RF-SET device is cryogenically cooled and used to find experimental values of the stray capacitance. A heterostructure made of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide from which piezoelectric beams can be made is designed to contain a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Quantum Hall effect samples are fabricated from the wafer, and magnetoresistance measurements for each sample are presented. It is shown that the 2DEG has a high electron concentration of about 8 × 10^11 cm−2 but a low mobility of about 3.5 × 10^4 cm^2/(V·s) for this type of heterostructure.</description>

   <description>Despite our theoretical commitment to community development (CD) approaches in occupational therapy, current practice models focus on individual interventions, rather than identifying how occupational therapists (OTs) can contribute at a community level. Consequently, OTs attempting to work with communities may not have clear guidance on methods of community engagement or strategies for addressing community level issues. This research examined three cases of OTs working in CD in different regions of Canada in order to 1) generate in-depth interpretive case descriptions of CD practice; and 2) conceptualize CD from the perspective and practices of occupational therapy. Data collection in each case occurred over three weeks and included approximately 30 hours of observations, document reviews and 14 interviews with health professionals and program participants. Constructivist grounded theory informed data analysis. The conceptual framework generated from the cross-case analysis describes the context of CD in which the OTs bridged the health and community sectors. The OTs were in community-focused positions located within regional health authorities. The OTs strategically used both professional and personal self to enable more equitable power sharing between health services, community agencies and consumers, creating opportunities for meaningful engagement with and in communities. Four main CD strategies contributed to this power shift: 1) building consumer and community capacity, 2) nurturing community partnerships, 3) influencing the health care system, and 4) linking sectors and resources. These OTs focused on a set of core values while drawing on their professional experiences. Individual, organizational and community-level changes resulted from these CD initiatives. The conceptualizations developed in this study can inform the practice of OTs by identifying potential CD strategies for enabling occupations with communities and sensitizing OTs to historical contextual tensions and power inequities. From this, the applicability of current occupational therapy models to communities can be extended, enhancing reflexive CD practice.</description>

   <description>This thesis concerns the occurrence of the large-scale bed and plan forms known as alternate bars and meandering, and the internal structures of the flow associated with their formation. The work is to be viewed as an extension of previous work by da Silva (1991), Yalin (1992), and Yalin and da Silva (2001).&#xd;
As a first step in this work, the criteria for occurrence of alternate bars and meandering of Yalin and da Silva (2001) is re-considered in view of additional field and laboratory data from the recent literature and data resulting from two series of experimental runs carried out in two sediment transport flumes. This leads to a number of modifications of the boundary-lines in the related existence-region diagram of Yalin and da Silva.&#xd;
The size of the largest horizontal coherent structures (HCS’s) of an alternate bar inducing flow was then investigated experimentally on the basis of three series of flow velocity measurements. These were carried out in a 21m-long, 1m-wide straight channel, conveying a 4cm-deep flow. The bed consisted of a silica sand having a grain size of 2mm; its surface was flat. The measurements were carried out using a Sontek 2D Micro ADV. The horizontal burst length was found to be between five and seven times the flow width. The effect of the HCS’s on the mean flow was also investigated. A slight internal meandering of the flow caused by the superimposition of burst-sequences on the mean flow was clearly detectable.&#xd;
Finally, with the aid of three new series of measurements in the same channel, an attempt was made to penetrate the dynamics and life-cycle of the HCS’s. For this purpose, quadrant analysis was used; the cross-sectional distribution of relevant statistical turbulence-related parameters was investigated; and cross-correlations of flow velocity along the flow depth and across the channel were performed. The analysis indicates that the HCS’s originate near the channel banks, with the location of ejections and sweeps being anti-symmetrically arranged with regard to the channel centreline, and then evolve so as to occupy the entire depth of the water and the entire width of the channel.</description>

   <description>This work examines the application of different magnetic flux leakage (MFL) inspection concepts to the non destructive evaluation (NDE) of residual (elastic) stresses in CANDU reactor feeder pipes. The stress sensitivity of three MFL inspection techniques was examined with flat plate samples, with stress-induced magnetic anisotropy (SMA) demonstrating the greatest stress sensitivity. A prototype SMA testing system was developed to apply magnetic NDE to feeders. The system consists of a flux&#xd;
controller that incorporates feedback from a wire coil and a Hall sensor (FCV2), and&#xd;
a magnetic anisotropy prototype (MAP) probe. The combination of FCV2 and the MAP probe was shown to provide SMA measurements on feeder pipe samples and predict stresses from SMA measurements with a mean accuracy of ±38MPa.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis is to explore the intersection of sport for development and peace (SDP) and global corporate philanthropy through a case study of the National Basketball Association’s (NBA) “Basketball Without Borders” (BWB).  The NBA promotes BWB as a means to social and economic development in the global South by wedding basketball with education on social issues and the development of sport-related infrastructure.  However, the NBA’s participation in SDP is emblematic of broader issues in neoliberal globalization, and, as such, an historical and discursive analysis is undertaken to interrogate the seemingly divergent pursuits of capitalism and international development.  I argue that the consequences of transnational corporations like the NBA entering developing nations for the purposes of promoting development through sport results in the prioritization of commercialism over development, and the (re)production of hegemonic and neocolonial ideologies and practices.</description>

   <description>This thesis extends the applicability of quantum cryptography.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, we prove that quantum cryptography at least equals classical cryptography in an important area, namely authentication. The quantum key distribution protocols presented here show that, contrary to previous belief, authentication can be done with quantum methods only.&#xd;
&#xd;
In addition, we have designed quantum security systems in unconventional settings. The security of sensor networks poses specific challenges, as the sensor nodes in particular can be physically picked up by the intruder. Our scheme protects both the integrity of the communication messages and it also protects the identity of the nodes, such that a reading intrusion of a node is detectable.&#xd;
&#xd;
The problem of access control in a hierarchy refers to a large number of users, organized in a hierarchy, having selective access rights to a database. Our quantum solution introduces quantum keys to the effect that the cryptographic scheme is dynamically adaptable to changes in the user structure, and it exhibits increased security levels.&#xd;
&#xd;
To the best of our knowledge, this thesis is the first to introduce quantum keys, that is secret keys defined by an array of qubits. We show that quantum keys make it possible for two parties to communicate with one-time pads without having to meet in advance. Also, opposite to previous cryptographic ``common sense", the security level of a quantum cryptosystem with quantum keys and quantum messages increases while being used, meaning the security increases over time.</description>

   <title>North Atlantic Quadrangle: The Importance of France in Canadian Strategic Culture, 1760-1949</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2010-03-22 12:52:20.99</description>
   <description>The objective of this dissertation is to answer the puzzle raised by political scientist John Kirton: Why has Canada, for the last century, gone to war for and beside France? In other words, I assess France’s relative importance in Canadian strategic culture. The hypothesis defended is that the emergence of France in Canadian strategic culture stems from the social construction of Canada's internal state identity as a bicultural (English and French) country, with its corollary external identity as an Atlanticist country, emerging in 1940, and whose associated principles (allied unity, status and functional representation) explain the legitimacy to use force outside Canada's borders as well as the magnitude of Canada's military contribution. This gives France a double influence on Canada’s strategic culture, that is to say, in the constitution of what is considered a “just” cause: the legitimacy of quadrilateral multilateralism, as well as the "Christian democratic" values and ethnocultural heritage shared between Canada and France, which I call "francosphère.” The demonstration that France is an essential geonormative pillar in Canada’s international security policy – justifying an extension of the geometric metaphor of the North Atlantic triangle - is established in three stages. First, I reject the realist hypotheses explaining the peculiarity of Franco-Canadian relations (anti-American and anti-Soviet balancing, collective defence, relative power, and the Gaullist assault on Canada’s territorial integrity) because of their inconsistency and/or their lack of empirical support. Then, I develop a constructivist analytical framework of foreign policy. Finally, the empirical and historical study that follows, examining Franco-Canadian relations from 1760 to 1949, confirms my hypothesis, namely that the importance of France in Canadian strategic culture is determined by the emergence of bicultural and Atlanticist identities, both institutionalized after the trauma of June 1940.</description>

   <description>Natural hazards related to ground movement that directly affect the safety of motorists and highway infrastructure include, but are not limited to, rockfalls, rockslides, debris flows, and landslides. This thesis specifically deals with the evaluation of rockfall hazards through the evaluation of LiDAR data.&#xd;
Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is an imaging technology that can be used to delineate and evaluate geomechanically-controlled hazards. LiDAR has been adopted to conduct hazard evaluations pertaining to rockfall, rock-avalanches, debris flows, and landslides. Characteristics of LiDAR surveying, such as rapid data acquisition rates, mobile data collection, and high data densities, pose problems to traditional CAD or GIS-based mapping methods. New analyses methods, including tools specifically oriented to geomechanical analyses, are needed.&#xd;
The research completed in this thesis supports development of new methods, including improved survey techniques, innovative software workflows, and  processing algorithms to aid in the detection and evaluation of geomechanically controlled rockfall hazards.&#xd;
The scientific research conducted between the years of 2006-2010, as presented in this thesis, are divided into five chapters, each of which has been published by or is under review by an international journal. The five research foci are: i) geomechanical feature extraction and analysis using LiDAR data in active mining environments; ii) engineered monitoring of rockfall hazards along transportation corridors: using mobile terrestrial LiDAR; iii) optimization of LiDAR scanning and processing for automated structural evaluation of discontinuities in rockmasses; iv) location orientation bias when using static LiDAR data for geomechanical analysis; and v) evaluating roadside rockmasses for rockfall hazards from LiDAR data: optimizing data collection and processing protocols.&#xd;
ii&#xd;
The research conducted pertaining to this thesis has direct and significant implications with respect to numerous engineering projects that are affected by geomechanical stability issues.&#xd;
The ability to efficiently and accurately map discontinuities, detect changes, and standardize roadside geomechanical stability analyses from remote locations will fundamentally change the state-of-practice of geotechnical investigation workflows and repeatable monitoring. This, in turn, will lead to earlier detection and definition of potential zones of instability, will allow for progressive monitoring and risk analysis, and will indicate the need for pro-active slope improvement and stabilization.</description>

   <description>Tail modified amidine type cationic switchable surfactants were synthesized. The modified structures included ethylene oxide units in the tail to increase water solubility. Surfactants with different hydrophile-lipophilic balance were available by virtue of the commercial availability of the alcohol precursors.&#xd;
Low viscosity emulsions of heavy crude oil were generated by activating indigenous crude oil surfactants with a water-soluble base. The emulsions containing approximately 70 wt% heavy crude oil were visually stable under ambient conditions for two weeks. Immediate phase separation was found to occur with the addition of carbon dioxide gas. Free water was easily separated from high viscosity crude oil. Improvements in the quality of phase separation were possible with water-soluble organic bases. Amidine surfactants with appropriate structure were also capable of stabilizing heavy crude oil emulsions.&#xd;
Anionic switchable surfactants were developed. The surfactants reacted with carbon dioxide to cause changes to interfacial properties. Carbon dioxide in aqueous solution was able to neutralize the anionic form of the surfactant. Examples include carboxylic acids and phenols. Heating and removal of carbon dioxide was, in most cases, sufficient to cause the surfactant to become anionic again. Interfacial properties such as surface tension and emulsion stability were controlled using the anionic switchable surfactant system. Otherwise stable emulsions were triggered to separate by addition of carbon dioxide.&#xd;
Polystyrene particles of 30 nm to 40 nm in diameter were made by emulsion polymerization using anionic switchable surfactants. The latex was stabilized by electrostatic charges with measured zeta potential below –30 mV. Treating the latex with carbon dioxide was found to cause aggregation of polymer particles. The aggregates were much larger with diameter of approximately 100 μm and readily separated by flotation and dried into a fine free flowing powder. Re-dispersion of the aggregates was possible after heating and mixing the slurry in water. The re-dispersed latex was found to be stabilized by electrostatic charges with measured zeta potential below –30 mV.</description>

   <title>Novel Aspects to the Role of Rad9A During the DNA Damage Response</title>

   <description>The human Rad9A checkpoint protein is required for genomic stability and proper execution of the DNA damage checkpoint.  Previous work has shown Rad9A to be the key member of a heterotrimeric toroidal structure known as the 911 complex, along with Hus1A and Rad1, which is similar in structure to PCNA.  Recent literature suggests Rad9A is a novel oncogene, found to be upregulated in a number of cancers and high mRNA levels are thought to have a protective effect on tumour growth.  This thesis describes two novel functions for the Rad9A protein.  The first is as a facilitator for the nuclear translocation of the Claspin adaptor protein, required for successful Chk1-mediated checkpoint activation.  The second is as part of a novel nuclear structure containing important members of the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway.  Work described herein also confirms the existence of a Rad9A paralogue, Rad9B, that partially rescues defects associated with Rad9A-deficiency and is expressed in both tumour and undifferentiated embryonic stem cell lines.  This work discusses these findings in the context of current literature and provides future experiments to continue investigations into the function of this vital checkpoint protein.</description>

   <description>Bandpass microwave filters are often modeled as a set of coupled discrete and localized resonators. This model is adequate in the narrow-band case. It, however, fails to describe accurately compact structures where stray couplings can be strong. &#xd;
 	To address this problem, a new view is proposed in this thesis. Instead of basing the model on localized discrete resonances, we start by constructing a model that is based on the global resonances of the structure. These are the resonances that the ports see and emerge when the entire structure is treated as a single unit. The resulting circuit, the transversal circuit, is universal. It is valid for any coupled resonator filter. The circuit is used in optimization of compact and ultra wideband suspended stripline filters and excellent results were obtained.&#xd;
   	In order to relate the global-eigen modes model to the conventional model, the issue of&#xd;
representation of microwave filters is investigated in detail. It is shown that a microwave filter can be represented by an infinite number of similar coupling matrices by using different modes as basis. According to this new view, a similarity transformation in microwave coupled resonator filters is interpreted as a change of basis. Two circuits that are related by a similarity transformation represent the same filter structure by using different sets of modes as basis.&#xd;
  	These conclusions were exploited in establishing a design theory for filters with dual-mode cavities. The new theory leads to direct and accurate design techniques that need no, or minimal, optimization. No tuning is used in the CAD steps. Tuning may only be required to account for manufacturing tolerances. A new tuning configuration is described and validated by computer simulation.&#xd;
  	A novel dual-mode filter with improved quality factor and reduced sensitivity is developed and designed within the same approach. The filter is fabricated and measured and excellent results are achieved. The same design methodology was used to introduce a new class of dual-mode dual-band microwave filters with improved sensitivity. It is also shown that canonical dual-mode filters can be designed within the same view with minimal local optimization of the input cavity.</description>

   <description>In block-selective solvent, the rod-coil block copolymers can form various micellar structures.  With block copolymers that contain a conjugated polymer block, the conformation of the conjugated polymer can be reflected by spectral changes in the solution.  Therefore, it is of interest to study the relationship between the spectral changes and the nature of the conjugated polymer. &#xd;
The fundamental physical properties of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) were studied.  Five P3HT samples with different molecular weights were used.  We have determined the relationship between physical and spectral properties of this polymer and its molecular weight.  In particular, we have found that the refractive index increments, the maximum absorbance wavelength, extinction coefficients, and the emission wavelengths, increase with molecular weight.&#xd;
Diblock copolymers of poly(3-hexyl thiophene)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (P3HT-b-PHEMA) were also studied.  The morphological and spectral changes of these block copolymers were studied at various stages of micelle formation in block selective solvents.  The relationship between the volume fraction of the P3HT block and their physical and spectral properties were also discussed.</description>

   <description>This study provides a biological perspective on the potential of using year-round sanctuaries to protect largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Although the Rideau Lakes bass sanctuaries have been present for more than 70 years, a lack of empirical rationale has resulted in a considerable debate regarding their usefulness. Using radio telemetry in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, the current study indicates that largemouth bass behaviour is influenced by the structural complexity of the habitats they occupy. In high-structure habitats, bass tend to have smaller utilization areas, displacement rates and radial displacements relative to those occupying low-structure habitats. All largemouth bass were captured and released (after transmitter implantation) in high-structure areas; however, more than half (12 of 23) of these individuals made spring (closed fishing season) relocations to low-structure areas where most (11 of 12) remained for the duration of the study. Behaviour is important to consider because of the influence it has on the level of sanctuary protection received by a largemouth bass. Twelve individuals began the study in the high-structure habitats of Lake Opinicon’s Murphy Bay fish sanctuary; however, only five remained in high-structure habitats throughout the study to receive full open season protection, two others received partial protection and four largemouth bass received no open season sanctuary protection because they made spring relocations to low-structure areas outside of the sanctuary. The results of this study provide an important biological perspective for the evaluation of year-round bass sanctuaries. Further research is needed to understand the specific causes of observed behaviours and to investigate how open and closed season protection of a year-round sanctuary translates into overall bass fishery benefits. Therefore, we recommend the maintenance of the Rideau Lakes bass sanctuaries as year-round regulations until there is sufficient empirical evidence to support their re-designation or removal.</description>

   <description>This qualitative case study investigated how an elementary school shaped the acculturation processes of grade 3-4 immigrant students. It was grounded on John Berry’s model of acculturation strategies which maintains that the existence of multiculturalism in the host society is a necessary condition for the integration of immigrants. Also, Geneva Gay’s conceptualization of culturally responsive teaching was accepted as the analytical framework which represents the actualization of multiculturalism in school settings. &#xd;
The site of the study was an elementary school with a large number of immigrant students in Western Canada. The study used participant observation and interviews as methods of data collection. The audio recording of the classroom sessions for five full weeks, interviews with teachers and students, as well field notes were the sources of data. &#xd;
The analysis of the data showed that there was little evidence of culturally responsive teaching in the classroom. Findings suggest that these grade 3-4 students were receiving an education which is usually typified as the education for working-class children, were detached from their own culture, were taught by a curriculum defined by themes and orientation from Western/mainstream culture, and were experiencing a whole series of disconnected relationships among teachers, parents, and themselves. It was concluded that, despite the powerful multicultural policies at the provincial and school board level,  school practices, and teachers’ attitudes were reflecting the melting pot-model of host society in Berry’s model and the process of institutional acculturation favoured assimilation rather than integration.</description>

   <description>This study examines the geographies of the Bloody Falls massacre story, an account of a massacre of a group of Inuit by a group of Dene allegedly witnessed by explorer Samuel Hearne along the Coppermine River in July 1771. Working from an understanding of story as a relational and material ordering practice, and based on archival, ethnographic, and other qualitative research methods, I consider how the storying of Bloody Falls has ordered colonial and capitalist relations, relations of violence and desire, and relations of decolonization and Indigenous self-determination in the Central Canadian Arctic. The study contributes to theoretical, empirical, methodological, and ethical concerns in geography. I intervene in debates about the materiality of knowledge, power, and practice and suggest that recent turns to the material and the ontological in geographic scholarship risk abandoning important theoretical and political resources that are&#xd;
necessary for producing engaged and informed knowledge about the colonial past and present. Drawing on actor-network, feminist, postcolonial, and antiracist theories as well as geographic understandings of discourse, I advance a more rigorously materialist assessment of discursive processes and consider the methodological implications of tracing cultural, economic, and political geographies through stories. The study also contributes to understandings of the Bloody Falls massacre by highlighting the importance of copper in the event and describing the ways in which Inuit and Dene story the massacre and its implications. I advance an alternative framework for understanding northern Indigenous geographies and Indigenous-settler relations in Canada involving attention to the geographies of response and responsibility and to the materiality, relationality, and practices of storytelling. At a time when increased attention is being focused on the Canadian North, whether in terms of climate change, sovereignty, resource extraction, or militarization, this study elaborates a critical narrative geography of the region that might facilitate efforts to decolonize northern knowledge and practice.</description>

   <description>Identities are present in the interactions between individuals and organizations.&#xd;
Online shopping requires credit card information, while e-government services require social security or passport numbers. The involvement of identities, however, makes them susceptible to theft and misuse.&#xd;
The most prominent approach for maintaining the privacy of individuals is the enforcement of privacy policies that regulate the flow and use of identity information.&#xd;
&#xd;
This approach suffers two drawbacks that severely limit its effectiveness. First, recent research in data-mining facilitates the fusion of partial identities into complete identities. That holds true even if the attributes examined are not, normally considered, to be identifying. Second, policies are prone to human error, allowing for identity information to be released accidentally.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents a system that enables an individual to interact with organizations, without allowing these organizations to link the interactions of that individual together. The system does not release individuals' identities to&#xd;
organizations. Instead, certified artificial identities are used to guarantee that individuals possess the required attributes to successfully participate in the interactions. The system limits the fusion of partial identities and minimizes the effects of human error. The concept of using certified artificial identities has been&#xd;
extensively researched. The system, however, tackles several unaddressed scenarios.&#xd;
&#xd;
The system works not only for interactions that involve an individual and an organization, but also for interactions&#xd;
that involve a set of individuals connected by structured relations. The individuals should prove the existence of relations among&#xd;
them to organizations, yet organizations cannot profile the actions of these individuals. Further, the system allows organizations to be anonymous, while proving their attributes to individuals. Reputation-based trust is incorporated to help individuals make informed decisions whether to deal with a particular organization.&#xd;
&#xd;
The system is used to design applications in e-commerce, access control, reputation management, and cloud computing. The thesis describes the applications in detail.</description>

   <description>In recent times the need for educational research dedicated to engineering education has been recognised. This PhD project is a contribution to the development of engineering education scholarship and the growing body of engineering education research. In this project it was recognised that problem solving is a central activity to engineering. However, it was also recognised that the conditions for doing engineering are changing, especially in light of pressing issues of poverty and environmental sustainability that humanity currently faces, and as a consequence, engineering education needs to emphasise problem definition to a greater extent. One mechanism for achieving this, which has been adopted by some engineering educators in recent years, is through courses that explicitly relate engineering to social justice. However, creating this relationship requires critical interdisciplinary thinking that is alien to most engineering students. In this dissertation it is suggested that for engineering students, and more generally, engineers, looking at their practice and profession through a social justice lens might be seen as a threshold that needs to be crossed. By studying the variation present among students in three different courses at three different North American universities, the intention was to understand how students approach and internalise social justice as a perspective on engineering and/or develop their abilities to think critically. A conceptual model to frame the study was developed by combining elements of threshold concept theory and the educational research methodology, phenomenographic variation theory. All three of the courses studied operated on a similar basic pedagogical model, however, the courses were framed differently, with social justice in the foreground or in the background with the focus on, in one case, ethics and in the other, sustainability. All courses studied appeared to be successful in encouraging engineering students to engage in critical thinking and a similar general trend in the development of students’ conceptions of social justice was observed in each of the three courses. However, it does appear that if one is interested in developing an articulated understanding of social justice, with respect to engineering, that an explicit focus on social justice is preferable.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-02-10 13:18:17.667</description>
   <description>Objective: Primarily, to determine if affective Theory of Mind (ToM) decoding differs between patients with bipolar disorder who are experiencing mania, euthymia, or depression. Secondarily, to determine if a bias in ToM in patients experiencing different affective episodes is related to a positive, negative, or neutral valence of the target. Finally, to determine if mental state decoding is related to the severity of depressive, manic, or anxious symptoms Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, study of ToM in patients with bipolar disorder experiencing mania (n = 14), depression (n = 25), or euthymia (n = 20), using the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task” (Eyes Task) and the Animal Task developed to control for nonsocial response demands of the Eyes Task.  Measures of depressive and anxious symptoms were taken using self-report scales. Interview measures of depressive and manic symptoms were also conducted. A review of patient records was conducted to collect information regarding medications, and course of illness variables. Results: Patients experiencing mania were significantly impaired in mental state decoding compared to euthymic and depressed patients with bipolar disorder. No significant difference was observed between the depressed and euthymic groups. These relationships were maintained when controlling for age of illness onset and Animal Task accuracy. No effect of valence was found. Manic symptom severity was negatively correlated to Animal Task accuracy but no other relationships between Eyes and Animal Tasks and the severity of manic, depressive, or anxious symptoms were found. Group differences in Eyes Task performance were not due to differences in demographics, axis I comorbidities, history of psychosis, or course of illness measures. Limitations: The sample was too small to assess differences between acutely and chronically ill patients. There was no assessment of neurocognition or intelligence using tasks previously validated with manic patients. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder experiencing mania were significantly impaired in mental state decoding compared to patients who were depressed or euthymic. The deficit in ToM decoding in manic patients independent of indicators of illness severity may be indicative of qualitative differences in interpersonal dysfunction between mania, depression, and euthymia in patients with bipolar disorder.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-26 15:51:55.044</description>
   <description>This thesis explores the relationship between contemporary stresses, paleotectonic structure, and seismicity within continental interiors. This is achieved by combining a variety of geophysical and geological data coupled with numerical stress analysis to form seismotectonic models for local seismic zones in eastern North America.&#xd;
&#xd;
The work focusses on two main areas: (1) Southern Ontario, a region with low to moderate earthquake activity, which is structurally dominated by the Grenville orogen. Numerical models are used to show that both increased seismicity and an identified perturbation in the local stress orientation could be explained by reactivation of basement faults. (2) The Charlevoix seismic zone, a region of comparatively high background seismicity and large historic events, which is structurally controlled by an Iapetan rift and a meteorite impact structure. Although the rift faults are poorly aligned for reactivation in the regional stress field, modelling indicates that if they are sufficiently weak, they may act as a conduit, channelling higher stresses into the interior of the fractured crater zone, triggering much of the background seismicity. Furthermore, interaction with the crater acts to enhance rift fault slip near their intersection points, matching the observed pattern of large events in the seismic zone. The results also highlight a potential structural bias inherent in intraplate focal mechanisms. The faulting style of large earthquakes is heavily influenced by the regional structural trends, while smaller events, which can take advantage of local complexity in fault orientation, produce mechanisms more indicative of local stress conditions. &#xd;
&#xd;
Concepts developed with these studies as well as a comparison with the eastern Tennessee seismic zone are used to propose a regional model for eastern North American seismicity. Seismicity may be explained by a large deformation zone between the rigid North American craton and the Atlantic oceanic crust. Differential motion across the zone is accommodated by infrequent large earthquakes that localize on the major paleotectonic structures, which may produce a regional counterclockwise stress perturbation within the deformation zone. Stress orientations deduced from smaller magnitude events illustrate this regional perturbation.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-09 08:43:16.931</description>
   <description>A class of phosphonium cyclopentadienylide ligands was first reported in 1956 by Ramirez and Levy, who synthesized triphenylphosphonium cyclopentadienylide. They discovered that this ylide was unusually inert, for instance being unreactive with ketones; they attributed this unusual stability to its ability to undergo charge delocalization. It was subsequently found that the ylide coordinates to metals in η5 fashion, and thus one might anticipate a rich chemistry involved with these ligands, although surprisingly little research on this&#xd;
fascinating ligand has been reported over the past 50 years. More recently, the&#xd;
coordination chemistry of its analogous compound, methyldiphenylphosphonium&#xd;
cyclopentadienylide, has been investigated, specifically using group six transition&#xd;
metals. As an extension of the latter work, we have now successfully developed a&#xd;
general synthetic route to similar phosphonium 1-indenylide compounds, IndPL3&#xd;
(L3 = Ph3, PMePh2, PMe2Ph).&#xd;
The coordination of these compounds is of particular interest given that the&#xd;
compounds that form exhibit planar chirality and, as a result, enantioselective&#xd;
catalytic properties are anticipated. Furthermore, reactions involving two molar&#xd;
equivalents of phosphonium 1-indenylide, where two ligands coordinate, would&#xd;
produce diastereomers.It was our attempt to extend this work to group 4 metal&#xd;
halides, specifically to form coordination compounds of the type [TiCl3(IndPL3)]Cl&#xd;
and [TiCl2(IndPL3)2]Cl2. These compounds could be of great importance as&#xd;
enantioselective polymerization catalysts, or alternatively anti-cancer agents.</description>

   <description>Patients with dementia are often unaware of their disease and do not seek medical attention; thus, health care providers must shift to "active detection" to identify at-risk patients early. No previous studies have focused on promoting this shift, so this study evaluates the efficacy of a new program to improve the knowledge and confidence of primary care providers in the early detection, diagnosis, and management of mild dementia.&#xd;
Physicians and nurses (n = 38) were recruited from 14 practices in Ontario, Canada. The Mild Dementia Knowledge Transfer Program was run at each practice. As a Neuroscience Master’s student I demonstrated the cognitive assessment procedures, and recipients assessed remaining patients with my guidance. Assessments included patient interviews using a Data Gathering Form –developed for the Program – to provide informal cognitive assessment, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. The procedures were discussed between assessments to enhance learning. Later, recipients discussed the assessment results with the dementia specialist and myself; diagnoses and initial care plans were formulated collaboratively. Questionnaires measuring knowledge and confidence regarding detection, assessment and care of mild dementia were developed to measure change pre-post and three months after the Program. Linear mixed-effects models analysis with time as fixed effect and intercept as random effect was conducted to test change. &#xd;
Program recipients showed increases in knowledge-confidence score after the program (10.3; P &lt; .001) paralleling increases in both knowledge and confidence sub-scores; there was no decline after three months (P = .83). No differences were observed between medical and nursing staff. The number of assessments done by recipients was positively associated with knowledge-confidence change (P = .01). Most recipients (70%) rated the program as excellent; 65% rated interactivity as the best part, 34% rated time commitment as the worst part, and 91% rated the program as making it easier to detect dementia.&#xd;
Due to the complex nature of dementia, the Program was performance-oriented, specialist-supported, clinic-based, and flexible to the needs of recipients. It showed acceptability and feasibility within primary care, and the results support its’ efficacy to improve primary care providers’ self-rated knowledge and confidence in mild dementia care.</description>

   <description>Experiencing a traumatic event during childhood or adolescence is not a rare event, yet there is little written that examines the impact that trauma and the resulting stress have in the school context, from the perspective of the youth. Traumatic stress manifests itself in internalizing and externalizing behaviours that can significantly impact academic and social functioning, and the psychosocial well-being of youth. In the absence of disclosure, teachers are often unaware that trauma may be at the root of emotional and behavioural needs seen in the classroom and may be the reason for more subtle shifts in behaviour, achievement, appearance, and demeanour. The protective nature of school connectedness, and specifically student-teacher relationships and caring, positive school climates, in increasing engagement and decreasing at-risk behaviours and emotional distress (Blum, 2005, Bond et al., 2007; Klem, &amp; Connell, 2004) holds promise for these students. School and teachers can play an important role in improving well-being and in mitigating long term negative outcomes. Research in this area is essential as students with trauma histories and subsequent mental health needs are at greater risk for delinquency, substance abuse, suicide, chronic health problems, and diminished educational and employment success than their peers (Bardone, 1998; Edwards, Anda, Felitti, &amp; Dube, 2004; Fergusson, 2007). &#xd;
     This qualitative study describes the experience of four young adults who had each experienced varying traumatic life events during childhood and adolescence. The interviews sought to understand how trauma impacted the high school experience for the participants, perceptions of teacher support, and to hear their advice on how teachers can best support their learning and well-being. Results of the cross-case analysis showed the importance of noticing and validating subtle signs of student distress, of connections with caring teachers, and of teacher initiated offers of support. The youth also emphasized the importance of being seen and related to as a person and not solely as a student, highlighting the need for schools to focus on student well-being as well as academic functioning.  These findings emphasize the importance that caring connections with teachers can have in supporting the well-being of students who have experienced trauma.</description>

   <title>Analysis of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Antigens Presentation by Macrophages</title>

   <description>The activation of cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses requires antigen presentation by professional antigen presenting cells. Macrophages (MØ) can regulate CTL responses but little is known about the role played by splenic macrophages (Sp-MØ) in antigen cross-presentation.&#xd;
Here, we established, and characterized, an efficient culture method for generating Sp-MØ. By monitoring MØ markers, we found that 7-days Sp-MØ resembles the red pulp macrophages (RPMØ) phenotypic characteristics. The phagocytic capacity of Sp-MØ was increased as the cells become more differentiated. Thus, increased differentiation of Sp-MØ in vitro can be macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) driven, which allows for an optimal condition to increase the yield of the spleen-derived MØ.&#xd;
As a result of examining the antigen presentation of Sp-MØ during differentiation, we reported that Sp-MØ down-regulated their ability to cross-present the cell-associated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP) but not the soluble OVA proteins without altering their capacity to directly present LCMV antigens after infection. Mechanistically, we defined the cytosolic pathway as the dominant cross-presentation pathway used by Sp-MØ. Further analysis revealed a direct relationship between Sp-MØ differentiation, phagosomal acidification, and antigen cross-presentation. As Sp-MØ become more mature, their vesicular phagosomal system acquired high acidic characteristics, which adversely affected antigen cross-presentation due to potent and enhanced antigen degradation.&#xd;
We also addressed the capacity of diverse LCMV antigens, generated during virus infection, to induce LCMV-specific CTL responses via cross-presentation by employing antigen donor cells (ADCs) that provide sufficient LCMV antigens after virus inactivation with no possible direct antigen presentation. Our results demonstrated that the ADCs induced LCMV-specific CTL responses in vitro and in vivo. Out of the four CTL epitopes tested (NP396, NP205, GP33, and GP276), in vitro cross-presentation were dominated by LCMV-NP396 epitope; while the in vivo cross-priming has shifted towards LCMV-GP33 and NP396 epitopes.&#xd;
Collectively, the data presented in this thesis have defined for the first time important factors that influence Sp-MØ culturing in vitro and highlighted a potential role for the Sp-MØ in regulating CTL&#xd;
iii&#xd;
responses via cross-presentation, and characterized how different epitopes from LCMV are cross presented in vitro and in vivo.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-13 18:32:29.294</description>
   <description>In this thesis we modify the Made-To-Measure (M2M) algorithm to be dynamically selfconsistent&#xd;
and apply it to the problem of generating equilibrium collisionless systems with&#xd;
non-spherical halos. Our M2M algorithm systematically adjusts the masses of particles in a&#xd;
system slowly, keeping the system in equilibrium. The adjustments are performed according&#xd;
to some given constraints and proceed until pseudo-observations of the system match&#xd;
the constraints. We use this algorithm to generate isolated triaxial dark matter halos and&#xd;
disk-halo systems with prolate halos. The isolated triaxial dark-matter halo simulations&#xd;
provide a test for the algorithm. These tests show that our algorithm can generate equilibrium&#xd;
collisionless systems with non-spherical halos, but we also find that our algorithm&#xd;
requires a large amount of computational time to converge to the final target system. The&#xd;
disk-halo simulations show that prolate halos modify the morphology and velocity profile&#xd;
of dark matter dominated disks that cause errors in the measurement of the inclination and&#xd;
understanding the rotation curve. As a result of these errors, a mass estimate from the&#xd;
observed rotation curve of a disk in a prolate halo will depend on the observers position&#xd;
relative to the disk. The mass estimates from the same disk observed at different positions&#xd;
may vary by up to a factor of three.</description>

   <description>Tree-planters are likely to suffer from musculoskeletal injuries during their short work season.  The objective of this research is to identify the biomechanical mechanisms that contribute to these injuries with an overall goal of reducing injury frequency and severity.&#xd;
Pre- and post-season discomfort questionnaires were administered to workers in two tree-planting camps to identify areas of the body most prone to injury.  Musculoskeletal pain and discomfort were significantly higher post season.  Greatest pain and discomfort were reported in the feet, wrists and back, while the highest frequency of pain was reported in the back.  &#xd;
Upper body and trunk postures were recorded during the tree-planting task in the field using digital video and inclinometers.  Results indicated that deep trunk flexion occurred over 2600 times per day and workers spent at least half of their workday in trunk flexion greater than 45 degrees.  Although results provide useful insight into injury mechanisms, postural data were two dimensional.  &#xd;
Inertial motion sensors were used in a second field study the following season to examine differences in three-dimensional upper limb and trunk relative joint angles during commonly used tree seedling unloading methods.   Results showed trunk rotation up to 50 degrees combined with deep trunk flexion during parts of the task. Trunk flexion and rotation were significantly less when the tree seedling load was distributed asymmetrically as compared to symmetrically.  &#xd;
Joint reaction forces in the lower body and trunk during the same unloading methods was examined during a simulated planting task in a lab environment.  Greatest joint reaction forces and non-neutral postures occurred when the tree was inserted into the ground.  Right-loaded planting bags resulted in more substantial differences in posture and joint reaction forces than either left-loaded or even-loaded bags.  Axial forces were greater in the right leg than the left throughout the task, regardless of loading condition.   &#xd;
In conclusion, underlying biomechanical mechanisms for injury during tree-planting seem to be a combination of awkward postures (particularly the trunk), repetitive motions, and carrying of heavy loads.  Different seedling unloading strategies did not result in substantial overall differences in posture or joint reaction forces.</description>

   <description>Sport has become so deeply in engrained in Western culture that society’s understanding of it has become permeated with common sense.  Deromanticizing the idea of sport, researchers have recently come to study sport as a cultural formation, asking that it be understood as an institution with a complex historical background.  At its core, sport can be understood as an institution that is problematic.  This idea opens the door for researchers to critically analyze the structure of sport and the power relations at play in sport and consumer culture.  The central focus of the project examines the political economic structures and processes that have led to the complex conditions of the commodification of the professional athlete in twenty-first century Western society.  As such, this project will address how athletes, such as soccer stars Mia Hamm and David Beckham, have been utilized as commodities to reach niche markets, represent multiple identities, and to maintain normative ideas of sport and society.  In its entirety, this project will address how social, cultural, and historical processes converge to shape twenty-first century Western sport.</description>

   <description>Total knee replacement is the gold standard treatment for restoring mobility and relieving pain associated with osteoarthritis when other medical therapy has failed.  Revision surgery is necessary when the replaced knee fails, which is often a result of implant damage (such as wear) or poor kinematics.&#xd;
&#xd;
Design optimization is a method for finding the best shape for a component using an optimization approach considering one or multiple performance metrics.  The shape of a parametric candidate design can be manipulated by an optimization algorithm, which seeks to minimize an objective function subject to performance constraints and design space limitations.  During multiobjective design optimization, multiple performance measures are minimized simultaneously, the relative importance of each determined using a weighted sum.  This approach can also be used to derive a Pareto curve or frontier which graphically describes the relationships (or trade-offs) between the performance measures.  &#xd;
&#xd;
It was hypothesized that a trade-off exists between wear and kinematics performance in total knee replacements.  The objective of this research was to test this hypothesis by using multiobjective design optimization to describe this relationship with a Pareto curve.  It was first necessary to develop and validate numerical frameworks for wear and kinematics simulations, using models constructed using a parametric modeller.  The Pareto curve was then generated using a combination of single objective and multiobjective design optimizations considering these two performance measures.&#xd;
&#xd;
Single objective optimization for wear yielded a theoretical design with superior wear resistance when compared to a typical commercially available knee design.  Single objective optimization for kinematics yielded a theoretical design capable of higher flexion, as well as more natural laxity characteristics.  After performing multiobjective design optimization, the resulting Pareto curve showed that there is, in fact, a trade-off between wear and kinematics performance.  When considering optimum designs, in order to improve the wear performance it was necessary to sacrifice kinematics performance, and vice-versa.  This previously suspected but never verified nor quantified relationship can be used to improve total knee replacement designs, as well as help healthcare providers select the best implants for their patients.</description>

   <description>The Miguel Auza mine, located in Zacatecas State, Mexico, is a vein-type polymetallic epithermal deposit hosted in deformed argillite, siltstone and greywacke of the Cretaceous Caracol Formation.  Silver-rich base metal veins (0.2 m to >1.5 m wide) are spatially associated with NE-striking, steeply SE- dipping (70-80º) faults over a strike length of 1.6 km and a depth of 460 m.  &#xd;
	&#xd;
	Three distinct structural stages are correlated with hydrothermal mineral deposition: Stage I is characterized by normal faulting and early hypogene alteration of the sedimentary rock. Stage II is associated with reverse-sense reactivation of early normal faults, dilation of bedding planes/fractures, and deposition of barren calcite + pyrite veinlets. Sub-stages IIA and IIB are related to the development of reverse-fault-hosted quartz-carbonate sulphide veins and characterize the main stage of mineralization.  Associated hydrothermal minerals during the main stage of mineral deposition are quartz, muscovite, and calcite.  Stage III involves late NW-SE striking block faulting, brecciation and calcite veining.  Later supergene oxidation of veins led to deposition of Fe-oxides and hydroxides.&#xd;
	&#xd;
	The main Ag-bearing minerals comprise pyrargyrite, tetrahedrite- freibergite, polybasite-antimonpearceite, and acanthite, with associated sulphides including galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and pyrite.  In the main ore zone, base metal sulphides are commonly intergrown with the Ag-bearing sulfosalts. Compositions of Ag-rich tetrahedrite + pyrargyrite + sphalerite indicate a primary depositional temperature around 325-350ºC for the late phase of sub-stage IIB. &#xd;
&#xd;
	40Ar/39Ar dating of wall-rock illite associated with stage I alteration yields an age of 46.58 ± 0.30 Ma.  Ages of  46.01 ± 0.55 Ma, and 44.55 ± 0.22 Ma were obtained for vein muscovite related to the main stage (sub-stage IIB) of ore deposition.  These ages correspond to the later stage of the Laramide orogeny in Northern Mexico.   &#xd;
	The geometric relationship between the various structures, vein types, and the regional Miguel Auza fault zone suggest episodic reverse-sense reactivation of normal faults. Based on (1) the tectonic setting, (2) spatially related igneous rocks, (3) ore and gangue mineralogy, and textures (4) geochemical signature, and (5) inferred temperature of formation, the Miguel Auza deposit is interpreted to be an intermediate-sulfidation type deposit.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
The main objective of a ventilation system is to provide the quality and quantity of the airflows throughout the mine and to ensure safe and health conditions for the workers to the level specified by the mining regulations. &#xd;
&#xd;
In uranium mines the planning and operation of the ventilation systems have a large impact on production due to the fact that the first engineered step to control radiation contamination is with ventilation. The techniques used to maintain good air quality in uranium mines are based on providing very large volumes of air, maintaining the residence time of the air at a minimum in all working areas, guaranteeing zero recirculation of the air and designing a highly flexible ventilation system.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis introduces a general approach that can be use in ventilation planning for uranium mines and outlines the importance of conducting medium and long term ventilation planning exercises. Case studies are presented to illustrate the use of ventilation modeling software, spreadsheets, scheduling software and mine design software in order to manipulate data in ventilation planning exercises. The results from these exercises will indicate any required additional infrastructure. A section of this thesis deals with simulation exercises used for validation of the design work. Once the new infrastructure is in place and access to reliable field date is available, the models are calibrated and validated to permit further refinement of the ventilation system.&#xd;
&#xd;
This work has demonstrated how one can effectively design, asses and manage underground mine ventilation systems with the help of ventilation modeling software, when such a tool is properly used through calibration and validation exercises.&#xd;
&#xd;
The methodology for the reconciliation between ventilation and production planning proposed in this thesis will assist the uranium mining industry in maintaining the health and safety of the workers underground while efficiently achieving economic production targets.</description>

   <description>Infill development, including the reuse of vacant and derelict industrial buildings, is a desirable form of development as municipalities face the pressure of continuous growth. There have been numerous industrial sites in Toronto that have already been redeveloped through adaptive reuse, but there are still sites that remain underutilized, and additional sites continue to become vacant across the city. As the prior use can no longer be supported, these buildings are demolished in order to construct new buildings, or they undergo adaptive reuse.&#xd;
The purpose of this report is to explain how the environmental, locational, legislative, market and financial characteristics of industrial buildings located in Toronto affect whether they are chosen for adaptive reuse. Additionally the similarities and differences between public and private sector adaptive reuse projects will be studied. This report will complement existing research completed by others on the characteristics of adaptive reuse projects in Ontario, and provide more specific information regarding the industrial adaptive reuse market in Toronto.&#xd;
The case study approach used in this report consists of eight industrial adaptive reuse projects in the City of Toronto. Interviews with the developers were completed to gain valuable insight into the factors that were present and affected the selection of the building. The analysis involved reviewing the data from the interviews to identify the similarities and differences between the characteristics of the developers’ projects. &#xd;
Based on the analysis of the interviews, four recommendations were made. These recommendations are provided with the goal of assisting developers during the selection of industrial buildings in Toronto to undergo adaptive reuse. Each recommendation considers the characteristic that a building and site should or should not possess.&#xd;
Recommendation 1: The site should not contain ground water contamination&#xd;
Recommendation 2: Use concrete buildings if planning an addition&#xd;
Recommendation 3: Select a building with interior demising walls removed&#xd;
Recommendation 4: Select a building that has financial or development incentives promoting reuse</description>

   <description>Miniemulsion technology is attracting increasing interest for the preparation of nano-size particles. However, the barrier to industrialising miniemulsion-based products is the lack of an energy efficient and scalable homogenisation device. Current laboratory techniques consist of batch units, however trends are leaning towards developing continuous processes. The objective of the work presented here is to investigate the use of the rotor-stator (RS) and static mixers (SM) as homogenisation devices and ultimately develop a continuous emulsification/polymerisation process for the preparation of miniemulsions.&#xd;
Initially we investigated the RS as a homogenisation device and found that we were able to generate droplets ranging from 300 nm to 2 μm, at industrially pertinent solids content. Subsequently, we investigated the use of SM and compared their performance in terms of mean droplet size evolutions with the rotor-stator. We were able to generate droplets &lt; 200 nm in size and polymerise them in a stable fashion. &#xd;
All the available emulsification devices were then compared in terms of power/energy consumption, droplet size distributions and shear rates. It was observed that with energy costs being of similar orders of magnitude, SM imposed less shear, produced relatively narrow distributions and were better adapted to scale-up, making them the optimal choice for miniemulsification.&#xd;
Energy savings were increased by reducing coalescence during the emulsification step by using in situ generated surfactants, ultimately reducing emulsification time. Neutralising a water-soluble base with an oil-soluble acid almost instantaneously generates in situ surfactants at the oil-water interface. The reduction in emulsification time was partially attributed to the elimination of the relatively slow adsorption step &#xd;
typical of preformed surfactants.&#xd;
These results were used to show that emulsifying in situ formulations at moderate flow rates in line with SMX mixers can substantially reduce emulsification time from 30 minutes, with preformed surfactants, to ~30 seconds. With such a rapid emulsification step, it was possible to test the feasibility of the continuous emulsification process followed by polymerisation in a tubular reactor. Comparing this process with a batch operation, similar results for the ratio of NP/ND and conversion were obtained, but the continuous process was accomplished in a single step.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-19 18:50:46.661</description>
   <description>This study examines the effects of morphological awareness and reading ability on the accuracy and speed of reading multi-morphemic words. Test of word reading ability and morphological awareness were given to 134 Grade 5 students. They also completed a test of their ability to read morphologically complex words, in which accuracy and response times were recorded. Two sets of response time scores were calculated – the first taking into account only the accurately pronounced words, and the second taking into account both the accurately and the inaccurately pronounced words. These words varied in surface frequency, base frequency, and transparency. Analysis of variances indicated that multi-morphemic word reading accuracy and speed were positively related to reading ability, morphological awareness, surface and base frequencies, and transparency. Significant interactions showed that (a) high base frequency increased reading accuracy and speed for words with low surface frequency, particularly for the less able students, and (b) the combination of high base frequency and transparency increased reading accuracy and speed for words with low surface frequency. Findings were similar for accuracy and both sets of response time scores. These results imply that morphological knowledge is involved in the reading of multi-morphemic words, suggesting that investigation of instruction that targets the morphological characteristics of words is warranted.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-27 10:16:11.811</description>
   <description>Background: 	Breast cancer is a complex disease, both phenotypically and etiologically. Accordingly, the responses to various treatments in the adjuvant setting among individuals vary considerably.  There is a demand for tools that can distinguish patients who may benefit or may suffer from particular systemic treatments. We hypothesized that combination of data on genetic biomarkers with data from traditional clinical and pathophysiological (clinicopathologic) factors using traditional Cox model or Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, a new machine learning method, may provide a better tool for prediction of benefits to chemotherapy for the treatment of early breast cancer than using either biomarker or clinicopathologic data alone. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods:  This project included 531 patients from NCIC-CTG MA.5 trial who had data on both clinicopathologic factors, such as age, tumor size, ER status, type of surgery, tumor grade and lymph node involvement, and biomarkers assayed on tissue microarrays (TMAs), including HER2, p53, CA9, MEP21, clusterin, pAKT, COX2 and TOP2A. The Cox model and SVM methods were used to develop prognostic indices for relapse-free or overall survival with either data from TMAs and clinicopathologic assessments alone or their combination.  The prognostic indices developed were then examined for their value as predictive classifiers for benefits from CEF treatment. The power of the predictive classifiers derived was evaluated and compared using the bootstrap approach.&#xd;
Results: None of the prognostic indices developed were found to have significant predictive value, although the prognostic index developed using SVM method based on only biomarkers yielded a marginal significant p-value (p=0.0527) for the interaction between classifier and treatment. In accordance with results published previously, the interaction between the classifier developed based on HER2 or TOP2A and treatment was significant (p=0.02 and 0.04 respectively). Comparisons based on the bootstrap approach indicate classifiers developed based on SVM performed better than those based on the Cox model method.&#xd;
Conclusions: Combination of data using biomarkers and clinical-pathological factors, and using either the traditional COX model method or the new machine learning method was not shown to perform better than two single previously known biomarkers in prediction of response to CEF treatment for early breast cancer.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-20 21:34:12.295</description>
   <description>This thesis studies issues in auctions and contests. The&#xd;
seller of an object and the organizer of a contest have many&#xd;
instruments to improve the revenue of the auction or the&#xd;
efficiency of the contest. The three essays in this dissertation&#xd;
shed light on these issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapter 2 investigates how a refund policy affects a buyer's&#xd;
strategic behavior by characterizing the equilibria of a&#xd;
second-price auction with a linear refund policy. I find that a&#xd;
generous refund policy induces buyers to bid aggressively. I also&#xd;
examine the optimal mechanism design problem when buyers only have&#xd;
private initial estimates of their valuations and may privately&#xd;
learn of shocks that affect their&#xd;
valuations later. When all buyers are&#xd;
\emph{ex-ante} symmetric, this optimal selling mechanism can be&#xd;
implemented by a first-price or second-price auction with a refund&#xd;
policy. Chapter 3 investigates how information revelation rules affect the&#xd;
existence and the efficiency of equilibria in two-round&#xd;
elimination contests. I establish that there exists no symmetric&#xd;
separating equilibrium under the full revelation rule and find&#xd;
that the non-existence result is very robust. I then characterize&#xd;
a partially efficient separating equilibrium under the partial&#xd;
revelation rule when players' valuations are uniformly&#xd;
distributed. I finally investigate the no revelation rule and find&#xd;
that it is both most efficient and optimal in maximizing the total&#xd;
efforts from the contestants. Within my framework, more&#xd;
information revelation leads to less efficient outcomes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapter 4 analyzes the signaling effect of bidding in a two-round&#xd;
elimination contest. Before the final round, bids in the&#xd;
preliminary round are revealed and act as signals of the&#xd;
contestants' private valuations. Compared to the benchmark model, in which private valuations are&#xd;
revealed automatically before the final round and thus no&#xd;
signaling of bids takes place, I find that strong contestants&#xd;
bluff and weak contestants sandbag. In a separating equilibrium,&#xd;
bids in the preliminary round fully reveal the contestants'&#xd;
private valuations. However, this signaling effect makes the&#xd;
equilibrium bidding strategy in the preliminary round steeper for&#xd;
high valuations and flatter for low valuations compared to the&#xd;
benchmark model.</description>

   <description>The error choice (EC) technique was among the earliest indirect attitude measures developed and was originally designed to overcome social desirability concerns (Hammond, 1948).  This programme of research set out to advance EC research in several ways.  First, an exploratory factor analysis examined whether participants’ responses to the EC target items produced a systematic pattern of responding.  The factor analysis indicated that a single underlying factor best accounted for the data.  Additionally, the EC measure demonstrated good reliability across the 3 studies.  &#xd;
Second, these studies provided evidence that the EC measure is, at least in part, attitudinal.  The EC measure showed a modest positive correlation with the direct measure of attitude in all 3 studies.  This suggested that participants’ responses to the EC target items were, at least partially, attitudinal.  Additionally, across the studies participant’s EC scores did not change between the high and low social desirability conditions, while participants’ scores on the direct measure were significantly more positive in the high social desirability condition.  These findings suggest that the EC measure is, to some degree, resistant to socially desirable responding. &#xd;
Studies 2 and 3 also represent the first time that recommendations made by early EC researchers to improve the EC technique were systematically examined.  In these studies the amount of time participants had to complete the EC measure was restricted.  The time restriction did not improve the performance of the EC measure.  The other optimal condition examined in Study 3 was the presence and absence of filler items in the EC measure.  Indeed, removing filler items from the EC measure did not negatively impact its performance.&#xd;
Finally, this programme of research compared the EC measure with more contemporary indirect measures of attitude.  In Study 2, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) was compared with the EC and direct measure. In Study 3, the Personalized IAT was compared to the EC and direct measure.  The results revealed that neither the IAT nor PIAT correlated with the EC measure.  In summary, these results suggest the EC technique holds some promise as an approach to attitude measurement and is well worth resurrecting.</description>

   <description>This thesis puts forth an ethnographic, contextual social constructionist account of the non-mainstream body manipulations practiced at the annual Body &amp; Soul body modification event in Western Canada. The radical practices at this event include sewing limes and other items to one’s body, flesh hook pulling, and/or receiving “third eye” piercings and cheek skewers; thus, it constitutes an example of extreme deviance subject to negative reactions from outsiders. This research assumes that meaning is discursively and symbolically constituted by people via an active process of claimsmaking wherein competition for definitional control of reality ensues. From a qualitative stance, data were derived from a combination of participant observation fieldwork at Body &amp; Soul and subsequent in-depth interviews with participants. The results demonstrate a trend in the (counter)claimsmaking activity of practitioners of this extreme form of body modification wherein paradoxically the nature of their deviance is reconstructed and aligned with conformist goals via discursive, corporal, and symbolic claims that simultaneously offer an implicit critique of mainstream Western culture. The results are interpreted as part of a discursive competition for definitional control of extreme body modification, strategy in the negotiation and management of a stigmatized identity, means of implicit social criticism, and an unconventional expression of conventional values.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-23 12:49:29.244</description>
   <description>Size reduction represents one of the most energy-intensive and costly processes in the extraction of valuable minerals and rocks. Drilling and blasting, being the first operation in the size reduction chain, may have a significant downstream effect, influencing mine economics. This thesis investigates effects of blasting on subsequent size reduction operations.&#xd;
A series of small scale blasts have been conducted, and the fragments have been screened, drop weight tested, crushed and their Bond Work Index and breakage parameters have been determined. The process was repeated for 3 different types of granite blocks (Stanstead, Laurentian, and Barre granite) using samples not blasted previously and samples blasted with three different powder factors (0.391, 0.782, and 1.173kg/m3). As well, four types of different charge methods with the same powder factor were used to investigate the influence of blasting energy distribution on grindability in the case of Barre granite. Subsequently, stress wave collision blasting and the effect of delay timing were tested under the same powder factor conditions.&#xd;
Generally, powder factor resulted in the most significant changes in the breakage parameters as well as fragmentation. The Bond Work Index showed a small decrease as a function of powder factor, which can be considered to be material dependent.&#xd;
There is indication that distribution of charge resulted in better grindability while fragmentation seems to be similar in both cases and better than when air decking was used. The results from Barre granite showed clearly that stemming affected fragmentation by producing finer fragments.</description>

   <description>The purpose of my research is to contribute to the de/reconstruction of knowledge about the Black educational experience in Canada. Using post-positivist paradigms, critical Black feminist standpoint theory and auto-ethnographic qualitative methods of inquiry, I provide an insider perspective on being Black and female in the Canadian educational system, from primary and secondary experiences through the journey of claiming a higher education. My self-study explores the social and cultural forces that have impacted my life, highlights systemic racism throughout the journey, identifies themes in the educational experiences of Black students and Black women, uncovers contradictions between the dominant discourse and my reality, and incites reflection and action on the implications for teaching, research and educational policy.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-26 11:44:51.418</description>
   <description>The signaling pathways of tyrosine kinase Trk receptors and their downstream biological effects are well known, but the parameters controlling the interactions between the receptors and their natural ligands still remain to be defined. Recent published reports from our laboratory indicate that nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced TrkA receptor activation is dependent on a membrane cellular sialidase. This sialidase activity specifically targets and hydrolyzes sialyl α-2, 3-linked β-galactosyl residues resulting in the desialylation and activation of the receptor. These findings support a novel hypothesis that places mammalian sialidase(s) in a cycle of activation of these receptors by their natural ligand. Taken together, they also predict a prerequisite desialylation of Trk receptors caused by a sialidase on the cell surface enabling the removal of a steric hindrance to receptor dimerization. Until now, the sialidase associated with neurotrophin-treated live Trk-expressing cells has not been identified. The molecular mechanism(s) of sialidase activation by neurotrophin factors binding to their receptors also remains unknown. In this thesis, the novel role of Neu1 sialidase in the activation of ligand-induced TrkA and TrkB receptors has been identified. It has been reported for the first time that Neu1 is already in complex with naïve and ligand-induced Trk receptors. In addition, a membrane sialidase mechanism initiated by NGF binding to TrkA has been indentified. It suggests a potentiation of GPCR-signaling via membrane Gαi subunit proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation to induce Neu1 sialidase activation in live TrkA- and TrkB-expressing cells and primary neurons. These results establish a unique mode of regulation of Trk receptors by their natural ligand and define a new function for Neu1 sialidase. Preliminary data indicate that members of the family of tyrosine kinase receptors like epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin receptor are also under the same regulatory control of Neu1 sialidase. Recent reports from the laboratory have indicated that ligand-induced activation of the highly glycosylated Toll-like receptors, TLR-2,-3 and -4 is also dependent on Neu1 sialidase on the cell surface. Taken all together, the findings in this thesis uncover a Neu1 and MMP-9 cross-talk on the cell surface which is critically essential for neurotrophin-induced Trk tyrosine kinase receptor activation and neuron function.</description>

   <description>Background and Purpose: Physical activity is significantly lower in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population compared with age-matched sedentary controls. Self-efficacy is a significant contributing factor to exercise behaviour in the healthy and various chronic disease populations; however, little information is available on self-efficacy and exercise in the ESRD population. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between self-efficacy and physical activity levels in individuals with ESRD and to determine factors which may contribute to this relationship. &#xd;
Participants: Patients (127 hemodialysis and 5 peritoneal dialysis) were recruited from the Kingston General Hospital renal units.&#xd;
Methods: Self-efficacy was measured using the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES) and the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSES). Physical activity was measured using the Human Activity Profile (HAP). Responses on the HAP resulted in 2 scores: the maximum activity score (MAS) and the adjusted activity score (AAS). Contributing factors, such as age, co-morbidities, length on dialysis (vintage), medications, dialysis efficacy (Kt/V), albumin, prealbumin, total protein, protein catabolic rate (PCR) and hemoglobin (HgB) were collected from patient records. &#xd;
Results: The average MAS and AAS scores were 62.5±15.6 and 49.1± 21.0 (SD), respectively, which are substantively lower than those in the healthy population. Serum albumin was the sole contributing factor to physical activity such that AAS in those with lower levels of albumin (24-30g/L, 31-34 g/L) was less than those with higher levels of albumin (p&lt;0.05). Both MAS and AAS were significantly lower in those with diabetes (n=66) compared to those without (n=66), as was the difference between MAS and AAS. Age and self-efficacy explained 51% of the variance in MAS. Age, self-efficacy and serum albumin level explained 59% of variance in AAS. &#xd;
Discussion and Conclusion: Individuals on dialysis have lower functional capability within their maximal energy ability at any age and this difference is more pronounced among those with diabetes. Physical activity was substantially influenced by an individual’s self-efficacy, age and serum albumin level. These findings indicate that self-efficacy must be taken into account and used to promote greater participation in physical activity in the ESRD population.</description>

   <description>This case study evaluates the process of affirmative business development within&#xd;
a federal correctional psychiatric facility for federal offenders with mental illness serving&#xd;
long or indeterminate sentences. It examines how the business associates (i.e., offenders&#xd;
with mental illness who are self-employed in the affirmative business) change through&#xd;
working in the affirmative business, and what challenges and benefits they experience.&#xd;
The aim is to disseminate knowledge that will assist in developing supported employment&#xd;
opportunities for offenders with serious mental illness.&#xd;
Qualitative and participatory research methods are used to give a descriptive&#xd;
account of the experience of 14 business associates within a critical paradigm. The&#xd;
framework that guided this study included the Canadian Model of Occupational&#xd;
Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E); the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB); and&#xd;
a Community Economic Development (CED) approach. Strategies were incorporated to&#xd;
maintain rigor and ensure trustworthiness and quality of the findings. The data outlined&#xd;
the first 6 years of the affirmative business. Interviews and observations were conducted&#xd;
during year 7 and 8 of the affirmative business. Reviews of documents and artifacts were&#xd;
current and historical in nature.&#xd;
Three overlapping phases of business development, outreach, and replication are&#xd;
discussed along with their corresponding core tasks of skepticism, tensions of growth,&#xd;
and transformation. Within each phase, six overlapping themes emerge: business&#xd;
development; personal growth, recovery, and hope; ongoing support; the prison&#xd;
environment; volunteerism; and the community. Self-employment within the affirmative&#xd;
iii&#xd;
business emerges as having an encouraging effect on promoting empowerment and&#xd;
recovery, increasing self-reliance and self-efficacy, helping symptoms, learning new&#xd;
ways to resolve conflict, and improving understanding of employment support needs.</description>

   <description>Mobility occurs naturally in many distributed system applications such as telecommunications and electronic commerce. Mobility may reduce bandwidth consumption&#xd;
and coupling and increase flexibility. However, it seems that relatively little work has&#xd;
been done to support quality assurance techniques such as testing and verification of&#xd;
mobile systems.&#xd;
This thesis describes an approach for checking the conformance of a mobile, distributed application with respect to an executable model at runtime. The approach&#xd;
is based on kiltera -- a novel, high-level language supporting the description and execution of models of concurrent, mobile, distributed, and timed computation. The&#xd;
approach allows distributed, rather than centralized, monitoring. However, it makes&#xd;
very few assumptions about the platform that the mobile agent system is implemented&#xd;
in.&#xd;
We have implemented our approach and validated it using four case studies. Two&#xd;
of them are examples of mobile agent systems, the two others are implementations&#xd;
of distributed algorithms. Our approach was able to detect seeded faults in the&#xd;
implementations. To check the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach more&#xd;
comprehensively a mutation-based evaluation framework has been implemented. In&#xd;
this framework a set of a new mutation operators for mobile agent systems has been&#xd;
identified in order to automatically generate and run a number of mutants programs&#xd;
and then evaluate the ability of our approach to detect these mutants. We found that&#xd;
our approach is very effective and efficient in killing the non-equivalent mutants.</description>

   <description>In this study we look at the problem of analysing survival data in the presence of&#xd;
longitudinally collected covariates. New methodology for analysing such data has&#xd;
been developed through the use of hidden Markov modeling. Special attention has&#xd;
been given to the case of large information volume, where a preliminary data reduction&#xd;
is necessary. Novel graphical diagnostics have been proposed to assess goodness of fit&#xd;
and significance of covariates.&#xd;
The methodology developed has been applied to the data collected on behaviors&#xd;
of Mexican fruit flies, which were monitored throughout their lives. It has been found&#xd;
that certain patterns in eating behavior may serve as an aging marker. In particular it&#xd;
has been established that the frequency of eating is positively correlated with survival&#xd;
times.</description>

   <title>Neo-Traditionalist Fantasies: Colonialism, Modernism, and Fascism in Greater France 1870-1962</title>

   <description>Neo-traditionalism was a classicist and colonialist project for regenerating the nation, inaugurated by French avant-garde intellectuals in the fin-de-siècle. Most were formerly Symbolists. They wanted to regenerate a dissolute French population employing new fantasies of identity which would overcome the fragmentation of French culture in the era of modern imperialism. The neo-traditionalist world-view was an alchemy of conflicting cultural concerns which defined the era. These intellectuals hoped that, according to their specific re-arrangement of these concerns, they would redefine and regenerate France itself. Neo-traditionalism was an aesthetic-political project which was conservative and revolutionary, colonial and metropolitan, traditional and avant-garde.&#xd;
This dissertation is a history of this specific set of ideas and strategies which occupies an uneasy position at the intersection of several conventional historical topics: modernism, fascism, and colonialism. Neo-traditionalism was none of these per se, and yet touched upon all of these topics. This is not a history of France quarantined from its overseas territories, but a history of France that includes colonial Algeria as it was seen by most French contemporaries: an integral and legal part of territorial France. This study also focuses on the lives of two neo-traditionalist intellectuals, Louis Bertrand and Albert Camus, whose works helped define and redefine these shared ideas over time, as they moved across the colonial threshold between France and Algeria, and as they sought to&#xd;
iii&#xd;
redefine each society in the image of the other. Bertrand was the founder, almost sui generis, of the conventions of settler literature in the colony. He was also one of the most pro-Nazi French intellectual s of the twentieth century. Camus still remains the most celebrated writer of that settler literature, as well as being almost equally as certain the most famous anti-fascist French intellectual of the twentieth century. There is much that distinguishes their lives and work from one another, but there is also a great deal that they share. One was fascist, the other was anti-fascist. But they shared particular visions of society that are only understood in exploring the intellectual subcultures which shaped their world-view on either side of the Mediterranean: a neo-traditionalist world-view.</description>

   <description>Recent years have witnessed a tremendous amount of research in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) due to their numerous real-world applications in environmental and habitat monitoring, fire detection, object tracking, traffic controlling, industrial and machine-health control and monitoring, enemy-intrusion in military battlefields, and so on. However, reducing energy consumption of individual sensors in such networks and obtaining the expected standard of quality in the solutions provided by them is a major challenge. In this thesis, we investigate several problems in WSNs, particularly in the areas of broadcasting, routing, target monitoring, self-protecting networks, and topology control with an emphasis on minimizing and balancing energy consumption among the sensors in such networks. Several interesting theoretical results and bounds have been obtained for these problems which are further corroborated by extensive simulations of most of the algorithms. These empirical results lead us to believe that the algorithms may be applied in real-world situations where we can achieve a guarantee in the quality of solutions with a certain degree of balanced energy consumption among the sensors.</description>
