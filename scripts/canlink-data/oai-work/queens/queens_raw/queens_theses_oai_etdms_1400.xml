   <description>Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in human breast cancer.  However, there are few predictive, prognostic, or therapeutic targets of breast cancer metastasis.  Ezrin, a membrane cytoskeletal cross-linker, is frequently over-expressed in human breast cancer and is required for motility and invasion by cultured epithelial cells.  Our group has recently shown that ezrin acts co-operatively with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, in the transformation of epithelial cells, in which ezrin is phosphorylated on specific tyrosines, such as Y477, by Src (91, 93).  We therefore examined whether Src/ezrin interaction also regulates invasion and metastasis of breast cancer.  This thesis presents the following results: 1) In a murine system, ezrin and Src are differentially localized in nulliparous, lactating mammary glands and PyMT-induced tumours, with pronounced apical expression in nulliparous mammary glands but non-polarized strong cytoplasmic expression in PyMT-induced tumours.  2) Increased expression and activation of ezrin, Src and Met in PyMT-induced tumours compared to normal breast tissues was observed.  A concomitant increased expression of activated Stat3 and HGF was also observed in PyMT-induced tumours, consistent with the establishment of an HGF/Met autocrine loop.  3) In invasive human breast tumours, from a premenopausal patient cohort, ezrin showed significantly greater cytoplasmic localization compared to non-neoplastic epithelial ducts in normal mammoplasties.  4) In a mouse breast carcinoma xenograft model, a Y477F ezrin mutant (not phosphorylatable by Src), significantly reduced local invasion of primary tumours and spreading into visceral organs, yet, it did not significantly affect primary tumour growth rate.  5) Y477F ezrin-expressing tumours exhibited focal areas of incomplete membranous ezrin staining which was absent in control tumours.  Moderate/strong cytoplasmic ezrin staining was evident in both tumour groups.  Thus, ezrin is differentially localized in non-invasive versus invasive mammary tumours.  Our study implicates a role of the Src/ezrin pathway in regulating local invasion and metastasis of breast carcinoma cells and provides a clinically relevant model for assessing the Src/ezrin pathway as a potential prognostic marker and treatment target for invasive breast cancer.</description>

   <description>The applications of the pesticide DDD to the water of the St. Lawrence River prior to and during the World Exhibition of 1967 in Montréal, Québec were examined. The pesticide was applied between 1965 and 1967 in excess of 16 000 kg to abate nuisance shadflies. To determine if the evidence was captured in the environmental media, sediment cores were sampled from a fluvial lake downstream of the Expo ’67 site, Lac Saint-Pierre, Québec, Canada and from an upstream fluvial lake, Lac Saint-François, Ontario and Québec, Canada.  Sequential slices of sediment cores from the two lakes were analyzed and compared for pesticide concentrations using gas chromatography and dated using 137Cs isotopes. The percentage of total carbon in the sediments was also analyzed to express pesticide concentrations on a carbon basis. Concentrations of DDD and DDE in Lac Saint-François ranged from below detection to 12.2 ppb and from below detection to 11.5 ppb, respectively. Concentrations of both contaminants were highest approximately between the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, consistent with historical use patterns. DDT was not detected in sediment slices from Lac Saint-François at any depth. Concentrations of total DDD, DDE and DDT in Lac Saint-Pierre ranged from below detection to 26.4 ppb, from below detection to 20.9 ppb, and from below detection to 80.5 ppb, respectively. Contaminant concentration distributions demonstrated very complex and multi-peaked profiles that were not reflective of expected historical use patterns. The influence of sediment grain size and carbon content on the contaminant profiles was examined but did not appreciably explain the complexity. Mixing of sediment due to physical processes in combination with other variables may help explain the complex contaminant and 137Cs activity profiles. Although pesticide concentrations were generally higher in the downstream lake compared to the upstream lake, conclusions of the source of the pesticide cannot be accurately drawn due to the complex signals in Lac Saint-Pierre and the absence of DDT in Lac Saint-François, which prevents the comparison of a DDD:DDT breakdown ratio.</description>

   <description>A recent model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) suggests that the neuropathological, behavioural and cognitive symptoms progress in stages. There is substantial evidence for a prodromal stage of PD, during which time pre-motor symptoms develop. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a risk factor for developing PD and may be part of the pre-motor stage. In both disorders, neuropathological α-synuclein aggregates are thought to be a direct cause of the resulting symptoms. One model has shown that in rats, proteasome inhibition produced by systemic exposure to environmental toxins results in α-synuclein pathology and motor behaviour dysfunction that mimics the progression of PD in humans. The present study examined the hypothesis that the systemic proteasome inhibition model would produce pre-Parkinsonian RBD-like pathology in rats. It was expected that sleep disturbances would be seen prior to behavioural disturbances in rats treated systemically with PSI (a proteasome inhibitor). Following baseline sleep recording and training on the inclined beam-traverse task, rats were injected with PSI (a proteasome inhibitor) or ethanol (control), 6 times over 2 wk. Sleep recording over 8 wk and behavioural testing over 16 wk provided no evidence of sleep disturbances or motor dysfunction. Post-mortem immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissue provided no evidence of PSI-associated α-synuclein aggregates in the locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus (dorsal part), or substantia nigra (areas involved in RBD and/or PD). These results did not provide support for RBD as a prodromal phase of PD within the systemic proteasome inhibitor-based model and add to a growing body of research reporting inconsistent findings using this model. We suggest that systemic PSI exposure in rats does not produce a viable model of RBD or PD. Whether RBD is an early symptom in the progression of PD remains to be established.</description>

   <description>The ability for megavoltage computed tomography patient setup verification using a cobalt-60 (Co–60) gamma ray source has been established in the context of cobalt tomotherapy. However, it would be beneficial to establish improved cobalt imaging that could be used on more conventional units. In terms of safety and efficiency, this imaging technique would provide the patient with less exposure to radiation. Digital tomosynthesis (DT) is an imaging modality that may provide improved depth localization and in-plane visibility compared to conventional portal imaging in modern Co–60 radiation therapy. DT is a practical and efficient method of achieving depth localization from a limited gantry rotation and a limited number of projections. In DT, each plane of the imaging volume can be brought into focus by relatively displacing the composite images and superimposing the shifted dataset according to the acquisition geometry. Digital flat-panel technology has replaced the need for multiple film exposures and therefore the speed of imaging and capabilities for image processing has put DT in the forefront of both clinical and industrial imaging applications. &#xd;
The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate the performance of an experimental system for megavoltage digital tomosynthesis (MVDT) imaging using a Co–60 gamma ray source. Linear and isocentric acquisition geometries are implemented using tomographic angles of 20-60° and 10-60 projections. Reconstruction algorithms are designed for both acquisition geometries. Using the backprojection approach, the data are shifted and added to reconstruct focal planes of interest. Depth localization and its dependence on tomographic angle and projection density are visualized with an anthropomorphic head phantom. High contrast resolution at localized depths is quantified using the modulation transfer function approach. Results show that focal-plane visibility is improved for larger tomographic angles and that focal-plane visibility has negligible dependence on projection density. Lastly, the presence of noise and artifacts in the resulting images are quantified in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio and the artifact spread function. The work presented here is expected to provide the justification required to proceed with a prototype Co–60 MVDT system for patient set-up verification in modern Co–60 radiation therapy.</description>

   <description>Within Canada’s federal correctional system, prison-hospitals provide both in-patient and ambulatory services to incarcerated male offenders. With at least 12% of incarcerated men being identified at intake as having a mental health disorder, the need for these services is significant (Sampson, Gascon, Glen, Louie &amp; Rosenfeldt, 2007).  While some description of the mental health services provided, internal operational reviews, and external health services accreditation surveys of these prison-hospitals are available, there has been very little attention paid to the challenge of trying to balance the dual correctional and mental health mandates of these facilities. Research in comparable facilities and services in the United States describe mental health care as a ‘non-system’ of care and state that mental health staff receive very little system-wide direction regarding the provision of services (Cruser &amp; Diamond, 1996; Elliot, 1997).&#xd;
This is a study that critically analyses how mental health care has become subordinated to correctional and security priorities in a Canadian prison-hospital.  Five key elements identified in the policy implementation literature are used to explicate the everyday experiences of frontline staff as they work to provide mental health services in this correctional environment.  The thesis argues that the mental health work of frontline prison staff is subverted by a lack of vision for mental health care within organizational policy structures, allowing the detailed correctional policy structures to become the dominant force in implementation and decision making. &#xd;
Using the theory and method of institutional ethnography developed by sociologist Dorothy Smith, the analysis displays how the everyday activities of frontline staff are systematically organized by routine organizational policy structures to advance the correctional mandate of the prison-hospital while mental health care has slowly declined.  The study finds that mental health care is socially organized as a ‘zero-sum game’. As policy texts have concerted and coordinated the everyday activities of frontline staff in predictable ways, gains for the correctional and security priorities of the prison-hospital have meant significant and repeated losses for mental health care.  However, there are ‘windows of opportunity’ for frontline staff to advance the mental health mandate of the prison-hospital if they work together.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the influence of nutritional phosphate (Pi) deprivation on extracellular proteins secreted by the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Initial studies compared the secretome of Pi-sufficient (+Pi) versus Pi-deficient (-Pi) Arabidopsis cell cultures by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry identified 18 different secreted proteins that were upregulated by at least 2-fold by –Pi Arabidopsis. They were predicted to function in Pi scavenging, cell wall and ROS metabolism, proteolysis, and pathogen responses. The relationship between mRNA levels and relative amounts of selected secretome proteins was assessed. The results indicate that transcriptional control is but one of many factors contributing to Arabidopsis Pi starvation responses and highlight the importance of parallel biochemical and proteomic studies of –Pi plants. Three purple acid phosphatase (APase) isoforms were fully purified from the culture media of –Pi Arabidopsis cells and identified as AtPAP12 (At2g27190) and two AtPAP26 (At5g34850) glycoforms. As each purple APase exhibited broad substrate specificities and pH-activity profiles, it is hypothesized that their combined activities facilitate Pi scavenging from soil-localized organophosphates during nutritional Pi deprivation. AtPAP26 is dual-targeted during Pi stress since an earlier report demonstrated that it is also the principal intracellular (vacuolar) APase upregulated by -Pi Arabidopsis. The results indicate that differential glycosylation influences AtPAP26’s substrate specificity and subcellular targeting. An atpap26 T-DNA insertional mutant lacking AtPAP26 transcripts and immunoreactive AtPAP26 polypeptides exhibited: (i) 9- and 5-fold lower shoot and root APase activity, respectively, which did not change in response to Pi starvation, (ii) a 40% reduction in secreted APase activity during Pi deprivation, (iii) 35 and 50% reductions in free and total Pi concentration, respectively, in shoots of –Pi plants, and (iv) impaired shoot and root development when subjected to Pi deficiency. By contrast, no deleterious influence of AtPAP26 loss of function was apparent in +Pi plants. The results establish a firm role for AtPAP26 in the acclimation of Arabidopsis to Pi deficiency. The identification and functional characterization of secreted proteins upregulated by –Pi Arabidopsis is relevant to applied efforts to engineer Pi-efficient transgenic plants, needed to minimize the input of expensive, unsustainable, and polluting Pi fertilizers in crop production.</description>

   <description>Acrylic resins, synthesized from a mixture of monomers selected from the methacrylate, acrylate and styrene families, are the base polymer components for many automotive coatings due to their excellent chemical and mechanical properties. The low molecular weight polymers with reactive functionalities are made via high-temperature starved-feed free-radical solution semibatch terpolymerization, operating conditions that greatly promote the importance of secondary reactions, such as methacrylate depropagation, and acrylate backbiting, chain scission and macromonomer propagation. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, a generalized model for styrene/methacrylate/acrylate terpolymerization has been developed and formulated in the PREDICI software package and poorly understood high temperature mechanisms have been studied. Unknown rate coefficients for methacrylate depropagation, reactivity of acrylate macromonomer and penultimate copolymerization kinetics were determined via separate kinetic experiments. The generality of the terpolymerization mechanistic model was verified against data obtained under a range of polymerization conditions, and provides an exclusive insight into the kinetic complexity of methacrylate/styrene/acrylate terpolymerization at high temperatures.</description>

   <description>In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, inter-subject anatomical variability of the human brain has been a major challenge in finding reliable functional/anatomical correspondences. Assessment of brain-behavior relations involves a series of geometrical/statistical operations on brain images to minimize such inter-subject variability, so that group maps of brain activity relative to brain anatomy can be developed. Various methods of image registration, segmentation, and analysis have been proposed for mapping functional activity on to anatomical atlases of the brain. The two most common techniques that have been widely accepted and used by neuroimaging scientists are volume-based (VB) analysis using group registration methods and region-of-interest (ROI)-based methods using automated segmentation algorithms or macro/microanatomical probabilistic atlases for labeling. Nevertheless, the analysis results based on these techniques are significantly affected by the accuracy of the selected segmentation and/or registration methods. Furthermore, conventional fMRI data analysis techniques (VB, and ROI-based methods) mainly rely on the assumption that brain processes are common and universal among individual humans; however, besides anatomical differences, there also exist cognitive and behavioral variability among individuals due to differential engagement of brain networks even when performing an identical cognitive task. In this thesis, I have assessed the impact of anatomy-based alignment techniques (VB, and ROI-based methods) on sensitivity of fMRI data group analysis. I evaluated the effect of the type of inter-subject registration used and related factors on sensitivity of group-level fMRI data analysis. Furthermore, I have also assessed the goodness of fit of probabilistic maps by proposing an evidence-based framework for evaluation of probabilistic maps. As a test model, I have selected the human auditory cortex. Auditory cortex is an interesting yet challenging case with substantial inter-individual functional/anatomical variability. For the sake of ROI-based method of analysis, I have proposed a novel approach for automatic segmentation of Heschl's gyrus, which is the landmark for primary auditory cortex. Finally, in order to assess the impact of inter-subject variability in anatomy on functional organization, I analyze data from an fMRI study, which demonstrates that the degree to which anatomical registration compensates for functional variability depends on the brain region activated.</description>

   <description>Recent evidence indicates that the mature neocortex retains a higher degree of plasticity than traditionally assumed. Up- and down-regulation of synaptic strength, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), is thought to be the primary mechanism mediating experience-dependent plasticity of cortical networks. The present thesis investigate factors that regulate adult cortical plasticity, focusing on the role of neuromodulators, recent sensory experience, and different anatomical divisions of the cortex in influencing synaptic strength. First, I investigated the role of the neuromodulator histamine in gating plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of urethane anesthetized adult rats. Histamine applied locally in V1 produced an enhancement of LTP elicited by theta burst stimulation (TBS) of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and allowed a sub-threshold TBS to produce stable LTP. Second, the impact of visual deprivation on LTP in V1 was assessed. Animals that received 2 and 5 hr dark exposure showed greater potentiation of field potentials when stimulated though retinal light flashes or weak TBS of the dLGN, which failed to induce LTP in control animals kept in continuous light. Third, I performed a detailed characterization of LTP induced by different TBS protocols, recording in either the monocular or binocular segment of both V1 hemispheres (i.e., ipsi- and contralateral to the stimulated dLGN). Stronger, NMDA receptor-independent LTP was found in the contralateral V1. Interestingly, weak TBS induced LTD that was NMDA receptor-dependent in the ipsilateral V1. Furthermore, a lower LTP induction threshold was observed in the binocular than the monocular segment of ipsilateral V1. Lastly, I investigated cholinergic modulation of sensory-induced activity in the barrel cortex. Basal forebrain stimulation enhanced multi-unit activity elicited by whisker deflection, an effect that was more pronounced for weaker response driven by a secondary whisker than principal whisker deflection. &#xd;
	This thesis demonstrates that neocortical plasticity consists of multiple forms of synaptic modification. Adult cortical plasticity is greatly influenced by preceding activity of the synapse by various neuromodulator systems, and by anatomical subdivisions within primary sensory cortex fields. Together, these mechanisms may facilitate the detection, amplification, and storage of inputs to primary sensory fields of the neocortex.</description>

   <description>This thesis addresses the design and implementation of micro-inverters for grid-connected single-phase photovoltaic (PV) systems. Despite the existing research issues concerning Micro-inverters, they have recently become very attractive due to their modularity and capability of independent maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The complexity in the design of micro-inverters stems from strict grid connection standards and high expectations of compactness, large amplification gain, high efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions and excellent output power quality. Moreover, since micro-inverters are exposed to a wide temperature range, the reliability and life-time of this technology are major problems. The main limiting factor in the life-time of micro-inverters is the use of large electrolytic capacitors for power decoupling.&#xd;
&#xd;
New circuit configuration and control structures to design a compact and efficient micro-inverter with high quality and robust output power injection capabilities are introduced in this thesis. In the proposed topology electrolytic capacitors are eliminated, removing the obstacles in achieving a durable and reliable design. To achieve a compact design, the proposed micro-inverter consists of a soft-switching high frequency resonant converter at the input and a hard-switching lower frequency inverter with a high order filter at the output.&#xd;
&#xd;
Small and large signal models of the resonant converter are obtained to design controllers.  A new optimal controller and a design method are also proposed for the inverter that yield robust performance with a high quality output in the presence of grid voltage harmonics, impedance uncertainties and frequency changes. Furthermore, using a new nonlinear control strategy, a direct instantaneous power control method is proposed to achieve fast active and reactive power injections into the grid without using the measurement or calculation of active and reactive powers.&#xd;
&#xd;
A comprehensive steady state analysis is carried out to arrive at a final design that ensures optimum responses for all operating conditions. Moreover, for all proposed controllers, stability analysis is performed to guarantee sufficient stability margins accounting for uncertainties and nonlinearities. Analytical, simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-29 14:19:56.636</description>
   <description>In this dissertation, we investigate three different questions that are related to information asymmetry and principal-agent problems. The first question is whether principal-agent conflicts lead executives to influence the design of their own employment contracts to exploit the shareholders; the second is the question whether conflicts of interest hamper the effectiveness of affiliated analysts in detecting and curbing earnings management; and the third is whether small investors are at an informational disadvantage. The three studies provide evidence on the existence of information asymmetry and principal-agent problems in various contexts. In particular, we find that the benchmarking process of executive compensation observed is a remedy of the agency costs incurred; that analysts from independent research firms monitor firms they cover more effectively than analysts affiliated with investment banks; and, strikingly, that small investors actually may have better information regarding firms’ financials even when compared to professional equity analysts. Together, these studies provide new insights into the cornerstone problems of the finance literature.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-29 14:38:28.115</description>
   <description>Thesis Objectives&#xd;
The thesis research was undertaken to improve knowledge about caregivers needs and develop a means of assessment for the acute care sector. Specific objectives were: 1) identify and evaluate the applicability of a supportive care framework to guide in the comprehensive assessment of the needs of informal caregivers of patients with stroke, 2) describe the needs reported by a cohort of active caregivers, and 3) assess the utility of a tool for application in acute care stroke practice.&#xd;
Population and Setting&#xd;
	Family caregivers of patients admitted to hospital with an acute stroke in a major urban center. Focus group of nurses employed in acute stroke care at a regional stroke centre.&#xd;
Methods&#xd;
	1) Integrative study of the stroke research was conducted to identify the type and range of reported needs. 2) Mixed methods exploratory study of family caregivers of patients with acute stroke was conducted. 3) Focus group of nurses employed in acute stroke care was carried out to evaluate the applicability and feasibility of the assessment tool.  &#xd;
Results&#xd;
	Integrative Study: Seventeen studies that reported on the needs of family caregivers of patients with acute stroke were identified. Reported needs were wide ranging, crossed all domains and are similar to those reported in the stroke population.  &#xd;
	Exploratory Study: Ten family caregivers participated in a needs assessment using an already developed survey modified for the stroke population. All fully completed the 42 item survey and six of these caregivers initiated an impromptu post-survey discussion. The cohort of caregivers reported unmet needs in the six domains.&#xd;
	Nurses employed in acute stroke care reported that the new caregiver assessment would be useful in identifying family caregiver needs. &#xd;
Conclusions&#xd;
	The study identified a wide spectrum of needs experienced by this cohort of caregivers. Both caregivers and nurses found the assessment approach valuable in improving this area of care. Further refinement and validation of the survey would provide the specificity to identify the very different needs of individual families and would provide direction to the healthcare community in planning for a more seamless transition across the continuum.</description>

   <description>Calpains are a family of intracellular cysteine proteases activated by calcium.  They participate in many processes including cell motility, cell cycle progression and cell death, in response to calcium signaling.  Because calpain over-activation as a result of calcium dysregulation is a contributing factor to many disease states, these enzymes are important therapeutic targets.  Within the cell, calpains 1 and 2 are regulated by the protein inhibitor calpastatin.  This unstructured protein is specific for calpain, binds tightly, and recognizes only the activated form of the enzyme.  Detailed kinetic data obtained using surface plasmon resonance allowed the association and dissociation rates of each of the four calpastatin inhibitory domains to be measured.  Based on this, inhibitory domain 4 was selected to be co-crystallized bound to calpain 2.  The X-ray crystal structure of this complex provided both the first view of the active enzyme, as well as the first view of how it is inhibited. Calpastatin wraps around the enzyme making contact with each domain.  It lies in the active site as a contiguous polypeptide chain and escapes cleavage by forming a loop away from the catalytic cysteine. In addition to inhibiting substrate cleavage, calpastatin protects calpain in two ways; it prevents autoproteolysis, and it prevents calcium-dependent aggregation.  The crystal structure of the calpastatin:calpain complex revealed no obvious reason for this stabilization. To elucidate how this protection occurs, peptides were synthesized corresponding to conserved subdomains of calpastatin.  Surprisingly, each peptide alone was capable of preventing aggregation in vitro, by blocking hydrophobic patches exposed upon activation.  The increased hydrophobic surface of the activated enzyme may alter calpain’s affinity for other proteins such as substrates.  By binding across many domains of calpain, calpastatin could act to block protein-protein interactions.  These studies have characterized calpastatin’s interaction with calpain, which will further our understanding of the enzyme’s regulation and aid in the development of better calpain inhibitors.</description>

   <description>While the excess accumulation of abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (abdominal SAT and VAT, respectively), is independently associated with increased health risk, the relative amount of lower body SAT is associated with an improved health profile. In contrast to the established metabolic benefit of reducing VAT and abdominal SAT, the first study in this thesis investigated whether loss of lower-body SAT during diet and/or exercise induced weight-reduction resulted in a deterioration of metabolic profile in a sample of obese men (n = 58) and women (n = 49). After control for potential confounders, reductions in VAT, abdominal and lower body SAT were all associated with improvements in certain metabolic risk factors. However, only reductions in VAT and abdominal SAT remained associated with improvement in risk factors independent of changes in other AT depots.&#xd;
Recently, it was suggested that a large breast size among women may predict type-II diabetes risk independent of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. While the mechanism is unknown, a large breast size may predict health risk by indicating fat deposition in ectopic depots such as VAT or inter-muscular AT (IMAT). The second study investigated the independent associations between breast volume with metabolic risk and regional fat distribution in 92 overweight or obese premenopausal women. Although breast volume was not significantly associated with metabolic risk, after control for age, BMI and waist circumference level, women with the highest breast volume had approximately 1.1 and 1.3 kg more VAT and IMAT, respectively, by comparison to women with the smallest breast volume.&#xd;
In contrast to the metabolic benefits of weight loss among metabolically-abnormal obese (MAO) individuals, weight loss among metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals may be unnecessary or even harmful. In the third study, 63 MHO and 43 MAO men and women participated in an exercise or diet weight-loss intervention. In response to similar weight loss, MHO and MAO men and women showed significant improvements in insulin sensitivity. However, significant improvements in other metabolic variables (triglycerides, fasting glucose, HDL-cholesterol, and total cholesterol) were only observed among MAO, but not MHO subjects.</description>

   <description>Following a large seismic event in hard rock mines, there is a short-term increase in aftershock activity, which over time decays to background levels. During this time of elevated seismic activity the risk of aftershocks with sufficiently high magnitude to cause damage is also high. Workers are therefore restricted from re-entering affected areas for a specified time period. This is the re-entry protocol. The objective of this research has been to produce practical, standardized guidelines for the development of re-entry protocols.&#xd;
This thesis is divided into two parts. In Part I, current re-entry practices are evaluated based on the results of a survey of 18 seismically active mines, mostly in Ontario. Based on this compilation, a complete set of best practice guidelines are proposed.&#xd;
Part II of this thesis presents an in-depth study of the temporal evolution and characteristics of aftershocks and their implications for re-entry protocol development. Through this part of the thesis, eight mining and two crustal seismicity catalogues are used to study the statistical properties of aftershock sequences. These include the modified Omori’s law, Båth’s law, the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relation, the Reasenberg and Jones model, and the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. Statistical procedures for identifying the most consistent parameters of these relations were developed and tested. &#xd;
Despite the site specific nature of mining seismicity, consistent statistics were identified and used to develop guidelines for re-entry protocol development in Ontario mines without the requirement for previous intensive calibration. These simple recommendations are intended for those mines with limited historical seismicity, and to serve as a first approach guide for developing a re-entry protocol. Their applicability is, however, limited to single aftershock sequences.&#xd;
For mines with a significant seismic database a probabilistic approach for setting a family of decay curves (seismic envelopes) and estimating seismicity rate thresholds for re-entry protocol development is proposed. With this formulation it is possible to interpret the decay behaviour of new aftershock sequences and quantify the degree of confidence of the re-entry protocol decision making process in real-time. This is the recommended method for the standardization of re-entry protocol development.</description>

   <description>Current technologies such as anti-virus software programs and network firewalls provide reasonably secure protection at the host and network levels, but not at the application level. When network and host-level entry points are comparatively secure, public interfaces of web applications become the focus of malicious software attacks. In this thesis, we focus on one of most serious web application vulnerabilities, broken access control. Attackers often try to access unauthorized objects and resources other than URL pages in an indirect way; for instance, using indirect access to back-end resources such as databases. The consequences of these attacks can be very destructive, especially when the web application allows administrators to remotely manage users and contents over the web. In such cases, the attackers are not only able to view unauthorized content,but also to take over site administration. To protect against these types of attacks, we have designed and implemented a security analysis framework for dynamic web applications. A reverse engineering process is performed on an existing dynamic web application to extract a role-based access-control security model. A formal analysis is applied on the recovered model to check access-control security properties. This framework can be used to verify that a dynamic web application conforms to access control polices specified by a security engineer. Our framework provides a set of novel techniques for the analysis and modeling of web applications for the purpose of security verification and validation. It is largely language independent, and based on adaptable model recovery which can support a wide range of security analysis tasks.</description>

   <description>Stroke is the most common serious neurological condition worldwide. Members of the Black population are at an increased risk of suffering a stroke due to several risk factors which are more prevalent in this racial group. The purpose of this qualitative research study is to describe how African-Caribbean stroke survivors, who live in Canada, understand their illness and manage their care during the early recovery period. &#xd;
	Eight participants who were of African-Caribbean origin who were living in Canada and recovering from a stroke were interviewed. Results of the study indicate that participants were not knowledgeable about the risk factors for stroke, they did not recognize the warning signs of a stroke as a medical emergency, and they did not always follow treatment regimes recommended by their physicians.   Participants in the study described stroke as a catastrophic event, resulting in feelings of intense fear, being out of control, uncertainty, yearning for their old self, and feelings of detachment from their own body. Motivating factors in their recovery from stroke were the support of family, their own individual personal determination, and the acceptance of the illness by the participants. Nurses and physiotherapists were valued by the participants due to the role they played in improving their functional abilities.&#xd;
	Participants expressed a desire for nurses to become knowledgeable about the African-Caribbean culture, in order to provide them with education pertaining to diet as well as steps they can take to reduce their risk of having another stroke. &#xd;
Responding to the care needs of this population will require individualized nursing care which considers the influence of culture on how the illness is perceived.</description>

   <description>Recreational athletes are encouraged to use mental imagery by their coaches less frequently than elite athletes (Jedlic, Hall, Munroe-Chandler, &amp; Hall, 2007). The purpose of this study was to examine whether a mental imagery workshop would increase recreational level coaches’ encouragement of imagery to their athletes when compared to coaches attending a communication workshop. The workshops provided coaches with imagery or communication information and tools as well as role-playing opportunities. Recreational sport coaches (N = 132; M age = 41.80 years, SD = 9.67) completed the Coaches Encouragement of Athletes Imagery Use Questionnaire (CEAIUQ; Jedlic et al.), Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (CART-Q; Jowett &amp; Ntoumanis, 2004), and questionnaires assessing coaches’ demographics, confidence, knowledge, and attitudes towards imagery. These questionnaires were completed before the workshop and online four weeks later. Repeated measure MANCOVAs, controlling for sex and highest level coached, were performed comparing the coaches’ encouragement of imagery use, as well as their confidence, attitudes, and knowledge of mental imagery, across the two study groups. No group by time interactions were found for any of the five functions of imagery. However, group by time interactions were found for knowledge (F(1, 132) = 5.45, p = .02, ηp2 = .040), attitudes (F(1,132)  = 4.45, p = .01, ηp2 = .055) and confidence (F(1,132),= 7.10, p = .04, ηp2 = .032) towards imagery. Paired-samples t-tests demonstrated that the mental imagery group significantly increased their confidence from baseline to follow-up (t(65) = -2.75, p = .01). Findings provide direction for designing future coach education training programs and aid in understanding recreational sport coaches’ views on encouraging their athletes to use imagery.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2010-04-30 12:15:57.972</description>
   <description>This thesis is a study of the residential care for elderly people in Beijing, China. First, a set of statistical indicators are developed for mapping the spatial distribution of the elderly population and residential care facilities (RCFs). Secondly, in-depth, semi-structured interviews are used to understand the socio-cultural meanings of access, the decision making process in relocation, the well-being of elderly residents, as well as the challenges of residential care and social welfare reform. In total, 27 elderly residents, 16 family members, and five RCF managers were interviewed in six RCFs in Beijing. The constant comparative method is used to analyze all the transcribed interview materials.&#xd;
There are several major findings resulting from the research: the distribution of the elderly population and residential care resources is geographically uneven across the districts of Beijing and the supply of resources does not match the potential need. Elderly people and their family members choose residential care because of the shortage of community and home care resources and/or the advantages of residential care. The decision making process is a process of balancing geographical factors, quality of services, and financial affordability. Access to residential care is an interactive process influenced by geographical, economic, and social-cultural factors. The physical and socio-cultural environments of RCFs and individual’s sense of place play important roles in their adaptation and well-being after the relocation from the home to a RCF. Building up the active aging model with joint efforts from governments, society, RCFs, and individuals is helpful and effective for promoting the well-being of elderly residents in RCFs. At the end, the study also provides suggestions for the government, organizations, and RCFs on aspects such as administration, policy making, planning, volunteering, and management of RCFs to meet the challenges of residential care in China. &#xd;
The study confirms the importance of healthy living environments to the well-being of elderly residents. It also provides knowledge for understanding the reconfiguration of filial piety in decision making processes and utilization of residential care in current Chinese society. From a health geography perspective, this thesis is one of the first studies on residential care in China.</description>

   <description>Forecasting firms' earnings has long been an interest of market participants and academics. Traditional forecasting studies in a multivariate time series setting do not take into account that the timing of market data release for a specific time period of observation is often spread over several days or weeks. This thesis focuses on the separation of announcement timing or data release and the use of econometric real-time methods, which we refer to as an updated vector autoregression (VAR) forecast, to predict data that have yet to be released. In comparison to standard time series forecasting, we show that the updated forecasts will be more accurate the higher the correlation coefficients among the standard VAR innovations are. Forecasting with the sequential release of information has not been studied in the VAR framework, and our approach to U.S. nonfarm payroll employment and the six Canadian banks shows its value. By using the updated VAR forecast, we conclude that there are relative efficiency gains in the one-step-ahead forecast compared to the ordinary VAR forecast, and compared to professional consensus forecasts. Thought experiments emphasize that the release ordering is crucial in determining forecast accuracy.</description>

   <description>Incandescent lamps are now being gradually replaced by Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) as CFLs consume less power to produce the same light output and its lifetime is much longer than that of an incandescent lamp.  However, current CFLs have the following drawbacks: (1) the line current drawn from the CFL produce a large amount of unwanted harmonics that results in very poor input power factor; (2) the dimming performance of a CFL with conventional incandescent lamp dimmers is very poor.  The performance of the CFL depends on the design of the electronic ballast circuit that is located at the base of each CFL.  For a CFL electronic ballast to be practical, its size and cost is of utmost importance. Thus, the main challenge in the design of practical dimmable CFL ballasts is to solve the aforementioned CFL performance issues while minimizing its size and cost.  &#xd;
In the first part of this dissertation, two novel high power factor single-stage electronic ballast topologies are proposed to solve the poor power factor issue of the CFLs that are currently on the market.  Both proposed circuits have the following advantages: (1) only one switch is required in the power circuit; (2) the switch has both lower current and voltage stress than other conventional circuits; (3) the built-in power factor correction (PFC) circuit allows incandescent phase-cut dimmer to be used for dimming the CFL; (4) the circuit design is simple and it requires less system space compared to other conventional high PF electronic ballast topologies.  The second part of this dissertation proposes a new control circuit that enables the lamp to maintain high power factor throughout the majority of the dimming range.  In the proposed control scheme, the dimmer phase-cut angle is fed-forward to the control circuit.  The controller then determines the proper duty cycle based on the phase-cut angle to facilitate the desired dimming operation.  This novel control circuit was first implemented using analog circuitry. After assessing the performance of the analog version of the proposed controller, it was then digitally implemented through the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technique.  The feasibility and performance of both the proposed electronic ballasts and control concept have been verified through theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results on a 13W 4-pin D/E CFL from Osram Sylvania.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, three techniques are proposed to enhance the transient performance of voltage regulators (VR) for computer applications. Voltage mode control with load line positioning and phase current balancing technique is first introduced to maximize the transient response of the VR and to balance the phase current for multiphase VR under high frequency dynamic load conditions. The VR and its control method is modeled and analyzed in depth for its targeting applications. Secondly, a predictive non-linear voltage mode control method is digitally implemented to further enhance the transient response of the VR. The proposed control method enables the VR to operate at a lower switching frequency in the 250KHz range for higher efficiency during steady state operation but to respond quickly accordingly to transient events when necessary. This control technique allows the use of simple VR topologies and can reduce the number of bulk capacitors. Thirdly, a VR with Transient Circuit and digitally implemented non-linear control is introduced to greatly enhance the transient response of the VR. The proposed control method allows the VR to operate at a lower switching frequency in the 250KHz range for higher efficiency under static load condition, but to respond even quickly with the aid of the Transient Circuit upon large load steps. This method allows the use of simple VR topologies and can potentially remove all the bulk capacitors. In the thesis, theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments are given to describe and verify the proposed techniques.</description>

   <description>In recent years, a modified method to strengthen reinforced concrete (RC) structures has emerged involving application of fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) in the ‘near surface’ of a member. The near surface mounted (NSM) method entails placing a pre-cured FRP bar, rod, strip, or plate, along with an adhesive into a pre-cut groove or slot in the cover of a member. Advantages of the NSM technique over externally bonded (EB) systems include minimal surface preparation and installation time, the ability to anchor the FRP into an adjacent member, superior protection from mechanical and environmental damage, and superior bond properties. Although a number of laboratory studies, field applications, and experimental field projects have employed the NSM FRP strengthening technique, none of these have been performed in a climate where cold environments and freeze-thaw cycling could cause adverse effects. This thesis presents the results of an experimental program to investigate the flexural and bond performance and freeze-thaw durability of a specific NSM carbon/vinylester FRP tape strengthening system through a series of tests on strengthened slab strips and a series of pull-out bond tests. The effects of adhesive type (cementitious or epoxy) and exposure condition (room temperature, freeze-thaw, sustained load, or freeze-thaw under sustained load) are examined. The results indicate no discernable negative impacts on the performance of the grout strengthened members after exposure to freeze-thaw cycles and/or sustained load. The slab strips strengthened with epoxy adhesive displayed minor changes in ultimate load (less than three percent) after exposure to freeze-thaw cycles or a period of sustained load, while the combined effect of freeze-thaw cycles and sustained load produced an average reduction in ultimate load of eight percent. The epoxy adhesive strengthened pull-out bond tests experienced a 27% average drop in ultimate load after 150 freeze-thaw cycles. These results suggest that additional research on the combined effects of sustained load and freeze-thaw cycling are warranted, particularly for NSM strengthening applications using epoxy adhesives.</description>

   <description>We introduce a novel Syntax-based Security Testing (SST) framework that uses a protocol specification to effectively perform security testing on text-based communication protocols. A protocol specification of a particular text-based protocol under-tested (TPUT) represents its syntactic grammar and static semantic contracts on the grammar. Mutators written in TXL break the syntactic and semantic constraints of the protocol specification to generate test cases. Different protocol specification testing strategies can be joined together to yield a compositional testing approach. SST is independent of any particular text-based protocols. The power of SST stems from the way it obtains test cases from the protocol specifications. We also use the robust parsing technique with TXL to parse a TPUT. SST has successfully revealed security faults in different text-based protocol applications such as web applications and kOganizer. We also demonstrate SST can mimic the venerable PROTOS Test-Suite: co-http-reply developed by University of Oulu.</description>

   <description>This Ph.D. thesis reports the discovery and study of several morphologies of ABC triblock copolymer assemblies in block selective solvents.  One block copolymer self-assembled into helices (mostly double and some triple helices), and the other block copolymer formed a mixture of structures resembling hamburgers and striped cylinders.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The helices, biomimmetic structures which are unusual from block copolymer self assembly, were prepared from the triblock copolymer poly(n-butyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PBMA-b-PCEMA-b-PtBA).  They were formed spontaneously in several binary solvent mixtures including dichloromethane/methanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF)/methanol, and chloroform/methanol.  They were formed in the composition ranges where the mixtures were good for the PtBA block, poor for the PCEMA block, and marginal for the PBMA block.  The structure was studied and established by TEM, AFM, DLS and 1H NMR and by TEM tomography.   The mechanism and kinetics of helix formation was examined.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The Hamburger and striped cylinder structures were produced from poly(tert-butyl acrylate)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(succinated glyceryl monomethacrylate) or (PtBA-b-PCEMA-b-PSGMA) in mixtures of THF, (-)-sparteine and 1- or 2-propanol.  Here THF solubilized all the blocks of the copolymer, while propanol was a precipitant for the middle block (PCEMA), and the chiral amine, (-)-sparteine, complexed with PSGMA and made it insoluble.  Within the Hamburger-like structure, the “filling” was made of the complexed PSGMA chains and the "buns" were made of PCEMA.  The striped cylinders were made of stacking alternating PCEMA and PtBA stubs.  The PtBA chains were located on the outer surfaces of both of these structures.  With the hamburger structures, after PCEMA crosslinking, we were able to remove the chiral amine by dialysis and make the PSGMA chains soluble again in solvents such as N, N dimethylformamide.  The hamburgers were thus separated into two halves, with each half existing as a Janus particle, which had PtBA chains on one side and PSGMA chains on the other side.  The Janus particles might have interesting applications, such as in Pickering emulsion stabilization.</description>

   <description>As high bandwidth applications continue to emerge, investigation in technologies that&#xd;
will increase transmission capacity become necessary. Of these technologies, Optical&#xd;
Time Division Multiplexing (OTDM) has been presented as a possible solution, supporting&#xd;
a next generation bit rate of 160 Gbit/s. To perform the demultiplexing task,&#xd;
the use of tandem electro-absorption modulators (EAMs) has been widely studied,&#xd;
and due to its benefits was chosen as the topology of this thesis.&#xd;
To create an effective model of an OTDM system, the vector based mathematical&#xd;
simulation tool MatLab is used. Care was taken to create an accurate representation&#xd;
of an OTDM system, including: the development of a realistic pulse shape, the&#xd;
development of a true pseudo-random bit sequence in all transmitted channels, the&#xd;
optimization of the gating function, and the representation of system penalty.&#xd;
While posing impressive bit rates, various sources of system performance degradation&#xd;
pose issues in an OTDM system, owning to its ultra-narrow pulse widths.&#xd;
The presence of dispersion, timing jitter, polarization mode dispersion, and nonlinear&#xd;
effects, can sufficiently degrade the quality of the received data. This thesis gives a clear guideline to the tolerance an OTDM system exhibits to each of the aforementioned sources of system penalty. The theory behind each impairment is thoroughly discussed and simulated using MatLab. From the simulated results, a finite degree of sensitivity to each source of system penalty is realized. These contributions are of particular importance when attempting to implement an OTDM system in either the laboratory, or the field.</description>

   <description>Heme degradation is catalyzed through the action of heme oxygenases (HO), present as inducible (HO-1) and constitutive (HO-2) isoforms, resulting in the endogenous production of carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin and iron.  Numerous studies attempting to elucidate the physiological roles of these products have relied on metalloporphyrin inhibitors of HO; however, they have limited utility, as they are known to inhibit other hemoproteins.  Previous work in our laboratory has led to the identification of a number of azole-based compounds that inhibit HO in vitro, including several that have demonstrated selectivity for HO-1.  The principal goal of this project was to characterize lead compounds in vivo and investigate their therapeutic potential as anti-cancer agents.  The first objective was to develop a method to screen novel azole-based HO inhibitors (abHOi) in vivo.  To this end, we describe a non-invasive method of measuring CO exhalation (VeCO) as a measure of in vivo HO activity.  Using the VeCO method, we found that the inhibition of HO by abHOi was dose- and time-dependent, and was comparable to the effectiveness of the classical metalloporphyrin HO inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin.  Moreover, abHOi inhibited HO by a reversible, non-competitive mechanism and had no effect on HO-1 or HO-2 protein expression.  Interestingly, structurally similar azole antifungal drugs were found to inhibit HO activity at therapeutically relevant doses, which raises the possibility that some of the anti-mycotic and anti-tumourigenic effects of drugs like ketoconazole may be mediated, in part, by the inhibition of HO.  Our last objective was to investigate the effectiveness of abHOi in in vitro and in vivo models of tumour angiogenesis, growth and metastasis.  We found that the HO-1-selective abHOi, QC-15, decreased cancer cell viability and inhibited endothelial cell sprouting from aortic rings and capillary-like endothelial cell tube formation in vitro.  In an orthotopic breast cancer model, treatment of tumour-bearing mice with QC-15 reduced primary tumour volume and lung metastasis, but not tumour angiogenesis.  These results demonstrate that abHOi are valuable pharmacological tools in the elucidation of the physiological roles of HO and its products and, barring serious toxicity, promising therapeutic entities for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</description>

   <description>The diffusive transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through geomembranes is examined.  The key diffusive parameters: diffusion (Dg), partitioning (Sgf) and permeation (Pg) coefficients, for transport from both vapour and aqueous phases are evaluated.  Consideration is given to different types of geomembrane, exposure to cold climatic conditions, and aged geomembranes exhumed after 3 and 25 years.  Laboratory sorption and diffusion tests are performed and modeling is used to infer diffusive parameters from experimental data.&#xd;
	The transport of VOCs through polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) geomembranes from both aqueous and vapour phases is evaluated by Purge &amp; Trap-GC/MS.  Results indicate that VOC transport through geomembranes in a simulated landfill environment is identical despite the phase they originate from.  Subsequently, this finding is confirmed by examining diffusion of vapour-phase VOCs using Solid Phase Microextraction-GC/FID.  &#xd;
	Diffusive transport of VOCs through traditional PVC, LLDPE and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes is compared with that through two novel co-extruded geomembranes, one with a polyamide inner core, the other an ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) inner core.  Both co-extruded geomembranes show a 10-200-fold decrease in Pg values and therefore improved diffusive resistance to VOCs compared to the traditional geomembranes.  EVOH also shows a 5-12-fold decrease in Pg values compared to an HDPE geomembrane. &#xd;
	The effects of cold environments on the diffusion of VOCs are studied. Five geomembranes are exposed to simulated cold climatic conditions in the laboratory. Results from diffusion tests run at 2-24oC indicate Dg and Pg decrease with temperature. The temperature and diffusion coefficients relationship follow the Arrhenius equation. Activation energies of diffusion are calculated specific to each geomembrane and contaminant. An HPDE geomembrane taken from a field site in the Canadian Arctic after three years of exposure to cold climatic conditions shows minimal decreases in Dg and Pg when compared to new HDPE.&#xd;
	Finally, the diffusion of VOCs through an HDPE geomembrane exhumed from a decommissioned PCB landfill originally built in 1984 is examined. Profiling of PCB concentrations in the landfill clay and composite liners is investigated indicating minimal PCB diffusive migration after 25 years.</description>

   <description>The leaching behaviour of enargite was studied under atmospheric pressure. The kinetics of enargite dissolution appear to be extremely slow under the conditions studied using both small scale shake flasks and bench scale stirred tank reactors. An enargite concentrate and a purer&#xd;
mineral specimen were utilized and the effect of numerous variables including temperature, particle size, acidity, oxygen flow rate, iron addition, redox potential and pyrite addition were investigated. The initial rate of copper dissolution from enargite was relatively fast up to about 40% copper extraction but this was followed by a much slower dissolution rate. The first stage is thought to be reaction rate controlled while the latter stage appears to be diffusion controlled.&#xd;
The activation energy was determined to be 32 kJ/mol for the concentrate and 33 kJ/mol for the pure specimen in the temperature range of 55-85°C. In the presence of high concentrations of copper sulphate, enhanced copper recovery was observed for the pure enargite specimen. This could be the result of a change in the reaction product layer on the enargite surface and perhaps&#xd;
the formation of intermediate Cu2S. Previous work has shown that adding excess pyrite enhances copper extraction from enargite but these results could not be reproduced. Particle size reduction appears to be the most effective method to increase extraction rates, however only 70% copper recovery and 35% arsenic recovery was achieved after 24 hours of leaching at d80=2μm. At these&#xd;
reaction rates, it appears that enargite dissolution at atmospheric pressure will not be an economical process compared to other technologies such as high temperature/pressure oxidation or roasting.</description>

   <description>The availability and use of new materials and construction techniques are allowing bridges to be built that are longer and more slender to those that have been constructed in the past.  This can cause bridges to have lower stiffness and damping, and thus be less able to resist dynamic effects.  This is of special concern for pedestrian bridges, because the harmonic loads that pedestrians apply to the bridge have the potential to excite the bridge’s natural frequencies.  In addition, pedestrians can be sensitive to these vibrations.&#xd;
A model was developed in order to better understand the effects that a pedestrian can have on these vibration-prone bridges.  The model consisted of two parts: a finite element model that used the structural data for the bridge in order to produce mass-normalized mode shapes, and a bridge-pedestrian interaction program that used the structural and modal data, along with pedestrian loading scenarios, to generate the bridge response.  &#xd;
A parametric study of two bridges was conducted.  The bridges included: a short span bridge that would not be expected to respond excessively to pedestrian loads, and a long-span, lively bridge that had natural frequencies in the range of pedestrian loading.  Many loading cases were examined by varying the following parameters: load case, number of pedestrians, damping, and pacing frequency.  &#xd;
The modal solution was an effective method of finding the bridge responses.  It was determined that pedestrian loads can be represented by a simple constant plus sinusoidal load.  The excessive vibrations of long and slender bridges could be addressed by increasing damping on susceptible modes.</description>

   <description>In Canada there are increasing numbers of girls and women playing sport (Ifedi, 2005). In part, these opportunities are the result of earlier feminist efforts in the 1970s and 1980s and yet feminism itself is very rarely a part of the experiences of girls and women once they are involved in sport. The purpose of this thesis is to explore how this might be different and to create feminist politics around women’s high performance sport in Canada. This consciousness-raising qualitative writing project features three narratives written from a first-person perspective based on my experiences playing interuniversity sport. Chapters on methodology, second- and third-wave feminism and Canadian sport history provide a context for the narratives chapter. I urge other athletes to take up feminisms so that they might gain a different perspective to understand their experiences and see greater connections between themselves and other women. This might inspire women to change what they expect from and how they evaluate their experiences in sport in ways that align with feminist ideas. The project concludes with some thoughts on doing a qualitative writing project that might be helpful to other graduate students who are considering doing this type of research.</description>

   <description>Fibroferrite [Fe(OH)SO4•5H2O] is a product of the AMD (acid mine drainage) process and forms by chemical weathering and oxidation of iron sulfides in hydrothermal and magmatic ore deposits. The present work consists of two distinct parts. The first part is a crystallographic and optical study of 30 samples of  fibroferrite from natural occurences and mine waste. The second part covers the description of all the experimental attempts to synthesize fibroferrite. Powder-diffraction data were collected and the Rietveld refinement procedure was conducted for each of the 30 natural samples in order to refine the values of the lattice constants of each sample. The a and c values of the lattice constants of fibroferrite measured in this study were found to conform to the values reported in the most recent literature. Optical observations were conducted, using a spindle stage, on each of the 30 natural samples. The purpose of the optical analysis was the selection of crystals adequate for a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. Samples were selected for a study on a rotating anode source and further studies at a synchrotron facility. None of the selected crystals was suitable for a single crystal X-ray diffraction study and the unit cell could not be found. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy chemical analyses using a scanning electron microscope were performed on the 10 natural samples supplied by the Royal Ontario Museum and the Canadian Museum of Nature. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy chemical analyses did not allow a real understanding of the level of substitutions of other cations for ferric iron within the atomic structure of fibroferrite. Several experiments were performed in order to synthesize fibroferrite. Commercially available reagents were used. All the experimental attempts conducted failed in synthesizing fibroferrite. A too restricted Eh and pH range of the laboratory conditions at which the experiments were conducted and the formation of metastable phases could be evoked as reasons of this failure.</description>

   <description>Industrial activity over the last two centuries have increased heavy metal contamination worldwide and has led to greater human interaction with these contaminants. Cadmium, copper and zinc are particularly common industrial effluents and are highly toxic in elevated concentrations. Due to the hazards of heavy metal pollution, there is a growing demand for cost effective and efficient means to remove heavy metals. Photoautotrophic microbes can biotransform heavy metals into the relatively biologically unavailable and insoluble metal-sulfides.  By characterizing the sulfur assimilation pathways’ role in heavy metal biotransformation, more effective heavy metal bioremediation processes may be developed. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Synechoccocus leopoliensis and Cyanidioschyzon merolae were exposed to cadmium, copper, and zinc and their abilities to synthesize metal-sulfides were assessed. Sulfate, sulfite and cysteine were enriched in the respective media of each species to determine the role of sulfur metabolites in enhancing metal tolerance and metal-sulfide formation. The activities of cysteine desulfhydrase, serine acetyltransferase and O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase activity were analyzed under the stress of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II).  C. merolae supplemented with sulfate yielded a significant increase in Cd(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) tolerance, higher sulfide formation, and increased enzyme activity.  C. reinhardtii and S. leopoliensis supplemented with sulfate yielded significantly more biomass than the sulfite and cysteine treatments when exposed to Cd(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II). In all species the addition of sulfite and cysteine was found to be detrimental to cell growth. C. reinhardtii had an average increase of 5-8 times the initial cysteine desulfhydrase and serine acetyltransferase activity for each metal treatment. Cd(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) proved to have a limiting effect on S. leopoliensis’ enzyme activity. The potential limitations in the sulfur assimilation pathway will be discussed. C. merolae may prove to be a successful candidate for metal bioremediation. Utilizing supplemental sulfate nutrition may improve the rate of biotransformation in aerobic microbes.</description>

   <description>Feminist geographic debates have drawn attention to the multi-scalar role of borders as processes of social differentiation that are reproduced and inscribed on the bodies of migrant workers in everyday life. This thesis explores these questions in the context of Singapore’s global city-state where the increasing visibility of low-wage foreign workers in local residential areas has become a subject of tense neighbourhood frictions that frequently bring borders into sharp relief. Using the case-study of a recent public furore surrounding the proposed location of a foreign worker dormitory in Serangoon Gardens, one of Singapore's well-known middle-class estates, it examines the ways that migrant exclusions in local residential areas are informed by border anxieties and practices that mark out the labouring bodies of foreign workers as alien and “out of place.” The Serangoon Gardens incident exhibited a moment of tension whereby gendered, racialised, and class-based meanings attached to specific forms of flexible labour (particularly foreign construction and domestic work) were inserted into wider debates about nation, community, and the socio-spatial preservation of middle-class identity and belonging. Insofar as Singapore’s growth remains undergirded by the systematic in-flow of low-wage foreign workers to service its infrastructural and social reproductive labour needs, a study of borders helps illuminate the inherent contradictions and barriers of mobility within the global city as an exclusionary landscape. This thesis argues that the deeply marginalised place of foreign workers in society stems predominantly from the constitutive role of the state’s managerial migration regime in shaping everyday social meanings and practices that construct these workers as unassimilable subjects within the city-state. The outcome of these multi-scalar forms of bordering practices has been to produce a transient, depoliticised, and governable migrant population in the interests of security and economic prosperity in Singapore’s global city-state.</description>

   <description>A study of methods for reducing the acoustic noise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners is presented in this thesis. The structural-acoustic coupling mechanism of MRI scanners was investigated using a method of structural-acoustic modal analysis. Mathematical expressions of generalized radiation impedances of gradient coil ducts with perforated panel inserts were developed and the effects of the perforated panel inserts on the acoustic noise in the duct were discussed. The possibility of using micro-perforated panel (MPP) absorbers in MRI scanners to reduce the acoustic noise was then investigated through analytical and computational modeling. A comprehensive experimental study was conducted after the analytical and computational investigation. Finally, design methods and procedures were developed specifically for the MPP absorbers in MRI scanners. Design considerations and recommendations were given as well.&#xd;
Several major conclusions can be made from this research. Firstly, the method of structural-acoustic modal analysis is effective for finding the structural-acoustic coupling modes which should be avoided in the design of MRI scanners. Secondly, a perforated panel insert produces significant effects on the radiation impedance of gradient coil ducts and MRI scanner bores. This attribute partly contributes to its capability of reducing the acoustic noise in a duct. Thirdly, the effectiveness of MPP absorbers in MRI scanners can be accurately predicted using a combination of theoretical analysis and computational modeling. Moreover, it has been proved that well designed MPP absorbers are effective in reducing the acoustic noise in MRI scanners. Lastly, the presented design methods and recommendations for the MPP absorbers can be relatively easily used by MRI designers or engineers to tackle the acoustic noise problem in MRI scanners.</description>

   <description>Hypertension and salt-sensitivity are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  Although both conditions are idiopathic, they develop due to a complex interplay between susceptibility genes and environmental factors.  Given that the kidney plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, in particular, by maintaining sodium and water balance via pressure-natriuresis, it is not surprising that disturbances in the proper functioning of this intrarenal mechanism have been linked to these conditions.  Although direct coupling of changes in renal arterial pressure (RAP) to renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) and consequent sodium excretion is well established, few studies have characterized the moment-to-moment aspects of this process.  Thus, the main focus of the research presented herein was to characterize the moment-to-moment RAP-RIHP relationship, and assess the functioning of this intrarenal mechanism in various animal models of genetic and environmentally-induced hypertension and/or salt-sensitivity.  &#xd;
In adult normotensive rats, the response time of RIHP to acute changes in RAP was rapid (&lt;2 seconds), and the moment-to-moment RAP-RIHP relationship was linear over a wide range of pressures.   Additionally, the functioning of this relationship was not affected by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and autonomic nervous system.  Further, the acute RAP-RIHP relationship was impaired in hypertension and/or salt-sensitivity.  Specifically, animals with a hypertensive phenotype (i.e. young spontaneously hypertensive rats [SHR] and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide gene-disrupted mice [ANP -/-]) displayed a rightward shift in the moment-to-moment pressure-natriuresis curve towards higher RAP.  This rightward shift was associated with increased structurally-based vascular resistance properties in the hindlimb of young SHR versus their normotensive controls.  Salt-sensitive phenotypes were associated with a blunting of this acute mechanism.  Specifically, this blunting was evident in both the ANP -/-, a transgenic model of salt-sensitive hypertension, and in adult perinatal iron deficient (PID) rats, a developmentally programmed model of salt-sensitivity.  It appears that a blunting in the RAP-RIHP relationship is influenced by an imbalance of key blood pressure modulating factors (e.g. ANP).  Further, visceral obesity was associated with salt-sensitivity in PID rats; however the mechanism(s) are yet to be elucidated.  Novel methodologies (MRI, abdominal girth) were developed for non-invasive assessment of visceral obesity to aid future research.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the role of memory in the construction of small-town Ontario in the work of a number of Ontario writers. After an initial overview of the vexed position the small town holds in Canadian and Ontarian cultural discourse, this dissertation then examines the role of distance - temporal, spatial, and cultural - in memorial reconstructions of small-town pasts, and claims that this distance is essential to nostalgic visions of the small town. This dissertation does not discuss the small town as merely an idyll or anti-idyll, but analyzes the effect of something Leo Marx calls the “pastoral design,” defined as the “larger structure of thought and feeling of which the ideal is a part” (24). The effect of this structure is most apparent in Stephen Leacock’s Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town, and this dissertation argues that Leacock’s Mariposa is the product of melancholics daydreaming of a better small-town past in order to soothe their contemporary urban anomie; however, Leacock also reveals the decidedly ambivalent effect the urban sphere has on its own nostalgic image. Chapter Three examines Sunshine Sketches’ influence on Deptford in Robertson Davies’ Fifth Business; Deptford is at once an acknowledgement of, and departure from, Leacock’s Mariposa. The unstable portrayal of the town suggests that Deptford is no complement to an urban sphere, but is shaped by the same processes of modernity affecting the city. In Chapter Four the dissertation discusses Alice Munro’s Lives of Girls and Women, specifically how narrator Del Jordan collapses the distance between her present and past, and how Munro’s text undermines the values attendant to rural and urban space. Finally, Chapter Five identifies the presence of a rural-urban binary in two texts by Jane Urquhart. For Urquhart’s characters, the small-town past is a solemn object of loss, but is ultimately a construct that can only be a reflection of the mourning or remembering self. This dissertation reads these small-town narratives as sophisticated statements on the role of urbanization in memories of a personal and social past, and on the vexed position of the rural in an increasingly cosmopolitan world.</description>

   <description>Cynicism is one of the most frequently used, but most polysemic, words in the modern lexicon. This dissertation attempts to shed some light on a dark subject by tracing the idea of cynicism from the late eighteenth century to the late nineteenth century and early twentieth in order to construct a multi-faceted theory of modern cynicism which is in turn applied to, and modified by, the writings of H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad, and George Bernard Shaw. The genealogy of cynicism that I construct in the first chapter draws upon existing research in the area as well as original research from a range of books and articles published from 1790 to 1895. This genealogy shows that the idea of cynicism takes shape largely in relation to the nineteenth century’s anxieties about the social and subjective consequences of modern culture. In the remaining chapters, I examine each writer’s understanding of and engagement with cynicism and explore the ways that each participates in, modifies, or rejects the pessimistic form of modern cynicism associated with the fin de siècle. I suggest that in rejecting the pessimistic form of realism typical of the period, Shaw comes closer than other authors to recovering a salutary neo-Cynicism; I also argue that he perceived, but was not able to overcome, the subjective barriers to political change that more recent theorists have associated with twentieth-century cynicism.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2010-05-19 18:06:55.622</description>
   <description>Background: &#xd;
Stigma can not only affect the stigmatized individual, but also those closely associated with that individual, such as parents. Parents are often in the role of primary caregivers for individuals with intellectual disabilities. However, few studies have looked at the experiences of stigma in parents of adults with intellectual disabilities. &#xd;
Objectives: &#xd;
Three objectives of the current study were to test the internal consistencies of three scales aimed to measure experiences of parents of adults with intellectual disabilities (two stigma scales and one scale looking at positive personal, perspective on life, and relational changes in parents), test the inter-correlation between the scales and describe the parents’ experiences.&#xd;
Methods: &#xd;
A self-administered survey containing the three scales was mailed to parents of adults with intellectual disabilities by agency staff on the investigators’ behalf. The participants were identified through a database of anonymized information about individuals with intellectual disabilities within the six counties of South Eastern Ontario. A total of 97 participants (parents) were eligible for the study. &#xd;
Results: &#xd;
The scale measuring positive changes experienced by parents had significant item non-response. However, all three scales achieved good to excellent internal consistencies when tested in the current sample. The two stigma scales were moderately correlated with one another in a positive direction, while the scale measuring positive changes in parents did not significantly correlate with either of the stigma scales. Mothers and younger parents (less than 65 years) were more likely to report that stigma affected their ability to interact with relatives than fathers and older parents. Parents of adults with dual diagnosis (having both an intellectual disability and mental health problems) were more likely to report that stigma affected their family’s quality of life than parents of adults with an intellectual disability only.&#xd;
Conclusion: &#xd;
Both of the stigma scales are recommended with caution, with recommendations ranging from rewording of items, change in item order within the survey, more conservative item response categories, reconsideration of dichotomizing responses and a mode of survey administration which lowers the potential for non-response. Certain groups of parents of adults with intellectual disabilities experience stigma differently than others.</description>

   <description>Computer assisted surgery uses a collection of different techniques including but not limited to: CT-guided, fluoroscopy-guided, and ultrasound-guided imaging which allows medical staff to view bony anatomy of a patient in relation to surgical tools on a computer screen.  By providing this visual data to surgeons less invasive surgeries can be performed on a patient's fractured scaphoid.  The data required for a surgeon to perform a minimally invasive surgery while looking only at a computer screen, and not directly at a patient's anatomy, will be provided by CT and ultrasound data.  We will discuss how ultrasound and CT data can be used together to allow a minimally invasive surgery of the scaphoid to be performed.&#xd;
&#xd;
  In this thesis we will explore two techniques of registering segmented ultrasound images to CT data; an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach, and an Unscented Kalman Filter-based Registration (UKF).  We use two different ultrasound segmentation methods; a semi-automatic segmentation, and a  Bayesian segmentation technique. The segmented ultrasound data is then registered to a CT volume.  The success or failure of the&#xd;
registrations is measured by the error calculated in mapping the corresponding land-&#xd;
marks to one another and calculating the target registration error.  The results show that the Unscented Kalman Filter-based registration using the Bayesian segmentation of ultrasound images has the least registration error, and has the most robustness to error in initial alignment of the two data sets.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and user-acceptability of three Mark 3 water pump carriage systems for the Aviation and Forest Fire Management division of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR).  Twenty Ontario Fire Rangers were recruited to wear three different designs of the Mark 3 carriage system (Original, Modified, and OMNR Prototype) through a circuit of tasks that simulated a Fire Ranger’s working environment. Subjective ratings were determined for difficulty of loading/unloading, discomfort, system stability and overall performance after each pump condition with a final ranking questionnaire on the same variables after circuit completion.  Two tri-axial accelerometers mounted on each pump and the sternum of each participant provided data for calculation of relative pump-carrier accelerations. Measures were determined for the mean relative accelerations, 50th and 90th percentile acceleration amplitude distributions, and median acceleration frequencies. One-way repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons were conducted on the objective and subjective rating data followed by ranking each score to attain a total score.  Overall, the OMNR Prototype was ranked as the best system. It received a first place ranking for all subjective variables and a first place ranking in 10/18 objective variables with a second place ranking on 6/18 scores.  It was concluded that the OMNR Prototype will be recommended for implementation as the OMNR fire suppression system. However, prior to full implementation, additional in-field evaluations should be conducted.</description>

   <description>Activation-tagging is a functional genomics technique where strong enhancers are inserted randomly into target genomes and can over-activate endogenous genes.  When interesting phenotypes occur as a result, it can lead to the discovery of new genes or the characterization of known genes.  From a population of ~2000 activation-tagged poplar trees created in our lab, a mutant with red xylem was identified and named rosewood.  Based on previously identified poplar mutants, the red-wood phenotype suggested a change in lignin biosynthesis, but work done during this thesis revealed that the red wood is actually a result of increased anthocyanin content.  Efforts to engineer edible plants for increased anthocyanin content are on-going, due to their antioxidant properties and wide-ranging health benefits to humans.  Although poplar trees are not eaten by humans, discovery of a novel aspect of anthocyanin regulation could have implications beyond the Populus genus.  In this thesis, rosewood’s single T-DNA insertion was identified and characterized.  Rosewood’s case turned out to be atypical in the analysis of activation-tagged mutants: no surrounding protein-coding genes could be implicated in rosewood’s phenotype, and instead several novel, non-coding, upregulated RNAs were discovered next to the T-DNA enhancers.  Only four cases of activation-tagged non-coding RNAs appear in the literature, only one of which involved a novel gene.  To date, there is no clear methodology on how to annotate plant non-coding RNAs discovered in this fashion.  A major part of this thesis consisted of setting up a workflow for this purpose, which accounts especially for the current computational tools that can be used for microRNA prediction in plants.  Based on molecular data and bioinformatics analyses, it is proposed that the locus at the T-DNA insertion contains one or more natural-antisense microRNAs and that these are somehow responsible for rosewood’s increased anthocyanin content.  The results of a phenotype recapitulation attempt in stem tissue using one of the novel transcripts are discussed.</description>

   <description>This study aimed to understand annual and long-term chemical and physical processes that affect the development and state of coastal lakes in the Canadian High Arctic.  The first major research project studied the formation of hypersalinity in a seasonally isolated marine basin (SIMB) located near Shellabear Point, Melville Island, Northwest Territories (75'N, 113'W).  To quantify the role of brine rejection from a seasonal ice pan, an annual ice-formation model was applied, which incorporated stable oxygen isotope fractionation.  This model complemented seasonal sampling of ionic and isotopic composition and a full-year recording of physical lacustrine parameters.  Additionally, a pilot study using radon-222 as a tracer of groundwater seepage was undertaken to quantify the brine seepage from surrounding permafrost into the hypolimnion of the SIMB.  Results indicate that brine rejection from the annual formation of lake ice in a SIMB is the major driver of hypersalinity in this system, and that the current chemical constitution may have formed in less than a decade.  This study contributes novel hypotheses on the chemical formation of hypersaline lakes, but also coastal meromictic lakes derived from epishelf lakes during the Holocene.  &#xd;
The second investigation focused on the seasonal variability of limnological processes in two coastal freshwater lakes in the Canadian Arctic.  East and West Lake are located at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO, 75'N, 109'W), Melville Island.  From 2006 to 2009, there have been two central changes in the lake systems: 1) an enhanced ionic loading into both lakes since 2007, and 2) a significant increase in the suspended sediment concentration in the lower 15 m of West Lake in 2009.  The elevated ionic concentrations are a result of increased active layer thickening during an unusually warm summer in 2007.  The high turbidity in 2009 had a substantial impact on annual mixing of West Lake.  The suspended sediment produced a density gradient that prevented river-generated density currents from delivering fresh oxygenated water to the bottom of the lake, and prevented thermal warming.  The lack of re-oxygenation and nutrient delivery likely had a substantial impact on the benthic ecosystem in the lake.</description>

   <description>Biphenyl and dioxane biodegradation by poplar and willow rhizosphere microorganisms was studied in a phytoremediation test-plot contaminated with biphenyl and dioxane. A dioxane-degrading consortium enriched from the contaminated rhizosphere soil did not use dioxane as the sole source of carbon and energy, but did co-metabolize dioxane in the presence of tetrahydrofuran (THF).  An isolate obtained on agar plates containing basal salts and glucose grew on glucose and co-metabolically degraded dioxane after THF degradation. The rate and extent of dioxane degradation by this particular isolate increased with increasing THF concentration. This isolate was subsequently identified as a Flavobacterium by 16S rDNA sequencing. This is the first report of a dioxane-degrading Flavobacterium which is phylogenetically distinct from any previously identified dioxane degrader. &#xd;
Rhizosphere microorganisms in the phytoremediation test-plot were capable of degrading biphenyl in the presence of the terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide. TEAs (sulfate and carbon dioxide), nutrients in basal salts medium (BSM) or fertilizer enhanced biphenyl degradation. Although root exudates appeared to enhance biphenyl degradation slightly, it was not statistically significant (p > 0.10). A fungus enriched and isolated from the rhizosphere soil, was found to degrade biphenyl under anaerobic conditions only.  The fungus was identified by a primer pair ITS4 and ITS1F as Pseudallescheria boydii.&#xd;
The microbial community in the rhizosphere of the poplar and willow trees was sampled from different soil locations in the test-plot over a 5-year period. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results indicated that soil type had a significant impact on microbial community composition with a more diverse microbial population in native soil samples than in engineered soil samples. Although tree type had less influence on microbial diversity, diversity did decrease with time in the engineered soil of the willow rhizosphere. There was no significant influence of soil depth on the microbial community. Three aerobic biphenyl-degrading consortia were enriched from different rhizosphere soils, and the major microorganisms found in the enriched consortia were identified by 16S DNA sequencing as being in the family of Flavobacteriaceae, Alcaligenaceae, and Mycobacteriaceae. &#xd;
Direct polymerase chain reaction (DPCR) without prior DNA extraction and DGGE yielded the same results as PCR assays using extracted DNA in the analysis of microbial populations in dioxane- and biphenyl-degrading consortia. Therefore, the combination of DPCR and DGGE has the potential for the fast analysis of the microbial populations of environmental and clinical samples with limited diversity.</description>

   <description>In current online games, player positions are synchronized by means of continual broadcasts through the server. This solution is expensive, forcing any server to limit its number of clients. With a hybrid networking architecture, player synchronization can be distributed to the clients, bypassing the server bottleneck and decreasing latency as a result. Synchronization in a decentralized fashion is difficult as each player must communicate with every other player. The communication requirements can be reduced by computing and exploiting frontier sets: For a pair of players in an online game, a player's frontier is the region of the game space where the player may move without seeing (and without communicating to) the other player. A pair of frontiers is called a frontier set. This thesis describes the first fast and space-efficient method of computing frontier sets in large terrains. &#xd;
&#xd;
Frontier sets are computed by growing regions in a connected set of quads in a hierarchical decomposition of the terrain. The solution involves the precomputation of a potentially visible set (PVS) for each quad in the decomposition, which stores all the quads potentially visible from any point within the current quad. Since the memory needed to store the PVSs for all the quads is quite large, a compression technique is introduced which controls the size of each PVS. A PVS merging algorithm, with both lossless and lossy variations, is also described which permits adding the PVS of a point or quad to the PVS of a growing region. The new algorithm is compared to a simple region growing approach where frontiers are grown along the individual terrain points. Using similar merging techniques, the new algorithm performs better, producing larger frontier sets with faster execution times.</description>

   <title>Scaling of Metabolic Enzymes: Transcriptional Basis of Interspecies Variation in Mitochondrial Content</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2010-06-09 10:50:02.133</description>
   <description>Mitochondrial content, an important determinant of muscle metabolic capacity, changes in individuals during development, and in response to physiological and environmental challenges. This phenotypic plasticity is attributed to the coactivator PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) but it remains unclear if this transcriptional regulator accounts for evolutionary variation in mitochondrial content.  In an attempt to explain why some species have higher muscle mitochondrial enzyme levels than other species, I examined if the transcriptional mechanisms that control mitochondrial content of a tissue in an individual are also responsible for differences between species. If PGC-1α creates differences between the mitochondrial content of species based on variation in promoter binding motifs, then cis-factor evolution may be the guiding force in scaling trends. &#xd;
In this thesis I explored the basis of size-dependent patterns by looking at layers of regulation, from catalytic activities to promoter evolution and regulation. A representative family, Rodentia, was used to collect muscle samples from a size range of approximately 20g up to 17 kg. As expected, in rodent lower limb muscles, mitochondrial and glycolytic enzyme activity exhibited reciprocal scaling patterns, though the scope differed between muscles. Very little of the variation was accounted for when the activity was related to DNA content. However, when COX activities were expressed relative to DNA, the scaling patterns were similar among the 3 muscles. To determine if interspecies differences were linked to transcriptional regulation,  ~800bp of the PGC-1α promoter from 56 terrestrial mammals (5g-5000kg) was examined. The basal placental mammalian promoter possesses putative elements for Sp1, HNF3, myogenic factors and metabolic effectors, which have been retained in mammals with little change in order or spacing. To investigate the ability of these promoters to control PGC-1α expression, rodent promoters were cloned into luciferase reporter gene constructs and transfected into a common mouse myoblast background (Sol8 cells). Unlike mitochondrial content, promoter activity did not vary with body size across the rodent family. Likewise, PGC-1α transcript levels did not vary in rodent muscles in a way that would explain differences in COX activity. This suggests that though PGC-1α may be crucial for within species variation, transcriptional regulation of PGC-1α is not responsible for interspecies variation in mitochondrial content.</description>

   <description>The application of Discrete-Event Systems (DES) theory to the problem of guar- anteeably enforcing concurrency constraints in multi-threaded applications has been studied under certain assumptions, namely, the assumption of a static pool of pre- existing instantiated threads, whose creation and termination are not modelled. This work proposes an extension of this case to handle dynamically instantiated and termi- nated threads using a Petri net formalism and an online limited-lookahead state-space search technique.</description>

   <description>The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field analyzes software data to uncover knowledge and assist software developments. Software projects and products continue to grow in size and complexity. In-depth analysis of these large systems and their evolution is needed to better understand the characteristics of such large-scale systems and projects. However, classical software analysis platforms (e.g., Prolog-like, SQL-like, or specialized programming scripts) face many challenges when performing large-scale MSR studies. Such software platforms rarely scale easily out of the box. Instead, they often require analysis-specific one-time ad hoc scaling tricks and designs that are not reusable for other types of analysis and that are costly to maintain. We believe that the web community has faced many of the scaling challenges facing the software engineering community, as they cope with the enormous growth of the web data. In this thesis, we report on our experience in using MapReduce and Pig, two web-scale platforms, to perform large MSR studies. Through our case studies, we carefully demonstrate the benefits and challenges of using web platforms to prepare (i.e., Extract, Transform, and Load, ETL) software data for further analysis. The results of our studies show that: 1) web-scale platforms provide an effective and efficient platform for large-scale MSR studies; 2) many of the web community’s guidelines for using web-scale platforms must be modified to achieve the optimal performance for large-scale MSR studies. This thesis will help other software engineering researchers who want to scale their studies.</description>

   <description>In North America, deepening economic integration under free trade has led to the formation of several cross-border regions between Canada and the United States and such regions have become a significant focus for public policy research in Canada. A key question is whether, as a result of increased economic integration, there are tendencies towards policy and institutional convergence within cross-border regions; especially in areas viewed as critical in determining competitive economic advantage. One such area is employment relations.  However, relatively little research has focused on how, or even if, employment relations are changing within cross-border regions. &#xd;
Previous studies comparing differences and similarities in employment relations between Canada and the United States have tended to focus on one of three scales: the nation, the firm, or the individual workplace. Here, the focus is on employment relations within a cross-border region. Such regions often share similar economic and social characteristics.  Thus, we might expect that if cross-national employment relations are becoming more similar due to deepening economic integration this would manifest most clearly at this scale. &#xd;
The empirical focus is the forest products industry in the cross-border region of Cascadia, comprised of British Columbia, Washington state, and Oregon. Employment relations are compared across three components of the forest products industry: pulp and paper, solid wood processing, and logging. Data are organized around case studies of each component and focus on employment, wages, and productivity; the restructuring of firms and ownership; the labour movement; work practices, training, and the reproduction of the labour force. The dissertation concludes that employment relations in the pulp and paper and logging industries in Cascadia are becoming more similar cross-nationally, while those in solid wood processing are increasingly differentiated cross-nationally. Moreover, it concludes that employment relations in British Columbia’s solid wood processing and pulp and paper industry are becoming more similar, while employment relations in the PNW solid wood processing and pulp and paper industries are increasingly differentiated.  The dissertation contributes to broader debates in economic geography by examining the tensions between national and sub-national political economic actors contribute to the production of scale and territory.</description>

   <description>A two-part paleolimnological study was conducted to examine changes in historical and modern water-quality in Lake of the Woods (LoW) in response to multiple stressors, such as climate change and shoreline residential development. Changes in diatom assemblages were analyzed in the modern and pre-industrial sediment intervals of 17 study sites, and in high-resolution 210Pb-dated sedimentary records from three northwestern bays (Clearwater, Poplar, and White Partridge bays). Patterns in diatom assemblage changes revealed pronounced and synchronous shifts over the last ca. 150 years. The most notable shift in the diatom community structure (~1970 AD) was characterized by an overall shift towards a higher relative abundance of small, centric Cyclotella taxa and planktonic, pennate diatoms (e.g., Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis), and a corresponding lower relative abundance of heavily silicified Aulacoseira taxa and small benthic Fragilaria taxa and Achnanthes taxa. Lakewater total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were inferred from sedimentary diatom assemblages. DI-TP reconstructions revealed either no change or a decline in DI-TP since pre-industrial (pre-1850) times at majority (88%) of the top-bottom study sites, and no distinct directional change over the past ca. 150 years at the northwestern bays. Therefore, we concluded that TP was not an important driver of the floristic changes we observed. Chl-a trends indicate that primary production increased during the last ca. 100 years, likely tracking increases in microbial blooms. Changes in diatom assemblage composition and primary productivity have occurred during a period of substantial warming for this region of northwestern Ontario. Strong correlations (r >0.50, p&lt;0.005) between diatom compositional changes, chl-a trends, and local air temperature records and lake-ice phenology suggest that climate-induced changes in lakewater properties may have been key factors driving the observed changes. From these data, we conclude that climate warming, rather than changing shoreline development and TP changes, has had the most pronounced effect on algal communities in the LoW. Estimates of pre-impact lake trophic status can aid in setting realistic mitigation targets for lakes impacted by multiple stressors. Therefore, paleolimnological studies comparing pre- and post-disturbance algal assemblages, such as the investigations we have conducted, are of interest from a lake management perspective.</description>

   <description>Early school leaving continues to be an issue that garners much attention from administrators, educators, and academics. In this study I review the existing literature on risk factors relating to early school leaving while examining the role of social context on educational aspirations and expectations.  Research findings (Alberta Learning, 2001; Ferguson, Tilleczek, Boydell, &amp; Rummens, 2005; Satchwell, 2004) show that early school leaving is a long process of disengagement that arises from multiple factors associated with experiences both inside and outside of school.  In this study I carry out a qualitative analysis of both school and non-school related risk factors deemed to be significant to the early leaving of four young Portuguese-Canadian men.  &#xd;
Their stories attest to the complexity of the phenomenon as they affirm the impact of both school and non-school related factors on early school leaving such as irrelevant curriculum, learning community, socio-economic status, and social context.  In recounting their stories, and analyzing them through Bourdieu and Passeron’s (1979) understanding of “cultural capital” and “habitus,” I provide insights in this study into how administrators, educators and policymakers, alike may make learning more meaningful and authentic in order to curb early school leaving.</description>

   <title>Studying Software Evolution Using the Time Dependence of Code Changes</title>

   <description>Constructing software bears many similarities to constructing buildings. In a building project, each floor builds on the&#xd;
previous structures (walls of the previous floors) with some structures being more&#xd;
foundational (i.e. essential) for other structures and some periods of construction being more foundational (i.e. critical) to the final structure. In a software project, each change builds on the structures&#xd;
created by prior changes with some changes creating foundational structure and with some time periods of changes being more&#xd;
foundational than others.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis is inspired by this similarity between constructing buildings&#xd;
and constructing software. The thesis makes use of the similarity to study the evolution of software projects. In particular, we develop the concept of time dependence between code changes to study software evolution through empirical studies on two large open source projects (PostgreSQL and&#xd;
FreeBSD) with more than 25 years of development history.&#xd;
We show that time dependence can be used to&#xd;
study how changes build on prior changes and the impact of this building process on the quality of a project. We show how&#xd;
a development period impacts the development of future periods in a project. We also show how a subsystem (module) of a project builds on other subsystems and we identify the subsystems that have high impact on a project's development. Using this knowledge, managers can better monitor the progress of the projects and better plan for future&#xd;
changes.</description>

   <description>Of the organisms with sequenced genomes, plants appear to possess the most rhomboid protease-encoding genes. However, our knowledge of processes in plants that involve Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP) and rhomboid proteases remains low.  As expressed recently by other researchers, finding a natural substrate for a rhomboid protease represents the biggest experimental challenge.  Using yeast mitochondria-based assays, a potential link between the plastid translocon component Tic40 and organellar rhomboid proteases was recently uncovered.  In this particular link, rhomboid proteases appear capable of influencing the pattern of imported Tic40 in yeast mitochondria.  Tic40 may thus represent a natural plant target of organellar rhomboid proteases.  Here, we obtained further motif-oriented evidence supporting Tic40 as a natural plant rhomboid substrate.  A comparative analysis of sequences revealed that Tic40 may also possess similar TMD motifs found in the model substrate, Spitz.  Rhomboid proteases often require these motifs to cleave substrates within intramembrane environments. Using site-directed mutagenesis and yeast mitochondria assays, the impact of mutations occurring in the motifs ASISS, GV, QP, and GVGVG of Tic40 was assessed.  In terms of cleavage and changing the pattern of imported Tic40, some of the mutations showed decreased activities and a few showed enhancements.  More importantly, the overall observed pattern associated with select Tic40 mutations resembled the characteristics reported for the model substrates.  In particular, mutations in the Tic40 GV motif produced similar results as that observed with Spitz, by drastically decreasing or increasing cleavage as a function of amino acid sequence.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2010-05-30 15:52:08.78</description>
   <description>This project critically evaluates sociological and biological epistemological approaches to the study of mental health and illness, such as anti-psychiatry, social constructivism, Actor Network Theory, neuroscience, and epigenetics, and addresses implications for establishing theoretical links between these domains of scholarship. How, for example, can neuroscience and epigenetics contribute to contemporary accounts of the embodiment of mental illness in the social sciences? What can the sociology of mental health contribute to contemporary biological accounts of behaviour? How might an integrative approach to the study of mental illness help better the lives of women and men living with mental illnesses? In order to address these questions, this project traces shifting sociological and natural scientific trajectories from the 1960s to present, and theorizes a more nuanced alignment between social and biological research in mental health. This dissertation is situated within a growing science studies tradition, one which examines the relationality between human and nonhuman processes, and which investigates how mental illness might be viewed as a constitutive state of relations between somatic (internal) and social (external) environments.</description>

   <description>Masonry walls subjected to out-of-plane loading, such as in a seismic event, require reinforcement to improve the ductility of the system. In current masonry construction practice, reinforcement is placed internally and fully grouted. For new construction this can make the wall unjustifiably heavy by not taking advantage of its light, hollow structure. For existing construction, it is difficult to retrofit using this technique.  Additionally, the reinforcement is located close to the neutral axis which reduces its effectiveness. Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars, strips and sheets are becoming increasingly popular in construction applications due to their noncorrosive nature and ease of installation. Also, stainless steel bars are used where the structure is exposed to a corrosive environment but have not found wider application for masonry structures. This study is an experimental investigation of the structural performance of masonry walls reinforced with Near-Surface-Mounted (NSM) FRP and stainless steel reinforcement under out-of-plane bending. Additionally, walls with Externally Bonded (EB) FRP sheets were tested.  The study simulates retrofitting applications and also proposes the NSM technique for new wall construction, using pre-grooved blocks, in lieu of the conventional method of internal reinforcing and grouting. To accommodate the NSM reinforcement, the grooves in the masonry blocks were aligned with ducts used to anchor the NSM reinforcement in the concrete footing.  Seven wall specimens were tested, including walls reinforced with conventional and stainless steel bars, glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP), and carbon-FRP (CFRP) reinforcement. The study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the NSM technique for new construction. Walls with NSM reinforcement showed a superior performance to those with EB reinforcement. It was shown that increasing the FRP reinforcement ratio may result in a change of failure mode, and as such, the increase in strength may not be proportional to the increase in reinforcement ratio. NSM steel-reinforced walls showed a superior performance in terms of strength, stiffness and the ductility associated with the formation of a plastic hinge at the base.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2010-05-31 09:53:50.676</description>
   <description>Peroxyesters undergo homolytic O-O bond cleavage under thermal and photolytic conditions, forming an alkoxyl and acyloxyl radical, the latter of which rapidly decarboxylates to form a carbon centered radical. While peroxyesters are generally decomposed under anaerobic conditions to serve as sources of carbon-centered radicals to initiate radical reactions, it has been shown that β,γ-unsaturated peroxyesters can decompose to yield a delocalized carbon-centered radical which can serve as a precursor to a powerful peroxyl radical clock. This competitive kinetic approach is attractive as it allows the facile determination of rate constants for formal H-atom reactions between peroxyl radicals and reductants (e.g. phenolic and aromatic amine antioxidants) without the need for specialized equipment. Furthermore, this approach allows for the determination of this kinetic data in a wide variety of solvents.&#xd;
Herein, we present our work towards the development of a water-soluble peroxyl radical clock, such that the kinetics of reactions of peroxyl radicals with water-soluble reductants can be determined. To do so, we have designed β,γ-unsaturated peroxyesters analogous to those we have previously developed, but that bear either carboxylate or poly(ethylene glycol) moieties to improve solubility in aqueous media. In addition, we have carried out a preliminary investigation of the use of alkyl and acyl xanthates as precursors to peroxyl radical clocks. These radical precursors offer the advantage that they have a pronounced ultraviolet absorption that tails into the visible, permitting efficient photochemical generation of the same alkyl radicals, but at longer wavelengths than that which are currently employed.</description>

   <description>Background: Levels of physical activity are significantly lower among individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to their healthy sedentary counterparts.  Low levels of self-efficacy (SE) with respect to exercise may contribute to a sedentary lifestyle in the ESRD population. Therefore, in a pilot investigation we examined the effects of an 8-week intra-dialytic (ID) exercise program on SE and physical activity (PA) in hemodialysis (HD) patients and determined the appropriateness and sensitivity of the selected outcome measures and proposed intervention.&#xd;
Methods: HD patients were randomized into an Exercise group (EX, n=4) or a Control group (CON, n=4).  The EX group cycled for approximately 60 min during HD, thrice weekly for 8 weeks. The CON group continued with their usual activity. At 8 weeks, participants in both groups had the option to participate in the exercise program. Physical Activity was determined using the Human Activity Profile (Maximal Activity Score, MAS; Adjusted Activity Score, AAS) and SE was evaluated using the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSES) and Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES).   Measures were obtained at pre, post and 8 weeks following the intervention.  &#xd;
Results:  No significant changes in PA or SE occurred between or within groups at any time point. Limited statistical power due to the small sample size and a ceiling effect due to initial high-function levels of the participants may have contributed to the lack of significant changes. MAS and AAS were generally lower in the CON group. Age was significantly associated with the AAS, MAS, and the Perform Social/Recreational Activities sub-scale of the CDSES. Serum albumin was significantly related to the AAS and the Exercise Regularly and Do Chores sub-scales of the CDSES. &#xd;
Conclusions: Age and albumin should be taken into account when assessing physical activity in HD patients. Recruitment of additional participants is required to more clearly define the role of intra-dialytic exercise in enhancing exercise self-efficacy and physical activity in HD patients.</description>

   <description>This thesis devises quantization and source-channel coding schemes to increase the error robustness of the newly standardized ITU-T G.711.1 speech coder. The schemes employ Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based multiple description quantizers (MDQ). The thesis reviews the literature focusing on GMM based quantization, MDQ, and GMM-MDQ design methods and bit allocation schemes. GMM-MDQ are then designed for the quantization and coding of the MDCT coefficients in the G.711.1 speech coder. The designs are optimized for and tested over packet erasure channels. Performance of the designs are compared with Mohr's forward error correcting code based multiple description coding (MDC) scheme.</description>

   <description>The use of force by police has been explored through a range of social science perspectives. However, the majority of those perspectives have failed to account for the impact that situational factors have on the use of coercion by police. While situational perspectives have been utilized, they have primarily focused on solitary features of the situation; thus, ignoring a situation’s various component parts. The general absence of consideration given to situational force is exhibited within the sociological literature more generally. This absence contributes to a diminished appreciation for the circumstances that transpire within the context of the situation. This thesis explores the role that the situation plays in the generation of police use of coercion. In addition, this thesis observes whether contemporary theoretical developments can elaborate the explanatory value of the situation in studying the use of violence by police. Specifically, this thesis utilizes Collins’ (2004) micro-situational theory of violence and his concept of forward panic. &#xd;
	To examine the utility of Collins’ theory, eight theoretical propositions are used. This research examines the extent to which the propositions were empirically observable and whether they had a value added impact. The propositions examined were: 1) cross-purpose, 2) tension/fear, 3) the prolonged building of tension/fear, 4) docile lingering, 5) suspect in a position of weakness, 6) suspect outnumbered, 7) overkill and piling on of violence, and 8) rhythm. To observe the propositions a multiple case study analysis was conducted using Internet videos and newspaper articles. It was found that in all nine cases each of the propositions as described by Collins (2004) were present. The findings suggest general support for using Collins’ theory to explain police violence. In addition, his theory was found to have value added capability, as each of the situational components of the theory combined to impact on police violence.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2010-06-02 14:36:43.282</description>
   <description>In the post-9/11 world, Bangladesh has been identified as a new hub of the Al-Qaeda network in South Asia. Most of the contemporary national and international media reports, security documents, and even academic studies point to the fact that an Islamist movement is on the dramatic rise in Bangladesh in recent years. These reports and studies portray the Islamist movement as closely linked with terrorism and devoid of any historical roots and relations with other types of movement. Contrary to this view, this study argues that the Islamist movement is not an unprecedented phenomenon but historically linked with a broader militia movement which subsequently leads to the emergence of Bangladesh as a nation state in 1971. Since its inception, the nation state is dealing not only with the Islamist movement but also with two other types of militia movement almost simultaneously – the leftwing and the ethnic. Having identified these three types, this study defines the militia movement in terms of five analytical categories – ideology, motivation, mobilization, organization, and ritual – following Freilich and others. It analyzes the Bangladesh militia movement in terms of these five dimensions, providing historical-empirical data from both primary and secondary sources to show how the contemporary militias are carrying forward the legacy of their historical forerunners. This study concludes with policy recommendations on how informed decisions can be made to effectively deal with the militia issue.</description>

   <description>Microgyroscopes find popular applications in modern life, such as, vehicle navigation, inertial positioning, human body motion monitoring, etc. In this study, three unique MEMS gyroscopic sensors were investigated using experimental methods and finite element analysis (FEA) modelling, particularly their modal behaviour. The analytical, simulated and experimental results were compared and the discrepancy between resonant frequencies of the significant mode shapes was discussed.&#xd;
Three microfabricated gyroscopes were investigated: a thermally-actuated in-plane gyroscope, an electrostatically-actuated in-plane gyroscope and an electrostatically-actuated out-of-plane gyroscope. Numerical finite element modal analysis for these three gyroscopes was conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics. The experimental testing was conducted using a microsystem analyzer (MSA-400 PolyTec) with an integrated laser vibrometer.&#xd;
The simulation models predicted that the frequencies for driving and sensing modes were 4.948kHz and 5.459kHz for a thermally-actuated gyroscope, which agreed well with experimentally determined results of 5.98kHz and 6.0kHz respectively. The power requirements of a thermally-actuated gyroscope were 363.39mW to elicit a maximum peak-to-peak displacement of 4.2μm during dynamic operation. Similarly, the simulated frequencies for the driving and sensing modes were 1.170kHz and 1.644kHz for an electrostatically-actuated in-plane gyroscope, which corresponded to experimentally determined resonant frequencies 1.6kHz and 1.9kHz.&#xd;
Simulation for the electrostatically-actuated out-of-plane gyroscope was conducted and the frequencies for the driving and sensing modes were found to be 2.159kHz and 3.298kHz. Due to some fabrication defects, the experimental testing for this microgyroscope was not successful. Some recommendations to improve the design were provided for the future work.</description>

   <description>Much of the academic literature and many health promotion materials related to Aboriginal peoples and food reflect and propagate a problematic view of authentic Aboriginal cultures: that they are frozen in time and are in need of protection. This prevailing view ignores the reality that all cultures, and their cuisines, evolve and adapt through creativity and resilience. Most food research focusing on Aboriginal peoples centers around narrowly defined “traditional foods,” and little attention has been paid to what they themselves consider to be “traditional foods,” or the socio-cultural significance of contemporary food patterns. Because others have often paternalistically assumed to know what is in their best interests, Aboriginal peoples’ perspectives have seldomly been heard on such matters. The purpose of this project was to hear the voices of Aboriginal peoples about the meanings and values of foods in their contemporary diets. Participants, who self-identified as being Aboriginal persons, living in or near Terrace, British Columbia, were asked to take pictures of everyday foods, which were used in open-ended, semi-structured, photo-elucidated interviews. Themes identified in preliminary analysis were further discussed in a group interview. Analysis of these interviews showed support for some key issues documented in the academic literature, such as barriers that exist in accessing and using locally gathered foods. However, particiants also contested some of the assumptions implicit in research and health promotion materials, such as the dichotomization of gathered foods as “healthy” and store-bought foods as “unhealthy.” Analysis showed that the meanings participants ascribe to food are context dependant; for example, different partcipants might consider a particular food a luxury, staple or “poor food,” depending on their backgrounds. Analysis also revealed that there are debates about what foods are considered to be “traditional.” The findings of this research urge us to reconsider some of the assumptions that inform research and health promotion activities targetting Aboriginal peoples.</description>

   <description>This thesis focuses on the cytochrome P450 CYP24A1, which catabolizes 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25-(OH)2D3) via two pathways commencing with C24-, or C23-hydroxylation and culminating in calcitroic acid or 1α,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone respectively.  In my thesis, I set out to identify the molecular determinants of the unique multicatalytic activity of human (h) CYP24A1, using a combination of techniques including homology modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme activity assays.  In total, 42 hCYP24A1 mutants were stably transfected into V79-4 cells, and the metabolism of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and 9 analogs or prodrugs were studied using HPLC and LC-MS-based techniques.  Overall, we observed that mutations at sites in contact with the side-chain of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 above the heme in the homology model, affected the regioselectivity of the protein, and mutations at more distal sites along the substrate cavity affected the access of the substrate or intermediates.  Of these mutations, A326G and V391L were of particular interest.  Ala326, in the centre of the I-helix in contact with the side chain of 1α,25-(OH)2D3, is a major determinant of the regioselectivity difference between opossum (C23-hydroxylating) and human (C24-hydroxylating) enzymes.  When Ala326 was mutated to Gly, as it is in opossum, hCYP24A1 was converted from a C24-hydroxylase, to a C23-hydroxylase, forming 1α,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone.  We propose that A326G permits the side chain to enter the substrate binding site more deeply, thus positioning C23 as opposed to C24 above the heme for hydroxylation.  Another mutation, V391L in the beta-3a sheet, drastically changed the substrate specificity of CYP24A1 towards the prodrug 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1α-OH-D3), which is not metabolized by the wild-type enzyme.  V391L converted  hCYP24A1 into a  1α-OH-D3-25-hydroxylase, forming 1α,25-(OH)2D3 which was subsequently catabolized via C24-hydroxylation by the same enzyme.  The downstream catabolism of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 formed from 1α-OH-D3 was engineered to proceed via C23-hydroxylation, by introducing a V391L/A326G double mutant.  We propose that altered steric contact at C21 is responsible for enabling C25-hydroxylation by V391L.  Taken together, we have successfully developed an approach that has identified key structural and functional insights into the mechanism of action of hCYP24A1 that can be potentially applied to study other cytochrome P450 enzymes.</description>

   <description>This study explores the importance of heterosexual relationships, in theory and practice, to the making of Upper Canada as a British colonial society. Between 1783, when settlers began to enter the territory in the wake of the American Revolutionary War, and 1850, when the transition toward a more powerful colonial state was underway, contests surrounding marriage, gender, and sexuality were of great significance.  The colony was intended by its first and many of its subsequent Lieutenant-Governors to serve as a model of loyalty to the British Empire and a bulwark against American democratic “disorder.”  Fundamental to this colonial project was the presence of an orderly body of white settlers; however, this aim was often complicated and undermined by a diverse settler population which refused to conform to middle-class mores and social norms. Marriage and sexual “morality,” significant aspects of assessing “race” and “civilization” in this period, were primary sites for these tensions.&#xd;
This study reenvisions appropriate and inappropriate heterosexual behaviour in the colony and explores the importance of debates over marriage and sexuality to articulations of settler identity.  Using private writings, travel literature, and judicial records, including the benchbooks of the colony’s judges, I examine the ways the formation and dissolution of intimate relationships were contested between individual colonists, in local politics, and in international discourse about the British empire and the value of its colonies of settlement.  Although Upper Canadians generally tolerated a broader spectrum of heterosexual behaviours and practices, including “irregular” marriage forms, disputes over appropriate expressions of sexuality and marriage were implicated in the rhetoric of inclusion and exclusion from the colony’s inception.   The role of the “neighbourhood” and community knowledge was multivalent and critical in determining acceptable behaviour in consensual relationships and defining sexual coercion.  By the end of the 1840s, shifts in cultural and legal values increasingly placed the regulation of intimate matters in the hands of the state.</description>

   <title>Dissipative Decomposition and Feedback Stabilization of Nonlinear Control Systems</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-06-17 10:13:42.201</description>
   <description>This dissertation considers the problem of approximate dissipative potentials construction and their use in smooth feedback stabilization of nonlinear control systems.  For mechanical systems, dissipative potentials, usually a generalized Hamiltonian function, can be derived from physical intuition.  When a dissipative Hamiltonian is not available, one can rely on dissipative Hamiltonian realization techniques, as proposed recently by Cheng and coworkers.  Extensive results are available in the literature for (robust) stabilization based on the obtained potential.&#xd;
&#xd;
For systems of interest in chemical engineering, especially systems with mass action kinetics, energy is often ill-defined.  Moreover, realization techniques are difficult to apply, due to the nonlinearities associated with the reaction terms.   Approximate dissipative realization techniques have been considered by many researchers for analysis and feedback design of controllers in the context of chemical processes.  The objective of this thesis is to study the&#xd;
construction of local dissipative potentials and their application to solve stabilization problems.&#xd;
&#xd;
The present work employs the geometric stabilization approach proposed by Jurdjevic and Quinn, refined by Faubourg and Pomet, and by Malisoff and Mazenc, for the design of stabilizing feedback laws.  This thesis seeks to extend and apply the Jurdjevic--Quinn stabilization method to nonlinear stabilization problems, assuming no a priori&#xd;
knowledge of a Lyapunov function.&#xd;
&#xd;
A homotopy-based local decomposition method is first employed to study the dissipative Hamiltonian realization problem, leading to the construction of locally defined dissipative potentials.  If the obtained  potential satisfies locally the&#xd;
weak Jurdjevic--Quinn conditions, it is then shown how to construct feedback controllers using that potential, and&#xd;
under what conditions a Lyapunov function can be constructed locally for time-independent control affine systems.  The proposed technique is then used for the construction of state feedback regulators and for the stabilization of periodic orbits based on a construction proposed by Bacciotti and Mazzi.  In the last chapter of the thesis, stabilization of time-dependent control affine systems is considered, and the main result is used for the stabilization of periodic solutions using asymptotic feedback tracking.&#xd;
&#xd;
Low-dimensional examples are used throughout the thesis to illustrate the proposed techniques and results.</description>

   <description>This thesis focuses on the design of radio-frequency (RF) mixers, including a broadband downconverter mixer, an upconverter mixer and a downconverter mixer with high linearity. The basic mixer topology used in this thesis was the Gilbert cell mixer, which is the most popular mixer topology in modern communication systems. In order to accommodate different applications, the broadband mixer and the upconverter mixer were designed to be reconfigurable.  &#xd;
&#xd;
First, a broadband downconverter mixer with variable conversion gain was designed using 0.13-$\mu m$ CMOS technology. The mixer worked from 2 to 10 GHz. By changing the effective transistor size of the transconductor and the load, the mixer was able to work in three different modes with different conversion gain and power consumption. &#xd;
&#xd;
Second, an upconverter mixer with sideband selection was demonstrated in CMOS 0.13-$\mu$m technology. The transmitted sideband could be chosen to be the upper sideband or the lower sideband. The mixer worked at 5 GHz with a 100 MHz IF. The measured voltage conversion gains were 11.2 dB at 4.9 GHz and 12.4 dB at 5.1 GHz. The best sideband rejection was around 30 dB.&#xd;
&#xd;
Third, a modified derivative superposition (DS) technique was used to linearize a Gilbert cell mixer. Simulation results predicted an IIP3 improvement of 12.5 dB at 1 GHz. After linearization, the noise figure of the mixer increased by only 0.7 dB and the conversion gain decreased by 0.3 dB. The power consumption of the mixer increased by 0.96 mW.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the design of a QPSK demodulator frontend for GPON transceiver at end user's side. Since lowering the cost of the terminal transceivers in an access network like GPON is a key requirement, CMOS technology is used and several area-saving design techniques are applied. The designed frontend circuit saved more than 80% area of the key components like the mixers and the QVCO than some published designs which can also fit the application. A measurement in frequency domain and a simulation in time domain verified that this frontend is able to demodulate a QPSK signal with a data rate as high as 5 Gbit/s.&#xd;
&#xd;
Two structures of quadrature oscillators are firstly presented and compared. One is an LC QVCO centered at 5 GHz, which has a tuning range of 3 GHz, a phase noise of -100.8 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, and an area of 0.15 mm2 excluding pads. The other is a ring QVCO which only takes an area of 0.019 mm2. But it has a higher phase noise of -81 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset.&#xd;
&#xd;
Then two broadband mixers are described separately. The first one provides a high conversion gain, but its input linearity is insufficient to meet the input power requirement. The second mixer obtains required input linearity but with a trade-off of conversion gain. Both mixers have a broadband input impedance match from 2 GHz to 8 GHz. The first mixer has a conversion gain of 8.5 dB and an input 1 dB compresion point at -17 dBm. The second mixer has a conversion gain of -7 dB with an on-chip buffer or -2.1 dB without buffer, but an input 1 dB compresion point at -5 dBm.&#xd;
&#xd;
A frontend circuit is lastly presented. It integrates the compact ring QVCO, two broadband mixers with high input linearity, and two second-order LC ladder low pass filters. A Frequency domain measurement shows the expected spectrum down conversion of a 2.5 Gsym/s QPSK signal centered at 5 GHz. The whole frontend circuit including pads takes 1 mm2 area, and consumed 157 mW power.</description>

   <description>Hair is a remarkably complex material-semiotic entity. Caught on the cusp between self/society, meticulously contrived and purposely styled, hair is crucial in the articulation of identity and difference. However, although scholars have focused a great deal of attention on the body as a site of cultural production and identity politics, discussions surrounding hair have been largely ignored and relegated to the realm of the trivial or inconsequential. Addressing this void, this project places hair at the centre of examination in a two-part qualitative analysis. First, hair is reconfigured as sign and examined as a socio-cultural performance achieved through the reiteration of historically contingent practices, and materialized through the body. Particular attention is paid to Black women’s hair/styling practices as a vital site of cultural production, identity negotiation and radical subversion. Following this is a critical discourse analysis of the representation of hair within popular culture, with a specific focus on the way in which Black women’s hair/styling practices are fundamentally implicated in the production of identity and difference. The possibility of resistance through transgressive hair stylizations is also explored. Overall, hair is found to be intimately involved in the (re)constitution of sexed/gendered beings, integral to the process of racialization and a potential locus of resistance. However, this investigation also finds that popular culture displays –even those that purport to offer a critical analysis – fail to destabilize the underlying regimes of domination and oppression that limit and sustain the systems of meaning through which hair is understood.</description>

   <description>When women are faced with the diagnosis and treatment options for their care, they have high a need for information that persists throughout the course of their illness.  When information needs are met, women are able to make informed decisions regarding their care, have increased quality of life, and cope better with their illness.  The objective of this study was to identify the information needs of postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer making treatment decisions regarding endocrine therapy.  An integrative review of research was conducted to collate and describe the information needs assessment methodologies used to identify information needs for women with breast cancer.  Based on this review and our long-term goal of identifying a list of questions or information needs of women at this stage of their cancer treatment, we conducted a qualitative descriptive study to identify information needs and interviewed 17 post-menopausal women with early stage breast cancer and 4 healthcare providers.  Women were asked to describe the questions they had or the information that they needed when endocrine therapy became part of their care.  The healthcare providers described the information that they felt was important for women to know in regard to endocrine therapy.  A list of 91 questions regarding endocrine therapy was identified; including information needs related to side effects, drug characteristics, financial cost, and survival/recurrence.  Most women were not aware that they had a choice about the different types of endocrine treatment and often followed the physician’s recommendations.  This study supports the assertion that postmenopausal women with breast cancer wish to be informed that they have a choice and desire information to make the best personal choice in collaboration with the physician.  Healthcare professionals need to be aware of both the common and individual patients’ information needs and present options to assist women making the best decisions about their care.</description>

   <description>This research explored the role of science and civil society environmental organizations in conservation planning, using a case study of Ontario’s Long Point region.  Science is a dynamic field that is constantly adapting and evolving and is increasingly relied on as a basis for decision-making in conservation planning, policy and management.  The role of civil society in conservation planning has also grown and organizations that operate outside of government now play an important role in acquiring land, conducting monitoring activities, and promoting local stewardship.  Considering the activities of these organizations, and the underlying science that informs them, is essential given the increasing prevalence of this type of work and the increasing ability of civil society organizations to affect conservation planning outcomes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Through a literature review, document analysis, and semi-structured interviews, this research considered how characterizations of science, applications of science, and recent trends in science have influenced conservation plans, policies, and actions in the Long Point region.  The results illustrate how different forms of information were considered and applied when prioritizing, justifying, and implementing conservation projects and provide a location-specific example of how the modern features of conservation planning and management are influencing environmental outcomes.   Specifically, the results suggest how place-based knowledge can potentially be disseminated through policy and planning initiatives and also suggest how different forms of information may interact to influence overall project credibility.  These findings have implications for both planning theory and practice by contributing to our understanding of the role of science in shaping conservation practices, the role of civil society in driving conservation innovation, and the importance of local knowledge in supporting effective conservation actions.</description>

   <description>The first part of this research is devoted to work of an anthological and descriptive sort, which aims at gathering a corpus of French independent monologues. "Independent monologue" should be understood as a self-sufficient stage performance based on the speaking of a single artist, in opposition to the monologues inserted in a dialogical play. From the Middle Ages to the 1950's, this historical review focuses in particular on the thirteenth century "jongleurs", the burlesque sermons at the junction of the end of the Middles Ages and the early Renaissance, the plays "in monologues" of the eighteenth century, the "monologues fumistes" at the end of the nineteenth century, the poets and cabaret singers of the Belle Époque, Cocteau's monological theatre and two of the first contemporary humorists, Bourvil and Fernand Raynaud.&#xd;
&#xd;
This corpus provides the material for a two-step analysis. First we examine whether the type-differences that certain monologues reveal can be accounted for by objective formal characteristics which then allow us to propose a partition of our corpus. As a result of this questioning, we propose that generic distinctions can be established among the monologues according to the enunciation conditions they develop, that is, whether the speech is directly addressed to the public or not, and whether the enunciator is a character or the artist himself. Next we organize the monological universe according to traits, transversal to the generic partition, with which the monologues present affinities. These traits pertain to scenic modalities, to functions held by the monologuist or to the form of discourse. The analytic tool previously developed is finally brought into play in confronting the work of Raymond Devos, a humorist emblematic of the French scene whose sketches stand out for the remarkable plays on word they display.&#xd;
&#xd;
N. B.: the bibliography aims at offering simplified access to the monologues, in particular by providing the references to internet documents, be they texts that are difficult to obtain or audio and video recordings.</description>

   <description>A parameter-free solution is presented for data projector calibration using a single camera and Gray coded structured light patterns. The proposed method assumes that both camera and projector exhibit significant non-linear distortion, and that projection surfaces can be either planar or freeform. The camera is calibrated first through traditional methods, and the calibrated images are then used to detect Gray coded patterns displayed on a surface by the data projector. Projector to camera correspondences are created by decoding the patterns in the camera images to form a 2D correspondence map. Calibrated systems produce geometrically correct, ex- tremely short throw projections, while maintaining or exceeding the projection size of a standard configuration. Qualitative experiments are performed on two baseline images, while quantitative data is recovered from the projected image of a chessboard pattern. A typical throw ratio of 0.5 can be achieved with a pixel distance error below 1.</description>

   <description>Until recently, the majority of research in the area of English phonological awareness has centered on segmental phonology as predictors of reading. Current research, however, has expanded the concept of phonological awareness to include prosodic sensitivity⎯the awareness of suprasegmental information. The present study explores the role of five segmental and suprasegmental levels of English phonological awareness as predictors of individual differences in word reading in Korean children learning English. 104 native Hangul speaking children in Grade 3 were assessed on English levels of stress, syllable, rime, simple phoneme, and consonant cluster awareness, as well as, English and Hangul word reading. Hierarchical regression models indicated that awareness of syllables, onset/rime units, and phonemes within consonant clusters were uniquely predictive of individual differences in L2 English word reading after accounting for cognitive ability, English background variables, and L1 word reading. Awareness of stress-timed patterns contributed to common variance in English and Hangul word reading, but was not uniquely predictive in final regression models. No level of phonological awareness was predictive of Hangul word reading. Results support the notion that segmental phonological elements not present in L1 may be predictive of individual differences in L2 word reading. Furthermore, cross-language transfer of PA may be weak in the direction of English (L2) to Hangul (L1).</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2010-06-29 15:56:08.387</description>
   <description>Obesity is pandemic.  Pharmacological treatment development depends on modeling the regulation of feeding, particularly by free fatty acids (FFA).  Most models have been employed in the rat in vivo, and show FFA-stimulated intestinal satiety signals are dependent on the fat’s acyl chain-length, involve cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion, and are mediated by vagal afferents.  I hypothesized that an in vitro mouse model could be employed, with sensitivity to measure afferent responses to nutrient stimuli.&#xd;
     Male C57BL/6N mice were killed, the intestine harvested en bloc, and a jejunal section dissected with neurovascular mesenteric arcade emanating centrally.  The tissue was placed in a Krebs-superfused chamber, the lumen cannulated with the outlet open to drain, and Krebs or other mediators were continuously perfused intraluminally.  The dissected afferent nerve was placed in a suction electrode for extracellular recording.  Afferent responses to distension and the perfusion of mediators (e.g. CCK or FFA) were tested.  Preparations from normal mice (no surgery), or from mice following chronic subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or sham operation, were used to assess vagal afferent contributions.&#xd;
     Luminally-perfused CCK (100 nM) increased afferent firing.  This response was abolished with the CCK-1 receptor antagonist lorglumide (10 µM).  The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) sodium butyrate (30 mM) potentiated firing.  The long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) sodium oleate (1-300 mM) activated concentration-dependent firing (EC50=25.35 mM) that was significantly greater at 30 mM than that evoked by butyrate.  Lorglumide (30 µM) abolished the oleate (30 mM) response.  The L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) inhibitor nicardipine (3 µM), intraluminally, potentiated the oleate response, while bath application abolished it.  Vagotomy attenuated the oleate response.  Vagotomy abolished the intraluminal CCK (100 nM) response, and attenuated the response to bath-superfused CCK.&#xd;
     These findings support FFA chain-length-dependent mesenteric afferent activation and CCK involvement in oleate-induced firing, and suggest LTCC mediation of excitatory and inhibitory oleate response transduction pathways.  The murine oleate response was shown to be mostly vagally-mediated, with some spinal contribution, and both vagal and spinal contributions to CCK responses were suggested.  These data provide a basis for further investigation in vitro of cellular and molecular mechanisms of afferent satiety signals, and ultimately of obesity pathogenesis.</description>

   <description>Current biomass pellets are susceptible to fines production during handling and transportation, moisture absorption, biological degradation, low specific energy content, off-gassing and poor flow and handling characteristics. The goal of this thesis was to create a novel pellet that addressed these issues. A new mould and die assembly was created to form spherical pellets using hybrid poplar that was torrefied in-situ. The new pellets were subjected to crushing, abrasion and tests of their hydrophilic performance. Additionally, ultimate and proximate analysis was performed. A “batch” torrefier was constructed to investigate the properties of torrefied poplar in order to compare the results to in-situ torrefied pellets. Mechanical and chemical tests which examined failure strength in compression, abrasion resistance, hydrophobic nature, gross calorific value, density, and size were used to determine where the new pellets ranked in comparison to standard cylindrical pellets. A set of designed experiments which used the aforementioned responses was created to formulate linear models which could predict the same responses based upon three two-level “factor” inputs: biomass particle size, moisture content of biomass, and temperature of torrefaction. The new spherical pellets withstood compressive forces of up to 17.06 MPa, did not abrade, absorbed up to 29.4% moisture yet returned to an “air-dry” moisture content of &lt;5% on a mass basis within 24 hours and obtained specific energies up to 22.09 MJ/kg. In addition, spherical pellets did not disintegrate when immersed, but instead remained intact and possessed much of their original physical characteristics once dried. The designed experiments showed that torrefaction temperature was the most important factor which affected test responses.</description>

   <description>This study offers a hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry into the experiences of Malaysian parents who selected an international education for their children. Data collection was conducted at one international school in Kuala Lumpur, and consisted of both a survey and interviews. The study focused on parents’ own educational background and experiences, their expectations and motivations for selecting an international school, factors affecting school choice, and attitudes to cultural and self-identities within the context of international education. Findings suggest that Malaysian parents from different age groups as well as varying ethnic and linguistic backgrounds had similar motivations for sending their children to an international school. From the data analysis, three themes emerged: aspirational priorities, discouraging influences, and enabling factors. By scaffolding my examination within the theory of reproduction in education and notions of social and cultural capital, I examined how multiple forms of economic, cultural, and social capital are recognized and mobilized in the search for a quality education in an increasingly globalized market. I conclude that Malaysian parents in this study chose an international school for their children based on experiences forged in four spheres of influence: individual, social, national, and global.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, German) -- Queen's University, 2010-07-03 15:55:04.052</description>
   <description>It is an undeniable fact that Adalbert Stifter paid detailed attention to his natural surroundings. Yet in the 1980s and 90s Stifter research focused on the author’s use of language: scholars endeavoured to emancipate the text from the intention of the author and to argue that a hermeneutic understanding of the text as a unity of meaning was impossible. More recently, scholars have pointed out the importance of Stifter’s ethical world-view, which insists on an equal treatment of all things. Following on from those arguments, this thesis conducts a reading of Stifter’s works from an ecological point of view and their implication for a good life in accordance with nature. Albert Schweitzer’s "Reverence for Life" and Arne Næss’ Deep Ecology are used as the ethical and philosophical framework. The four discussed works, "Der Hochwald" (1841/ 44), "Bergkristall" (1845/ 53), "Kalkstein" (1848/ 53) and "Der Nachsommer" (1857) show affinities and inconsistencies both between the different texts and within the individual texts themselves. Especially "Der Nachsommer" contradicts itself with its insistence that humans are only an "insertion" in the history of the earth on the one hand and its sympathy for the human desire for domination of the land on the other. Firstly, the thesis shows how the complexity of the ecological imagery in Stifter’s texts reflects the intricacy of a nineteenth-century perception of the world. The enthusiastic conquest of nature and the desire to reorder nature exists simultaneously with the scientific questioning of the subjective world-view. This questioning of a subjective perception of the world is secondly linked to the ecological imagery in Stifter’s work. His idiosyncratic language gives life to all things. This language, which I call an ecocentric narrative style, can be retraced in all his works, even in "Nachsommer". Consequently, the experience of the sublime is shifted into an ecological sublime. The perception of the immensity of nature and one’s own insignificance is not to be overcome by reason, but is instead a comforting realisation of one’s own relationship to and oneness with the entirety of the natural world.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of combining implementation intentions (II) and regulatory fit in the context of two important health goals: increasing leisure time physical activity and decreasing leisure time sedentary behaviour. Implementation intentions specify exactly how, when, and where a behaviour will occur and can be an effective method of increasing goal enactment. Regulatory fit occurs when a goal or strategy used to achieve the goal matches an individual’s regulatory orientation. University students (N = 180) were randomly assigned to a goal (increase activity/decrease screen time) and an experimental condition (II/non-II). Participants formed a goal to increase their physical activity or decrease their screen time over the following four weeks according to their random assignment. Participants’ commitment to their goal was monitored over the course of the study. The II group also formed a detailed plan regarding how they would accomplish their goal. Regulatory fit was determined based on group assignment and score on the regulatory focus questionnaire. Physical activity and screen time were assessed with self-report questionnaires. Follow-up occurred online four weeks after baseline. Data were analyzed separately by goal type using linear regressions to examine the effects of regulatory fit, experimental condition, and goal commitment on the behaviour variables. The regulatory fit manipulation was not successful. Among those with the physical activity goal, no significant effects emerged for the experimental variables. Among those with the screen time goal and in the fit, II group, stronger goal commitment tended to be associated with increased participation in moderate physical activity, β = .17, t(22) = .94, p = .36. Also, participants who set II for the screen time goal and were committed to this goal tended to report less screen time than participants with lower goal commitment (β = -.40, t(69) = -2.05, p = .05). Findings provide preliminary insight into the effectiveness of II and the importance of goal commitment in interventions aiming to reduce sedentary behaviour.</description>

   <description>In laser Transmission Welding (LTW), the laser beam passes through the transparent part and is dissipated as heat in the absorbent material through the use of laser-absorbing pigments such as carbon black (CB).  This energy is then conducted further into both parts.  Melting and subsequent solidification occur at the interface causing a weld to form between the two parts.&#xd;
Gluing or welding structures to the back of automotive Class-A panels often results in the appearance of undesirable surface deformations on the Class-A side.  Through control of the laser welding and material parameters, it may be possible to use contour LTW as a means of joining structures to the back of absorbent Class-A panels without creating these unwanted surface defects.  &#xd;
A series of lap welds was made using a range of CB levels, laser powers and polypropylene part thicknesses.  A profilometer was used to measure the size and shape of the defects generated on the surface of the black part.  Two types of defects were observed: ribs and sink marks.  It was observed that lower powers combined with higher carbon black levels generally resulted in smaller defects.  The type of defect depended on the boundary conditions between the two parts and the flow of polymer that had thermally expanded during welding (flash).  If weld flash flowed into gaps between the two plates, rib defects were always observed.  If flash flowed elsewhere and no gaps existed between the plates, sink marks occurred.  Finite element modeling was used to qualitatively validate these observations.</description>

   <description>Traditionally, the central threat to the defensibility of the range of practices and attitudes constitutive of moral criticism has been seen to be posed by the Causal Thesis, the view that all actions have antecedent causes to which they are linked by causal laws of the kind that govern other events in the universe. In such a world, agents lack the sort of underived origination and agency required for the appropriateness of moral criticism. However, Peter Strawson’s “Freedom and Resentment” marks a move away from a metaphysical conception of agency and conditions of the appropriateness of moral criticism. On Strawson’s account, the problem of moral responsibility is centrally a normative problem, a problem about the moral norms that govern interpersonal relationships, and the conditions of appropriateness of the range of attitudes and sentiments occasioned by the agents’ fulfillment or non-fulfillment of these norms. In this dissertation I argue that the success of normative conceptions of conditions of appropriateness of moral criticism is contingent of the amelioration of the tension between two strategies in “Freedom and Resentment.” Naturalist interpretations hold that sentiments and practices constitutive of moral criticism are natural features of human psychological constitution, and therefore neither allow nor require justification. Rationalist interpretation, by contrast, are based on an analysis of conditions under which moral criticism can be justifiably modified or suspended. Both of these strategies, I argue, are false. The naturalistic interpretation is false not because of its inability to offer a plausible account of the conditions of justifiability of reactive attitudes, but rather because of its inability to offer a principled account of the way moral norms are grounded. The rationalistic interpretation, in turn, not only relies on an implausible psychological account of conditions of responsible agency, but puts an unacceptable emphasis on the agent’s intention. A plausible interpretation of the normative strategy requires emphasizing not only the significance of attitudes and feelings, but also the role reasons play in constituting moral norms and justifying moral criticism</description>

   <description>In Canada, parental acceptance and uptake of the HPV vaccine has been low.  There is a need for more effective HPV vaccination health messages for parents.  Whether a message is framed in terms of the benefits of engaging in the behaviour (gain frame), the costs of failing to engage in the behaviour (loss frame) or both the benefits and the costs (mixed frame) has potential to impact parents’ decision making. The appropriate frame of a message may depend on the recipient’s sex and involvement with the health issue.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the persuasiveness of gain-, loss- and mixed-framed messages on mothers’ and fathers’ intentions to have their young son or daughter vaccinated against HPV.  The study used a 3 Frame x 2 Sex of Parent x 2 Sex of Child design.  We randomly assigned participants (n=367) to read a framed message and then complete a 29-item questionnaire assessing theoretical determinants of parental consent for vaccination.  ANCOVAs revealed a three-way interaction for intentions to speak to a doctor about the HPV vaccine, F(2, 342)=3.66, p =.03, perceived severity of HPV, F(2, 347) = 3.10, p = .05, and for anxiety about their child contracting HPV, F(2, 342)=3.58, p=.02.  Effect size comparisons revealed that gain-framed messages seem to persuade parents who are the opposite sex to the child for whom they are considering the vaccine.  In turn, loss- and mixed-framed messages may persuade parents who are the same sex as the child for whom they are considering the vaccine.  Perceived severity of HPV and anxiety about HPV mediated the relationship between message frame and intentions for some parent-child dyads.  Findings have implications for constructing effective messages encouraging parents to consider having their child vaccinated against HPV.</description>

   <description>Proteins play many roles in the body, and the task of understanding how proteins function is very challenging. Determining a protein’s location within the cell (also referred to as the subcellular location) helps shed light on the function of that protein. Protein subcellular location can be inferred through experimental methods or predicted using computational systems. In particular, we focus on two existing computational systems, namely EpiLoc and HomoLoc, that use features derived from text (abstracts of technical papers), and apply a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify proteins into their respective locations. Both EpiLoc and HomoLoc’s prediction accuracy is comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein location prediction systems. However, in addition to accuracy, other factors such as training efficiency must be considered in evaluating the quality of a location prediction system. In this thesis, we replace the SVM classifier in EpiLoc and HomoLoc, by a naïve Bayes classifier and by a novel classifier which we call the Mean Weight Text classifier. The Mean Weight Text classifier and the naïve Bayes classifier are simple to implement and execute efficiently. In addition, naïve Bayes classifiers have been shown effective in the context of protein location prediction and are considered preferable to SVM due to clarity in explaining the process used to derive the results. Evaluating the performance of these classifiers on existing data sets, we find that SVM classifiers have a slightly higher accuracy than naïve Bayes and Mean Weight Text classifiers. This slight advantage is offset by the simplicity and efficiency offered by naïve Bayes and Mean Weight Text classifiers. Moreover, we find that the Mean Weight Text classifier has a slightly higher accuracy than the naïve Bayes classifier.</description>

   <description>Women in Benin commonly participate in physically demanding activities that involve the carriage of heavy loads on the head and back. These strenuous tasks combined with pregnancy can result in back pain that may persist after delivery in some cases. The objective of this study was to examine how the trunk postures of pregnant women in Benin were affected by their occupational activities. This study also examined trunk postures, as well as postures of the head relative to the trunk, in the specific task of carrying loads on the head. Finally, the instrument used in this study to measure trunk postures, the Virtual CorsetTM  (VC) (Microstrain, Williston, VT, USA), was validated against a system of potentiometers.&#xd;
Questionnaires completed by 26 pregnant and 25 non-pregnant subjects revealed that 58% of pregnant women suffered from back pain since the start of pregnancy. An average of 328 instances of trunk flexion at angles larger than 60° were recorded during the workdays of 17 pregnant women, while 66 of those flexions events were held for more than four seconds. Furthermore, an average of 36% of the recorded workday was spent in trunk flexion at angles exceeding 20°. Trunk postural data, at C7 and S1, as well as sagittal positions of the head relative to the trunk were compared between pregnant and non-pregnant subjects and between unloaded and loaded walking conditions for the specific task of head load carriage. These comparisons showed that load on the head significantly increased upper trunk extension and lateral bending of the upper trunk towards the left during walking. Motion of the head relative to the trunk and motion of the upper trunk significantly decreased in the loaded condition and was compensated by increased motion at the sacrum level. &#xd;
In the validation study, the VC was moved at different speeds to observe the effects of accelerations on the angle measurements. Root mean square difference between the angles measured by the VC and the potentiometers were all below 5° and 6° for flexion-extension and lateral bending, respectively, with the exception of rapid movements where errors were slightly larger.</description>

   <description>The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signalling factors play diverse roles in animal development. In mammals, the Hh ortholog Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is critical for the proper formation of the limbs, central nervous system, and axial skeleton, amoung other tissues. Mutations affecting the function of this pathway during development have severe consequences to the developing embryo and can cause birth defects in humans. Inappropriate activation of the pathway in adult tissues has also been implicated in several human cancers. In recent years several unexpected regulatory factors of the pathway during embryogenesis and in the adult have emerged through genetic studies in the mouse, such as proteins involved in vesicle transport and in the formation and function of primary (non-motile) cilia. Evidence is presented here that the mouse Tubby gene family member Tubby-like protein 3 (Tulp3) plays an important negative regulatory function in the Hh signalling pathway during embryogenesis, a role not previously associated with the Tubby proteins. Embryos lacking Tulp3 develop severe neural tube defects and polydactyly, along with ectopic activation of Shh target genes in the developing limbs and CNS, and altered Shh mediated axon guidance in the developing spinal cord. Moreover, Tulp3 was found to act largely independently of Shh, as compound Tulp3/Shh mutant embryos retain expression of Shh target genes and related abnormalities. Finally, the Tulp3 protein was found to localize to the primary cilium in cultured cells, implicating Tulp3, and possibly other Tubby proteins as regulators of cilium based signalling. These results have important implications in the understanding of the regulation of the Hh pathway, and in the emergence of Hh related birth defects and tumourigenesis.</description>

   <description>An innovative two-stroke engine has been under development at Queen’s University.&#xd;
Traditional crankcase-scavenged two-stroke engines have laboured to meet emissions standards and achieve fuel economy comparable to four-stroke engines. The engine in question makes use of a modified Eaton-type supercharger to enable air-only scavenging, with this it utilizes direct fuel injection which occurs after the exhaust ports have closed, these two elements combine to&#xd;
eliminate the combustion of lubricating oil in the cylinder and short-circuiting of the fuel-air mixture into the exhaust. By having passive check valves in the cylinder head to regulate the inflow of scavenging air, and exhaust ports located near bottom centre this results in a top-down uniflow-scavenged configuration, as well as retaining a simplistic engine design. In the two-stroke cycle, using the intake charge to replace the combustion products with fresh air during&#xd;
scavenging is critical to engine performance. In this engine the scavenging charge is produced by a set of passive intake check valves, and because of this the scavenging timing is important.  These valves are important because they govern the volume of combustion products that are forced out of the cylinder during scavenging, and hence the efficiency of combustion in the engine. To evaluate the engine design criteria, a validated computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was used to offer insight into how the in-cylinder flow developed during scavenging. The CFD model of this engine was used to test different check-valve geometries to see how they affect the scavenging flow in the cylinder. The goal of this is to assist in entraining more of the combustion products which would result in more being exhausted from the cylinder. A more favourable design was found, and a design produced to be taken onto the next step of testing.</description>

   <description>MRI-guided prostate needle biopsy requires compensation for organ motion between&#xd;
target planning and needle placement. Two questions are studied and answered in this&#xd;
work: is rigid registration sufficient in tracking the targets with a maximum error of&#xd;
3 mm (smaller than average prostate tumor size) and how many intra-operative slices&#xd;
are required to obtain this accuracy? We developed rigid and deformable multislice-&#xd;
to-volume registration algorithms for tracking the biopsy targets within the prostate.&#xd;
Three orthogonal plus additional transverse intra-operative slices were acquired in&#xd;
the approximate center of the prostate and registered with a high-resolution target&#xd;
planning volume. Simulated intra-operative data, phantom data, and MRI-guided&#xd;
robotic prostate biopsy data were used to assess tracking accuracy. Registration tests&#xd;
on simulated intra-operative data with 3, 4, and 5 slices were performed to evaluate&#xd;
the effect on registration error and time. Results: Using three orthogonal slices pro-&#xd;
vides sufficient accuracy. Convergence test results on phantom images demonstrated&#xd;
100% success rate for initial misalignment of 5mm. Average registration errors for&#xd;
the patient data were 2.55mm and 2.05mm for the rigid and deformable algorithms,&#xd;
respectively. The algorithm was able to capture rigid biopsy target displacements&#xd;
of maximum 8mm and non-rigid displacements of maximum 1.5mm. Rigid tracking&#xd;
appears to be promising. Deformable registration does not seem warranted.</description>

   <description>In Ann Stoler’s (1995) erudite critique of the absence of race in Foucault’s History of Sexuality Volume 1, she asks if any of the figures of sexual regulation Foucault takes up could have “exist[ed] as objects of knowledge and discourse in the nineteenth century without a racially erotic counterpoint, without reference to the libidinal energies of the savage, the primitive, the colonized?” (pp. 6-7). Recognizing that the regulation of sexuality was often enforced through psychiatric mechanisms, one might also add that discourses of wellness and illness, the normal and the pathological, were also discursively framed in relation to the colonial other. This paper explores how the medicalizing discourses of s/m in nineteenth century sexology were mutually constituted with Germany’s coeval imperial expansion and regulation of national identity. I take up the conditions of possibility for the formation of sadism and masochism within psychiatric discourse, such as Germany’s national unification in 1871, Germany’s colonial expansion in East and Southwest Africa from 1884 to 1919, and the exogenous criticisms of Germany’s colonial policy. Such circumstances provided impetus for Germany to define savagery and civility through the regulation of sexual practices within Germany’s national borders. Though s/m is presently most often tied to discourses of imperialism, through shared tropes such as master-slave relationships, flogging, bondage, and collars, I hope to complicate such perspectives by examining the relationships of imperialism and nationalism to psychiatric perspectives on s/m. By conducting a close reading of psychiatric, sexological, and psychoanalytic descriptions of sadism and masochism throughout Germany’s imperialist expansionist era, I argue that the pathologization of s/m was as much about the regulation of Germany’s racial identity as it was about the regulation of sexuality.</description>

   <description>Objective: To identify the physician-, patient- and health-system-related factors that influence gynecologists’ decision to recommend endometrial sampling in young women (less than 40 years) with abnormal uterine bleeding&#xd;
Study methods: A mail-based survey study was conducted using the Salant-Dillman method with 4 points of contact over 9 weeks. All Canadian obstetrician/gynecologists were initially surveyed (N=1746), receiving either French or English questionnaires. Eligible respondents were gynecologists practicing in Canada who treat these young women (N=834). Order response bias was taken into consideration by mailing two versions of the survey. Categorical data were analyzed using Pearson’s Chi-square statistics. A logistic regression with mixed effect model was performed to determine the odds of sampling the endometrium, using physician as random factor.&#xd;
Results: Overall response rate was 56.5%. The majority of respondents were generalists (83.6%). 70.3% of respondents have had young patients with malignant or pre-malignant endometrial conditions. Physicians ≤ 39 years have had less experience with these patients (59.6%, p=0.002) as have physicians practicing in communities without ob/gyn residents (35.2%, p=0.006). Sampling method was predominantly by office pipelle (79.7%), with younger physicians and female respondents employing this method most frequently (p=0.0001). &#xd;
In case scenarios which explored the importance of four patient-related risk factors (obesity, irregular cycles, nulliparity and older age), on the decision to sample, 98.8% of respondents would sample a young woman presenting with all four risk factors, as opposed to 8.8% who would sample if the patient did not have any of these characteristics. Obesity and irregular cycles was the next most important combination of risk factors prompting sampling in 87.3% of physicians. &#xd;
In the logistic regression, the odds ratio to proceed with endometrial sampling was 2.23 (95% CI 1.64-3.03) if a physician had previous experience with young women diagnosed with endometrial cancer or a pre-malignant condition, and was 1.45 (95% CI 1.05-2.01) if the physician was female. &#xd;
Conclusion: Patient and physician factors influenced the decision to proceed with sampling the endometrium of young women with abnormal uterine bleeding, whereas the health-system factors studied in this survey did not seem to play a strong role.</description>

   <description>The boreal forest region of Canada is climatically sensitive and may be impacted by anthropogenic-induced climatic changes. The results of this multi-proxy paleolimnological study contribute detailed information on changes to the boreal forest in northwestern (NW) Ontario, showing unequivocal changes in lake and forest structure due to climate during the warmer mid-Holocene. This study uses diatoms, pollen, and charcoal reconstructions to better understand the timing and extent of climate-related changes in Lake 239, Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), in NW Ontario throughout the Holocene with an emphasis on the warmer mid-Holocene. &#xd;
Diatom analysis revealed changes in water quality based on analysis of species assemblages and quantitative inferences of total phosphorus from a deep central core. Lake levels at least 8-m lower than today were inferred from a near-shore core and were concurrent with an increase in nutrient-rich diatom assemblages, an increase in diatom accumulation, and a decrease in chrysophytes relative to diatoms in the central core. A concurrent increase in pollen such as Cupressaceae and Ambrosia indicate more open boreal forest between ~4500-8000 cal yr BP. Pollen-based inferences of temperature suggest an increase on average of 1-2°C warmer than today with winter temperatures up to 4°C warmer. The pollen inferences also suggest enhanced precipitation, but with increased evaporation/evapotranspiration resulting in reduced moisture availability overall. A transect of cores surrounding ELA was synthesized using pollen-based reconstructions of temperature and precipitation to assess regional changes. All sites show shifts in pollen assemblages indicating a warmer mid-Holocene; prairie sites to the west show mid-Holocene decreases in precipitation relative to today, whereas sites near or east of ELA show consistent increases in precipitation, but with enhanced evaporation. Charcoal analysis shows an increase in charcoal accumulation during the mid-Holocene warm period compared to the early and late Holocene, suggesting a more active fire regime. Fire return intervals based on type-M charcoal show a pronounced decrease during the early-to-mid Holocene period and a corresponding increase in fire frequency, whereas fire frequency derived from total charcoal was virtually unchanged over the Holocene. This study helps fill a knowledge gap in NW Ontario noted by several large regional assessments.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2010-07-26 11:11:27.456</description>
   <description>Background. Children with autism spectrum disorders have complex needs requiring a broad range of supports. High demand for autism services has led to gaps in the provision of care, and there is little research examining whether families of school-aged children receive services reflective of their needs.&#xd;
Objectives. The objectives of this thesis were to describe unmet needs reported by parents of school-aged children with an autism spectrum disorder and to examine the association between the child’s level of functional independence and the parent’s reported level of unmet need. &#xd;
Methods. A review of the literature on needs assessments in autism was performed. A cross-sectional study was then conducted among parents of 101 children who (1) had an autism spectrum disorder, (2) were between the ages of 6 and 13 years, and (3) were living in Manitoba, South Eastern Ontario, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland and Labrador. Data were collected using a written questionnaire (Family Needs Questionnaire, Impact on Family Scale, demographic questions) and a telephone interview (Scales of Independent Behaviour-Revised, service use questions). Log binomial regression was used to examine the association between the child’s functional independence and the parent’s perceived unmet needs. &#xd;
Results. The most commonly reported unmet needs were related to social inclusion for the child, information about special programs and services, and continuity of support. Families of children with high functional independence had lower unmet need compared to families of children with moderate functional independence (RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.67-0.99). Families of children with high functional independence, and who perceived a high level of impact of the child’s disability on the family, had greater unmet need (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.03-1.45). &#xd;
Conclusion. This thesis identifies family needs which have not been met by the service system. Assessments of child and family functioning may provide insight into unmet need that is not revealed simply by knowing a child’s diagnosis on the autism spectrum. Information about the unmet needs of families of children with autism spectrum disorders may help policy makers and service planners to develop resources and services that are responsive to their client group.</description>

   <description>In the past decade, nanomechanical resonators have found use in the work towards understanding mesoscopic quantum systems and the necessary validation of quantum mechanics on this scale. In 2010, the observation and state manipulation of a nanomechanical quantum system was achieved for the first time by O'Connell et al.. In 2002, Knobel and Cleland proposed to use a radio frequency superconducting single-electron transistor (RF-SSET), a fast and sensitive charge amplifier, to sense the quantum-limited motion of a piezoelectrically coupled nanomechanical resonator. The work presented in this thesis is towards the realization of the RF-SSET component of this device. An in-house fabrication recipe for making SETs with tunnel junction areas &lt; 100^2 nm^2 and resistances between 20 kΩ and 150 kΩ was developed, in the end producing six SETs with resistances (36 ± 8) kΩ that were not susceptible to aging effects. Three measurement circuits were designed and used to characterize one of these SETs in the superconducting state (SSET) and operated in the DC and RF modes in a cryostat at a base temperature of 320~mK. Lock-in measurements revealed the SSET junction capacitances as 206 and 305 aF, contributing to a charging energy of (296 ± 11) x 10^(-6) eV. The resonant LC tank, which permitted RF operation, was also characterized at base temperature. The charge sensitivity of the RF-SSET was 6.8 x 10^(-5) e/√Hz (with uncertainty between 9.6 x 10^(-4) e/√Hz and 3.5 x 10^(-5) e/√Hz). With moderate improvements to the impedance matching network formed with the LC tank and greater junction resistances, an RF-SSET charge sensitivity on the order of 10^(-6) e/√Hz, required for sensing the quantum-limited motion of the nanomechanical resonator, should be achieved.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2010-07-17 00:52:41.487</description>
   <description>This dissertation examines the welfare effects of inflation on employment and output in three different market settings. The theoretical frameworks build on recent studies in the monetary search literature that explicitly models the microfoundations of money and study how monetary policy interacts with real variables.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first essay studies the relationship between inflation and unemployment in a general equilibrium framework where inflation has differential effects on employed and unemployed workers. The model finds that inflation can either increase or decrease employment and output, depending on goods and labor market institutions. Sales taxes, the degree of competitiveness in the goods market and imperfect indexation of unemployment insurance benefits are the major factors determining the direction of this relationship. Through a comparison of these parameters, the model predicts an inflation-unemployment relation that is qualitatively consistent with the empirical evidences.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second essay, co-authored with Liang Wang and Randall Wright, investigates the effect of inflation on people's trading behavior in the goods market. By focusing on buyers' search intensity on the extensive margin, the model unambiguously predicts a rise in inflation leads to an increase in the speed with which agents spend their money and velocity. This is consistent with the phenomenon described by the conventional "hot potato" effect of inflation. We also discuss the welfare implications of different monetary policy. In some circumstances inflating above the Friedman rule may be optimal, but the effect of inflation on output is always negative.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third essay, co-authored with Allen Head, Guido Menzio and Randall Wright, examines the effect of monetary growth on output in a general equilibrium model where price stickiness arises as an equilibrium outcome. The model makes several predictions about individual firms' price adjustment behavior that are consistent with micro data. For instance, the frequency (duration) of price changes increases (decreases) with inflation and the price change hazard declines over time. In contrast to the New Keynesian literature, price rigidities in our model does not generate monetary non-neutrality. Higher inflation reduces real output in the long run, but changes in the aggregate price level has no effect on real allocations.</description>

   <description>Industry is heavily dependent on the process of combustion and with a projected rapid increase for the demand of combustion-derived energy it is imperative to expose a new age of engineering professionals to the discipline of combustion engineering.  &#xd;
One purpose of this study was to modify an existing scaled-down industrial furnace and to retrofit it with the ability to interchange burners for academic application and combustion testing.  A number of available industrial burners are presented and their qualities and drawbacks discussed. The modification of an existing scaled-down industrial tunnel furnace is proposed in this work with the objective of providing users with exposure to the control and safe operating strategies associated with industrial combustion.  &#xd;
The furnace system simulates a square-shaped tunnel geometry commonly found in industrial applications.  A single nozzle mix burner is mounted along the furnace axis and operated with supporting equipment such as a burner control safeguard, a gas train, and an air supply.  Details of the furnace are provided in this work.  The concept of radiative heat transfer within a combustion enclosure is demonstrated through furnace simulation with Hottel’s Zone Method.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2010-07-20 13:38:13.996</description>
   <description>Background: Chronic pain is prevalent worldwide and is estimated to range from 2% to 55% in the general population.  There is a limited understanding of the prevalence and incidence of chronic pain in Canada.  Furthermore, our understanding of the sociodemographic predictors of chronic pain is limited; thus we are poorly positioned to identify potential populations at risk. &#xd;
Objectives: The primary objectives for this study included: 1) to determine the prevalence and incidence of chronic pain and pain-related interference in Canada over time and, 2) to determine the influence of sociodemographic predictors on the development of chronic pain by sex in the Canadian adult population over 12 years.  &#xd;
Methods: Using data from the cross-sectional components of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) (1994/95, 1996/97, 1998/99) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (2000/01, 2003, 2005, 2007/08), we examined the prevalence and interference of chronic pain.  The longitudinal component of the NPHS was used to determine the incidence and sociodemographic predictors of chronic pain.  Chronic pain was defined as the presence of “usual pain”.  &#xd;
Results: The prevalence in the cross-sectional samples ranged from 15.1% to 18.9%.  In the longitudinal sample, the incidence ranged from 5.4% to 7.8% and the prevalence ranged from 15.3% to 19.5%.  Women, compared to men, had a higher prevalence, but not incidence of chronic pain each year.  Of those individuals reporting chronic pain, the majority reported at least a few activities prevented.  Women who were older, with lower education, and widowed, separated, or divorced were more likely to develop chronic pain.  There were no sociodemographic risk factors for chronic pain in men.  &#xd;
Conclusion/Implications: This population-based study supports previous research findings indicating that chronic pain affects daily activities of many Canadians.  Furthermore, this is the first population-based prospective study examining the incidence and sociodemographic predictors of chronic pain in Canadians.  Further study with more detailed definitions of pain and pain-related interference is warranted.  Moreover, our findings suggest that older women are more likely to develop chronic pain and that men and women may have different risk factors for chronic pain, suggesting the need for gender-based preventative interventions.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2010-07-21 08:34:58.564</description>
   <description>Observers can retrieve the facing direction of a walker from point-light displays that are devoid of structure-from-motion information and retain solely local motion signals.  This ability is orientation-dependent and relies on the motions representing the feet of the agent.  The experiments described here were designed to investigate visual sensitivity to local cues contained in biological motion.  Initial experiments revealed that local biological motion carries information about animacy in addition to the agent’s facing direction in an orientation-dependent manner (Chapter 2).  The mechanism underlying the perception of local biological motion can be dissociated from that underlying the retrieval of global structure-from-motion information according to characteristics such as sensitivity to learning and noise (Chapter 3).  Further experiments revealed that the orientation-dependency for perceiving local biological motion is carried by vertical acceleration in the foot’s motion (Chapter 4).  The importance of acceleration for biological motion perception raises the need to achieve a better understanding of acceleration sensitivity across various parameters such as stimulus size.  To this end, Chapter 5 showed that acceleration thresholds for perceiving a linearly accelerating stimulus scale according to mean velocity as predicted by size invariance and are inversely proportional to stimulus duration.  An important role for acceleration for the perception of biological motion was further corroborated by findings in an evolutionarily guided psychophysical search for the adequate local motion, defined as one that carries maximal directional information and a large inversion effect (Chapter 6).  Finally, although orientation-dependency is a pervasively demonstrated characteristic of biological motion perception, the reference systems in which the stimuli are encoded are unclear.  The experiments in Chapter 7 revealed that both global structure and local motion aspects of biological motion, like faces, are primarily coded in an egocentric frame of reference.  Unlike faces however, there is an additional contribution of non-visual information about gravity for the perception of biological motion.  These findings are finally discussed in the context of emerging behavioural, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological work that further characterize a local motion mechanism that is proposed to serve as a fundamental first stage towards interpreting animate motion patterns.</description>

   <title>The Desire to Fill: Addiction and British Visual Culture, 1751-1919</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Art History) -- Queen's University, 2010-07-21 13:31:48.788</description>
   <description>In “The Desire to Fill” I examine visual culture, including paintings, graphic art, advertisements and architecture, in relation to the lived experience of addiction.  My study begins in 1751, the year that William Hogarth produced his engravings Gin Lane and Beer Street, and it ends in 1919, the year that Alfred Priest exhibited his painting Cocaine at the Royal Academy’s annual Summer Exhibition.  There are four underlying arguments in this text.  First, that addiction to drugs and alcohol is a manifestation of a desire to “fill a void.”  Second, that addiction has long been thought to be legible from the body.  Third, that addiction cannot be reliably read from the body, whether in life or an image.  Fourth, any project that is concerned with addiction and visual culture is therefore a paradoxical one, and must, by necessity, be a speculative one.&#xd;
	My methodological approach in this text is influenced by feminist theory and queer theory, and I explore the history of addiction using a continuist framework.  In other words, I suggest that, although the identities of the “addict” and “alcoholic” as we know them today were discursively constructed at the end of the nineteenth century, people experienced addiction before these identities came into being.  In that vein, I suggest that the woman in Hogarth’s Gin Lane is an alcoholic, and I show how anxieties about alcoholic mothers have remained remarkably consistent over the last three hundred years.  I also discuss graphic artist George Cruikshank’s experiences as a temperance advocate after he stopped drinking, gin palaces and women’s desire for alcohol, the social and legal ramifications of addiction, and, finally, cocaine and tobacco addiction after the First World War.  Ultimately, I examine the visual culture of addiction in order to destabilize stereotypes and myths about alcoholics and drug addicts that are still circulating today.</description>

   <description>We consider two transceivers equipped with multiple antennas that intend to communicate i.e. both of which transmit and receive data in a TDD fashion. Assuming that the responses of the&#xd;
physical communication channels between these two nodes are linear and reciprocal (time invariant or with very slow time variations), and by exploiting the closed loop conversation between these nodes, we have proposed efficient algorithms allowing to adaptively identify the Best Singular Mode (BSM) of the channel (those algorithms are for training, blind, and semi-blind channel identification). Unlike other proposed algorithms, our proposed adaptive algorithms are robust to noise as the involved step-size allows a trade-off to reduce the impact of the additive noise at the expense of some estimation delay. In practice, however, the reciprocity of the equivalent channels is lost because of the mismatch between the transmit and the receive filters of the communicating nodes. This mismatch causes significant degradation in&#xd;
the performance of the BSM estimation. Therefore, we have also proposed adaptive self-calibrating algorithms (which do not require any additional RF circuitry) that account for such a mismatch. In addition, we have conducted a convergence analysis of the BSM algorithm and extended it to estimate multiple modes simultaneously. Finally, we have also proposed an adaptive, iterative algorithm that is capable of allocating power in such a way that maximizes the capacity of a SISO OFDM communication system.</description>

   <description>The flavin-dependent halogenases are the most prevalent class of halogenase responsible for the regio- and stereoselective incorporation of halogens into natural products.  These enzymes require FAD, O2, NADH, and a flavin reductase to perform catalysis.  The majority of these enzymes are observed to catalyze the halogenation of aromatic substrates.  CmlS is a unique member of the flavin-dependent halogenase family in that it dichlorinates an alkyl group prior to incorporation onto the antibiotic chloramphenicol.  CmlS from the chloramphenicol producing strain Streptomyces venezuelae was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli in high yield. The X-ray crystal structure of CmlS was solved to 2.2 Å resolution, yielding key insights into a potential mechanism of catalysis.  As well, a covalent bond between D277 and the FAD 8α methyl group was discovered. This is a novel post-translational modification that is likely conserved among a large subset of flavin dependent halogenases and raises interesting questions about the catalytic mechanism of flavin dependent halogenation.  Another key enzyme involved in the incorporation of the dichloroacetyl moiety into chloramphenicol is CmlK, an acyl-CoA synthetase.  Only through the tandem action of CmlS and CmlK enzymes will chloramphenicol be formed with its dichloroacetyl group.  A variety of activity assays were performed with CmlS and CmlK with the hope of discovering their substrate specificities.  However, in vitro reconstitution of the activity of CmlS or CmlK was not successful. Future studies are discussed which will hopefully lead to delineating the roles of CmlS and CmlK in the biosynthesis of the dichloroacetyl group, and ultimately a detailed mechanistic description of halogenation by CmlS.</description>

   <description>The uncertainty surrounding the impact of future changes in climate and water resources has created renewed interest on how lakes have responded to drought in the past. There is a need to determine potential future available water by understanding past changes in water levels; the underlying ecological characteristics of using diatoms as a proxy for lake-level reconstructions is the basis of this thesis. By integrating knowledge from past water-level fluctuation studies and theories, along with developing a better understanding of diatom ecology in lake systems, more effective techniques are being developed to improve water-depth reconstructions. Diatom assemblages were examined from eight lakes in northwestern Ontario collected in surface sediments along a depth gradient at ~1-m water-depth intervals. Three major zones, based on the composition of diatom assemblages in each lake were consistently identified in all lakes: i) a near-shore assemblage of Achnanthes (sensu lato) species and other benthic taxa (Nitzschia, Cymbella); ii) a mid-depth small Fragilaria (sensu lato)/ small Aulacoseira zone with various Navicula taxa, and iii) a deep-water planktonic zone. The depths at which transitions between these zones are located varied among lakes, and the depth of the transition between the planktonic and benthic zones was consistent with water chemistry variables (e.g. DOC, TP) that are related to light attenuation. Deeper pelagic to benthic transitions occurred in lakes with the lowest DOC and TP (i.e. generally more light attenuation in lakes with higher concentrations of TP or DOC). Other findings included a decrease in species evenness and numbers with depth, along with an increase in scaled chrysophyte relative to diatoms.</description>
