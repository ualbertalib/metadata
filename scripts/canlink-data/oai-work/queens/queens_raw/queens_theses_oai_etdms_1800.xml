   <description>Purpose: Intravaginal probes used for recording electromyography (EMG) from the pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) likely record activity from nearby muscles (crosstalk), and move during functional tasks, causing motion artifact data contamination, threatening the validity of results obtained. This study investigated the test-retest reliability and validity of surface EMG recordings from the PFMs using a novel, theoretically superior electrode in comparison to a commercially available intravaginal probe, the FemiscanTM. Methods: Healthy subjects (n=20) performed tasks with each vaginal electrode in situ: i) PFM maximal voluntary contractions (MVC), ii) coughs, iii) unilateral hip adductor/external rotator contractions at 25%MVC, 50%MVC, and MVC while keeping the PFMs relaxed or maximally contracted, and iv) transversus abdominis contractions (TrA; recorded using fine-wires) at 25%MVC, 50%MVC, MVC.&#xd;
Analyses: i) Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), ii) t-tests of proportions (α=0.05), iii) repeated measures ANOVAs and Tukey’s post-hoc testing (α=0.05) and iv) cross-correlation functions between peaks of transversus abdominis and PFM activity were used to determine the between-trial and between-day reliability of each vaginal electrode, a difference in prevalence of motion artifact contamination between electrodes, and the presence of crosstalk from the hip and TrA, respectively. &#xd;
Results: Between-trial reliability of both vaginal electrodes was excellent (ICC(3,1)=0.943-0.974). Between-day reliability was less consistent (ICC(3,1)=0.788-0.924 and 0.648-0.715 for the FemiscanTM and novel electrode, respectively). No significant difference in the proportion of files contaminated with motion artifact using each electrode existed. At submaximal intensities of hip muscle contractions, the FemiscanTM recorded significantly higher EMG amplitudes compared to what it recorded when the hip was relaxed, whereas the novel electrode did not, indicating that the FemiscanTM recorded crosstalk from the hip musculature. Low cross-correlation coefficients (&lt;0.90) and large time delays (≥ 0.5 milliseconds) between peaks of PFM and TrA activity indicated that neither vaginal electrode recorded crosstalk from the TrA. &#xd;
Conclusion: The novel electrode is a promising tool to record EMG from the PFMs, as it records less crosstalk from the hip musculature than current technology while maintaining a high degree of reliability when comparing results collected within the same session; however, this electrode should not be used to compare one’s muscle activity between days.</description>

   <description>The anodic polarization of Ni electrode in 0.5 M aqueous KOH solution at various polarization potential (Ep), time (tp) and temperature (T) values leads to the formation of β-Ni(OH)2 films. The growth of the hydroxide layers are irreversible and cannot be reduced electrochemically to metallic Ni. The hydroxide layer becomes thicker at higher values of Ep and/or tp and/or T. The thickness of β-Ni(OH)2 hydroxide were determined using ex–situ XPS and depth–profile techniques. Application of the oxide growth theories to our data indicate that the development of the β-Ni(OH)2 layer follows inverse logarithmic growth kinetics. The driving force of the process is the strong electric field that is established across the oxide layer. The strength of electric field is in the range of 0.015 – 0.197 x 109 V m–1.      &#xd;
The oxidation mechanism of the Ni(II) surface compound to Ni(III) is electrochemically irreversible and the process is treated according to Randles–Sevcik equation. A linear relation was determined between the peak current density (jp) and the square root of the potential scan rate (v1/2) for the entire range of Ep, tp and T. The diffusion coefficient (D) values calculated for anodic and cathodic processes are 8.1 ± 0.2 x 10–12 and 4.3 ± 0.2 x 10–12 cm2 s–1, respectively. The activation energy (Ea) values for the diffusion process are 23 ± 2 kJ mol–1 (anodic) and 26 ± 2 kJ mol–1 (cathodic). The D and Ea values calculated from chronoamperometry measurements are comparable with those calculated from jp vs. v1/2 plots.&#xd;
The electro–reduction of PtO electrochemically pre–formed on Pt electrode in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4 solution was also investigated. A well–controlled reduction conditions (Er, tr and T) were applied to determine the amount of the reduced PtO oxide. The reduction of the PtO requires much less time once ca. 1 monolayer (ML) of the oxide has been removed (ca. 1 ML of PtO remains). As expected, the longer tr and/or lower Er values, the greater the amount of the reduced oxide and consequently the smaller the amount of the remaining PtO oxide.</description>

   <description>Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a widely researched technology that has applications in a broad variety of fields ranging from medical, industrial, automotive and pharmaceutical to even office and home environments. It is composed of a network of self-organizing sensor nodes that operate in complex environments without human intervention for long periods of time. The energy available to these nodes, usually in the form of a battery, is very limited. Consequently, energy saving algorithms that maximize the network lifetime are sought-after. Link adaptation polices can significantly increase the data rate and effectively reduce energy consumption. In this sense, they have been studied for power optimization in WSNs in recent research proposals. &#xd;
	In this thesis, we first examine the Adaptive Modulation (AM) schemes for flat-fading channels, with data rate and transmit power varied to achieve minimum energy consumption. Its variant, Adaptive Modulation with Idle mode (AMI), is also investigated. An Adaptive Sleep with Adaptive Modulation (ASAM) algorithm is then proposed to dynamically adjust the operating durations of both the transmission and sleep stages based on channel conditions in order to minimize energy consumption. Furthermore, adaptive power allocation schemes are developed to improve energy efficiency for multi-hop relay networks. &#xd;
	Experiments indicate that a notable reduction in energy consumption can be achieved by jointly considering the data rate and the transmit power in WSNs. The proposed ASAM algorithm considerably improves node lifetime relative to AM and AMI. Channel conditions play an important role in energy consumption for both AM and ASAM protocols. In addition, the number of modulation stages is also found to substantially affect energy consumption for ASAM. Node lifetime under different profiles of traffic intensity is also investigated. The optimal power control values and optimal power allocation factors are further derived for single-hop networks and multi-hop relay networks, respectively. Results suggest that both policies are more suitable for ASAM than for AM. Finally, the link adaptation techniques are evaluated based on the power levels of commercial IEEE 802.15.4-compliant transceivers, and ASAM consistently outperforms AM and AMI in terms of energy saving, resulting in substantially longer node lifetime.</description>

   <description>The investigation carried out in this project allowed for the development of eleven regioregular π-conjugated alternating copolymers and their implementation in organic solar cells.  The eleven synthesized polymers, poly[(2,7-(9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole))-alt-(4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (CB), poly[(2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl))-alt-(1,6-pyrene)] (LP), poly[(2,7-(9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole))-alt-(5,5’’’-(3,3’’’-dihexyl-2,2':5',2'':5'',2'''-quarterthiophene))] (CT), poly[(2,7-(9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole))-alt-(2,7-9H-fluoren-9-one)] (CF), poly[(2,7-(9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole))-alt-(1,6-pyrene)] (CP), poly[(2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl))-alt-(4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (LB), poly[(2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl))-alt-(2,7-9H-fluoren-9-one)] (LF), poly[(5,5’’’-(3,3’’’-dihexyl-2,2':5',2'':5'',2'''-quarterthiophene))-alt-(2,7-9H- fluoren-9-one)] (TF), poly[(2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl))-alt-(4,4'-dioctyl-2,2'-bithiophene)] (oTLT), poly[(2,7-(9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole))-alt-(4,4'-dioctyl-2,2'-bithiophene)] (oTCT), poly[(2,7-(9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole))-alt-(4,4'-dihexyl-2,2'-bithiophene)] (TCT), were investigated using theoretical methods that included semi-empirical geometry optimizations, density functional theory (DFT) energy calculations, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) optical absorption predictions.  The absorption predictions gave credence to our experimental results in which the absorption of the longer polymer chains underwent a redshift from the monomer absorption.    &#xd;
   With several of the prepared polymers, bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells were fabricated and their photovoltaic activity was investigated. Several of the fabricated cells exhibited photovoltaic efficiencies including polymer/PCBM composites with an aluminum back electrode (CF, CT, P3HT, and MEH-PPV), and also inverted cells with a silver back electrode (CT, P3HT, and MEH-PPV).  Several polymers (CF, CT, TCT, LP, oTCT, oTLT, P3HT, and MEH-PPV) were used to solubilize single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).  The solubility of the nanotubes occurred by the polymers’ ability to wrap the tubes, disrupt the bundles (ropes of tubes), and allow for the creation of a homogeneous mixture.  Polymer:PCBM:SWNT mixtures were prepared and utilized as the active layer in BHJ solar cells.  Some of the inverted cells (with a silver back electrode) that incorporated the nanotube composites (CT, oTCT, oTLT, P3HT, and MEH-PPV) displayed photovoltaic activity.  These preliminary results illuminate the photovoltaic behavior of the polymer and provide evidence for their future use in polymer solar cells.</description>

   <description>Soil remediation requires technologies to restore contaminated soil to a state that is environmentally acceptable.  In most cases, while the soil can be remediated the contaminant itself cannot be reclaimed. Soil washing involves cleaning contaminated soil with a wash solution, generally an aqueous solution of a surfactant.  It was proposed that using switchable surfactants for washing oil-contaminated soil will not only help remove the oil from soil, but also aid in the recovery of the oil contaminant from the wash mixture. &#xd;
	Six surfactants were evaluated for their ability to wash Ottawa Sand artificially contaminated with North Sea crude oil. A water wash solution was used as a control.  Two commercial surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100, and four switchable surfactants, N'-octyl-N,N-dimethylamidine (C8), sodium octyl 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzoate (SAS1), sodium 4-(octyoxy) benzoate (SAS2) and sodium laurate (SAS3) were studied.  The surfactants were assessed based on their ability to remove oil from the sand and their ability to separate the crude oil from the wash mixture after CO2 treatment.  Oil removal from sand was determined by gravimetric analysis.  Oil content in the wash mixture was determined using Solid Phase Extraction and gravimetric analysis.  It was determined that switchable surfactants are able to remove North Sea crude oil from sand as well or better than the commercial surfactants and have the added feature of oil separation and recovery from the wash mixture after CO2 treatment.</description>

   <description>The ideological battle fought between the United States and Cuba has been centrally located in Miami, Florida.  The ninety miles of ocean separating the two nations serves as a type of no-mans land, the hypothetical battlefield separating Cuban-Americans from their homeland and families across the Florida straits.  For decades, the Miami Cuban community was seen as possessing a single identity, one of vehement anti-Castro sentiment and an ever-present desire to return to the homeland of their memories and past.  However, recent literature has suggested that fissures are becoming more apparent in the façade of absolute unity.  &#xd;
	The break in ideological singularity has emerged along generational lines, invoking Karl Mannheim’s pioneering work on the sociological analysis of generations.  This paper attempts to decipher the extent to which a Mannheimian generation is emerging among the youth of the Cuban-American population in Miami Florida.  Using discourse analysis an analysis of print news media conducted on 16 articles from the Miami Herald and 11 articles from the New York Times was undertaken to gain an understanding of the coverage of two major events seen to have an impact on young Cubans in both Miami and Cuba (Juanes’ concert for peace and the Elian Gonzalez case).  This analysis shed light on the extent to which an older generation of Cuban-Americans maintains control of resources.  &#xd;
	As expected, the Miami Herald was far more likely to espouse ideology supportive of the exile ideology.  It became clear that generational ruptures were recognized only when they did not conflict with the traditional rhetoric of anti-Castroism and discourse of regime change in Cuba.  Without this type of space for vocalizing dissent, it is difficult for a counter-movement along generational lines to form.  Overall, this thesis demonstrates that the exile ideology maintains control over what is considered permissible dialogue in traditional media outlets such as the Miami Herald, pointing to the conclusion that not all voices and opinions are recognized within the Cuban-American community in Miami.</description>

   <description>Behavioural choices of animals as they acquire resources in the wild are well characterized by foraging theory; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these behaviours are not well understood.  The goal of this thesis is to understand the brain mechanisms involved in selecting and executing such foraging behaviours. To do so, rhesus monkeys performed a novel visuosaccadic foraging task while we recorded the activity of single neurons in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SCi). An important innovation of this task is that both target profitability – the measure of value in the simplest case of foraging theory – and saccade choice are measured separately. We hypothesized that target profitability is represented in the SCi in addition to its well characterized role in saccade planning and preparation. &#xd;
Visual Foraging Task: Monkeys harvested coloured dots representing prey items by fixating them for a pre-specified handling time. On each trial, multiple prey are presented, sharing identical physical attributes except that each was one of three colours.  All prey of the same colour shared the same profitability [Profitability = reward magnitude (ml)/handling time (s)]. According to foraging theory, intake of reward is maximized if prey are selected in descending order of their profitability. Indeed, we found subjects gradually approached optimal efficiency. We computed an index of the relative subjective profitability of each prey colour, which compared the rank order with which monkeys chose prey of each colour.&#xd;
This subjective index of profitability was then compared to concomitant SC activity attributed to the prey item in the neuron’s response field (RF). First, we found that the amount of SC activity reflected the subjective profitability of the RF targets, and established that this effect was not simply a result of saccade goal planning. Second, profitability information remains dominant throughout the handling period until reward delivery, after which activity also became selective for upcoming saccades. Together, our results highlight the prominent role of target profitability in shaping SCi activity. We propose that profitability information in the SCi may play an important role in resolving competition between numerous target representations to choose the next saccade goal.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I examine how auditors construct their mental representations and test their hypotheses about the strength of a client’s control environment.  With regard to the former, I hypothesize that management’s frame of the control system and auditor’s retrieval of control environment information from memory may influence the auditor’s control environment mental representation and impact subsequent audit judgments.  Consistent with my theoretical predictions, I find that retrieval of control environment information from memory biases an auditor’s mental representation, and that this biased mental representation impacts subsequent fraud assessment.  In addition, there is limited evidence to support the conjecture that auditors may be susceptible to management’s framing of the internal control system resulting in relatively positive control environment evaluations which was found to transfer to some subsequent audit judgments.  With regard to the latter, prior audit literature has examined how auditors evaluate person specific characteristics, such as competence, of other auditors, however there has been no research that has examined how auditors test such characteristics of client management.  I disentangle whether auditors utilize a diagnostic and/or a conservative hypothesis testing strategy when testing client management’s ethicality and competence as these are fundamental components of the client’s control environment.  A diagnostic testing strategy is evidenced by the auditor searching for the most informative information, whereas a conservative testing strategy is evidenced by the auditor searching for risks.  I examine how a checklist decision aid contained in the current institutional context may inhibit auditors’ utilization of a diagnostic testing strategy, and examine how a schematic decision aid is able to enhance diagnostic testing.  The results indicate that auditors utilize both diagnostic and conservative testing strategies when testing client management ethicality; however, the auditor’s testing strategy is only diagnostic when testing client management competence.  In regard to decision aids, I found that when testing client management ethicality and competence, a schematic decision aid was able to increase the auditor’s extent of diagnostic testing.  The checklist decision aid decreased the auditor’s extent of diagnostic testing only when testing client management ethicality, and was not different from unaided judgments when testing client management competence.</description>

   <title>Canada's Other Red Scare: rights, decolonization, and Indigenous political protest in the global sixties</title>

   <description>This dissertation examines the histories of Indigenous protest, commonly known&#xd;
as “Red Power,” in the 1960s and 1970s in the town of Kenora, Ontario. Among the&#xd;
themes discussed are the associations of Indian and Métis activists with Third World&#xd;
national liberation movements, Black Power groups in North America and other&#xd;
Indigenous organizations, such as the American Indian Movement. This study pursues&#xd;
numerous themes, including: racialization, transnational decolonization, Canadian&#xd;
national identity and regional history. While previous studies on the era popularly&#xd;
understood as “the sixties” tend to focus on the particularities of the Canadian context,&#xd;
this dissertation suggests that the changing nature of Indigenous protest during the 1960s&#xd;
and 1970s forms a crucial link between Canada and global forces of social change that&#xd;
defined this era. Moments of Indigenous protest in Kenora, were not just singular&#xd;
episodes. Instead, actions such as the main street march in 1965 and the Anicinabe Park&#xd;
takeover in 1974 episode should be placed within the national and global movement of&#xd;
armed standoffs, occupations, and civil disobedience and understood through the broader social, cultural and political frameworks of decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2011-02-24 20:22:59.526</description>
   <description>This was a qualitative research study involving Aboriginal offenders at a Federal institution in the Ontario Region. The purpose of this study was to illuminate the Aboriginal offenders‘ perspectives on their experiences that led to their incarceration. The major research questions guiding this study include:&#xd;
1. What experiences do Aboriginal offenders feel contributed to their incarceration?&#xd;
2. What do Aboriginal offenders feel could have prevented their incarceration?&#xd;
3. How do Aboriginal offenders describe their experiences with the Residential School and child welfare systems?&#xd;
4. What are the Aboriginal offenders' perspectives on their experiences with CSC‘s healing and intervention programs?&#xd;
One of the goals of this study was to provide information to CSC to improve the reintegration programs and help Aboriginal offenders become law abiding citizens. The data was collected from individual interviews, which was analyzed in detail to develop themes.&#xd;
The analyses sought for stories that captured the depth of the experiences that led to the Aboriginal offenders‘ incarcerations.&#xd;
This study provided the personal perspective of the offenders as to how the Residential School and child welfare system have impacted their lives, and offers some insight into the over-representation of Aboriginal offenders in the prison system. This study also demonstrated how the socio-economic situation of these Aboriginal offenders played a role in their path towards prison. It is important to capture the voices of the&#xd;
iii&#xd;
Aboriginal offenders‘ experiences towards incarceration. Their stories offer ways to help other Aboriginal people.&#xd;
We must have Aboriginal community members involved in the lives of Aboriginal youth to prevent them from getting into trouble, and find alternative positives outlets and activities. We must instill and provide hope and inspiration so that our youth have something to look forward to in their lives. I know this is happening to varying degrees in our Aboriginal communities; however, we need to keep working towards this goal. In addition, CSC might consider allocating more resources and financial assistance to Aboriginal communities, who are dealing with their people involved within the prison system.</description>

   <title>Monologues en France - Du moyen âge à Raymond Devos</title>

   <subject>Monologues</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, French) -- Queen's University, 2011-02-24 12:17:16.349</description>
   <description>The first part of this research is devoted to work of an anthological and descriptive sort, which aims at gathering a corpus of French independent monologues. "Independent monologue" should be understood as a self-sufficient stage performance based on the speaking of a single artist, in opposition to the monologues inserted in a dialogical play. From the Middle Ages to the 1950's, this historical review focuses in particular on the thirteenth century "jongleurs", the burlesque sermons at the junction of the end of the Middles Ages and the early Renaissance, the plays "in monologues" of the eighteenth century, the "monologues fumistes" at the end of the nineteenth century, the poets and cabaret singers of the Belle Époque, Cocteau's monological theatre and two of the first contemporary humorists, Bourvil and Fernand Raynaud.&#xd;
&#xd;
This corpus provides the material for a two-step analysis. First we examine whether the type-differences that certain monologues reveal can be accounted for by objective formal characteristics which then allow us to propose a partition of our corpus. As a result of this questioning, we propose that generic distinctions can be established among the monologues according to the enunciation conditions they develop, that is, whether the speech is directly addressed to the public or not, and whether the enunciator is a character or the artist himself. Next we organize the monological universe according to traits, transversal to the generic partition, with which the monologues present affinities. These traits pertain to scenic modalities, to functions held by the monologuist or to the form of discourse. The analytic tool previously developed is finally brought into play in confronting the work of Raymond Devos, a humorist emblematic of the French scene whose sketches stand out for the remarkable plays on word they display. &#xd;
&#xd;
N. B.: the bibliography aims at offering simplified access to the monologues, in particular by providing the references to internet documents, be they texts that are difficult to obtain or audio and video recordings.</description>

   <description>Cette étude prend pour son objet la figure de la revenante dans le roman québécois contemporain au féminin, laquelle émane d’une tradition de l’effacement du féminin, que ce soit sur le plan social (valorisation du sacrifice maternel et de la transcendance féminine), créatif (empêchement de la participation des femmes à la production littéraire) ou représentatif (mise en scène de la disparition de la femme). Si cet effacement a longtemps servi d’appui à une économie et à une esthétique patriarcales, la revenante attire l’attention sur celles-ci et en provoque la remise en question. &#xd;
La revenante assume deux avatars dans notre corpus : l’apparition de la femme morte (en tant que fantôme, morte-vivante, figure fantasmatique ou onirique), ou le redoublement de celle-ci dans d’autres personnages féminins (c’est-à-dire que la hantée endosse les traits d’un précurseur spectral féminin). Nous nous intéressons aux enjeux de l’appropriation de ce vieux topos patriarcal dans le roman au féminin après 1980, moment où les femmes interviennent de façon régulière sur la scène littéraire. Ainsi, après avoir situé la revenante dans un contexte québécois et occidental, nous en examinons les instances dans les œuvres d’Anne Hébert, de Suzanne Jacob, d’Élise Turcotte et de Ying Chen.&#xd;
Puisque la revenante est une figure déterminante dans l’œuvre d’Anne Hébert, les deux premiers chapitres d’analyse traitent de textes de cette auteure canonique. « Désir et dés/ordre » identifie les lieux et les origines de la hantise féminine et le désordre qu’elle provoque pour mettre en évidence son rapport au désir; « La pro/création » examine la création artistique ou reproductrice comme médium de la spectralité au féminin. Le dernier chapitre, « Violence et vulnérabilité », présente des analyses de romans de Suzanne Jacob, d’Élise Turcotte et de Ying Chen afin d’y souligner la représentation des deux faces de la violence – l’agression et la vulnérabilité – telles qu’elles se chevauchent avec la revenance. Chacune des quatre écrivaines étudiées met en texte des dichotomies hétéronormatives; selon notre lecture, la revenante constituerait un symptôme de ces structures problématiques.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the interactions between ionomer and carbon black in solution as influenced by different ink parameters. The motivation for this work is to collect  necessary data that would lead toward the development of an improved microstructure model of catalyst layer of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Ionomer aggregation behaviour in solution was investigated at different ionomer concentration, solvent type and solvent composition. Ionomer was found to exist in three forms in solution. Extended molecule chains having a hydrodynamic diameter between 20nm to 30nm. Primary aggregates formed by the hydrophobic interaction of fluorocarbon backbone are around 300nm in diameter. Secondary aggregates formed from electrostatic interaction of side chain ion pairs usually having diameter above 1000nm.  Aggregation behaviour of ionomer in different solvents and solvent mixtures at different mixing ratios was also investigated. 1-propanol and 1-propanol/water mixture were found to be the best solvent and solvent mixture among the solvents examined. &#xd;
&#xd;
Carbon black (CB) particle size distribution in solution was measured under different conditions. A maximum 2hr sonication time is suggested for dispersing CB in solution. Size distribution of CB particles increases with concentration. Water content in the co-solvent mixture influences the particle size distribution of CB. It is suggested that water content should be kept under 50wt% to prevent aggregation of CB particles.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ionomer is found to adsorb on platinum/carbon (Pt/CB) surface strongly when mixed. The adsorption process comprises a primary adsorption stage and a secondary adsorption stage. At low ionomer concentration, the primary adsorption was found to follow a Langmuir isotherm with maximum surface coverage around 2.66 x 10-3 g ionomer/m2 Pt/CB. The Pt/CB particle size change due to ionomer adsorption was measured. A maximum size increase around 40nm was found. The size change combined with ionomer molecule geometry estimation implies that only part of the ionomer molecule adsorbed on Pt/CB surface.</description>

   <description>Adaptive distributed systems have the potential to revolutionize how humans and computers interact. They can enable software to adapt to dynamic human demands, as users change their focuses, goals, locations and devices. However, producing these systems is currently very challenging: developers must solve daunting user interface issues while mired in distributed systems problems.&#xd;
&#xd;
We present a new class of toolkit, intended to ease the development of adaptive distributed systems. Unlike existing alternatives, we provide a high-level programming model in which developers can easily specify runtime adaptations. Meanwhile, our toolkit automatically generates a fast and tunable implementation. Partial failures in the distributed system are reflected back into the high-level programming model. As a result, developers can remain insulated in their high-level model while building highly-dynamic, high-performance and failure-resistant applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our Fiia.Net toolkit relies on model transformation at runtime to bridge between the programmer's high-level model and the actual implementation of the distributed system. Our novel model transformation is the first that can practically maintain this transformation, and enables our toolkit to easily support user-driven adaptations, dynamic optimization and self-healing.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-02-28 15:17:31.209</description>
   <description>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) with all-electric range (AER) combine battery driven electric motors with traditional internal combustion engines in order to reduce emissions emitted to the atmosphere, especially during short, repetitive driving cycles such as commuting to work. A PHEV utilizes grid energy to recharge the electrical energy storage device for use in the AER operation. This study focuses on battery systems as the electrical energy storage device and evaluates commercially available technologies for PHEV through scaled hardware-in-loop (HIL) testing. This project has three main goals: determine the state of technology for PHEV batteries through an extensive literature review, characterize commercially available batteries including simulated HIL response to a real-world PHEV simulation model, and finally, develop a tool to aid in choosing battery types for different vehicle styles (a battery decision matrix). The five different battery types tested are as follows: A123 Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) Li-Ion, Genesis Pure Lead-Tin lead acid, generic absorbed glass mat (AGM) valve regulated lead acid (VRLA), SAFT Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) and SAFT Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd). The batteries were characterized in terms of capacity and maximum power as well as tested on an individually scaled real-world duty cycle derived from a model developed by the University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg.&#xd;
&#xd;
 	When comparing the results of the characterization testing with the literature review and manufacturers’ data it was found that there are discrepancies between the batteries tested and the manufacturers’ specifications for mass and capacity. Furthermore, the response to duty cycle testing shows that it is imperative that the internal resistance of the batteries and their conductors should be considered when designing a vehicle, although the literature suggest that this is not commonly done. The results from testing were incorporated into a simple decision matrix factoring in vehicle design constraints, battery performance and cost. Through the duty cycle testing, the dynamic resistance of each of the batteries was determined by measuring the voltage response of the battery to variations in current draw. This resistance figure is important to include in simulations as it effectively reduces available energy the battery can supply due to increasing current demands, as voltage drops in response to a load.</description>

   <description>Evidence for the repeated, independent evolution of hot- and cool-season breeding populations across colonies of the Band-rumped Storm-petrel has garnered much interest from seabird ecologists and evolutionary biologists, alike.  Sympatric seasonal populations have been shown to be each other’s closest relatives, implying that ecological divergence into two seasonal foraging types has taken place several times independently across the species’ range, each time in the absence of geographical barriers to gene flow.  I present data on the molecular genetic characteristics of a unique year-round breeding population in the Cape Verde archipelago.  Using mitochondrial control region sequence and five microsatellite loci, I characterized genetic relationships among 220 birds breeding in four different months (January, April, June and November) and tested for a relationship between temporal isolation and genetic differentiation.  Birds breeding in April, June and November were genetically indistinguishable at microsatellite loci, but control region sequence suggested differentiation between January and other months (pairwise ΦST from 0.19 to 0.46, p≤0.05).  No evidence for genetic isolation by time was found.  A comparison of birds breeding in June and November revealed significant differences in a suite of morphological traits related to foraging strategy (tarsus length, bill length, bill depth, head length, wing length and tail shape), and even significant variation among birds breeding in the same month, despite evidence for gene flow between these groups.  Interpreting these patterns in the context of Band-rumped Storm-petrel populations range-wide, I suggest that divergent selection on standing variation within ancestral populations may be an important mechanism explaining the repeated, independent evolution of conserved seasonal foraging types in this species.</description>

   <subject>Commodity Tax</subject>
   <subject>Corporate Income Tax</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2011-02-28 15:19:49.8</description>
   <description>This dissertation investigates the commodity tax and corporate income tax. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction and Chapter 2 consists of a literature review.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapters 3 and 4 analyze how state governments determine their commodity tax rate and respond to other state and federal government tax rate changes. We construct and estimate the household utility function and the state government objective function, and compute the slope of the reaction functions to evaluate the tax interactions between state governments and between state and federal governments. We find that horizontal tax interactions are very small and that state governments do not change their tax rate even though the neighboring state governments change their tax rates. On the other hand, vertical tax interactions are positive, and if the federal government increases its tax rate, state governments also raise their tax rates to preserve their tax base.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapter 5 discusses how the corporate income tax affects firm location and exit decisions. We compute and compare three kinds of individual firm-level tax rates and examine the effect of these corporate income taxes on firm location and exit behaviour. We find that each tax rate has a different distribution across provinces and that using a different tax provides a different interpretation of tax effects. In most cases, high corporate income tax rates are found to discourage firm location choice and encourage firm exit decisions.</description>

   <description>Groundwater is an important resource that is relied on by approximately half of the world’s population for drinking water supply.  Source water protection efforts rely on an understanding of flow and contaminant transport processes in aquifers.  Bedrock aquifers are considered to be particularly vulnerable to contamination if the overburden cover is thin or inadequate.  The objective of this study is to further the understanding of modeling, sampling, and the potential for anthropogenic contamination in fractured bedrock aquifers.  Two numerical modeling studies were conducted to examine geochemical groundwater sampling using multi-level piezometers and the role of discretization in a discrete fracture radial transport scenario.  Additionally, two field investigations were performed to study the variability of bacterial counts in pumped groundwater samples and the potential for anthropogenic contamination in a bedrock aquifer having variable overburden cover in a semi-urban setting.  Results from the numerical modeling showed that choosing sand pack and screen materials similar in hydraulic conductivity to each other and the fractures intersecting the borehole can significantly reduce the required purge volume.  Spatiotemporal discretization was found to be a crucial component of the numerical modeling of solute transport and verification of the solution domain using an analytical or semi-analytical solution is needed.  Results from the field investigations showed fecal indicator bacterial concentrations typically decrease on the order of one to two orders of magnitude from the onset of pumping.  A multi-sample approach that includes collection at early-time during the purging is recommended when sampling fecal indicator bacteria for the purpose of assessing drinking water quality.  Surface contaminants in areas with thin or inadequate overburden cover can migrate quickly and deeply into the bedrock aquifer via complex fracture networks that act as preferential pathways.  While the presence of fecal indicator bacteria in groundwater samples signifies a possible health risk through human consumption, it was the suite of pharmaceuticals and personal care products that allowed the identification of septic systems and agriculture as the dominant sources of contamination.  Land-use planning and source water protection initiatives need to recognize the sensitivity of fractured bedrock aquifers to contamination.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-03-03 08:36:14.559</description>
   <description>The ability to safely react to dangerous situations, or exploit opportunities within a dynamically changing world is fundamental for our survival. In order to respond to such changes in the environment, sensory information must first be received and processed by the nervous system before an appropriate motor response can be planned and executed. However, relatively little is known about how the central nervous system computes such sensory to motor transformations that are so critical for guiding efficient behavior. This thesis explores some of the neural mechanisms that underlie the visuomotor transformations that guide eye movements. Specifically, this thesis studied saccades (rapid eye movements critical for visual orienting in primates) and examined the relationships between visual and motor signals in the primate Superior Colliculus (SC, a midbrain structure located at the nexus between visual input and motor output that is critical for visual orienting). I recorded extracellular action potentials (spikes) from single neurons related to: 1) the appearance of visual saccade targets; 2) saccade planning and preparation; and 3) the execution of precise saccades that orient to visual targets.  &#xd;
	In this thesis I present four studies that examine the relationships between visual and motor related responses in the SC during visually guided saccades. In chapter 2 I examined the alignment between visual and motor response fields and concluded that they were well aligned. In chapters 3 and 4 I explored how visual responses were modulated by stimulus intensity and how this modulation influenced saccade behavior.  I concluded that luminance modulated multiple properties of the visual response including the timing and maximum discharge rate and these changes were highly correlated to changes in saccade latency and metrics.  In the fifth chapter I applied some of the knowledge gained from the previous chapters to develop a neural network model of the SC that was capable of simulating saccadic sensory to motor transformations and predict saccadic reaction time. I concluded that saccade latency was strongly dependant on the spatial interactions of visual and saccade related signals in the SC. Together, these findings provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying saccadic sensorimotor transformations.</description>

   <description>This work describes the design and development of a velocity map imaging apparatus that will be used to study the laser initiated photochemistry of water ice and other condensed phases. Experiments on methanol ice photolysis using a different apparatus at Kyoto University are described to give an appreciation of the photochemistry and the experimental parameters.&#xd;
Water deposited on a surface at temperatures below 140 K can form an amorphous solid.&#xd;
Amorphous solid water (ASW), which does not exhibit properties of a well-defined phase, is the most profuse phase of water found in astrophysical environments. Chemical characteristics of ASW - in particular its photochemistry - and the physical characteristics closely associated with the structure such as density and surface are reviewed. The correlations between the morphology and the growth conditions of ASW are also described.&#xd;
Methanol is also known to be a component on the icy mantle on interstellar grains. The effects of irradiating amorphous solid methanol by UV photons are discussed.&#xd;
Experiments at Kyoto University have been performed to detect state-selectively nascent OH and CH3 photofragments following photolysis at 157 nm. Information on the velocity distributions was obtained from time-of-flight measurements.&#xd;
At Queen’s University Velocity Map Imaging combined with resonance enhance multiphoton ionization (REMPI) will be used for quantum state-selective detection of the nascent photoproducts and their velocity distribution. To help automate the experiments “virtual instruments” have been created for the hardware components of the experiment using LabVIEW 8.6. The ion optics of the velocity map imaging spectrometer under construction at Queen’s have been characterized using the SIMION 7.0 software package, and the anticipated experimental image of nascent photoproducts has been simulated by a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm.</description>

   <description>Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have been extensively investigated for their applicability in the field of tissue engineering due to their multi-lineage differentiation potential and the convenience of cell acquisition. To date, conventional inductive media have been used to induce lineage-specific differentiation of ASCs; however, this general approach has limitations in terms of high costs and unstable differentiation responses. In native tissues, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) interact with their surrounding cells (i.e. mature cells) through paracrine and autocrine signaling, which can regulate their metabolism and cell function. Therefore, the author developed in vitro co-culture models to study the interactions between ASCs and three different mature cell types: adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts. &#xd;
In this work, bovine ASCs (bASCs) from the interdigital fat pad were first isolated and characterized, in terms of in vitro proliferation and multi-lineage (bone, cartilage, fat) differentiation with conventional inductive media and culture conditions. Doubling time calculations and gene expression analysis of stem cell markers indicated a threshold existed for stem cell degeneration at passage 5 (P5) for bASCs when expanded extensively in vitro. The multi-lineage differentiation potentials were compared between passage 2 (P2) and P5. Interestingly, while the P5 bASCs presented significantly lower levels of adipogenesis and chondrogenesis, osteogenesis was maintained or even improved with serial passaging. &#xd;
In the designed indirect co-culture systems, adipogenesis and chondrogenesis were investigated in growth medium without key differentiation factors, whereas osteogenesis was induced in conventional osteogenic medium, to maintain the stable phenotype of the mature osteoblasts in culture. The results were used to demonstrate the general feasibility of mature cell-induced or -enhanced bASC differentiation through soluble, cell-secreted paracrine signaling. When compared to growth factor (GF)-stimulated differentiation, the bASCs in co-culture presented an earlier, but potentially stronger, level of differentiation. &#xd;
Among these paracrine factors, Wnt proteins are known to play essential roles in mediating stem cell self-regulation and fate determination. In the current thesis, the Wnt inhibitors WIF-1 and DKK-1 were used to explore the involvement of the Wnt canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways in the designed co-culture environments. The data showed a strong correlation with the literature, indicating the canonical pathway was upregulated during osteogenesis, but inhibited during adipogenesis. The inhibition of chondrogenesis through the canonical pathway was suggested on a genetic level.</description>

   <description>Hydrochloric acid leaching of saprolite nickel ores has been proposed as an effective means of recovering nickel and cobalt. However, the leach produces a concentrated brine of magnesium chloride which must be hydrolyzed to recover the HCl lixiviant. The processing of carnallite similarly produces a concentrated MgCl2 brine; converting this brine into HCl and MgO provides an attractive way of adding value while effectively disposing of this waste product.&#xd;
Direct pyrohydrolysis of magnesium chloride brines by the reaction,&#xd;
MgCl2,a + H2Oa  MgOs + 2HClg&#xd;
is energy-intensive as large volumes of water must be evaporated. The energy cost is high, and the HCl stream produced is limited to approximately 20 wt% HCl. This thesis explores alternative methods of obtaining HCl from aqueous magnesium chloride solutions. Two methods are considered: the hydrolysis, under autogenous pressure, of concentrated MgCl2 molten salt hydrates; and the precipitation of magnesium hydroxychloride compounds such as 2MgO·MgCl2·6H2O and 3MgO·MgCl2·11H2O, which are subsequently decomposed at high temperature.&#xd;
Considerable experimental difficulties were encountered in studying pressure hydrolysis of molten salt hydrates, despite extensive equipment modifications. Ultimately, the work moved on to precipitation and decomposition of hydroxychlorides. This was found to bear promise, and conceptual flowsheets based on these reactions are presented. A phase stability diagram giving the areas of predominance of the different hydroxychloride phases is presented, and fundamental thermochemical data are derived. The results of a kinetic study on magnesium hydroxychloride thermal decomposition are also presented.</description>

   <description>There is currently a great interest in the field of porous organosilica materials because of the high surface areas (> 1000 m²/g) and narrow pore size distributions which are beneficial for applications such as chromatography, chiral catalysis, sensing or selective  adsorption. Periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) represent an interesting class of hybrid silica materials because of the wide variety of bridging organic groups which can be incorporated within the precursors [(OR)3Si-R-Si(OR)3] giving rise to materials with exceptional properties.&#xd;
We have synthesized and characterized various aromatic PMOs composed of supporting structural monomers (phenylene- or biphenylenebridged) and functional stilbene monomers (cis and trans) (1, 2). The effect of the different synthetic procedures and varying amounts of functional stilbene monomer on the properties of the materials was examined. The functional transstilbene component was determined to be well distributed in a phenylene-bridged PMO using P123 as a pore template from TEM techniques with Os staining. The trans-stilbene linkers were completely transformed to aryl aldehydes through ozonolysis with dimethylsulfide workup. Further transformation of the carbonyl functionality to an aryl imine showed a moderate level of success.&#xd;
Enantiomeric forms of a novel, chiral PMO precursor (CM) were synthesized and incorporated into biphenylene-bridged PMOs. Under basic pH conditions templated with C18TMACl, although very low levels of CM are incorporated, enantiomeric forms of chiral, porous materials are obtained as was verified by distinct mirror-image circular dichroism spectra. Powder XRD patterns suggest that a tightly packed asymmetric biphenylene arrangement may be necessary for the optical activity. Preliminary results using these materials as a chiral chromatographic phase are promising.&#xd;
Finally, a thin film morphology of an ethane-bridged PMO incorporating a thiol ligand, (3- mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, was prepared on a fibre optic cable and used as a component in a heavy-metal sensing application.</description>

   <description>Within the city of Kingston, ON, the Princess, Concession, and Bath (PBC) intersection is a high traffic intersection and an important node for both local residents and daily commuters. Prior to the 1970’s, the intersection was the site of Kingston’s largest traffic circle. However, the traffic circle was removed in order to increase the traffic capacity of the intersection.  This report provides an analysis of the design and use of the current intersection and recommends the installation of a modern roundabout. Figure A illustrates the design of the existing intersection and the maximum diameter of a potential roundabout. Figure B illustrates the proposed design.</description>

   <description>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a de facto standard for data exchange in the World Wide Web. Indexing plays a key role in improving the execution of XML queries over that data. In this thesis we discuss the three main categories of indexes proposed in the literature to handle the XML semistructured data model, and identify limitations and open problems related to these indexing schemes. Based on our findings, we propose two novel XML index structures to overcome most of these limitations: a native index structure called Level-based Tree Index for XML databases (LTIX) and a relational index structure called Universal Index Structure for XML data (UISX). &#xd;
A proper labeling scheme is an essential part of a well-built XML index structure. We found that existing labeling schemes are not suitable for our index structures and therefore propose a novel labeling scheme, Level-based Labeling Scheme (LLS), which has the advantages of most popular types of labeling schemes while eliminating the main disadvantages. We then combine our LLS labeling scheme with our index structures. An evaluation shows that LLS performs well in comparison to existing labeling schemes using different mappings to relational tables.&#xd;
We propose the LTIX to minimize the number of joins and matches required to evaluate twig queries, and also to facilitate effective query optimization through early pruning of the space search. Our experimental results show that this approach performs well in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches.&#xd;
We propose the UISX to overcome the key problem with the state-of-the-art approaches, namely that they cannot support efficient processing of twig queries without requiring significant storage. We use a light-weight native XML engine on top of an SQL engine to perform the optimization related to the structure of the XML data prior to shredding. Experimental results show that our approach achieves lower response times than other similar approaches while using less space to store XML data.</description>

   <description>Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a common medical issue among human adults, leading to back pain and potentially, disability, decreasing an individual’s quality of life. In the United States alone, huge economic impacts are apparent with an estimated $50- 100 billion attributed to lost productivity and medical costs related to DDD. Spinal degeneration occurs in the intervertebral disc (IVD) and once damaged, the IVD is incapable of adequate self-repair. A regenerative therapy incorporating nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue engineering may provide an answer to spinal degeneration. The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the potential of a thiol-modified hyaluronan (TMHA) and elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) as a hydrogel scaffold for nucleus pulposus tissue engineering. Two materials, one composed of TMHA only and one a 3:1 TMHA/ELP, crosslinked with polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), were seeded with cultured human NP cells and cyclic hydrostatic loading was applied at 1MPa for 3 hours a day for 3 consecutive days. Cell viability and gene expression were analyzed. A decreasing trend in cell viability with time and cyclic hydrostatic pressure loading was observed and statistically significant differences were observed between the TMHA unloaded treatment group at day 0 and the TMHA loaded treatment group at day 4 and between the TMHA unloaded treatment group at day 0 and the 3:1 TMHA/ELP loaded group at day 4. Comparisons between TMHA only and 3:1 TMHA/ELP hydrogels for the same treatment indicate similar trends and no statistically significant differences in biological effects were observed. Gene expression analysis indicated low frequency expression of NP&#xd;
extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules regardless of time point or cyclic hydrostatic pressure application. These results are revealing in that the 3:1 TMHA/ELP hydrogel did not support NP cells significantly better than the TMHA hydrogel, though cell source and hydrostatic pressure generation issues may have impacted this finding. Additional studies with alternative cell type and a refined hydrostatic pressure application method may better illuminate the efficacy of a 3:1 TMHA/ELP hydrogel as for NP tissue engineering.</description>

   <description>This study was conducted to improve our understanding of the biological impacts of competitive angling events on fish. More specifically, this study examines the impacts of transporting Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in the livewells of bassboats on large water bodies. Fish were transported in an experimental livewell that recorded the amount of water turbulence experienced by the fish held in the tank, in Force (0.84ft2/lb/sec). A video recording of the transportation process was also taken to determine the amount of interactions between the fish and the walls of the livewell. It was determined that as water activity increased, so did the mean number of impacts per minute. In addition, as the number of impacts increased, so did the concentration of plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Levels of plasma LDH and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were compared between fish that were transported in a padded livewell and fish that were transported in an unpadded livewell. Fish that were transported in an unpadded livewell showed significantly higher levels of both LDH and CPK (P &lt; 0.05). Fish that were transported in the padded livewell did not show significantly higher levels of LDH or CPK than the control groups. This indicates that transportation of Smallmouth bass in livewells causes cellular damage and that this damage can be mitigated by simple modifications to the interior of the livewell.</description>

   <description>The physical response of composite landfill liners, consisting of a high-density polyethylene geomembrane overlying a compacted clay liner, was examined with an emphasis on quantifying the magnitude and possible implications of sustained tensile strains that may develop in the geomembrane from gravel particles either present on top of or underneath the geomembrane. This involved development of new experimental apparatus to study the effects of time, temperature and chemical action on geomembrane strains. A method based on the concept of time-temperature superposition was developed to predict long-term lower temperature geomembrane strains from short-term higher temperature data. It was found that the short-term response is dominated by loading strains while in the long-term, creep is more significant. The predictions from this method suggest that the protection provided by a nonwoven needle-punched geotextile is not sufficient to limit long-term tensile strains, but a geocomposite may be able to limit geomembrane strains below proposed allowable limits, depending on the applied pressure and landfill temperature. Experiments were also conducted with the new apparatus to examine the implications of sustained tensile strains. It was found that sustained tensile strains resulted in brittle rupture of a notched geomembrane, despite stress relaxation for a geomembrane under a single gravel particle and constant vertical force. The time to rupture depended upon the maximum applied force as well as the stress crack resistance of the geomembrane. This represents the first compelling evidence that long-term geomembrane strains from gravel indentations should be limited. However, even when using an excellent protection layer from overlying gravel particles, gravel particles in the underlying compacted clay liner were identified as another possible source of tension in the geomembrane that for very large landfills may exceed tensile strains limits. For such cases, compacting the top most layer of the clay liner at the lower bound of its acceptable water content combined with careful site inspection such that visible gravel particles are removed from the clay surface will minimize the tensile stains that may develop.</description>

   <description>The growing global awareness of sexual violence as a weapon of war has been accompanied by the strategic and pervasive inclusion of women’s personal stories of war rape. This representational strategy of Western media, academia and humanitarian policies was critically examined in order to understand how war raped women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are discursively situated as “Other.” Drawing on the theoretical concepts of abjection and objection, the study did not question the truth of women’s experience but rather examined whether the pervasive inclusion of war rape stories constituted a true feminine subjectivity. A foucaldian notion of discourse provided a method to expose meaning and dominant discourses, which make certain identities and stories of war rape more visible than others. The purpose of this study was to critically engage with dominant Western discourses of war rape and provide a more complex understanding of how diverse power structures, identities and representational practices impact the struggle of Congolese women to open self-determined pathways of empowerment. &#xd;
A qualitative method of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was used to examine the textual and visual processes of representation. Samples of text were taken from three main areas: media coverage (print, television, web based magazines, and films), feminist academic literature (journals, reports and books), and humanitarian policies (UN mission reports, Security Council resolution, mandates and reports). &#xd;
The results revealed that war rape victims, the DRC and acts of war rape were all positioned as “Other” and as a media spectacle that was further consumed by Western audiences. It was also found that certain war rape identities and social factors remained invisible, including the West’s complacency in the DRC conflict. Ultimately, the study finds a tension between discourse as a tool of liberation and a tool of power and control. This thesis recommends that anti rape activists must examine their own dominance over war rape victims and consider new strategies—beyond the simple act of storytelling—that will position rape victims as the subjects (not objects) of their own struggle to end war rape.</description>

   <description>Asymmetric information has crucial implications for various market participants in financial markets, including investors (local and foreign), firms, and governments. The information asymmetry problem is especially severe in emerging markets. My dissertation attempts to address a few information-related questions that interest both academicians and practitioners. The first study adds some new evidence to the on-going debate of whether local or foreign investors are better informed. I offer a new perspective to the issue by examining two market segments within one country but separated by the relevance of local knowledge measured by state ownership. I find that state ownership has a dramatic asymmetric effect on local and foreign institutional investors in China’s stock market. Local (foreign) institutional investors have an informational advantage in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while foreign institutional investors have an informational advantage in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). Moreover, the informational advantage of local institutional investors is less evident in SOEs with high board independence and better audit quality. Building on these results, the second study further uses local and foreign institutional ownership as a measure of private information and examines whether firm-specific return volatility proxies for price informativeness. I find firm-specific return volatility is positively related to private information. Therefore the results support the notion that firm-specific return volatility measures the rate of private information impounded into stock prices. My research contributes to the literature in at least four important ways. My findings reconcile the two opposing views on local and foreign investors in the literature and suggest that the informational advantages of local and foreign investors vary with the relevance of local knowledge. Examining only the whole market in past research masks important variation in the relative advantages of local and foreign investors in market segments within a country. My study also suggests that taking into account firm-level characteristics, especially corporate governance measures, can enhance our understanding of the behavior of institutional investors. Additionally I provide some of the first evidence to show that local political institutions can create barriers faced by international investors. Finally, my research confirms the merit of firm-specific return volatility as a measure of price informativeness. Together, these studies provide new insights into research on asymmetric information in emerging markets and have important implications for local and foreign investors, firms, and governments.</description>

   <title>A Culture of Learning in One Non-Profit Organization</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2011-03-27 09:20:58.606</description>
   <description>The purpose of my research is to describe and analyze the facets of the learning culture in one non-profit organization. Based on my reading, I define a learning culture as: the observable and unobservable processes, structures, norms, and communication patterns that support ongoing, work-related, learning for employees.&#xd;
I relied on Schein’s (1985, 1992, 2004) levels of culture theory to guide my study. Schein posits that culture must be explored at three levels: “artifacts” (observable symbols and structures), “espoused beliefs and values” (the articulated ideologies of the organization), and “underlying assumptions” (the unconscious beliefs that are shared amongst members of a group). Accordingly, I selected a three-phase qualitative approach to provide a rich description of one organization’s learning culture. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and document analysis, I investigated the firm’s learning culture. I targeted two groups: organizational representatives and employees. I further divided my employee group into two subgroups: administrators (management) and frontline employees (those who provide direct care for clients), in order to glean a broad perspective of the learning culture and how different groups perceive that culture.&#xd;
My research allowed me to describe the organization’s culture of learning. I uncovered a mismatch, however, between the organization’s espoused values regarding work-related learning and the employees’ perspectives on their learning. The organization articulates that it actively promotes and encourages learning for its employees; yet, the employees perceive their learning to be supported, but not readily encouraged. I tentatively conclude that perspectives on learning seem to be a function of employee role. This study offers some insight into the challenges of investigating an organization’s culture, both theoretically and methodologically.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2011-03-30 21:40:25.831</description>
   <description>This thesis discusses the mathematics of the Element Independent Corotational (EICR) Method and the more general Unified Small-Strain Corotational Formulation. The former was developed by Rankin, Brogan and Nour-Omid [106]. The latter, created by Felippa and Haugen [49], provides a theoretical frame work for the EICR and similar methods and its own enhanced methods. &#xd;
   The EICR and similar corotational methods analyse non-linear deformation of a body by its discretization into finite elements, each with an orthogonal frame rotating (and translating) with the element. Such methods are well suited to deformations where non-linearity arises from rigid body deformation but local strains are small (1-4%) and so suited to linear analysis. This thesis focuses on such small-strain, non-linear deformations. &#xd;
   The key concept in small-strain corotational methods is the separation of deformation into its rigid body and elastic components. The elastic component then can be analyzed linearly. Assuming rigid translation is removed first, this separation can be viewed as a polar decomposition (F = vR) of the deformation gradient (F) into a rigid rotation (R) followed by a small, approximately linear, stretch (v). This stretch usually causes shear as well as pure stretch.  &#xd;
   Using linear algebra, Chapter 3 explains the EICR Method and Unified Small-Strain Corotational Formulation initially without, and then with, the projector operator, reflecting their historical development. Projectors are orthogonal projections which simplify the isolation of elastic deformation and improve element strain invariance to rigid body deformation. &#xd;
   Turning to Lie theory, Chapter 4 summarizes and applies relevant Lie theory to explore rigid and elastic deformation, finite element methods in general, and the EICR Method in particular. Rigid body deformation from a Lie perspective is well represented in the literature which is summarized. A less developed but emerging area in differential geometry (notably, Marsden/Hughes [82]), elastic deformation is discussed thoroughly followed by various Lie aspects of finite element analysis. Finally, the EICR Method is explored using Lie theory. Given the available research, complexity of the area, and level of this thesis, this exploration is less developed than the earlier linear algebraic discussion, but offers a useful alternative perspective on corotational methods.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2011-03-31 16:17:57.86</description>
   <description>In recent decades, many softwater lakes on the boreal shield have experienced significant reductions in aqueous calcium (Ca) concentrations. These declines are a long-term consequence of acid deposition due to the depletion of base cations from watershed soils. There is concern that in some lakes [Ca] may be falling to levels detrimental to the competitiveness of Ca-rich organisms.&#xd;
By examining the crustacean zooplankton remains preserved in lake sediments, this thesis provides field evidence of reduced [Ca] impacting a Ca-sensitive crustacean zooplankton species (Daphnia pulex). Additionally, a 770 lake data set compiled from several Ontario monitoring programs revealed that 62 % (an increase from 35% in the early 1980s) of the lakes were near or below the laboratory-determined Ca threshold (1.5 mg•L-1) for the growth and survival of D. pulex.&#xd;
To determine whether the 1.5 mg•L-1 Ca threshold could be observed in a spatial survey of crustacean zooplankton sedimentary remains, surface sediments from 36 softwater (Ca range 1-3 mg•L-1) Ontario lakes were analyzed. Significant differences in daphniid abundances across the Ca threshold were present; however, only for the D. longispina species complex, indicating differences in Ca tolerances within daphniid species complexes. Extending the analysis to a comparison of modern-day vs. preindustrial assemblages revealed that in the same 36 lakes there have been large declines (by up to 30%) in daphniid relative abundances since preindustrial times coincident with increases in Ca-poor species (i.e. Holopedium gibberum) irrespective of modern day pH. These findings demonstrate that in natural settings, the competitive disadvantages of Ca limitation may occur at a higher [Ca] than previously suspected.&#xd;
Finally, zooplankton sedimentary remains were analyzed from several “pristine” lakes in northwestern Ontario that have also experienced Ca declines in recent years. Reduced abundances of Ca-sensitive taxa and increases in Ca-insensitive fauna provided further evidence of the impacts of Ca decline independent of acid deposition. Collectively these analyses demonstrate the potential importance of Ca as an environmental stressor in softwater regions, as well as the need for further research in order to make better use of the available information preserved in the sediment record.</description>

   <description>Background: Life expectancy (LE) estimation is an important part of both screening and treatment decision-making for potentially curable prostate cancer. Clinicians’ estimation of patient life expectancy is typically made using population-based life tables and intuition and it is often inaccurate. This study explores methods to improve LE prediction by formally considering patient co-morbid illness status, in addition to age, in the development of a LE prediction tool. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients from the Ontario Cancer Registry who were curative treatment candidates, identified between 1990-1998. We analyzed data on three sub-populations of this cohort, and we used LE estimates from the Ontario Life Tables. Each model utilized Cox proportional hazards analysis, and/or the declining exponential approximation of LE, to estimate the survival experience of potential curative treatment candidates, including the impact due to both age and co-morbid illness status. We developed five separate models, tested them using a random subset of the cohort study sample, and compared their predictive accuracy by measuring both discriminative ability and calibration to determine the ‘best’ model. We also conducted a supplementary analysis using logistic regression to develop a model to predict the probability of 10-year survival.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: The ‘best’ of our models demonstrated a c-index of 0.65 and very good calibration. Further analysis revealed that our ‘best’ model violated the Cox PH assumption for age and it’s predictions consistently over-estimated observed LE. Supplementary analysis of the logistic regression prediction model demonstrated a c-index of 0.70. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Our exploration of methods to predict LE resulted in modest predictive accuracy. However, based on the results of the logistic regression model, we conclude that the results of our LE prediction models are reasonable, and obtaining a high level of predictive accuracy may not be possible given just age and co-morbidities as predictors.  Further studies should continue to explore these and other methods for LE prediction. External validation of the ‘best’ model from the current study is required before the model and its accompanying LE reference tables can be recommended for use in a clinical setting for screening or treatment decision-making.</description>

   <description>Objective:  To determine the effects of head position and of different postural control demands on head tremor measures in participants with essential tremor.  &#xd;
Methods:  Seventeen participants with essential tremor (ET) of the head and 17 control participants took part.  Individuals held their heads in varying degrees of rotation, flexion, and extension.  Subsequently, individuals sat and stood in different postures, incorporating different foot placements (feet apart and together), surfaces (solid and foam), and vision conditions (eyes open and closed).  Neck muscle activity was recorded from three muscles bilaterally (trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis).  Three-dimensional head and thorax positions were recorded using an Optotrak system, and head angular velocity with respect to thorax was calculated by differentiating tilt-twist angles.  Fourier analysis was used to determine tremor power.&#xd;
Results:  ET participants showed sharp peaks at their tremor frequency in spectral plots of kinematic data, whereas CN participants did not.  Electromyography data was too noisy for frequency analysis.  ET participants displayed increased tremor power in head positions 25° from neutral compared to neutral and positions 50° from neutral.  Tremor power increased with increasing difficulty of posture for both participant groups.  Removal of vision resulted in decreased tremor power in ET participants; power was significantly decreased in the easier postures, and progressively less so with increasing difficulty of posture.  Interestingly, tremor direction was inconsistent in both groups, and two ET participants displayed multiple tremor peaks. &#xd;
Conclusions:   The tilt-twist method is a feasible way of measuring head kinematics.  Changing stiffness of the neck likely mediates the effect of head position on head tremor power, with the resultant interplay of the central driver and the mechanical resonance driving the amplitude changes.  Decreasing stability of posture increases head tremor, likely due to the associated increase in postural sway and stress on the postural control system.  Vision appears to exacerbate head tremor through the addition of tremor-related visual noise and an implicit task to stabilize vision; this is possible evidence of a visuomotor deficit.  However, stabilizing vision becomes less important with increasing difficulty of posture, resulting in a narrowing gap in tremor power between vision and no vision conditions.</description>

   <description>An alternating current electroosmotic micro pumping device has been designed, experimentally tested and theoretically analyzed using an electrohydrodynamic theoretical model applied to a computer simulation model.  The device SP-1 is a microelectrode array which uses the principal of AC electroosmosis (EO), ions driven along microelectrode surfaces by coulomb forces produced by tangential electric fields. These ions, when driven, induce a net fluid motion due to viscous drag forces. Three submerged microelectrode wires were deposited on a substrate using microfabrication techniques such that a square spiral geometry was formed. Device SP-1 received asymmetrically applied AC signals creating a travelling wave of potential and resulted in a net fluid flow across the microelectrode array. Microsphere tracer particles were suspended in ethanol to measure the fluid velocity to determine pumping performance and the experimental operating frequency at which maximum fluid velocity is achieved. The experimental results were reviewed and at an AC signal frequency of 125 Hz, device SP-1 was capable of pumping ethanol at a fluid velocity of approximately 270 μm/s. The experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions produced using the computer simulation model. In addition, the computer simulation model predicted a similar flow profile to those previously predicted and experimentally observed. Overall, novel micropumping device SP-1 was found to produce a net flow comparable to previously tested devices and a computer simulation framework capable of analyzing future micropump design concepts was developed.</description>

   <description>In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, tyrosine dephosphorylation of p34cdc2 is required for mitotic initiation and this reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle.  The kinases wee1+, mik1+ and the phosphatases cdc25+, pyp3+ play opposite roles in the regulation of p34cdc2 activity.  In cells lacking wee1, tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2 is carried out by Mik1; in cells lacking cdc25+, the activity of the Pyp3 phosphatase is responsible for tyrosine dephosphorylation of p34cdc2 at the G2/M phase transition.  Pyp3 was first identified as a high copy number plasmid suppressor of a temperature sensitive cdc25-22 mutation.   Loss of pyp3+ function causes only a minor delay in the onset of mitosis in wild type cells, but is lethal in wee1- cdc25- double mutants suggesting an essential function in this genetic background.   However, it is not clear whether Pyp3 plays a direct minor role in dephosphorylating Cdc2 when Cdc25 is fully functional.  &#xd;
     In order to examine the function and regulation of Pyp3, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate S. pombe cDNA clones encoding proteins that interact with Pyp3.  One of the positive interacting proteins is tif1.  eIF4E (Tif1) is the mRNA cap-binding protein and essential for recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA.  Our results show that Pyp3 physically interacts with eIF4E in vivo and affects both the phosphorylation state and cellular distribution of eIF4E.  In addition, over-expression of eIF4E causes delay of cell cycle G2/M transition and an elongated cell size phenotype at division in S. pombe.  Importantly, over-expression of the Pyp3 tyrosine phosphatase counteracts the cell cycle inhibition induced by over-expression of wild type eIF4E, and this depends on the conserved eIF4E binding site on Pyp3.  In addition, Pyp3 also interacts with the 14-3-3 proteins in vivo.  Collectively, these data provide novel insights into Pyp3 function and eIF4E regulation, and suggest Pyp3 might have additional important roles in the coordination of cell growth with cell cycle control in fission yeast.</description>

   <description>Parasites may express proteins that mimic host proteins such that the host immune system cannot discriminate between host and parasite. An immune response to host proteins results in autoimmunity, and therefore, mechanisms to avert autoimmunity also limit the capacity of the immune system to respond to parasites that are mimics. In failing to elicit an immune response, parasites that are mimics appear to have a selective advantage and so it is unclear why all parasites do not evolve to be mimics.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, I demonstrate that next-generation methods can be used to perform an evolutionary invasion analysis. Subsequently, I use this method to identify evolutionarily stable strategies and to investigate three hypotheses for why all parasites are not mimics. These are: (1) that mimicry increases the risk of inducing autoimmunity and that hosts with autoimmunity are less likely to transmit the parasite; (2) that proteins which mimic host proteins have a reduced ability to perform the vital functions necessary for parasite replication; and (3) that owing to a feedback between the types of parasites that infect a host and the host's immune response, when parasites are likely to re-infect the same hosts, mimics are more likely to elicit an immune response.&#xd;
&#xd;
I show that each of these hypotheses explain why all parasites are not mimics. The key data needed to assess the applicability of these results is to quantify the number of secondary infections generated by hosts infected with parasites that are molecular mimics. This thesis motivates a new question in evolutionary epidemiology, furthers the field of evolutionary medicine and contributes novel methodologies for host-parasite multi-scale modelling in mathematical biology.</description>

   <description>Feminist engagement with criminology began several decades ago when feminist academics, scholars and activists brought attention towards the failure of criminology to focus on women. As a result there have been several efforts by feminist criminologists to make sense of women and girls who come into contact with the criminal justice system. Literature and research conducted within this area — beginning nearly forty years ago — provides the framework and analysis for this current thesis. This particular research analyzes the experiences of female inmates and the conditions within prisons for women. In particular, this research will examine whether the promises set out within Creating Choices (1990) and the Arbour Report (1996) have been fulfilled and whether there is evidence that the Correctional Service of Canada has reformed its practices and policies in the recommended ways.  Through examining specific case studies — deaths, suicides, major and minor disturbances — that have occurred within federal female prisons since the release of Creating Choices, it will be possible to determine whether the Correctional Service of Canada has followed the key recommendations advanced by both reports.</description>

   <description>Successful preservation of Earth’s biodiversity requires an understanding of the processes that generate new species.  The generation of species without gene exchange is considered predominant; however, a growing body of evidence indicates that populations can diverge while exchanging genes, and that this may be common.  Previous research hypothesized that blue-footed (Sula nebouxii) and Peruvian (S. variegata) boobies diverged from their common ancestor while exchanging genes.  Here, I combine ecological and genetic perspectives to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis.&#xd;
Using a panel of eight molecular markers, I estimate population differentiation for each species.  I find evidence of weak population differentiation for both species, an uncommon pattern in seabirds, and argue that specialization to an unpredictable food resource has shaped contemporary population differentiation.  Next, I use molecular markers and morphology to evaluate the hybrid status of five morphologically aberrant individuals.  I report that all are likely F1 (first generation) hybrids, and are the product of crosses between female Peruvian boobies and male blue-footed boobies.  Sex biases in pairing may occur because of an underlying preference for elaborate courtship displays.&#xd;
I then expand the dataset to 19 loci and use cline theory and Bayesian assignment tests to characterize the hybrid zone, to examine introgression, and to evaluate the hybrid status of the aberrant individuals.  The hybrid zone is most likely maintained by strong endogenous and exogenous selection against hybrids and dispersal of parentals into the hybrid zone (a tension zone), and introgression is low for nuclear loci and absent for mitochondrial loci.&#xd;
Finally, I test the hypothesis that this species pair diverged from their common ancestor with gene flow using recently developed analyses and multiple loci.  Divergence without gene flow is rejected and unidirectional introgression of sex-linked loci during divergence is reported.  The results of this study support the hypotheses that: 1) populations can diverge while exchanging genes; 2) the Z chromosome may play a role in avian speciation; and 3) organisms specialized to variable foraging environments should exhibit low population differentiation.  This study adds to our understanding of both population differentiation and speciation in seabirds, and the generation of new species more generally.</description>

   <description>This is an exploratory study, using quantitative and qualitative tools, studying younger adult students (aged 18 to 25) at a college in Ontario and proposes that younger adult notions of possible selves are strengthened through engaging with models for possible selves by conducting informational interviews with them. Research was conducted in the classroom and outside of the classroom (but on campus) using a methodological framework informed by the scholarship of teaching and learning. Anticipated outcomes include a further understanding of the researcher’s own practice in order to improve it, a further grounding of the researcher’s personal theory of practice, and useful data for other researchers interested in using possible selves as a lens to understand their teaching. The results of the study indicate that there are other issues and concerns related to notions of possible selves, including goal-setting and a sense of having choice and control over one’s fate. Implications for practice include recommendations that more opportunities and tools for the development of possible selves be offered to students and that these opportunities can be found in existing courses and programs.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the synthesis and design of two novel dual-mode&#xd;
microwave waveguide filter structures. The mode degeneracy is fundamental to this&#xd;
design technique. The first design introduces a structurally symmetric dual-mode cavity&#xd;
pseudo-elliptic band-pass filter, which has been implemented by only asymmetric&#xd;
structures so far. It is also used to shed light on the concepts of positive and negative&#xd;
coupling in dual-mode filters. A novel iris coupling structure is investigated allowing&#xd;
negative coupling coefficients required for certain polarizations of modes in dual- mode&#xd;
rectangular cavities. A 4th order dual-mode band-pass filter is designed at 11 GHz with a&#xd;
bandwidth of 200 MHz, an in-band return loss of 20dB and two transmission zeros at&#xd;
normalized frequencies of ±1.6. The filter makes use of the negative coupling property of&#xd;
the iris for inter-resonance coupling of the modes of horizontal orientation inside the&#xd;
cavity. The desired performance of the filter was achieved by the initial design without&#xd;
any optimization.&#xd;
The second design is especially convenient when temperature compensation is of&#xd;
prime concern. A direct design technique is developed and demonstrated with computer&#xd;
simulation and measurement in circular waveguide technology on a 4th order filter with a&#xd;
bandwidth of 50 MHz at 11 GHz, an in-band return loss of 20 dB and two normalized&#xd;
transmission zeros at ±1.5.</description>

   <title>An Evaluation of Ontario’s Green Energy and Green Economy Act of 2009: Exploring the Role of Indicators in Community Energy Planning</title>

   <description>With increasing public concern over environmental degradation and Climate Change, community energy planning is now emerging as a new task for planners. Community energy planning are practices that foster energy sustainability, protect or restore the natural environment, avoid harm in relation to social and health indicators, result in a more equitable distribution of benefits, are economic to maintain over the long-term, and do not impede the emergence of other sustainable approaches at the local level (FCM, 2009; Neves and Leal, 2010). More specifically, planning how a community generates, receives, utilizes and conserves energy can greatly contribute to the goal of stabilizing green house gas (GHG) emissions, reducing air pollution, diversifying energy resources and fostering a secure, accessible and stable energy supply that supports the local municipal economy.    &#xd;
&#xd;
As the role of energy planning is closely tied with supportive provincial Legislation, this research study aimed at analyzing the effectiveness of Ontario’s Green Energy and Green Economy Act (GEGEA) to local municipal planners. The overall goal of this Legislation is to foster the growth of renewable energy projects, promote energy conservation and energy efficiency while strengthening Ontario’s economy. This Act also has significant implications for municipalities across the Province, as it amends the Planning Act and removes barriers to the development of renewable energy undertakings in the overall planning process.</description>

   <description>This project weaves personal narrative with gardening and the thinking of philosopher Martin Heidegger, and although it takes place in a vegetable garden its purpose is larger. I begin as a feminist believing that new ways of speaking, acting and thinking from within the dominant paradigm of the West reflect diversity of experience and invite discussion. Guided by the thinking of feminist philosopher Adriana Cavarero (2000), I use personal narrative as an expression of relational experience. Like Cavarero I believe we are continually shaped by environment, and narrative tells not only of our own experiences but those of others with whom we come in contact. Because the narrative in this project is shaped by my relationship with an abandoned garden, it allows me to illustrate and explore some key concepts of philosopher Martin Heidegger through the work of feminist scholars.&#xd;
Heidegger‟s corpus questions what it means to be human in the world, and is founded on the premise that we relate to the world through care and as feminist thinker, narrator and gardener, care calls to me from within his thinking. My stories come from where I am, a neglected garden and farm north of Kingston Ontario. It is a good place to begin because it is a local example of a much greater neglect. Recognizing that we are in an era of global climate change brought on by a thinking which arose in the West, this&#xd;
&#xd;
project invites us to consider: how might our world look if we recognized nature not as a reified “thing” and in turn, how might this alter our political choices?</description>

   <description>A report submitted to the School of Urban and Regional Planning in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Urban and Regional Planning</description>
   <description>This report aims to bridge the gap between the sociopolitical landscape and the physical landscape of every day urban life. The urban landscape, particularly the urban waterfront, is a contested site where different forces – the political, the social, and the physical - come together to produce change. Processes like public participation highlight the power and potential for cities to develop under principles that are not predetermined, despite the clout of neoliberal dominance and normalcy. Through the effective management and realization that there are a variety of interactions, movements and ideologies that influence urban form and everyday urban life, the dynamic nature of a city is revealed. This report is a critique towards the ‘monolithic city’.&#xd;
The Bedford Waterfront Development (BWD), located in Bedford, Nova Scotia, Canada, is used as a case study in order to support this critique. Specifically, this case study asks the following: given the neoliberal paradigm of the Bedford Waterfront Development, what challenges, limitations, and constraints – and even opportunities – exist for the public in the planning decision making process? By critically evaluating the BWD’s public consultation process this report addresses the different ways in which the Bedford community’s voice was heard under a neoliberal waterfront planning framework.</description>

   <title>Talking Scot: English Perceptions of the Scots During the Regal Union</title>

   <subject>English, Scots, Britain, Familiar Alterity, Discourse, Perceptions</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, History) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-13 14:40:43.595</description>
   <description>From 1603 until 1707, England and Scotland were joined by what scholars have described as the regal union. A dynastic accident that came into being when James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne as well, it forced the two kingdoms to share a single monarch without creating a unified legal system, religious hierarchy, political structure or British culture. This dissertation re-evaluates the resultant Anglo-Scottish relationship by examining what English people actually said about the Scots and Scotland during moments when this union was strained. Specifically, it explores discourses about the Scots that circulated immediately after the regal union, and those which appeared during the Bishops’ Wars (1638-40), the Cromwellian Union (1651-59), the Popish Plot and Exclusion Crisis (1679-81), and the parliamentary union of 1707 that renegotiated the terms of engagement. By doing so, it challenges widespread assumptions that an uncomplicated xenophobia dominated English approaches to the Scots, and illuminates the existence of a more nuanced Anglo-Scottish dynamic that still informs British politics today.&#xd;
	The Scots were too similar to be Other, and too different to be wholly Same – their “familiar alterity” creating difficulties for the English. At the start of the regal union, the notion of what constituted a Scot was malleable and utilitarian, which encouraged the English to reject their partnership in the creation of a new British kingdom. During periods of outright Scottish assertiveness, however, the English were forced to remember their northern neighbours. At each of these moments, the Scots variously became beggars, locusts, radicals, worthy partners in empire, protestant deliverers and even role models, before the English were able to write them out of the equation again. Finally, in 1707, a parliamentary union mandated that within official discourse, the Scots were to be interpreted as familiars and as equals, in an attempt to cement their position and thus solidify the Anglo-Scottish relationship. In many ways, this meant nothing more than a divergence between official and popular discourses, but it did permanently intertwine English and Scottish development, no matter how intense divisive pressures became.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Law) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-13 15:56:25.285</description>
   <description>The failure of the civil society to generate and communicate commonly shared (consensual) environmental values and the incapability of the other social systems- environmental law and the environmental protection agencies- to assess and respond accordingly creates disequilibrium in mutual expectations. The communication gap among them promotes non-compliant behaviour, ultimately making enforcement of environmental law for the most part impossible in developing countries like Pakistan. Disrespect for law and lack of confidence in public institutions stems from problems in social fabric. It is often the result of a societal failure not the weakness of government institutions. In these circumstances, the legislative process not informed of existing social realities and the administrative process ignorant of the social stress face miserable failure. The enforcement agencies alone are incapable of achieving compliance and the law as a tool of the public policy is unable to bring change in social attitudes for a better environment. The onus is mainly on social institutions to generate positive social values which are later communicated with other individuals/groups/systems in the environment. For a better and healthy environment, the government agencies have to think beyond regulation and facilitate greater participation and positive mutual interaction among non-state actors.</description>

   <description>With the development of computing technology, the demand for next-generation voltage regulators (VRs) to power the modern microprocessors is rising. The next-generation VRs should be more compact and perform with faster dynamic response under increasingly large load transients. &#xd;
Charge balance control concept has been introduced to achieve much lower output voltage deviations and shorter settling time than linear mode controllers. However, the existing implementations of charge balance controllers are too complicated to be widely used in practical VR applications. Therefore, to improve the transient response of a VR in a practical manner, five novel ideas are presented in this thesis.</description>

   <description>Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) aims to increase productivity of software development by raising the level of abstraction beyond code concepts and using domain concepts. By providing a generative model-driven tooling component and runtime support, the Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) aims to simplify the creation of diagram editors for specific domains based on a series of model creation and transformation steps. GMF leverages the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) to allow the graphical modeling of Domain Specific Languages (DSL). &#xd;
A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is developed specifically for a specific task and specific domain. In this research, the State Machine Compiler (SMC) represents the specific domain for which a DSL in a form of a diagram editor is developed using GMF. SMC is an open source Java tool allowing generation of state pattern classes from textual descriptions of state machines.&#xd;
The main objective of this research is to describe the use of GMF, highlight potential pitfalls and identify strengths and weaknesses of GMF based on certain criteria. To be able to feed the SMC diagrams created with the editor into SMC, a Java Emitter Templates (JET) transformation is used to transform SMC model instances into textual format expected by SMC.</description>

   <description>Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) protect organisms from freezing damage at subzero temperatures. They do this by adsorbing to the surface of nascent ice crystals to block further ice growth. The key property of AFPs is to be soluble in liquid water but bind irreversibly to water in the solid state. Hypotheses for the mechanism by which AFPs recognize and bind ice have gone through several radical revisions without a consensus emerging. The remarkable diversity of independently evolved AFP structures, the multiple ice planes bound by AFPs, and uncertainty about the location of the ice-binding site(s) have all added to the difficulty of deducing a unified mechanism of AFP action. The central thesis of my research is that the characterization of additional AFPs will elucidate rather than obfuscate the mechanism of action. &#xd;
To this end I have advanced knowledge about three hyperactive AFPs. A reliable protocol to express and purify a sufficient quantity of type I hyperactive AFP was developed for further characterization studies. Initial crystallization trials using the recombinant material have produced consistent crystals for diffraction and resolution. A model of the recently discovered snow flea AFP was generated via de novo methods. The folding scheme is polyproline type II helices stacked into anti-parallel sheets, which was to our knowledge previously unobserved in monomeric proteins. The model was subsequently confirmed to be within 1 Å accuracy by X-ray crystallography performed by another group. I have also screened several insects for antifreeze activity. By using mass-spectrometry sequencing and a cDNA library, novel AFPs (3 kDa and 8kDa) were discovered from overwintering inchworms. The translated proteins were subsequently de novo modelled. &#xd;
After a thorough analysis of the literature, I reason that conflicting results from various AFP studies can be resolved. The hydrogen-bond ice-binding hypothesis was re-introduced to work coherently with elements of the hydrophobic ice-binding theory. We have proposed a unifying mechanism termed “anchored clathrate water,” which is supported by the water bonding on ice-binding surfaces reported both in in silico and in NMR studies. The new data I have obtained have further reinforced and expanded the hypothesis.</description>

   <subject>Affordability</subject>
   <description>The study found that sharing a 2 bedroom unit with 1 roommate was generally a more affordable option than living in a bachelor or 1 bedroom unit alone. Inner sub-areas and the central sub-area were found to be less affordable than the outer sub-areas in regards to rent. Finally, only the highest income young adult singles (those in the 4th quartile group) were able to afford most types of units in most sub-areas. The overall findings of the study were that young adult singles did not have high enough incomes to afford most types of purpose-built rental housing.</description>
   <description>A report submitted to the School of Urban and Regional Planning in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Urban and Regional Planning</description>
   <description>This study examined the affordability of purpose-built rental housing for young adult singles (ages 18 to 29) in the Greater Vancouver CMA. The aim of the report was to determine the affordability of different types of rental units (bachelor, 1 bedroom, and 2 bedroom), as well as units within different sub-areas of the Greater Vancouver CMA, and affordability of units for young adult singles in different income quartiles. This was completed using two methodologies. Both methods utilized an 'ability to afford' approach. The first method calculated the rent to income ratio that young adult singles in different income quartiles would have to have spent in order to afford 'average rent' units of different types in different sub-areas. The second method calculated the percentage of young adult singles who could have afforded to rent different types of units in different sub-areas. Both methods used income data from the 2006 Canadian census and rent data from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's 2006 rental market report for the Greater Vancouver CMA.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we investigate whether firms’ relationships with non-financial stakeholders affect their financing policies. We find that the firms that place a higher value on reputation for treating employees generously maintain lower debt ratios. Furthermore, we find that the firms whose business relies on major customer-supplier relationships adopt more flexible payout policies because of relationship-specific investments. Finally, we find that the high financial distress costs rather than the hold-up problem associated with relationship-specific investments affect firms’ financing policies. Overall, our results suggest that firms’ relationships with non-financial stakeholders are important determinants of their financing policies.</description>

   <title>The Synthesis of Succinic Acid and its Extraction From Fermentation Broth Using a Two-Phase Partitioning Bioreactor</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-18 08:07:51.379</description>
   <description>Succinic Acid (SA) is an intermediate in the production of fine and commodity chemicals. No commercial SA bioproduction process exists due to process limitations including end product inhibition and high product separation costs, which account for 70% of total production costs. Two-Phase Partitioning Bioreactors (TPPBs) can increase volumetric productivity through in-situ product removal, although SA uptake by polymers requires a pH below the pKA2 of SA (4.2).&#xd;
Sparging CO2 gas into the bioreactor was proposed to temporarily lower the pH of the medium, allowing for SA uptake. At 1atm CO2 sparging lowered the pH of Reverse Osmosis (RO) water to 3.8 but only to 4.75 in medium, requiring the use of H2SO4 and KOH for pH adjustment in subsequent experiments. Polymers were screened for SA uptake and the effect of pH on uptake from 2.2 to 6.2 was also studied. Only Hytrel® 8206 showed non-zero uptake with a partition coefficient for SA of 1.3. Cell cultures of Actinobacillus succinogenes was exposed to pH 4.2 for times from 5 minutes to 4 hours to determine whether cells could grow after low pH exposure. A. succinogenes resumed growth after up to 4 hours of low pH exposure, giving a sufficient time span for SA uptake in the bioreactor. A single-phase run was operated as a benchmark for comparison to the TPPB system which removed SA from the fermentation broth by pH cycling; lowering the pH to 3.8 for uptake, then increasing it to 6.7 to continue bioproduction. Uptake from fermentation broth took 60 minutes, within the time causing no effect on cell growth from low pH exposure. The two-phase run yielded 1.39g/L•h, unchanged compared to the single-phase run which gave 39g/L of SA after 28 hours. Though pH cycling reduced the concentration of SA through polymer uptake, the salts added for pH adjustment hindered further cell growth. The TPPB system demonstrated that SA can be efficiently removed from solution without complex separation methods. Future work will use pressurized vessels to increase the solubility of CO2 and lower the pH of fermentation broth for SA uptake without the need for strong acids.</description>

   <description>A key step in malignant progression is the acquired ability of tumour cells to escape immune-mediated lysis. A potential mechanism by which tumour cells avoid immune destruction involves the shedding of MHC Class I Chain-Related Protein A (MICA), a Natural Killer (NK) cell-activating ligand, from the tumour cell membrane. Hypoxia has been shown to cause increased MICA shedding; however, this hypoxia-induced effect can be attenuated by pharmacological activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent nitric oxide (NO)-signalling pathway in cancer cells. The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether treatment of tumour-bearing nude mice with the NO-mimetic glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) attenuates in vivo tumour growth and if so, whether this effect is dependent on the presence of an intact NK cell compartment. Results indicated that continuous transdermal administration of GTN (1.8 µg/h) can significantly attenuate the growth of transplanted human DU-145 prostate tumours but that this effect of GTN is lost in mice whose NK-cells have been depleted. Tumours and serum from the mice in this study were analysed to determine whether GTN treatment had any effect on the expression levels of proteins integral to the proposed MICA shedding mechanism; however, the results of these studies were inconclusive. As phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition represents a potential method to enhance NO-signalling, experiments were performed to determine whether treatment with the PDE5/6 inhibitor zaprinast could also attenuate hypoxia-induced MICA shedding and decrease in vivo growth of DU-145 tumours. Results demonstrated that treatment with zaprinast (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuates MICA shedding in DU-145 cancer cells and significantly decreases in vivo tumour growth. Taken together, the results of these experiments indicate that GTN attenuates tumour growth by sensitising tumour cells to innate immunity, likely by increasing membrane-associated tumour cell MICA levels through the reactivation of NO-signalling, and that zaprinast decreases tumour growth likely through a similar mechanism. These findings are important because they indicate that agents capable of reactivating NO-signalling, such as NO-mimetics and PDE inhibitors, can potentially be used as immunosensitisers in the treatment and/or prevention of cancer.</description>

   <description>Polypropylene (PP) and ethylene-co-octene copolymer (EOC) blends were prepared at various component ratios and reinforced with silica nanoparticles (SiO2). Strategies to improve filler dispersion involved the grafting of a silane coupling agent on the PP matrix, the addition of a maleated PP (PP-g-MA) as a compatibilizer and the use of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles. These approaches resulted in a fine dispersion of the nanoparticles within the PP phase and induced a reduction of the size of the EOC domains, due to a barrier effect. Tensile and flexural properties were significantly increased, whereas ductility and impact properties were not affected. These enhancements are attributed to the favourable microstructure of the blends, featuring a segregated microstructure, and to the improved interfacial adhesion between the functionalized polymer matrix and the surface of the nanoparticles.&#xd;
The microstructure and rheology of model melt compounded EOC-based nanocomposites were investigated. Functionalization of the polyolefin matrix was accomplished through silane grafting, or addition of a maleated EOC (EOC-g-MA) compatibilizer. Various grades of unmodified SiO2 having different specific surface areas (SSA), as well as a surface-modified grade were added to the EOC matrix at various loadings. The formation of covalent and hydrogen bonds between the silanol groups and the functionalized polymer generated strong polymer/filler (P/F) interactions, resulting in improved filler dispersion. Bound polymer characterization revealed that in the compatibilized materials, the amount of polymer physically attached to the nanoparticles was higher than in the non-compatibilized samples. &#xd;
In the absence of a compatibilizer, larger SiO2 aggregates formed upon increasing SSA because of increased probability of hydrogen bonding between the particles. The increased propensity for aggregation was revealed by time sweeps as well as by the increased strain sensitivity in stress sweeps. On the contrary, the compatibilized composites exhibited a stable response and a higher critical strain for the onset of non-linearity, indicative of stronger adhesion between the fillers and the matrix.&#xd;
Superposition of oscillatory and creep/recovery experiments revealed that the viscoelastic properties in the terminal region were influenced substantially by the state of dispersion of the nanoparticles. In the absence of a compatibilizer, substantial enhancements in the linear viscoelastic (LVE) functions were noted and an increasing SSA resulted in more significant deviations from terminal flow. On the contrary, the SSA of the particles had no effect on the viscoelastic and mechanical properties of the compatibilized composites.</description>

   <description>The calibration and use of seven hole pressure probes for hot flow measurement was studied extensively, and guidelines were developed for the calibration and use of these probes.  The influence of tip shape, Reynolds number, calibration grid density, and curve fit were studied and reported.  Calibration was done using the well established polynomial curve fit method of Gallington.  An improvement to this method was proposed that improved the uniformity and magnitude of measurement error.&#xd;
A hemispherical tip was found to be less sensitive to manufacturing defects, and less sensitive to changes in tip Reynolds number than a conical tip.&#xd;
The response of the probes was found to be Reynolds number independent over a tip Reynolds number of 6000 for the entire calibrated range.  For flows with an angle of attack less than approximately 20°, the response of the probe was found to be independent above Re = 3000.&#xd;
A minimum calibration grid density of 5° was recommended.  Error in the measurement of high angle flows was found to increase significantly when the calibration grid was sparser than this.&#xd;
The response of the probe was found to contain features that were not properly represented by third order polynomial terms, and it was found that it was necessary to include fourth order terms in the polynomial curve fit.&#xd;
The uniformity of calibration error was found to improve significantly when the high angle sectors were calibrated using a small number of additional points from adjacent sectors.  The calibration data sorting algorithm was modified to include a calibration point in a given sector if that sector’s port read the highest pressure, or if that port read within a specified tolerance (“overlap pressure”) of the highest pressure.  An overlap pressure of 15-20% of the calibration flow dynamic pressure was found to decrease the maximum calibration errors by 10-15%.</description>

   <description>Background: Coinfections with multiple types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are a common occurrence among HPV-infected individuals, but the clinical significance and etiology of these infections remain unclear. Though current evidence suggests that women with coinfections have increased HPV exposure (i.e. more sexual partners), it is also hypothesized that these women may represent a subgroup with increased HPV susceptibility, though this has been rarely studied to date. &#xd;
&#xd;
Purpose: The purpose of this project was to examine the occurrence, determinants and dynamics of HPV coinfections in a cohort of university students in order to explore the relationship(s) between coinfections, lifestyle factors and immunological susceptibility.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: This project is based on a secondary analysis of data from the McGill-Concordia Cohort, a longitudinal study of the natural history of HPV infection in 621 female university students in Montreal, Quebec. Participants were followed for 2 years at 6-month intervals. At each visit, cervical specimens were collected for cytology and HPV testing, and women completed a questionnaire about lifestyle and risk behaviours. Two definitions of coinfections were used: cumulative coinfection over follow-up and concurrent coinfection at each visit. Kaplan-Meier techniques were used to estimate incidence and duration of coinfections and multiple logistic regression was used to identify determinants of coinfections and associations between coinfections and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL).&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: More than half of the cohort became infected with HPV and of those, over 60% acquired multiple HPV types over follow-up. Incidence of coinfections was significantly increased among HPV-infected women at enrollment. The most important determinant of coinfection occurrence was number of sexual partners (both lifetime and new), though some genes of the immune response (HLA-DQB1*06:02, HLA-G*01:01:03 and HLA-G*01:01:05) were also significant predictors. Women with coinfections, particularly those with 4+ HPV types, also had longer infection durations and greatly increased odds of SIL. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Women with coinfections acquire new HPV types at an increased rate and have greater HPV persistence and occurrence of SIL, which may indicate immunological susceptibility. HPV coinfections mainly occur due to increased sexual activity but a decreased immune response to the virus may also be involved in a subset of women.</description>

   <subject>Housing and Human Service</subject>
   <subject>Homeless Youth</subject>
   <description>Youth homelessness is experienced by youth between ages of 16-24, where they are either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. These youth typically lack social structures, stability, and sense of security in their lives. They also face many issues such as drugs, violence, sexually transmitted diseases, and early pregnancy. In the past decade, youth homelessness has become an increasingly important issue in Canada. Many organizations such as Covenant House in Toronto and Crisis House in Calgary are designed specifically to help homeless youth in finding shelter spaces. However, in smaller cities such as Kingston, there is a lack of reports on the conditions of homeless youth. The aim of this master’s report is to fill the gaps and provide a research base for future studies. The report provides a detailed literature review on the subject of youth homelessness, and an analysis of how agencies have met the needs of homeless youth in Kingston based on interviews with youth and agencies to identify gaps in services. The agencies interviewed include Kingston Youth Shelter (KYS), Kingston Youth Employment Services, and Passage House.</description>

   <title>Changes in Sensorimotor Performance After Stroke and as a Function of Normal Aging</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-21 15:16:11.342</description>
   <description>Stroke is a leading cause of disability in Canada. To maximize a patient's chance of&#xd;
returning to their pre-stroke state, rehabilitation programs must be tailored to their specific brain impairments. Unfortunately, assessment of post-stroke impairments is largely based on the perceptual decisions of a clinician. To ensure inter-rater&#xd;
reliability, many current assessment tools use coarse, ordinal scales resulting in &#xd;
floor and ceiling effects.&#xd;
   The purpose of this thesis was to use robotic technology coupled with a visually&#xd;
guided reaching task to develop a reliable and sensitive tool for assessing upper limb&#xd;
motor function after stroke. Robotic devices have contributed greatly to our under-&#xd;
standing of motor function because of their ability to objectively, repeatedly, and&#xd;
reliably measure behavior. Visually guided reaching is an ideal task for assessing up-&#xd;
per limb motor function because it requires a broad range of sensorimotor functions&#xd;
as well as healthy functioning of a diverse neural network.&#xd;
   Control and stroke subjects performed an unassisted visually guided reaching task&#xd;
with each arm using the KINARM robot. Sensorimotor functions were assessed using&#xd;
a broad range of parameters derived from the kinematics of movement.&#xd;
   In our first study we examined the reaching performance of subjects with subacute stroke and reliably found impairments in both their affected and unaffected arms. We also found performance asymmetries between the affected and unaffected arms that were present even when both arms demonstrated normal reaching behaviour independently.&#xd;
   In our second study we examined changes in reaching performance that occur over&#xd;
the  first six months following stroke. We found that with time reaching performance&#xd;
improved with both arms, but performance asymmetries persisted throughout the  first six months after stroke.&#xd;
  In our  final study we examined reaching performance of healthy adults between&#xd;
the ages of 20 and 84 years of age. We found linear declines with age across most of&#xd;
our movement parameters, but interlimb asymmetries to be stable across adulthood.&#xd;
To generate age-specific performance curves descriptive statistics were tabulated for&#xd;
each parameter.&#xd;
   The results of this thesis demonstrate that a visually guided reaching task can&#xd;
provide reliable and sensitive information about a subject's sensorimotor impairments&#xd;
following stroke.</description>

   <description>This mixed methods study examined assistive technology and its role in the world early writers. It investigated the function of word predictive and  speech synthesis software in the early primary, mainstream classroom. A technology based writing intervention with 27 first grade students was carried out to assess how the use of Co:writer software affected the content of student writing. It looked at how the length of the writing sample, word use and sentence complexity was affected by this writing intervention. It also investigated how students interacted with the software and how they felt about its effect on their writing. The hypothesis was that the use of assistive technology while writing would aid students in creating more sophisticated, content rich writing samples and give students a positive feeling about their writing. Using a pre-post design, participant writing samples were analyzed for length, word use and sentence complexity. Targeted interviews and field notes revealed how students interacted with the software and how they felt about its effect on their writing. The data shows that within this study participants improved the length, and sentence complexity in their written samples.&#xd;
Qualitatively participants reported that the software helped to improve their vocabulary, length of writing sample, spelling, reading and editing. This study lays groundwork for more research into the use of assistive writing technology in early mainstream participants.</description>

   <title>The Toxicity of Hydroxylated Alkyl-Phenanthrenes to Embryonic Fish</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-24 12:15:43.323</description>
   <description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are common aquatic contaminants found at industrially contaminated sites. Alkylated PAH have been identified as a component of oil that is chronically toxic to the early life stages of fish. These compounds are important target analytes in Natural Resource Damage Assessment following oil spills, and often the focus of remedial activities. However, the mechanisms of PAH and alkyl-PAH toxicity are not well understood.&#xd;
The enzymatic metabolism of alkyl-PAH generates ring (OH-ring) and chain hydroxylated (OH-chain) derivatives, and has been associated with the increased prevalence of toxicity in early life stages (ELS) of fish. The role of PAH metabolism in toxicity remains unclear, and may involve the byproducts of metabolism such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive intermediates, metabolites themselves, or a combination thereof. Using 1-methylphenanthrene (1MP) as a model alkyl-PAH, this research describes the relative toxicity of a suite of hydroxylated alkyl-PAH to the early life stages of fish, proposing an association between the formation of para-quinones and enhanced toxicity.  &#xd;
The results of this thesis demonstrate: (1) hydroxylated derivatives of 1MP differ in toxicity from their non-hydroxylated counterpart; (2) ring hydroxylated 1MP derivatives are more toxic than both chain-hydroxylated derivatives and 1MP itself; (3) the location of ring-hydroxylation can affect toxicity and (4) the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) is a poor predictor of toxicity for hydroxylated APs derivatives.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-24 13:30:35.306</description>
   <description>Rationale: Due to the uniqueness of the conflict and post-conflict experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina and limited primary source research, it is unclear to what extent persons with physical disability participate in rehabilitation and other community services. It is uncertain whether persons with physical disability have access to available community programs and services and what role policy, environmental and attitudinal barriers play in community integration and social participation. &#xd;
Objective: The purpose of this study was to understand and describe factors that influence community integration and social participation of persons with a physical disability in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina. &#xd;
Methods: A concurrent embedded mixed methods design was used. Three face to face interviews were conducted and thirteen participants completed written questionnaires adapted from The “KIPA” Clear Direction Strategic Framework: Knowledge-Inclusion-Participation-Access (Edmonds, 2003). Participants had physical disabilities and were recruited through Mojmilo Health Clinic, Centar Za Fizikalnu Theraiji I Rehabilitaciju Community Based Rehabilitation centre and the Clinical Centre University Hospital in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. &#xd;
Results: The study identified  challenges and barriers encountered when accessing rehabilitation, primary health care, education and other community services and programs. The data suggested that persons with a physical disability perceived that factors associated with knowledge, inclusion, participation, and access are very important to their quality of life. Government policy reform and assistance, employment opportunities, attitudes and awareness, and community understanding emerged as critical factors of acceptance and integration. &#xd;
Conclusions: The study revealed that a complex array of factors influenced the integration of persons living with a physical disability in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Persons with disability indicated the need for individuals and disability groups to collectively advocate for all PWDs in order to voice their goals for integration and social participation. Knowledge, inclusion, participation, and access to health care, education, livelihood, attitude, social participation and advocacy emerged as intrinsic to the successful community integration of persons living with a physical disability.</description>

   <description>4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is a potent pulmonary carcinogen found in unburned tobacco and tobacco smoke.  To exert its carcinogenic effect, NNK is metabolically activated to reactive intermediates that can damage DNA by alkylation or pyridyloxobutylation.  NNK also has the ability to induce DNA oxidation and alter DNA repair activities that can result in deficient repair and potentially exacerbate carcinogenesis.  Base excision repair (BER) is a ubiquitous DNA repair system that mainly repairs oxidative DNA damage.  The goal of this study was to determine the effect of NNK on DNA oxidation status and BER activity in A/J mouse lung and liver.  Female mice were treated with 10 µmol of NNK i.p. and lung and liver were isolated 1, 2 and 24 hours post administration.  DNA was isolated from lung and liver, and the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, a biomarker of DNA oxidation) was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.  At 1, 2 and 24 hours in both murine lung and liver, there was no statistically significant difference in 8-OHdG levels (n = 4, P > 0.05) between control and NNK-treated mice.  To assess BER, cell-free whole tissue nuclear protein extracts from liver and lung were prepared and incubated with a plasmid substrate containing oxidative DNA damage.  In vivo treatment with NNK did not alter BER activity in lung or liver compared to control mice (n=3 or 4, P > 0.05).  These experiments indicate that acute treatment with a tumourigenic dose of NNK does not significantly stimulate oxidative DNA damage or significantly alter BER activity in murine lung and liver.</description>

   <description>The bio-renewable monomer γ-methyl-α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone (MeMBL) has been thoroughly investigated in this thesis. MeMBL is a relatively unstudied monomer that had received little attention since the early 1980’s but has become a subject of renewed interest since a process to produce it from biomass derivatives was developed in 2004. The principle interest with this monomer aside from the “green” potential associated with bio-renewables results from its structure being cyclically analogous to methyl methacrylate (MMA) as well as improved solvent resistance and a high (215oC+) glass transition temperature (Tg) compared to most petroleum sourced acrylics.  &#xd;
There are three major areas of focus in this work, examining polymerization kinetics, synthesis and polymer characterization. The polymerization kinetics of MeMBL were investigated with a variety of petroleum sourced monomers. MeMBL is in all cases preferentially incorporated into copolymers, presenting challenges for composition control. Preliminary investigations of aqueous phase polymerizations of MeMBL were problematic and led to investigations of organic phase polymerizations. The dispersion polymerization method was used to produce copolymers of MeMBL and MMA; during the study we obtained new insight into the mechanisms of particle nucleation and growth. With the acquired knowledge of MeMBL polymerization kinetics, the dispersion technique was used to produce MeMBL/MMA copolymers of controlled composition by semibatch for characterization studies.  The addition of MeMBL raises polymer Tg and lowers molecular weight, but due to unexpected difficulties in processing MeMBL copolymers, mechanical properties could not be investigated in this study. Future work may need to revisit other polymerization techniques in order to produce processable polymers to test whether or not MeMBL might be a suitable alternative to petroleum sourced monomers that is capable of extending the range and utility of acrylics.</description>

   <description>A report submitted to the School of Urban and Regional Planning in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Urban and Regional Planning</description>
   <description>This report offers a comparison of the planning for two professional football stadia in Canada. The development of a new stadium has long-term consequences on a city’s land use pattern and economic activity. Although professional sporting venues rarely create positive direct economic impacts, urban planners can play a large role in locating such a facility to inspire civic pride, instil a sense of community and create a vibrant and dynamic urban environment near the venue. Since the direct economic benefits for these stadia rarely cover the large government subsidies involved the justification for public sector assistance sometimes depends on the facility’s ability to support the non-financial objectives such as community revitalization.&#xd;
The purpose of this study is to compare the planning for new professional football stadia in Regina and Winnipeg in terms of the specific site, transportation and accessibility issues, and surrounding land uses and to examine how each facility will likely function with respect to their local urban environment. Recommendations formulated following the analysis of the evaluation criteria are specific to each facility and may not be applicable to all cities. Rather, these recommendations may serve as best practice guidelines when considering the functional impact of future professional football stadia.</description>

   <description>Four experiments are presented that explore social interactivity in a visually communicating species: the pigeon, Columba livia.  A closed-loop teleprompter system was used to isolate, control and manipulate social contingency in a natural courtship interaction. Experiment 1 tested different ways to measure pigeon behaviour and developed an automatic method for measuring the pigeon’s circle walking display using motion energy analysis.  In Experiment, 2 the subject’s courtship behaviour towards the video image of an opposite sex partner streamed live (Live), was compared with their behaviour towards a pre-recorded video image of the same partner (Playback).  The only difference between the Live and Playback condition was the presence or absence of social contingency.  The results showed that pigeons behaved interactively: their behaviour was determined, in part, by the social contingencies between visual signals.   To investigate what types of social contingencies are behaviourally relevant, the effects of the partner’s facing direction and the timing of social contingencies on behaviour were investigated in Experiment 3 and 4, respectively. To manipulate partner facing direction, the camera was rotated so that the partner appears to be courting 90° away from the subject.  To manipulate social timing, three time delays, 1, 3 and 9s, were implemented within the closed-circuit communication. In Experiment 4, the context-specificity of interactive behaviour was also investigated by testing behavioural sensitivity to social contingency and timing in both opposite sex and same sex social interactions. The results showed that the partner’s facing direction did not significantly influence behaviour, whereas the timing of social contingencies had a significant impact on behaviour: in courtship only.  These findings suggest that temporal relations between display bouts in courtship are behaviourally relevant.  A post hoc analysis was then used to evaluate the behavioural relevance of two social contingencies in particular: partner responsiveness and simultaneous display.  The results showed that females may be sensitive to the male responsiveness in courtship.  Also, simultaneous display appeared to create a perceptual interaction which acted to potentiate the courtship dynamic.  These studies provide a basis for further developing the pigeon and its courtship behaviour as a model for visual communication.</description>

   <description>Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are a novel class of ice-binding stress response proteins produced by organisms which experience freezing at some point within their respective life histories. These proteins are structurally and evolutionarily diverse, are found in a range of different organisms, and are often related to stress or pathogen response proteins. AFPs are found in certain plant species, many of which are within the Poaceae family of monocotyledonous plants and are largely found within the Pooideae subfamily. Lolium perenne, (Lp) the perennial ryegrass, produces an antifreeze protein, LpAFP, and, like many plant AFPs, it does not dramatically depress the freezing point. However, LpAFP demonstrates great capacity in ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI). This robust IRI has led to interest in industrial applications of this protein, from cryoprotection to use as a frozen food additive, and most notably, to its potential use in transgenic crop enhancement. LpAFP has potential for crop enhancement strategies since its superior IRI allows controlled intercellular ice crystal formation, thus limiting the cellular membrane damage caused by freeze-thaw events. This thesis has generated a greater understanding of the nature of LpAFP, through selective characterization of its recombinant and native states, functional analysis through attempted gene knockdown, and investigation of its export pathways. In addition, it provides suggestions and strategies to work towards the development of transgenic trait applications.</description>

   <description>Schools are a place to foster lifelong learning skills. Upon graduation, students continue to learn through the news. What skills and abilities are needed, then, to become news literate? By relying on in-depth interviews with five Ontario journalists, this study brings the voice of journalists into this academic discussion, a voice that has been largely neglected in the reviewed literature. This study finds reporters largely agree with educational theorists on the concepts and lessons underpinning news literacy curricula, although refine these ideas from the point of view of news producers. Several themes emerged through phenomenological analysis of interview transcripts, including news creation as a social process, deep questioning and curiosity in relation to critical thinking, the roles of social media in the modern news ecosystem, and understanding news as a narrative that we shape and are shaped by. Each theme defines what it means to be news literate from the point of view of journalists and gives a detailed view of the generally accepted academic definition of media literacy, which is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create media in a variety of forms (Aufderheide, 1993; UNESCO, n.d.). Journalists acknowledged their domain expertise with the media and teachers’ expertise with education, meeting Masterman’s (2001) belief in the need for educators and journalists to work together to further the cause of media literacy. Educators looking for more detailed ideas for the construction of news literacy curricula can find those details in the thoughts, ideas and themes in this study.</description>

   <description>This report applies a systematic conservation planning framework to identity a network of lands that, if protected from development, could contribute to better protecting biodiversity in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The analysis adopts a simplified version of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources’ suggested Process for a Coordinated, Integrated and Comprehensive Approach for Natural Heritage Systems (OMNR, 2010), and uses the MARXAN conservation decision-support tool (Ball, Possingham &amp; Watts, 2009), a GIS-based software program, to facilitate the analysis.  The report includes a study area assessment, a summary of objectives and targets used to guide the decision-making process, an explanation about data collection and manipulation, and a step-by-step discussion of the modelling techniques used to develop Natural Heritage Systems scenarios within the context of Greenbelt expansion and connections to other protected natural areas in the City of Ottawa. The outputs of the MARXAN analysis help identify a biodiversity “wish list” that shows hotspot areas that, if protected from disturbances, contribute to meeting the biodiversity targets developed in the report. The value of establishing an ecological “wish list”, based on biodiversity goals, is that the information can inform land purchase agreements, land swaps, community growth plans, and development approvals, as the City and NCC can make educated planning decisions based on the potential regional implications that a project might have on biodiversity and nature environmental functions.. The analysis provided in this report highlights the potential for conservation planning software to be used in Natural Heritage System planning in Ottawa, ON. The ability to rationally compare different options for Natural Heritage systems, in terms of their costs, their contributions to conservation goals, and their interactions with other land uses, is a powerful evolving tool for land use planning.</description>

   <description>Surveillance has long been used as an enforcement tool to detect conventional crimes and identify and punish offenders. However, its watchful gaze has been strategically directed away from the area of corporate crime. Corporate crime has long been under-studied and under-researched, despite the fact that the damages it causes amount to millions, even billions, of dollars. Its omission from the surveillant gaze, however, has been no accident. Because corporate offenders hold higher positions in society and possess greater political and economic resources than conventional street criminals, corporate offenders have often been able to resist the regulatory attempts against them. This thesis explores the underuse of surveillance as an enforcement tool in corporate crime, but also examines the regulatory climate that perpetuates this. It explores the main tools for addressing criminal and regulatory violations that are used by law enforcement agencies charged with enforcing corporate crime. This thesis identifies and examines five barriers—cultural, political, economic, legal, and technological—that have acted to limit and even prevent surveillance as a tool of regulation against corporate crime. Through an analysis of academic literature and public sources, this thesis assesses the small number of initiatives where surveillance strategies have been attempted in the field of corporate crime and investigates the reasons the attempts have been limited in number, scope and effect. The aim of this thesis is to draw attention to underuse of surveillance in corporate crime and question the current regulatory framework.</description>

   <description>Deep-corrugated steel culverts (with a corrugation wavelength of 400mm and amplitude of 150mm) can be used as an effective alternative for short-span bridges. Current design methods are typically based on two-dimensional finite element analysis. This thesis reports results from three-dimensional finite element analysis, with explicit modelling of the geometry of the corrugated plates (called corrugated analyses) and employing the orthotropic shell theory (called orthotropic analyses), for a specific box culvert having a 10 m span and 2.4 m rise. The results were compared to previously reported experimental data where a specific large span box culvert was tested under controlled laboratory conditions. The behaviour of the box culvert under small vertical displacement without any soil support was modelled to isolate the structure response. The box culvert was also modelled when subject to fully loaded dump truck, and when loaded using a tandem axle frame to service and ultimate loads. Both corrugated and orthotropic analyses successfully captured the response of the box culvert when backfilled and loaded using dump truck and axle frame loading. It was found that the orthotropic model overestimated the culvert stiffness at the ultimate limit state, but provided effective estimates of response up to the factored design loads. The corrugated model with geometric nonlinearity was required to capture the real behaviour of the corrugated plates up to the ultimate limit state.  New insight into the failure mechanisms of the box culvert were provided by the corrugated model analysis. A parametric study was then performed for 86 different long-span box and arch culverts, examining live load spreading in the axial direction, number of loaded lanes, design truck position, culvert geometry, plate thickness, and the existence of pavement. The results were then compared to the moment and thrust equations in the 2006 Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) to check the performance of the current design equations. CHBDC equations overestimated the earth and live load bending moments, and did not give the correct trend for different spans. CHBDC thrust equations were found to underestimate the earth and live load thrust values for arch culverts.</description>

   <description>The Large Tumor Suppressor 1 (LATS1) is a serine/threonine kinase and tumor&#xd;
suppressor found down-regulated in a broad spectrum of human cancers. It is a central&#xd;
player of the emerging Hippo-LATS tumour suppressor pathway, which plays important&#xd;
roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and stem cell differentiation. Despite the ample data&#xd;
supporting a role of LATS1 in tumour suppression, how LATS1 is regulated at the&#xd;
molecular level remains largely unknown. In this study, we have identified Itch, a HECT&#xd;
class E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel binding partner of LATS1. Itch can complex with&#xd;
LATS1 both in vitro and in vivo through the PPxY motifs of LATS1 and the WW&#xd;
domains of Itch. Significantly, we found that over-expression of Itch promoted LATS1&#xd;
degradation by polyubiquitination through the 26S proteasome pathway. On the other&#xd;
hand, knockdown of endogenous Itch by shRNAs provoked stabilization of endogenous&#xd;
LATS1 proteins. Finally, through several functional assays, we also revealed that change&#xd;
of Itch abundance alone is sufficient for altering LATS1-mediated downstream signaling,&#xd;
negative regulation of cell proliferation, and induction of apoptosis. Together, our study&#xd;
identifies E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch as the first negative regulator of LATS1 and presents&#xd;
for the first time a possibility of targeting LATS1/Itch interaction as a therapeutic strategy&#xd;
in cancer.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents an historical analysis of the role of financial accounting in the emerging conceptions of corporate governance during the Progressive era in the United States.  Specifically, this thesis advances an approach to the governance and control of corporations in terms of historically-situated subjects who are acted upon by various forms of power leading them to assume specific roles in relation to corporations and their governance. The focus of this study is a broad archival analysis of the emergence of the large industrial corporation during the late nineteenth and into the beginning of the twentieth century.  In particular, in this thesis I analyze the importance of financial accounting and reporting discourses, as forms of expertise, to the historical emergence of the corporation’s external relationships with broader government bodies and authorities and a broad range of individuals within the public domain.  I employ a Foucauldian theoretical and methodological lens to highlight the importance of disclosure and reporting at the macro level of a public economic discourse regarding the corporation.  This discourse illustrates how governance focused less on prohibitory laws regarding corporate actions and more on normalizing forms of power in terms measuring and disclosure.  I also analyze at the micro level the role of accounting expertise and how it leads to the understanding within the public domain of corporations as norms of business organization.  Specifically, accounting expertise provides a means by which the corporation is seen as not only controllable, but also productive and utility maximizing.  Taken together, this analysis highlights how financial accounting and reporting comprise forms of normalizing power which shape and define individuals as various types of corporate subjects, such as investors.</description>

   <description>Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is an innovative hydrothermal technique, employing supercritical water (SCW, T≥374oC, P≥22.1 MPa) as the reaction media, to convert wet biomass or aqueous organic waste directly into hydrogen (H2)-rich synthetic gas (syngas). In the first stage of this research, a secondary pulp/paper-mill sludge (SPP, provide by AbitibiBowater Thunder Bay Operations) was gasified at temperatures of 400-550oC for 20 to 120 min in a high-pressure batch reactor for H2 production. The highest H2 yield achieved was 14.5 mol H2/kg SPP (on a dry basis) at 550oC for 60 min. In addition, SPP exhibited higher H2-generation potential than sewage sludges, likely attributed to its higher pH and higher volatile matter and alkali salt contents. In the second stage, a novel two-step process for sludge treatment was established. The first step involved the co-liquefaction of SPP with waste newspaper in a batch reactor at varying mixing ratios, aimed at converting the organic carbons in the feedstocks into valuable bio-crude and water-soluble products. The highest heavy oil (HO) yield (26.9 wt%) was obtained at 300oC for 20 min with a SPP-to-newspaper ratio of 1:2. This co-liquefaction process transformed 39.1% of the carbon into HOs, where 16.3% of the carbon still remained in the aqueous waste. Next, an innovative Ru0.1Ni10/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (10 wt% Ni, Ru-to-Ni molar ratio=0.1), with long-term stability and high selectivity for H2 production, was developed for the SCWG of 50 g/L glucose, where no deactivation was observed after 33 h on stream at 700oC, 24 MPa and a WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) of 6 h-1. The H2 yield was maintained at ~50 mol/kg feedstock. The addition of small amounts of Ru to Ni10/γ-Al2O3 was found to be effective in enhancing Ni dispersion and increasing the reducibility of NiO. Finally, the Ru0.1Ni10/γ-Al2O3 catalyst together with an activated carbon (AC) supported catalyst (Ru0.1Ni10/AC) were utilized for treating the aqueous by-product from sludge-newspaper co-liquefaction using a continuous down-flow tubular reactor. More than 90% of the carbon in the waste was destroyed at 700oC with the highest H2 yield of 71.2 mol/kg carbon noted using Ru0.1Ni10/AC.</description>

   <title>Where Does the Small Rural School Stand? Exploring Different Perspectives</title>

   <description>The closure of small rural schools is the single most implemented educational change reform in rural areas of Canada (Wallin, 2007). Similarly, throughout the 20th century, rural school consolidation was the single, most frequently implemented educational policy in the United States (Herzog &amp; Pittman, 1995). This study explores the why and how of this phenomenon.&#xd;
Rural education research has indicated that small rural schools across North America share common challenges unique to the rural situation (Bard, Gardener &amp; Wieland, 2006; Blaine, Pace &amp; Robinson, 2004; Mulcahy, 1993; Wallin, 2007). Many rural education researchers concur that some of these challenges arise from social, economic and political differences between urban and rural settings, but primarily, they stem from the consequence of globalization on trade, labour relations, regulatory control, or governmental rules and guidelines (Howley, 1997; Wallin, 2007). In response to these challenges, many policymakers and educational officials have initiated reform efforts in the form of small rural school closures and consolidations (Bard et.al, 2006; Corbett &amp; Mulcahy, 2006; Hicks, 1999; Wallin, 2007). In this study, I carry out a qualitative analysis of the rationale behind these reforms, using one particular Eastern Ontario school board’s proposal (Boundary 2020) and a number of other documents as an exemplification of these closure and consolidation movements, and the various rural stakeholder responses to this reform.&#xd;
In an exploration of rural perspectives and philosophies, I bring alternative rural perceptions to the forefront and advocate for rural stakeholders to have a voice in the future of their schools and communities. Moreover, by acknowledging not only the existence of small rural schools in Ontario, including the notion that their future is threatened by plans such as Boundary 2020, this project serves as a point of departure for future rural education research in a province that tends to favour a metropolitan-inspired school system. Furthermore, by emphasizing the need to cultivate rural meanings and identities, I hope to encourage rural communities to nurture the strengths of their local schools through the development of locally responsive curricula and community-centered activities and opportunities, which could contribute to the sustainability of their local rural schools.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis is to generate new ways of understanding and imagining what it means to educate for and from a critical consciousness (Freire, 1974).  My research is focused on my experience of trying to put critical pedagogy theory into practice in the context of teaching a grade 11/12 high school class.  In contrast to oppressive pedagogies that functioned to “prepare students for dominant or subordinate positions in the existing society” (McLaren, 1994, p. 191), as a critical pedagogue, I was guided by the goal of liberating the students in my class by raising their consciousness.  However, when I attempted to put critical pedagogy into practice, I soon found myself reproducing an oppressive, transmission-style pedagogy.  If the goal of critical pedagogy was to emancipate students by providing them with a transformative educational experience, why did I continue to view myself and my students in ways that were oppressive and paternalistic?                                                                   Critiques of critical pedagogy (Ellsworth, 1989; Gore, 1993) offer important insight into this question.  Yet, a limited amount of research had been performed into how dominant cultural myths about teaching (Britzman, 1986, 2003) inform teachers’ desires and efforts to put critical pedagogy theory into practice.  My thesis aims to shed light on the relationship between critical pedagogy and cultural myths about teaching by examining the discursive roots and mythologies reflected in my desire to “make a difference” in the lives of my students with critical pedagogy.  In exposing how pedagogy, desire, and identity intersect in complex, creative, and contradictory ways, my research makes visible one of the most difficult lessons that teachers who wish to educate for and from a critical consciousness have to learn:  “That the sincerity of their intentions does not guarantee the purity of their practice” (Brookfield, p. 1).</description>

   <description>The proportion of elderly individuals in society is increasing dramatically, leading to an increase in the prevalence of age-related neurological disorders that affect the function of the frontal lobes and overall movement control. This thesis aims to evaluate ‘executive control’ and the underlying brain changes in normal versus abnormal aging processes using saccadic eye movement tasks. Tasks performed by subjects that probe executive control consist of antisaccades (generate a voluntary eye movement after inhibiting an automatic movement to a visual stimulus), and memory-guided saccades (generate eye movements to three previous remembered visual stimuli in the same sequence they were presented). Both of these types of saccades require good functioning behavioural control, which is subserved by areas in the prefrontal cortex. This thesis specifically characterizes the changes in oculomotor control related to aging, Huntington’s disease, mild cognitive impairment (amnestic), and Alzheimer’s disease. We also specifically examine the neural mechanisms related to behavioural control in the antisaccade task in aging. Together, the conclusions drawn from this thesis reveal that specific areas in the prefrontal cortex are involved in executive dysfunction in both normal and abnormal aging, but the patient groups studied have provided new understanding that different underlying brain substrates may be altering function in the frontal cortical areas, such as the basal ganglia and the hippocampus.</description>

   <description>The Paleoproterozoic Talbot volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) Cu-Zn occurrence is located near Talbot Lake, Manitoba, about 80 km south of Snow Lake. The mineralised system is unconformably overlain by more than 100 m of Paleozoic dolomite sequences and Quaternary glacial till. The clay fraction  of the till contains pronounced anomalies of Zn, Cu, Ag, Pb, Au, Mn, Hg, Cd, Co, Bi and Se, which is ascribed to the formation of clay-humic complexes that have carbon-isotopic compositions of δ13C &lt; -20‰. A VMS origin of the near-surface anomaly is confirmed by distinctly low 206Pb/204Pb ratios, compared to a more radiogenic till signature.&#xd;
The overall low 206Pb/204Pb ratios in the organic surface media black spruce bark, moss and humus also indicate input from a magmatic sulphide source, but likely reflect windblown material from the Flin Flon smelter stack at 160 km to the northwest. Black spruce tree rings that pre-date industrial sources of atmospheric metal input are used to measure historical element distributions because they record the local geochemistry at the time of heartwood growth and their root systems tap into large volumes of soil. At the Talbot prospect, the presence of secondary Zn from the till in black spruce tree cores is reflected in the Zn/Ca ratio, which eliminates the effect of dolomite-derived Zn. The process of element migration from buried mineralisation to the surface &#xd;
is complex and includes oxidation of sulphides, mobilisation and complexation of metal ions, physical upward transport, and deposition of indicator elements near the surface in accessible sampling media. To account for a significant influx of indicator elements into the relatively recently deposited till blanket, post-glacial groundwater upwelling is proposed to act as a major mechanism driving upward element migration.</description>

   <description>A report submitted to the School of Urban and Regional Planning in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Urban and Regional Planning</description>
   <description>Streets are an important part of every urban environment. They facilitate mobility and have a strong influence on the shape of a city`s urban form. Streets aid in the movement of automobiles, transit, sewage, utilities, and water. They also facilitate pedestrian movement; however, the importance of planning for pedestrians is often undervalued and overshadowed by the needs of motorized modes of transportation. In order to accommodate rising automobile ownership and mitigate greater levels of congestion, improvements to mobility and changes to street design are often made at the expense of the pedestrian. In order to re-balance the functionality of street networks, individual streets need to be planned and designed with all users in mind. Walkability is described as a measure of how friendly an area is to pedestrians and typically accounts for the overall quality of walking conditions, including safety, comfort, and convenience. The objective of this report is to assess the physical and perceptual qualities of the built environment of three downtown Vancouver streets (Granville St, Robson St, Davie St). Through a walkability audit, this report examines how the presence of pedestrian features and streetscape elements affect the quality of a pedestrian environment. Recommendations will be made on how each street could be made more walkable and pedestrian-friendly through design.</description>

   <title>Constituting Governable Subjects: Foucault and Governmentality’s Account of ‘Governing through Freedom’ and the Case of the Indigenous Populations of Canada</title>

   <description>In 1978, Michel Foucault introduced his genealogy of the modern state, or alternatively, what he termed governmentality in which politics is understood as the product of rationalities which make up rule.  Foucault’s problematic was to uncover the rationalities of bio-power or bio-politics which is situated within liberal rule.  For Foucault, liberalism is to be viewed as a philosophy of rule that concerned itself with the rationality that the state may be governing too heavily and which increasingly divested itself of its regulatory capacities and consequently sought to guide the conduct of the population through often indirect and distanced means.  Subsequently, others have built upon Foucault’s work on liberalism and have concluded that the phrase governing through freedom adequately characterizes liberal philosophies of rule.  However, numerous critiques have been raised concerning the contention that liberalism brought with it a substantiated increase in freedom.  It is this critique that the current research wishes to expand upon by using the case of the Aboriginal peoples throughout Canada between the eighteenth and nineteenth century to display that the concept of governing through freedom is far too restricted and that the governmentality literature often presents an incomplete account of classical liberalism.</description>

   <description>In Experiential Planning: A Practitioner’s Account of Vancouver’s Success, Jill Grant draws attention to the intervolution of social issues and urban planning and specifically the role of Vancouver’s “ambitious social agenda” in transforming the city into a place now commended for its livability. This transition in Vancouver over the last twenty (plus) years indicates a place for social planning in community building and urban development. In 1988, about the same time&#xd;
Vancouver began implementing the planning policies, practices, and strategies that would later be recognized as factors in establishing its reputation as a livable city, the province passed Business Improvement Area (BIA) legislation. At that time, and even now, BIAs across the&#xd;
province are typically formed to address a range of issues concerning community and economic development. Certainly the mitigation of social issues is an emerging role, but one that remains subordinate. In Vancouver, however, a city that planners consider “the exemplar of a modernist&#xd;
city that attempts to be socially inclusionary” (Grant, 2009, p. 359), social issues have tended to carry more clout with municipal planners and policy-makers. Nearby municipalities, on the other hand, including those that comprise the Greater Vancouver Regional District, do not necessarily&#xd;
share the same progressive outlook on social issues. The hypothesis that motivates this inquiry then is BIAs—uniquely positioned among the key actors in the public, private, and voluntary sectors in the community—to some degree, likely reflect the city’s zealous social plan. Whether this hypothesis is valid, and whether or not the effect occurs across the metropolitan region, are&#xd;
telling indications of the overall effects of municipal social policy on the economic development objectives of BIAs.</description>

   <description>Vertical inclusions of expanded polystyrene (EPS) placed behind rigid retaining walls were investigated as geofoam seismic buffers to reduce earthquake-induced loads. A numerical model was developed using the program FLAC and the model validated against 1-g shaking table test results of EPS geofoam seismic buffer models. Two constitutive models for the component materials were examined: elastic-perfectly plastic with Mohr-Coulomb (M-C) failure criterion and non-linear hysteresis damping model with equivalent linear method (ELM) approach. It was judged that the M-C model was sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. The mechanical property of interest to attenuate dynamic loads using a seismic buffer was the buffer stiffness defined as K = E/t (E = buffer elastic modulus, t = buffer thickness). For the range of parameters investigated in this study, K ≤ 50 MN/m3 was observed to be the practical range for the optimal design of these systems. Parametric numerical analyses were performed to generate design charts that can be used for the preliminary design of these systems.&#xd;
A new high capacity shaking table facility was constructed at RMC that can be used to study the seismic performance of earth structures. Reduced-scale models of geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS) walls were built on this shaking table and then subjected to simulated earthquake loading conditions. In some shaking table tests, combined use of EPS geofoam and horizontal geosynthetic reinforcement layers was investigated. Numerical models were developed using program FLAC together with ELM and M-C constitutive models. Physical and numerical results were compared against predicted values using analysis methods found in the journal literature and in current North American design guidelines. The comparison shows that current Mononobe-Okabe (M-O) based analysis methods could not consistently satisfactorily predict measured reinforcement connection load distributions at all elevations under both static and dynamic loading conditions. The results from GRS model wall tests with combined EPS geofoam and geosynthetic reinforcement layers show that the inclusion of a EPS geofoam layer behind the GRS wall face can reduce earth loads acting on the wall facing to values well below those recorded for conventional GRS wall model configurations.</description>

   <description>At times, today‘s society seems dominated by negativity, disasters and a perceived decrease in humanity. The problems have slowly spread into schools, with education in danger of becoming a process of churning out workers rather than thinkers. Large-scale testing and its worth in educational lore seem to have replaced the need for discrimination and teachers may be becoming expendable in the Western world. The need for character education seems greater than ever in a world where intolerance has in some instances replaced morality. This project looks at the need for character education in today‘s world, the possibility of integrating character into the curriculum, and personal experiences with character education. Educare Everywhere explores the benefits of a values education program and offers a vision of the future of education through the lens of character education.</description>

   <description>This research studied 22 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighbourhood Development (LEED-ND) certified projects to determine how LEED-ND projects are achieving their certification status. Specifically, this report looked for common credits and major themes among the 22 projects, in addition to analyzing four variables for their degree of influence on the LEED-ND certification scores. This report used a sequential mixed-methods approach which included data collection, closed-ended survey questions, and basic statistical testing (mean). This report revealed the importance of promoting sustainable neighbourhood development in planning practices. Secondly, it contributed to our understanding of the LEED-ND credit system and its overall effectiveness.  Both goals will aid planners in determining the feasibility of implementing sustainable practices at the neighbourhood scale.</description>

   <description>Five years ago a Canadian Community College School of Business program undertook the task of redesigning its curriculum using feedback from focus groups with local leaders from a wide variety of businesses. The feedback indicated a perceived need to create a better way of teaching the college learner. The college began to look for a more effective way to address the needs of the college learner, and learner-centered theory became a starting point in the process. One approach, learner-centered reform, has become a part of a larger process involving curriculum, institutional, and pedagogical reform in undergraduate education (Barr &amp; Tagg, 1995; O’Banion, 1999; Parekh, 2007). A learner-centered curriculum takes time, collective energy of all involved, and resources (Hubball, Gold, Mighty, &amp; Britnell, 2007). &#xd;
This redesign took place over an 18-month period with faculty from each of the programs along with a facilitator for the process. The approach of “What do learners need to be able to do when they graduate?” was at the forefront of the planning process. It was critical that the outcomes that were created have meaning and be relevant to the learner in a professional and individual context (Hubball &amp; Burt, 2004).  The work of this thesis is to map the curriculum looking for any gaps or areas of concern prior to conducting online surveys with faculty and learners. The questions addressed in this study are: (1) Was this curriculum change learner-centered? (2) Did the faculty feel the curriculum was effective? (3) Did the curriculum change serve the needs of the learners? These questions are addressed through a curriculum mapping exercise and two online surveys, one for faculty and one for learners. The results of the surveys were supportive of learner-centered theory occurring in this college curriculum. The results did show some differences among the three School of Business programs. It is these results that are discussed in this thesis.</description>

   <description>Brownfield sites present a number of opportunities for planning agencies and developers to build sustainable, vibrant, and financially viable communities throughout Canada. While these sites are typically situated in strategic locations near city centres with high land values, their risk profiles are relatively high. The risks associated with environmental contamination, market value, liability, approvals, and timing are significant barriers that play into all stages of the development process. Through interviews and pro forma analysis, this report aims to identify the common risk variables as identified by professionals in the field, and to provide a set of general recommendations to guide public professionals across Canada.</description>

   <title>Professionalism Through the Eyes of Female Elementary Teachers in Ontario</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-29 14:46:15.745</description>
   <description>Numerous changes in education in Ontario in the past few decades have lead to much discussion regarding the professionalism of teaching in Ontario. Some theorists suggest the changes are deprofessionalizing, leading to an intensification of work that detracts from the professional status of teaching by causing work overload and breaking larger tasks into smaller ones requiring less thought or decision-making by the teachers themselves. Others consider the changes reprofessionalizing, in that they are simply changing what it means to be in the profession of teaching, mostly by moving towards a system of collaboration. At the same time, the Ontario College of Teachers (2009) has declared teaching an official profession by allowing for the acronym OCT (Ontario Certified Teachers) to be added to the signature of teachers to denote their status. While others have certainly had their say, teachers themselves were the missing voice in this controversy.&#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of this study was to examine the views of some female elementary teachers towards professionalism. This qualitative study consisted of interviews with seven female elementary teachers from one Ontario public school board to describe and examine their perceptions of professions in general, and what enhances or detracts from their sense of professionalism as teachers. Data analysis showed the emergence of themes regarding responsibilities, relationships, board and Ministry policies, job compensation, professional organization, job learning, and personal privileges. Within these themes a great deal of variance existed regarding what enhanced and what detracted from the sense of professionalism for the teachers interviewed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Of the many themes discussed, some teachers found them professionalizing, and other teachers found them deprofessionalizing. The teachers’ own personal standards and beliefs about professions and the standards and attitudes towards teachers held by their administrator seemed to be the deciding factor in what they found professionalizing and deprofessionalizing. While the theorists suggest deprofessionalization or reprofessionalization is based on the specifics of the changes themselves, this study suggests that a teacher’s sense of professionalism is constructed in a much more complex and personal manner, making it difficult to categorize certain changes or initiatives in education the way the theorists have.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-29 15:16:39.848</description>
   <description>Background:  The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) causes a wide variety of symptoms, but the central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction is the one most likely to affect the day-to-day life of those affected by this genetic disorder. In addition to affecting the educational needs of children with 22q11.2 DS, the neurological deficits in childhood and adolescence could be related to future psychosis and schizophrenia, which can affect 30% of these patients. Thus, the development of screening tools for CNS dysfunction could help identify children who are most at risk for developing later psychosis, allowing them to receive additional care. As saccadic eye movement behaviours reflect the integrity of multiple brain structures, a battery of oculomotor tasks could help identify neurological deficits. This study sought to test the hypothesis that children with 22q11.2 DS would have deficits in oculomotor performance compared to typically developing children. Methods: A cohort of 16 children with 22q11.2 DS, and 32 age- and sex-matched controls completed prosaccade, antisaccade, delayed memory-guided sequential (DMS) and predictive eye movement tasks. Results: Compared to controls, children with 22q11.2 DS exhibited increased direction errors in the antisaccade task, increased timing errors in the DMS task, as well as decreased predictive and increased regular saccades in the predictive task. The group of children with 22q11.2 DS also exhibited an increase in saccade amplitude in the prosaccade, antisaccade and predictive tasks, increased error in saccade trajectory in the prosaccade, antisaccade and DMS tasks and decreased saccade velocity in the predictive saccade tasks. Conclusion: This study showed that performance in the eye movement tasks could be used to assess injury to the frontostriatal circuitry and cerebellum in children with 22q11.2 DS.</description>

   <description>ABSTRACT&#xd;
	The Eocene Roda Formation in northern Spain documents the deposits from a range of coastal depositional environments.  These include alluvial plains, distributary channels, mouth bars, upper to lower-shorefaces, and tidal shelf ridges.  Eighteen progradational sand tongues that are interpreted as parasequences compose two third-order sequences.  Sequence 1 accumulated in an environment with strong tidal currents and high rates of progradation, while Sequence 2 was deposited under relatively weaker currents and higher rates of aggradation, which produced a higher mudstone:sandstone ratio.&#xd;
	The stratigraphy highlights the transgressive origin of six tidal shelf ridges, three in each sequence, that overlie regressive deltaic tongues.  Sequence 1 shelf ridges are composed almost entirely of cross-bedded sandstones, whereas Sequence 2 ridges are composed of a mixture of cross-bedded and ripple-laminated deposits.  Ridges in both sequences contain bioturbation that is typical of the Cruziana Ichnofacies, and that indicates a marine origin.&#xd;
	The tidal ridges are stratigraphically located at or near the point of maximum third-order regression, and are not found within early highstand or late transgressive deposits― times of high relative sea level when the deltaic shoreline did not protrude significantly.  Tidal currents were accentuated at the coast when the delta complex had prograded several kilometres into the basin, while during times of high relative sea level, the basin was wider and tidal currents were weaker, consequently leading to a lack of tidal deposits.  The tidal ridges are, thus, interpreted as being headland-associated deposits.</description>

   <description>A master's project that explores traditional and alternative fairy tales and how themes, morals, female stereotypes and gender roles are represented in these stories. A fairy tale curriculum unit for grade five is also included for teachers and students.</description>
   <description>“Fairy tales and fantasy do help to shape great minds. Einstein was an avid reader of fairy tales” (Polette, 2005, p.1). &#xd;
Children’s literature contains many genres, one of the most popular being fairy tale stories. After all, a child’s first exposure to literature is usually a fairy tale written by either the Brothers Grimm or Perrault (Kuykendal &amp; Stern, 2007). Fairy tales have continued to delight children, young and old, for centuries and play an important role in a child’s view of society because of what they read in fairy tale literature. Fairy tales are one of the most interesting genres of literature and should be a bigger part of the elementary school curriculum as these are stories that children have grown up with their whole lives. By reading these stories and exploring them further in education, students will have a better understanding of the fairy tale and what it represents. When exploring new genres of literature, we tend to look for black and white when in reality; fairy tales provide many different shades of gray (Charles, 2009). &#xd;
Fairy tales, both traditional and alternative versions, will be compared and contrasted to discover what meanings their themes have, what views of male and female characters are presented and how much fantasy and reality exist within these stories. The traditional fairy tale stories of the Brothers Grimm titled Snow White and The Sleeping Beauty will be used to compare with and contrast against the alternative fairy tale stories titled Snow White in New York, Sleeping Ugly and The Paper Bag Princess. Further exploring these two genres of fairy tales is a curriculum unit designed for the Ontario Curriculum’s Grade Five Language Arts Reading component. Through this unit, students will learn about these types of stories and how their own views on characters, gender roles, fantasy and reality in fairy tales contribute to society, whether positively or negatively.</description>

   <description>Many real-world relations are networks that can be modelled with a kind of directed hypergraph named a forward hypergraph (F-graph). F-graphs capture the semantics of both conjunctive and disjunctive dependency relations. Logic statements are sometimes represented using AND/OR directed graphs and they directly correspond with F-graphs; we provide algorithms to convert between the two types of graph. &#xd;
&#xd;
One problem of interest in networks is determining the degree to which the network, with a priority on certain elements, depends upon individual nodes. We address this problem by providing an algorithm, AssetRank, which computes vertex ranks and takes into account network priorities, preferential dependencies, and extra-network influences.  &#xd;
&#xd;
A second problem of interest in networks is optimizing the removal of nodes to separate two subcommunities (source and target) to the greatest practical degree, even when a complete disconnection is impractical. The problem is complicated by the need to consider the cost of removing nodes, a budget that constrains the degree to which separation is possible, cascading effects of removing a node, non-linear effects of removing nodes in combination, and removing nodes with the greatest impact on the subcommunities. To this end, we use F-graphs and introduce the concepts of vertex closures and closure-relation graphs. We created two partial-cut algorithms: the first one computes an optimal solution to this NP-hard optimization problem, and the second one estimates an optimization by exploring the closure-relation graph in a best-first search manner.&#xd;
&#xd;
Computer network defence provides a ready application area. Network defenders wish to understand which services and hosts are defence priorities (defence goals), and then, which configurations and vulnerabilities are the most useful to attackers in reaching the defence goals. The defenders' resources are constrained in terms of available person-hours, finances, and acceptable impacts to operations. The work in this thesis supports network defenders by providing actionable information that efficiently removes attack enablers and ensures defence priorities. We present an integration of our algorithms with commercial and open-source network security software.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2011-05-02 10:29:01.785</description>
   <description>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) overcome the difficulties of other monitoring systems, as they require no human attendance on site, provide real-time interaction with events, and maintain cost and power efficient operations. However, further efficiencies are required especially in the case of Outdoor Environment Monitoring (OEM) applications due to their harsh operational conditions, huge targeted areas, limited energy budget, and required Three-Dimensional (3D) setups. A fundamental issue in defeating these practical challenges is the deployment planning of the WSNs. The deployment plan is a key factor of many intrinsic properties of OEM networks, summarized in connectivity, lifetime, fault-tolerance, and cost-effectiveness. In this thesis, we investigate the problem of WSNs deployments that address these properties in order to overcome the unique challenges and circumstances in OEM applications. &#xd;
A natural solution to this problem is to have multiple relay nodes that reserve more energy for sensing, and provide vast coverage area. Furthermore, assuming a subset of these relay nodes are mobile can contribute in repairing the network connectivity problems and recovering faulty nodes, in addition to granting balanced load distributions, and hence prolonging the network lifetime. We investigate this promising research direction by proposing a 3D grid-based deployment planning for heterogeneous WSNs in which Sensor Nodes (SNs) and Relay Nodes (RNs) are efficiently deployed on grid vertices. Towards this efficiency, we analyze and characterize the grid connectivity property in the 3D space. Afterward, we design optimization schemes for the placement of SNs and RNs on the 3D grid models. Based on theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, the proposed schemes show a significant enhancement in terms of network connectivity and lifetime in OEM applications.</description>

   <description>New processes for the production of polymeric dispersions with high solids content and low viscosity were developed, investigated and characterized. The specifications required for the desired application of paper coating, which constitutes one of the major innovative aspects of this thesis, requires in average particle sizes smaller than 200 nm. This particle size is significantly smaller than obtained in previous work in this area. The main objective of this project was to increase the solids content of existing products from ~50 to ~60 wt% while keeping the viscosity at low levels (&lt; 1200 mPa•s at 20 s-1).&#xd;
In order to produce high solids content latexes with low viscosity, bimodal particle size distributions were resorted to. To obtain highest packing fraction, the small particle size population should be about 7 times smaller than the large particles, bringing the size of the small particles to less than 30 nm.&#xd;
Modified (micro)emulsion processes were developed in order to produce small particle size latex with reduced surfactant concentration and increased solids content. The large particle population was developed using a semi-batch emulsion polymerization process, simulating a product that is commercially available (~52 wt% solids content and viscosity of ~500 mPa•s at 20 s-1). To increase the solids content of this product up to 60 wt%, a second population of small particles was created using two approaches.&#xd;
In the first approach, the small particles were generated in situ using the modified (micro)emulsion approaches developed previously. This process resulted in latexes of ~ 60% solids content and viscosities lower than 500 mPa•s at 20 s-1.&#xd;
In the second approach, the second population of particles was created by the addition of seeds by using small cross-linked particles as pseudo inert-fillers. This process resulted in products with ~58% solids and viscosities lower than 1400 mPa•s at 20 s-1. The slightly decreased solids content and increased viscosity relative to the previous approaches is due to the difficulty in producing cross-linked seeds with particle sizes smaller than 30 nm at an acceptable concentration, causing deviations from ideal conditions.</description>

   <description>Neuroeconomic models take economic theory literally, interpreting hypothesized quantities as observables in the brain in order to provide insight into choice behaviour. This thesis develops a model of the neural decision process in strategic games with a unique mixed strategy equilibrium. In such games, players face both an incentive to best-respond to valuations and to act unpredictably. Similarly, we model choice as the result of the interaction between action value and the noise inherent in networks of spiking neurons. Our neural model generates any ratio of choices through the specification of action value, including the equilibrium ratio, and provides an explanation for why we observe equilibrium behaviour in some contexts and not others. The model generalizes to a random-utility model which gives a structural specification to the error term and makes action value observable in the spike rates of neurons. Action value is measured in the spike activity of the Superior Colliculus (SC) while monkeys play a saccade version of matching pennies. We find SC activity predicts upcoming choices and is influenced by the history of events in the game, correlating with a behaviourally-established model of learning, and choice simulations based on neural measures of value exhibit similar biases to our behavioural data. A neural measure of value yields a glimpse at how valuations are updated in response to new information and compared stochastically, providing us with unique insight into modelling choice in strategic games.</description>

   <title>Study of the Neuromodulatory Effects of Dopamine in the Oval Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis in Drug Naïve and Cocaine Dependent Long-Evans Rats</title>

   <description>The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), especially its oval (ov) subregion, receives a robust dopaminergic input from the periaqueducal, retrorubral, and ventral tegmental midbrain areas (Hasue &amp; Shammah-Lagnado, 2002). Given the critical role of dopamine in motivated behaviors, we combined behavioral testing of operant responding towards natural and pharmacological rewards, and brain slices patch-clamp electrophysiology to identify specific alterations in dopaminergic regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission within the ovBST as a result of chronic cocaine self-administration. In drug naïve rats we observed that DA dose-dependently decreased GABAA-inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSC) through the actions of pre-synaptic D2 receptors. However in rats maintaining cocaine self-administration, DA (1µM) increased the amplitude of GABAA-IPSC and this increase resulted from a loss of functional pre-synaptic D2 receptors and the de novo addition of D1 receptors. Furthermore, direct activation of D1 receptors only in rats maintaining cocaine self-administration resulted in a sustained increase of GABAA-IPSC (LTPGABA). The D1-induced LTPGABA was blocked by intracellular application of a Src-tyrosine kinase antagonist in the recording pipette. Based on this observation we concluded that the D1 receptor was located post-synaptically. However, the measured LTPGABA was associated with modifications in the coefficient of variation and paired pulse ratio of evoked GABAA IPSCs, suggesting that it is maintained by persistently increased GABA release from pre-synaptic terminals. Therefore to explain this apparent contradiction we propose the existence of a currently unknown retrograde messenger that is released from the post-synaptic neuron, upon D1 receptor activation, and travels backward to increase GABA release from presynaptic terminals. Moreover, application of a D2 agonist blocked the D1-induced LTPGABA, and co-application of a G-protein antagonist in the intracellular pipette prevented this D2 mediated inhibition, suggesting that due to maintenance of cocaine self-administration there was an emergence of a new post-synaptic D2 component whose functional role seems to inhibit the D1 receptor increase of GABAA-IPSCs. Importantly, modulation of synaptic transmission by dopamine was identical to drug-naïve conditions when intravenous cocaine administration was not contingent upon operant responding (yoked), before the maintenance phase of cocaine self-administration (acquisition), or in rats maintaining operant responding for sucrose under the same reinforcement schedule. All together we identified robust alterations in the effects of dopamine on inhibitory synaptic transmission following voluntary cocaine self-administration, these results represent to our knowledge, the first evidence of a change in dopaminergic regulation of synaptic transmission specific to voluntary drug intake.</description>
