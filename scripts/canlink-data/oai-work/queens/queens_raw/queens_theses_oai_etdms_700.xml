   <description>Modelling of human motion is used in a wide range of applications.&#xd;
An important aspect of accurate representation of human movement is&#xd;
the ability to customize models to account for individual&#xd;
differences. The following work proposes a methodology using&#xd;
Hill-based candidate functions in the Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS)&#xd;
method to predict translational force at the wrist from flexion and&#xd;
extension torque at the elbow.  Within this force estimation&#xd;
framework, it is possible to implicitly estimate subject-specific&#xd;
physiological parameters of Hill-based models of upper arm muscles.&#xd;
Surface EMG data from three muscles of the upper arm (biceps&#xd;
brachii, brachioradialis and triceps brachii) were recorded from 10&#xd;
subjects as they performed isometric contractions at varying elbow&#xd;
joint angles. Estimated muscle activation level and joint kinematic&#xd;
data (joint angle and angular velocity) were utilized as inputs to&#xd;
the FOS model.  The resulting wrist force estimations were found to&#xd;
be more accurate for models utilizing Hill-based candidate&#xd;
functions, than models utilizing candidate functions that were not&#xd;
physiologically relevant. Subject-specific estimates of optimal&#xd;
joint angle were determined via frequency analysis of the selected&#xd;
FOS candidate functions. Subject-specific optimal joint angle&#xd;
estimates demonstrated low variability and fell within the range of&#xd;
angles presented in the literature.</description>

   <description>Educators in many jurisdictions have moved to incorporate the Web as a mode of delivery through the creation of hybrid courses enabled by commerically available course management software. Corporate expectations, the experience of the teacher, and the experience of the students are examined in the transition of a course from a traditional to a hybrid mode of delivery. It is a qualitative phenomenological study based on observation of the classroom and online sessions supplemented by interviews with the teacher, students, and an instructional leader within the institution. The findings show that corporate expectations were inconsistent with support for implementation. Senior management established little policy on the implementation of the technology. In the absence of policy, the instructional leadership within the institution provided what little direction there was to faculty. The vision held by these instructional leaders emanates from the literature that asserts the superiority of hybrid delivery over other modes. Corporate expectations were not borne out. The teacher replicated the existing design of the traditional course, something that is noted in the literature as a general tendency by teachers in similar situations (Cuban, Kirkpatrick, &amp; Peck, 2001). The experience of the students was the exact reverse of what the instructional leadership intended. Students monitored the progress of the course online and avoided attending class. The hybrid mode of delivery rather than enabling a richer learning experience than that found in the traditional classroom permitted students to use the technology to avoid engagement in the course.</description>

   <description>The Directed ortho Metalation reaction is described in Chapter 1 of this thesis with particular emphasis on its mechanism and synthetic potential.  Chapter 2 contains a review of the DoM (Directed ortho Metalation) of pyridine systems and describes the conditions that allow the one-pot DoM (Directed ortho-Metalation)-Boronation-Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling of pyridines 2.263a-c, 2.351-2.53 (Table 2.9) bearing several DMGs (Directed Metalation Groups) including the synthetically versatile diethyl amide functionality without incurring into commonly observed self-condensation processes.  The method avoids the tedious and uncertain isolation of the intermediate boronic acids while offering rapid access to synthetically valuable arylpyridines (2.354a-s, Table 2.9).  Selected aryl pyridine carboxamides were used to demonstrate the DoM-DreM (Directed remote Metalation) nexus that furnishes substituted and isomerically diverse azafluorenones 2.380a-d (Table 2.11) with high regioselectivity.&#xd;
The previous discovery of the anionic O→C -vinyl carbamoyl migration of carbamoyl stilbenes stimulated its application in the total synthesis of natural product isoprekinamycin, bearing the unusual diazo group.  Chapter 3 of this thesis describes the efficient synthesis of the key stilbene derivative 3.113 and its structural variations whose conversion to the desired naphthols 3.143, 3.144, 3.153 and 3.169 (Table 3.3) is accompanied by extensive decomposition, thus terminating this approach to isoprekinamycin.  A modified approach via Z-3.271 (Scheme 3.54) gave the desired naphthyl carbamate intermediates 3.274 and 3.278 (Schemes 3.55 and 3.56, respectively) whose complex DreM reactions prevented the completion of the synthesis but remain under active investigation in our laboratories. &#xd;
Previous studies of the DoM reaction of aryl tetramethyl phosphorodiamidate have shown that unpractical experimental conditions are necessary, thus limiting synthetic application.  Chapter 4 of this thesis describes the results concerning the performance of the tetraethyl phosphorodiamidate DMG under standard DoM and DreM conditions, anionic phospha-Fries rearrangement, 1,4 lateral migration, and Suzuki cross coupling which demonstrate synthetic utility and application in synthetic aromatic chemistry.</description>

   <description>To a person with an upper limb amputation or congenital defect, a well-functioning prosthesis can open the door to many work and life opportunities.  A fundamental component of many modern prostheses is the myoelectric control system, which uses the myoelectric signals from an individual's muscles to control prosthetic movements.  Though much research has been done involving the myoelectric control of arm and gross hand movements, more dexterous finger control has not received the same attention.  Consequently, the goal of this study was to determine an optimal approach to the myoelectric signal classification of a set of typing motions.  Two different movement sets involving the fingers of the right hand were tested:  one involving digits two through five (4F - "four finger"), and the other involving digits one and two (FT - "finger/thumb").&#xd;
&#xd;
Myoelectric data were collected from the forearm muscles of twelve normally-limbed subjects as they performed a set of typing tasks.  These data were then used to test a series of classification systems, each comprising a different combination of system element choices.  The best classification system over all subjects and the best classification system for each subject were determined for both movement sets.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The optimal subject-specific classification systems yielded classification accuracies of 92.8 ± 2.7% for the 4F movement set and 93.6 ± 6.1% for the FT movement set, whereas the optimal overall classification systems yielded significantly lower performance (p&lt;0.05): 89.6 ± 3.4% for the 4F movement set and 89.8 ± 8.5% for the FT movement set.  No significant difference in classification accuracy was found between movement sets (p=0.802).  A two-way repeated measures ANOVA (α=0.05) was used to determine both significance results.</description>

   <description>Metamaterials, artificially engineered structures with negative average relative permittivity and permeability, provide a route to creating potential devices with exciting electromagnetic properties that cannot be obtained with natural materials. One particularly interesting metamaterial device, is a planar metamaterial waveguide structure (MWS) that has potentially exciting applications. In this thesis, the properties and potential applications of metamaterial waveguide structures are explored. In particular, we examine the properties of metamaterial waveguides when the limitations arise from fabrication techniques and physical principles are taken into account.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, we study the basic properties of dispersion curves of an idealized (without loss and dispersion) metamaterial waveguide structure. We show that there are a rich variety of modes, such as the bound modes, the surface polariton modes, and the complex leaky modes, that are supported in MWS and have entirely different properties than the modes of a conventional waveguide structure. These novel modes provide more control over the electromagnetic fields and consequently lead to potential applications ranging from waveguide miniaturization to the slowing down of the light.&#xd;
&#xd;
Next, we study the effects of dispersion and loss, which are the inherent features of metamaterials, on the properties of MWS. We numerically show that the characteristic modes of the MWS are significantly changed particularly near the slow-light-modes when the intrinsic loss is introduced into the system. In particular we show that the stopped-light-modes disappear even in the presence of an arbitrarily small amount of loss. Moreover, we find several novel properties such as a splitting of complex leaky modes in a lossy MWS.</description>

   <description>In this work, I will describe a new statistical tool: the canonical bicoherence, which is a combination of the canonical coherence and the bicoherence. I will provide its definitions, properties, estimation by multitaper methods and statistics, and estimate the variance of the estimates by the weighted jackknife method. I will discuss its applicability and usefulness in nonlinear quadratic phase coupling detection and analysis for multivariate random processes. Furthermore, I will develop the time-varying canonical bicoherence for the nonlinear analysis of non-stationary random processes. In this thesis, the canonical bicoherence is mainly applied in two types of data: a) three-component geomagnetic field data, and b) high-dimensional brain electroencephalogram data. Both results obtained will be linked with physical or physiological interpretations. In particular, this thesis is the first work where the novel method of ``canonical bicoherence'' is introduced and applied to the nonlinear quadratic phase coupling detection and analysis for multivariate random processes.</description>

   <description>In this work, numerical and experimental methods are used to characterise the effects of convective transport in an anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).  To that end, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to compare a full transport model to one that assumes convection is negligible.  Between these two approaches, the variations of mass, temperature, and electrochemical performance are compared.  Preliminary findings show that convection serves to reduce the penetration of hydrogen into the anode, and becomes more important as the thickness of the anode increases.&#xd;
The importance of the permeability of SOFC electrodes on the characterization of convection is also investigated.  Experiments performed on Ni-YSZ anodes reveal that permeability is a function of the cell operating conditions, and increases with increasing Knudsen number.  An empirical Klinkenberg relation is validated and proposed to more accurately represent the permeability of electrodes in a CFD model.  This is a departure from an assumption of constant permeability that is often seen in the literature.  It is found that a varying permeability has significant effects on pressure variation in the cell, although according to the electrochemical model developed in this work, variation in permeability is only found to have minor effects on the predicted performance.&#xd;
Furthermore, it is revealed that an electrochemical model which makes the simplifying assumption of constant overpotential is in error when predicting current and temperature variation.  In this work, this is found to predict an unrealistic spatial variation of the current.  It is suggested that this approach be abandoned for the solution of a transport equation for potential which couples the anodic and cathodic currents.  This will lead to a more realistic prediction of temperature and performance.</description>

   <description>Accurate information on the spatial-temporal distributions of air pollution at a regional scale is crucial for effective air quality control, as well as to impact studies on local climate and public health. The current practice of mapping air quality relies heavily on data from monitoring stations, which are often quite sparse and irregularly spaced. The research presented in this dissertation seeks to advance the methodologies involved in spatiotemporal analysis of air quality that integrates remotely-sensed data and in situ measurement. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is analyzed to estimate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations as the target air pollutant.&#xd;
		   The spatial-temporal distribution of columnar aerosol loading is investigated through mapping MODIS AOD in southern Ontario, Canada throughout 2004. Clear distribution patterns and strong seasonality are found for the study area. There is a detectable relationship between an AOD level and underlying land use structure and topography on the ground. MODIS AOD was correlated with the ground-level PM2.5 concentration (GL-[PM2.5]) at various wavelengths. The AOD-PM2.5 correlation is found to be sensitive to spatial-temporal scale changes. Further, a semi-empirical model has been developed for a more accurate prediction of GL-[PM2.5]. The model employs MODIS AOD data, assimilated meteorological fields, and ground-based meteorological measurements and is able to explain 65% of the variability in GL-[PM2.5]. To achieve a more accurate and informative spatiotemporal modelling of GL-[PM2.5], a method is proposed that integrates the model-predictions and in situ measurements in the framework of Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) analysis. A case study of southern Ontario demonstrates the procedures of the method and support for its advantages by comparison with conventional geostatistical approaches. The BME estimation, coupled with BME posterior variance, can be used to depict GL-[PM2.5] distribution in a stochastic context. The methodologies covered in this work are expected to be applicable to the modelling or analysis of other types of air pollutant concentrations.</description>

   <title>Effect of Colchicine on Endosperm Development in Helianthus Annuus.</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2008-11-03 10:18:50.557</description>
   <description>Embryogenesis was observed through light and transmission electron microscopy to elucidate the role of the cytoskeleton in the cellularization of the coenocytic endosperm in Helianthus annuus. Microtubules were not seen throughout the development of the endosperm despite the fact that nuclear division occurred frequently. The positioning of organelles in the cytoplasm in close proximity to the developing cell plate as well as the crooked appearance of the growing endosperm cell wall suggests that a traditional microtubular system, in which a phragmoplast controls wall formation, is not present in this species. The growth patterns exhibited by endosperm walls, similar to that of tip growing cells, may indicate that actin filaments are controlling the cellularization of the endosperm. To further investigate the role of microtubules in the development of the endosperm of H. annuus, inhibitory studies using 100 µM, 300 µM and 1 mM colchicine were conducted on ovules both in-vivo and in-vitro.  Enlarged nuclei, partial collapse of the integumentary tapetum, and loss of organelles were observed in colchicine treated cells which indicates that colchicine affected the development of the endosperm. However, since little difference was seen between the various concentrations of colchicine and the cellularization of the endosperm was still observed in treated cell, this may indicate that either colchicine did not affect the cytoskeleton controlling endosperm development or that it did not successfully penetrate the embryo sacs. The minor effect seen by the application of colchicine may support the idea that actin plays a role in the cellularization of endosperm in H. annuus.</description>

   <description>In recent years, technologies using supercritical water have gained considerable attention, mainly due to versatility and uniqueness of water at elevated temperatures and pressures. The physical conditions required to generate supercritical water also make it prone to large intrinsic thermal and density fluctuations, exacerbated if there are impurities present in the system. These fluctuations induce nucleation, the initial stage of a first-order phase transition, and subsequent mixing of the new phase within the original phase. When this new phase reaches its critical size it grows irreversibly to macroscopic proportions, otherwise, tending to disintegrate. The presence of a polydispersed solid phase within the supercritical phase is responsible for unfavorable phenomena such as particle deposition and corrosion of structural components, both of which result in decreased efficiency and reliability of the supercritical water employing process. &#xd;
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation method has been the primary tool of investigation. Molecular motions are tracked on the femto and picosecond time-scales which are particularly important for the study of nucleation. Sodium chloride has been chosen in this research since it is computationally tractable and is unavoidably involved in most industrial water based applications. Cluster size distributions, the size of critical nuclei and cluster life-times are reported. The size distribution of emerging clusters shows a very strong dependence on the system’s density, with larger clusters preferentially formed at lower densities. &#xd;
Also, a materials science application is presented where the rapid quenching of hydrothermally formed sodium chloride clusters leads to a variety of nanostructures, characterizable by prominent vibrational modes. And lastly, during the conditions prior to crystallization, water is not only physically adsorbed to the cluster’s surface but also exists in a “confined” state within subsurface regions for several picoseconds during the nucleation process. A mechanism for the sodium chloride hydrolysis reaction is presented as well as showing that asymmetric electrostatic fields generated by the coalescing ions are on the order of 1010 V/m, sufficient to drive the hydrolysis of confined water molecules. The HCl molecule and hydroxide ions are formed, with the latter segregating preferentially to sub-surface regions in the amorphous NaCl particles. Both HCl and hydroxide are implicated in corrosion.</description>

   <description>Present day manufacturing assembly relies extensively on a variety of fasteners for the assembly of sub-systems, components and trim. Speed Fastening (SF) is one commonly used non-structural assembly fastening method. The primary limitation of SF is the lack of continuously fed rivets. One path to productivity improvement for SF is the development of a continuously feed tool that would eliminate the non-value added time currently scheduled for reloading in the work cycle. In preparation for the design of a new tool, a proactive ergonomic investigation was carried out to examine differences in muscular effort, upper-body posture, as well as subjective ratings of perceived exertion and discomfort across three different work rates for a simulated SF task conducted in a laboratory setting. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the ergonomic consequences that an increase in work rate would have on SF operators.&#xd;
Twelve healthy female subjects participated in simulated SF work over four test-sessions. The first test session familiarized subjects with the SF tasks as well as the data collection protocol. Subsequent test days, which were scheduled 24 hours apart, were block randomized to one of three work rates (7, 14 and 21 fasteners/min.) with subjects required to complete 120 minutes of a simulated SF task at both waist and shoulder height using a 50% work to rest duty cycle.&#xd;
The results of this study show significant increases in the amount of muscular activity required to complete the simulated SF, particularly for the 21 fasteners per minute work rate, with increases in peak sEMG amplitudes ranging from 3-12% MVIC. Specifically these increases were most marked in the forearm extensor muscles. In addition, significantly deviated postures were found in upper-limb joint ROM data, particularly when SF work was completed at shoulder height.&#xd;
Overall, based on the increased exposure to risk factors known to be precursors for workplace injury (i.e. repetition and awkward posture), it is inferred that an increase in work rate will put SF operators at an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injury. It is expected that this risk would be even more pronounced for work completed at shoulder height.</description>

   <title>Liquid Photography? Narrative and Technology in Digital Photographic Practices</title>

   <subject>Digital Photography</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-09 11:01:58.955</description>
   <description>This thesis is about emerging changes in photography and imaging related to digitization and how we might approach and understand them, particularly in terms of their impact upon how narratives are constructed. By focusing on the accounts of Queen’s University students this thesis examines the new ways of making, storing, distributing, and viewing images that have emerged with digital photography. Additionally, it looks at the cultural conventions of photography (particularly in relation to the documenting and organization of memory) that remain intact and have important implications for the reception of use of new digital technologies and how these are used to construct narratives.&#xd;
This thesis also looks at the digitization of photography in relation to broader theoretical debates about the dynamics and shifts associated with modernity, postmodernity and ‘global information culture’. Contemporary society is often seen as more capitalist, and in many ways, this is an era of increasing uncertainty, fluidity, and fragmentation. This thesis examines the affinity between the supposed ‘death of narrative’ in social theory and the ‘death of photography’ in terms of how they relate to the ordinary practices of amateur digital photographers.&#xd;
Specific focus is given to Bauman’s (2000) theory of ‘liquid modernity’ and how it offers a compelling account of contemporary society, specifically in terms of changes in narrative and how many individuals are faced with developing ‘biographical solutions’ to systemic problems of increasing uncertainty and fragmentation in the context of globalization and informationalization. In doing so, this thesis aims to address gaps in existing research on digitization that fails to capture the subtleties encountered in the everyday experiences of those engaged in taking the digital turn.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2008-11-06 13:51:42.326</description>
   <description>This thesis reports on a qualitative study that documented one teacher’s research-based practice of teaching students to read in a Grade 9 ESL Academic mathematics course. Specifically, this thesis focuses on the description of the range of strategies and reading-based activities that the teacher used; the experiences and influences that led him to include reading strategies in his regular instructional practice; and, the challenges that he faced when integrating these strategies routinely as part of his daily mathematics program. The complexity of simultaneously teaching mathematics and reading strategies in the context of a Grade 9 ESL Academic course is also discussed. &#xd;
The study was conducted early in the second semester of the 2007-2008 school year. A variety of data collection methods were used: interview, classroom observation, and document collection. The findings of the study provide concrete examples of designing lessons that embed the use of reading strategies (e.g., vocabulary development, reading supplementary text, and reflection) to teach or inform mathematics concepts. The large number of ESL students in the observed class underscored the importance of incorporating reading strategies into the mathematics program in order to facilitate ESL students’ language learning processes. The teacher under study focused on using additional literature as an aid to develop students’ deeper understanding of mathematics concepts and introduced reading strategies as a means to improve students’ reading comprehension of supplementary text; however, he did not apply these strategies to lessons directed at the comprehension of specific mathematics text. The conclusions suggest that mathematics teachers require substantive classroom-based evidence and support from Ministry of Education personnel, subject specialists, school administrators, and peers in order to be convinced of the value of reading in mathematics class and to embark on their own program for implementing reading strategies and reading-based activities into regular mathematics learning activities.</description>

   <description>The signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) is a latent cytoplasmic protein that is activated through phosphorylation of tyrosine-705 by a number of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This leads to Stat3 dimerization by reciprocal SH2-ptyr interactions, followed by translocation to the nucleus to initiate transcription of genes involved in cell growth, survival, and differentiation. Many of these signaling molecules known to activate Stat3 concentrate in specialized plasma membrane microdomains called caveolae, and are sequestered in an inactive state to the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) of the main caveolae resident protein, caveolin-1 (cav1). Since many of these signaling molecules are known, potent Stat3 stimulators, we set out to examine the effect of cav1 upon Stat3 activity. &#xd;
To this effect, cav1 was downregulated using a cholesterol chelator (methylcyclodextrin), or an antisense approach. Since we previously found that cell density can dramatically activate Stat3, all experiments were conducted at several densities. The results show that cav1 downregulation causes an increase in Stat3-tyr705 phosphorylation at all densities examined. We next examined the effect of cav1 upregulation upon Stat3 activity by transfecting an EGFP-cav1 construct. The results revealed that cav1 overexpression using this construct reduces Stat3 activity and induces apoptosis, which can be overcome by expression of a constitutively active form of Stat3. Finally, by expressing a Stat3 shRNA with an adenovirus vector, we demonstrated that Stat3 downregulation leads to an increase in cav1 levels. These results reveal the presence of a potent, negative regulatory relationship between cav1 and Stat3 phosphorylation.</description>

   <description>Studies described in this thesis were at aimed at characterizing the mechanisms involved in the pulmonary carcinogenicity of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), by addressing two critical determinants of carcinogenicity; biotransformation and DNA repair.&#xd;
The contributions of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A13 and CYP2A6 to NNK biotransformation in human lung microsomes were investigated.  Based on total bioactivation and detoxification of NNK and its keto-reduced metabolite, 4 (methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), subjects could be classified as either high or low bioactivators and detoxifiers.  Data from all of 29 individuals revealed no correlations between levels of CYP2A mRNA, enzyme activity or immunoinhibition and the degree of total NNK bioactivation or detoxification.  However, subgroups were identified for whom CYP2A13 mRNA correlated with total NNK and NNAL bioactivation (n=4) and NNAL detoxification (n=5).  Although results do not support CYP2A13 or CYP2A6 as predominant contributors to NNK metabolism in lung of all individuals, CYP2A13 appears to be important in some.&#xd;
The involvement of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in the repair of NNK-induced DNA pyridyloxobutylation was assessed.  Extracts from NER-deficient cells were less active at repairing pyridyloxobutyl (POB) adducts on plasmid DNA than were extracts from normal cells, and NER-deficient cells were more susceptible to 4-(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNKOAc)-induced cytotoxicity, demonstrating the participation of NER in the repair of POB-DNA adducts.&#xd;
The role of DNA repair in contributing to inter-organ susceptibility to NNK-induced carcinogenesis was investigated.  POB adduct repair was greater in extracts from mouse liver than lung, and activities in lungs of NNK-treated mice were lower than those of saline-treated mice, while repair was 3 times higher in livers of NNK-treated mice relative to control.  NNK treatment decreased incision of POB adducts by 92 % in lung extracts and increased incision by 169 % in liver extracts.  In addition, NNK altered the levels and binding to POB damage of key incision proteins.  These results suggest that lower NER incision activity and NNK-mediated alterations in levels and activities of incision proteins contribute to the relative susceptibility of mouse lung to NNK-induced carcinogenesis.</description>

   <description>As the use of Web expands, Web Service is gradually becoming the basic system infrastructure. However, as it matures and a large number of Web Service becomes available, the focus will shift from service development to service management. One key component in management systems is monitoring. The growing complexity of Web Service platforms and their dynamically varying workloads make manually monitoring them a demanding task. Therefore monitoring tools are required to support the management efforts. &#xd;
Our approach, Web Service Monitoring System (WSMS), utilizes Autonomic Computing technology to monitor Web Service for an automated manager. WSMS correlates lower level events into a meaningful diagnosed symptom which provides higher level information for problem determination. It also gains the ability to take autonomic actions and solve the original problem using corrective actions. In this thesis, a complete design of WSMS is presented along with a practical implementation showing viability and proof of concept of WSMS.</description>

   <description>Paleoclimatic research in the Canadian Arctic has increased in recent decades; however, there is still much to learn about the nature and extent of past climate change in this vast, environmentally sensitive region.  This thesis uses diatom assemblages in dated lake sediment cores as proxy indicators to infer how climate has changed over the Holocene in two very different lakes in the central Canadian Arctic: one located in a poorly-studied geographical region, and another possessing limnological characteristics that are unusual in an Arctic context.    &#xd;
Lake TK-2 is located in the low Arctic tundra.  Paleolimnological studies from this region are lacking, as most have centered on sites in the High Arctic Archipelago or around Subarctic treeline.  Marked changes in the diatom assemblages in TK-2 throughout the Holocene included potential evidence for the 8.2k cooling event, which has not been previously reported from other Canadian Arctic paleolimnological studies.  In addition, diatom shifts occurring ~7000 and ~3500 cal yr BP are indicative of mid-Holocene warming and subsequent Neoglacial cooling, respectively, the timings of which agree with those from other studies farther south.  Finally, shifts in the diatom assemblages in the upper sediment layers, beginning in the early-to-mid 19th century, are consistent with reduced ice cover, related to recent warming.&#xd;
Stygge Nunatak Pond, a small, closed-basin pond located on a nunatak in the High Arctic on Ellesmere Island, is characterized by unusually high ionic concentrations for an inland Arctic pond.  As in TK-2, Stygge’s diatom assemblages changed substantially throughout the Holocene, but especially in the most recent sediments.  Diatom shifts near ~10,500 cal yr BP suggest an early onset for the Holocene Thermal Maximum (and for the successive Neoglacial cooling trend) in this region, consistent with previous studies from the High Arctic.  Marked diatom assemblage changes occurred in the most recent sediments, and are indicative of climate warming and reduced ice cover, as well as increased ionic concentration due to enhanced evaporative concentration.  The dynamic nature of the diatom assemblage changes at the Stygge site suggests that sediments from these rare athalassic ponds represent an especially sensitive archive of Arctic climatic and environmental change.</description>

   <title>Using Economic Models to Tune Resource Allocations in Database Management Systems</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2008-11-17 15:35:50.303</description>
   <description>Resource allocation in a database management system (DBMS) is a performance management process in which an autonomic DBMS makes resource allocation decisions based on properties like workload business importance. We propose the use of economic models in a DBMS to guide the resource allocation decisions. An economic model is described in terms of business trades and concepts, and it has been successfully applied in some computer system resource allocation problems.&#xd;
In this thesis, we present approaches that use economic models to allocate single and multiple DBMS resources, such as main memory buffer pool space and system CPU shares, to workloads running concurrently on a DBMS based on the workloads’ business importance policies. We first illustrate how economic models can be used to allocate single DBMS resources, namely system CPU shares, to competing workloads on a DBMS.  We then extend this approach to using economic models to simultaneously allocate multiple DBMS resources, namely buffer pool memory space and system CPU shares, to competing workloads on a DBMS based on the workload business importance policy in order to achieve their service level agreements. Experiments are conducted using IBM® DB2® databases to verify the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

   <title>Status, Relatively Speaking: Extending the Organizational Focus on Status and Status Inequality</title>

   <subject>Status</subject>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2008-11-25 11:12:46.526</description>
   <description>This dissertation explores the role of status and status hierarchies in organizations, with considerable attention devoted to status-based health disparities. Manuscript 1 extends the current work stress literature by proposing a dynamic model relating individual-level socio-economic status (SES) to workplace stressors, psychological resources, and health. The model is tested using three-wave longitudinal data gathered across four years from employed Canadians.  The results show an escalating relationship between personal control and work stressors, which indirectly links SES to physical health outcomes.   &#xd;
&#xd;
The second study of the dissertation elaborates on the definition of status, acknowledging and embracing its relational nature. In doing so, Manuscript 2 advances Manuscript 1 in numerous ways: (1) it conceptualizes status at the team-level of analysis by introducing the construct of status inequality, or the degree to which status is dispersed within teams; (2) it shifts focus from macro indicators of SES to organizational indicators of status within small, face-to-face teams, asking whether status in these teams influences health; (3) it explores performance-related outcomes in addition to health outcomes at both the individual- and team-level of analysis. Archival data from National Basketball Association players and teams were obtained to test the hypotheses set forth in Manuscript 2.  The results of the study suggest that both status and status inequality (and their interaction) are related to the focal individual- and team-level outcomes.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The final chapter comprising this dissertation resides largely at the team-level of analysis. Manuscript 3 is a conceptual exploration into the mechanisms that relate status inequality to team-level health and performance, proposing that status inequality influences social cognition, from which emerges a team’s social structure. Furthermore, it places boundary conditions on the effects of status inequality by arguing that shared cultural values will determine how status inequality is perceived and enacted. The dissertation closes with a general discussion of the studies and recommendations for future research.</description>

   <description>Heme oxygenases (HO) catalyze the degradation of heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO) and free iron.  The two major isoforms, HO-2 (constitutive) and HO-1 (inducible by various stressors such as heavy metals and reactive oxygen species) are involved in a variety of physiological functions, including anti-inflammation, antiapoptosis, neuromodulation, and vascular regulation. Major tools used in exploring these actions have been metalloporphyrin analogs of heme that inhibit the HOs.  However, these tools are limited by their lack of selectivity; they affect other heme-dependent enzymes, such as cytochromes P450 (CYPs), soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS).  Our laboratory has been able to successfully synthesize a series of small molecule non-porphyrin HO inhibitors (QC-xx) that have had little or no effect against sGC and NOS; however, their effects on various CYP isoforms has yet to be fully elucidated.  In order to determine the effects on CYP enzyme activity, microsomal preparations of two CYP isoforms (2E1 and 3A1/3A2) were incubated with varying concentrations of HO inhibitor and the activity was determined via spectrophotometric analysis. Results indicated that some QC compounds demonstrated little to no inhibition of CYP2E1 and/or CYP3A1/2, while some others did inhibit these CYP isoforms.  Four regions of interest were analyzed further and several structural changes were identified as conferring increased HO inhibition and decreased effect on both CYP2E1 and 3A1/2.  Based on the information obtained, three putative compounds were designed and it is hypothesized that these compounds will be selective inhibitors for HO-1 over HO-2 and will display little effect on either CYP2E1 or 3A1/2 activities.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2008-11-20 12:49:49.4</description>
   <description>Purpose&#xd;
Clinical care providers today are more aware and have a better understanding of how osteoporosis affects a child’s quality of life and their ability to function. Fractures result in pain and suffering for children with this chronic illness and there is often a further reduction in mobility, independence, hospitalization, time out of school, and considerable stress upon the family (Caulton, Ward, Alsop, Dunn, Adams, &amp; Mughal, 2004). No published data could be found on the health related quality of life (HRQoL) for children who have been diagnosed or are receiving treatment for osteoporosis. The purpose of this study was to report on the HRQoL of children with osteoporosis using two validated questionnaires. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods&#xd;
An exploratory cohort study was conducted with a small convenience sample of 31 children with secondary osteoporosis receiving medical care from the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) participated. Data were collected using a generic questionnaire, the Dimension of Childhood Chronicity (DOCC) scale, and a disease specific questionnaire, the Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), both of which measure HRQoL.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results&#xd;
The total score for the DOCC scale was a mean of 59 out of a total possible score of 92. This result was not statistically different when compared with mean of children with disabilities. On the PODCI questionnaire, participants scored the lowest, with scores less than 68, in the areas of sports and physical functioning, pain and comfort, and happiness. Their overall Global Functioning score was 75. These results were statistically significant when compared to a healthy population.  Based on the HBSC study question, 70% of study participants rated their health as good or excellent.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions&#xd;
Despite low study numbers, it is evident that their disease has a substantial effect on the day to day life.  However, parents do not view their child as unhealthy as they are seeing improvements in their physical functioning and their children are happy and enjoying life.</description>

   <description>Hydrocarbon autoxidation, a free radical chain reaction, is one of the most important chemical processes, and is ubiquitous in biological systems and industry. While it is vital to maintaining cellular homeostasis and plays central roles in the immune and inflammatory responses, it is also believed to play a role in the onset and development of diseases and degenerative disorders when not kept in check. In vivo, this process is generally initiated by the reduction of O2 to superoxide (O2•-), which can then afford various reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as HOO•, H2O2, HO•, and 1O2. Recently, it was suggested that antibodies, as part of the immune system, produce another ROS: ozone. The evidence for endogenous ozone formation was based largely on the isolation of the known cholesterol ozonolysis products in extracts of arterial plaque and brain tissue. Identification was accomplished by derivatization and subsequent HPLC-MS analysis. Herein, an alternative, more likely explanation for the appearance of these two compounds and their derivatized forms is given, via acid-catalyzed Hock cleavage of cholesterol 5-hydroperoxide. &#xd;
Radical-trapping chain-breaking antioxidants inhibit hydrocarbon autoxidation; in Nature and as additives in industrial materials, formulations, etc. Nature typically employs phenols in this context, and it is well documented that their potency is based largely on the lability of their phenolic O-H bond. While their reactivity can be improved by making the phenol more electron-rich by introducing electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring, this increases their air (oxygen) sensitivity, leading them to decompose in air and generate ROS themselves! To prevent this, nitrogen(s) can be introduced in the aromatic ring to make 3-pyridinols and 5-pyrimidinols; the most effective air-stable radical-trapping antioxidants reported to date. Unfortunately, introduction of nitrogen in the phenolic ring leads to a concomitant increase in the acidity of the O-H bond, leading to stronger interactions with H-bond accepting solvents. This interaction reduces the efficacy of these compounds as antioxidants in polar and heterogeneous media. Herein we describe our efforts to minimize the effect of this interaction, thereby maintaining the strong antioxidant activities of 3-pyridinols and 5-pyrimidinols, by introducing two tert-butyl moieties flanking the reactive hydroxyl group.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the experiences and interpretations of place of immigrant women in Kingston and Peterborough, Ontario. Immigrant women in smaller Canadian cities contend with a varied and unique set of circumstances that are specific to their geographic positioning. Kingston and Peterborough, with populations of under 150,000 residents, are cities with particular racial discourses. Racialized discourses in Kingston and Peterborough identify each of these places as white cities. As a result, racialized inhabitants who reside in these cities are subsequently rendered invisible or out of place. Participants of my research, most of whom are racialized visible minorities, have all had to contend with oppressive effects of negotiating a white, and oftentimes unwelcoming landscape. &#xd;
There are three main objectives to my research. First, my desire was to learn about immigrant women’s lived realities and to better understand how the experience of migration and racialization had affected their lives. Second, I wanted to facilitate opportunities for women to share their stories with each other in the hopes of perhaps creating the types of learning experiences that would empower participants. Facilitating social interactions in which women could voice their experiences and share their emotional geographies became the most meaningful aspect of this research project at the level of the individual. Finally, I wanted our collaborative research experience to reach the wider public with the intention of creating transformative social change. The voices of immigrant women in smaller cities are often ignored or overlooked, and this gap in knowledge, I believed, was in need of exploring. Previous studies with immigrant women have focused primarily on immigrant women who live in larger Canadian cities. Little research has been directed at smaller cities such as Kingston and Peterborough and my thesis seeks to begin to remedy this oversight.</description>

   <description>Traditional models of professional development for teachers are often characterized by formats intended to transmit information for transfer to classroom practice. But it can be argued that one-size-fits-all models do not adequately meet the professional needs of teachers or respect the view of teachers as learners (Hall &amp; Loucks, 1978; Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 1999). More recently, school districts have explored job-embedded approaches to professional development. However, little or no program evaluation has been utilized to gather evidence of their value to practitioners (Guskey, 2000).  &#xd;
This study examined the perceived transformative value of an alternate professional development (PD) experience on teacher practice. The study aimed to:&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Describe teachers' conceptualizations of "teacher practice".&#xd;
2. Describe the ways teachers perceive their professional development experiences as having impacted their teaching practice.&#xd;
3. Report teachers' perceptions of effective and ineffective professional development.&#xd;
4. Identify institutional practices that influence teachers' perceptions of meaningful professional development.&#xd;
5. Describe the intrinsic and extrinsic factors valued by teachers in a professional development experience.&#xd;
Qualitative research methodology was utilized for this case study. I invited participants from the District Literacy Committee (DLC) to participate in this research, and conducted a cross-case analysis to analyze the experiences of Practicing Teachers (PTs) and Observing Teachers (OTs). My data collection included web-based surveys, artifacts, and two focus group discussions. Results indicated a strong perception that the job-embedded lesson study model had significant impact on teaching practice. My analysis of the data analysis elicited many similarities and some key differences between the two groups. While the OT and PT were similar in their conceptions of effective and ineffective PD, they differed in their conception of teacher practice and what they valued in a PD experience. Both groups believed PD had tremendous potential to impact teaching behaviours. The findings suggest that differentiated learning opportunities are necessary to meet the needs of teachers, and that alternative models of PD such as lesson study deserve consideration. This study has significant implications for those who facilitate PD and those who develop it.</description>

   <description>Both Hilary Bok, in “Freedom and Practical Reason,” and Robert Kane, in “Responsibility, Luck, and Chance:  Reflections on Free Will and Indeterminism,” make at least implicit use of process-based accounts of deliberation to establish their positions.  But Bok is a compatibilist while Kane is a libertarian—the usefulness of the notion of process to opposing sides of the contemporary free will debate suggests that it might be this notion that is doing the work for Bok and Kane rather than elements specific to their separate doctrines.  At the very least it suggests that an exploration of process will offer a better understanding of the interplay between compatibilism and libertarianism in the free will debate.&#xd;
In this thesis, I discuss the process-based accounts of John Dewey and A. N. Whitehead—primarily from Dewey’s Human Nature and Conduct and Whitehead’s Process and Reality—in an effort to bring out features of such accounts that are relevant to the issues of free will and human action.  Following focused discussions of Dewey and Whitehead I explore how their specific accounts bear upon the positions of Bok and Kane in their aforementioned articles, and conclude that Dewey and Whitehead would reject both the compatibilist and libertarian positions, taking up something of a middle ground between the two views.  I then end the thesis by exploring how a more general process account of human action bears upon Bok and Kane, concluding that it is possible to reconcile their views with such a general account with only some reinterpretation and restriction of their positions.  In general, I conclude that process-based accounts of human action favour neither compatibilist nor libertarian positions, but rather a mixture or middle ground between the two.</description>

   <description>Relay terminals are often used in tandem in sensor networks to lessen nodal communication burden. In this light we investigate the problem of power allocation amongst nodes in a relay network in order to maximize the overall achievable rate using link adaptive transmission protocols. We focus on the physical layer characteristics and implementation issues of link adaptation in order to develop a bit-level simulator needed to accurately model the rate performance of such a system. &#xd;
&#xd;
Optimal power allocation values, power adaptation policies, and switching levels for several link adaptive policies over a broad class of Rician fading channels are calculated. &#xd;
&#xd;
Furthermore, the maximum achievable rate for two and three link relay networks using our bit-level simulator and optimal power allocation values for collocated channel distributions is simulated. An overall achievable rate comparison between several link adaptive protocols is also investigated.</description>

   <description>During mammalian fertilization, the exposure of the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) after acrosomal exocytosis is essential for the secondary binding between sperm and zona pellucida (ZP) of the oocyte, a prerequisite for sperm penetration through the ZP. The identification of the sperm protein(s) responsible for secondary binding has posed a challenge for researchers. We were able to isolate a sperm head fraction in which the IAM was exposed. Attached to the IAM was an electon dense layer, which we termed the IAM extracellular coat (IAMC). The IAMC was also observable in acrosome reacted sperm. High salt extraction removed the IAMC including a prominent 38 kDa polypeptide, referred to as IAM38. Antibodies raised against IAM38 confirmed its presence in the IAMC of intact, sonicated, and acrosome-reacted sperm. Sequencing of IAM38 revealed it as the ortholog of porcine SP38, a protein that was found to bind specifically to ZP2 but whose intra-acrosomal location was not known. We showed that IAM38 occupied the leading edge of sperm contact with the zona pellucida during fertilization, and that secondary binding and fertilization were inhibited in vitro by antibodies directed against IAM38. As for the mechanism of secondary sperm-zona binding by IAM38, we provided evidence that the synthetic peptide derived from the ZP2-binding motif of IAM38 had a competitive inhibitory effect on both sperm-zona binding and fertilization while its mutant form was ineffective. In summary, our study provides a novel approach to obtain direct information on the peripheral and integral protein composition of the IAM and consolidates IAM38 as a genuine secondary sperm-zona binding protein. In addition, our investigation also provides an ultrastructural description of the origin, expression and assembly of IAM38 during spermatogenesis. It shows that IAM38 is originally secreted by the Golgi apparatus as part of the dense contents of the proacrosomic granules but later, during acrosome capping phase of spermiogenesis, is redistributed to the inner periphery of the acrosomal membrane. This relocation occurs at the time of acrosomal compaction, an obligatory structural change that fails to occur in Zpbp1-/- knockout mice, which do not express IAM38 and are infertile.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I present an excitonic approach to treating the coherent dynamics of optically generated charge carriers in semiconductor nanostructures. The main feature of this approach is that it includes exchange interactions and phase space filling effects, which have generally been omitted in previous excitonic treatments of coherent dynamics, so that it can go beyond the low excitation limit.  In contrast to the well-known semiconductor Bloch equations, this approach treats intraband correlations without factorization.  The excitonic formalism and the obtained excitonic equations are shown to be particularly advantageous in systems where bound excitons dominate the optical response and where intraband correlations play a central role. &#xd;
&#xd;
To demonstrate the application of the excitonic approach, we simulate the coherent carrier dynamics of an optically-excited, updoped AlGaAs superlattice in the presence of a terahertz pulse, where 1s excitonic states as well as higher in-plane excited states are included. We find that gain coefficients greater than 20/cm can be achieved over a tuning range of 3-11THz and that due to the coherent cascading of the carriers down the excitonic Wannier-Stark ladder, the gain coefficients have much higher gain saturation fields than comparable two-level  systems.&#xd;
&#xd;
To investigate the effects of phase space filling and exchange interaction on exciton dynamics, we then apply the excitonic formalism to a simple model of a quantum ring as well as a realistic model of a quantum well. For the quantum ring, we have obtained numerical results regarding exciton population and interband polarization. We also compared our excitonic approach to the semiconductor Bloch equations in detail using this simple model. For the quantum well, in addition to the investigation of exciton dynamics, we propose and examine several approximations that can make our excitonic dynamic equations very efficient. &#xd;
&#xd;
The excitonic formalism presented in this thesis is an efficient approach that can be applied in a wide range of systems, which makes it a potential alternative to the standard  miconductor Bloch equations for many systems where the intraband correlations are crucial.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, History) -- Queen's University, 2008-11-28 10:48:28.537</description>
   <description>Scholars describe fin-de-siècle Paris as a city of dualities, and examine its past as a series of crises or a tale of burgeoning optimism and opportunity.  Historians of women and gender have noted the limitations of this dualistic approach, and have explored new avenues of interpretation.  Specifically, they have shown how the combination of positive and negative impulses created a dynamic space in which women could re-imagine and re-articulate themselves.  While this approach illuminates the possibilities that existed for women in a complex urban landscape, it also indicates that fin-de-siècle Paris was a contested city, one fraught with challenges for women living in the French capital.  If the mingling of crises and belle époque culture had stimulating results for women’s emergence into urban spaces, it had confusing and conflicting effects as well. &#xd;
&#xd;
My thesis shows how fin-de-siècle Paris was a contradictory city for women artists, at a time when both opportunities and constraints in their profession were at a premium.  I examine the ways in which several notable women in the arts – painters Gwen John, Suzanne Valadon, and Romaine Brooks, sculptor Camille Claudel, and writer Rachilde – traversed this unsettling path, and evaluated their experiences through artistic representations of private life.  Far from portraying the traditional sphere of domesticity, however, which was considered an important form of artistic expression among women at this time, I argue that their depictions of intimate spaces, bodies, children, and female selfhood, were complex and often ambiguous, and part of a larger attempt to grapple with the shifting nature of identity, both as women, and as professionals.  John and Claudel created interiors that were signs of independence and artistic innovation, but also reflections of hardship; Valadon and Brooks invested images of the female and child’s body with strength and power, but also with pain and suffering; and Rachilde developed heroines who were unsuccessful in their attempts to create a unique sense of self.  Taken together, these representations demonstrate that women artists did not easily articulate a vision of modern female identity at the turn of twentieth century, but rather, highlighted the inconsistencies of this experience.</description>

   <description>The problem of finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane is one of the fundamental and well-studied problems in Computational Geometry. However, for a set of imprecise points, the convex hull problem has not been thoroughly investigated. By imprecise points, we refer to a region in the plane inside which one point may lie. We are particularly interested in finding a minimum perimeter convex hull of a set of imprecise points, where the imprecise points are modelled as line segments. Currently, the best known algorithm that solves the minimum perimeter convex hull problem has an exponential running time in the worst case. It is still unknown whether this problem is NP-hard. We explore several approximation algorithms for this problem. Finally we propose a constant factor approximation algorithm that runs in O(nlogn) time.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-01 14:58:51.95</description>
   <description>This dissertation looks at the challenges that deliberative democratic theory encounters when it tries to offer a rich account of inclusion yet refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of external protest.  While sympathetic to deliberative democracy’s goals, I challenge this focus upon the deliberative group as the theory tries to satisfy requirements of inclusion and legitimacy.  In response I offer a normative account of protest within a larger deliberative framework – one that offers a more comprehensive account of democratic inclusion.  I look at critiques of deliberative democracy, particularly in terms of the theory’s ability to account for pluralism, and I argue that in order to meet this challenge we need to offer a normative justification of protest.  Moreover, we need to do this not only to achieve full and effective inclusion but also to deal with the lack of efficacy that marginalized deliberants may encounter even when requirements of formal and effective inclusion are met. &#xd;
As I address these challenges I offer a theory of protest-as-deliberation in which I develop a normative justification of protest and set out the conceptual changes that allow this justification to be normatively and practically viable.  My account takes protest, as something outside of and in opposition to the deliberative group, seriously and extends the deliberative framework to include protest; importantly, it does this without co-opting protestors.  Drawing from previous critiques, I develop the normative and practical links that are necessary in order to facilitate a deliberative dialogue between protestors and the deliberative group.  The conceptual changes that are necessary in order to realize protest-as-deliberation require that we re-evaluate the impact that deliberative criteria of reason-giving has upon effective inclusion and people’s efficacy and that we change these criteria accordingly.  Additionally, we need to revisit the democratic capacity of the public sphere, reconceptualized as the deliberative polity in which the process of protest-as-deliberation takes place.  When we do this we ought to place a greater emphasis upon available public spaces, both physical and conceptual, that deliberants and protestors need in order for effective deliberation and contestation to occur.</description>

   <description>Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars are the pre-main sequence progenitors of main sequence A and B stars, and are characterized observationally by strong emission in spectral lines and significant infra-red excess that results from their presence in dust-obscured regions. These stars are usually surrounded by a complex environment composed of gas and dust and often a significant stellar wind and a circumstellar disc. This complex circumstellar environment can have a significant affect on their spectral energy distributions, leading to large systematic uncertainties in determinations of their effective temperatures from photometric methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
In an attempt to improve temperature determinations for HAeBe stars, we have conducted an experiment to evaluate the potential of high-resolution spectra to constrain their atmospheric parameters. To this end, high-resolution (R~68 000) and low-resolution (R~1500) spectra obtained using the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter (at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope) and the FORS1 spectropolarimeter (at the Very Large Telescope) have been used with an automatic spectrum fitting procedure. This procedure compares spectroscopic data to a grid of synthetic LTE, solar abundance spectra, spanning a range in effective temperature, surface gravity, and micro-turbulence.&#xd;
&#xd;
This analysis was applied to the spectra of a sample of twelve previously well-studied HAeBe stars. Our temperatures were found to be consistent with previously published values, while providing much lower uncertainties - in some cases about 5 times smaller. Numerous methods were investigated to obtain these quantitative uncertainties (chi-squared statistics, Bayesian analysis, Monte Carlo bootstrap method, individual temperature sensitive line region analysis). We conclude that our method can be used to efficiently and effectively obtain temperatures of HAeBe stars in addition to providing us with a characterization of the degree of departure of the spectrum from solar abundance, LTE photospheric models.</description>

   <description>This study describes the experiences of belonging of three Grade 6 students with mild disabilities, Jacob, Leah, and Andy, educated in an inclusive classroom. In addition, I gained the perspective of the classroom teacher, Linda, who described her approaches to facilitating belonging in an inclusive environment. Data collection included field observations and interviews with the classroom teacher and with the three focal participants. After completing data collection, analysis of the classroom data and the data of the three individual students was conducted using standard methods of qualitative analysis. Themes that emerged from the classroom data included: developing a trust culture, developing trusting relationships, teaching pro-social behaviours, building competence, and fostering autonomy. The classroom teacher fostered a supportive community environment that encouraged the development of interpersonal relationships, and she actively supported the social-emotional needs and the academic needs of all her students. &#xd;
Each student participant presented a unique case; therefore, the themes for the three student participants varied. Common themes included: sense of belonging, interpersonal relationships, and peer victimization. Themes that varied were sense of academic and social competence and fostering autonomy. For each individual student, belonging was fostered slightly differently and yet to fill this need, relatedness with others and a sense of academic or social competence was necessary. This study emphasizes that a sense of belonging is complex and multidimensional.</description>

   <description>Natural Fibre Composites (NFCs) offer new opportunities to mitigate negative impact of engineering activities on the environment. Due to their lost cost, light weight and environmental benefits, they find applications in building, furniture and automotive industry. This study seeks to improve mechanical properties of composites made from waste recyclable plastics and natural fibres from agricultural byproduct sources such as Agave americana leaves, corn, wheat and seed flax straws. The approach used is a holistic one which includes investigating the availability and properties of natural fibres and their composites with waste plastic for use in Canada and Lesotho, a small country in Southern Africa. The social and environmental implications of using these materials are also investigated.&#xd;
&#xd;
In both Lesotho and Canada, there are enough raw materials which can be used in NFCs if the necessary environment is developed. The unique microstructural and interfacial behaviour of Agave americana fibres were investigated and their possible impact on the composites forecasted. Composites made with a variety of underutilized natural fibres: Agave americana, corn, seed flax and wheat were also manufactured and tested. The addition of natural fibres and milled straw to the waste plastic improved mainly the tensile and flexural moduli of the composites. The environmental properties of NFCs were also analyzed through a case study using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as tool. The results suggest that NFCs could be seen as a more environmentally friendly alternative than conventional composites.</description>

   <description>Tagging is widely adopted in so-called "collaborative-tagging" systems which are one&#xd;
of the Web 2.0 applications that have achieved lots of attention lately. They provide&#xd;
services for users to store, manage and search web resources with the help of freely&#xd;
chosen keywords, called "tags". Because of the high-volume usage of these systems&#xd;
and the annotations that users provide by their tags, these systems are regarded as&#xd;
good targets for disciplines like knowledge discovery. Roughly, two lines of research&#xd;
have been pursued so far on collaborative tagging: to study the structure of tags and&#xd;
to study their functionality in web search. In this research we investigated tagging&#xd;
structures in a popular collaborative-tagging system, called del.icio.us, by focusing on&#xd;
the relations of "tags", "users" and "web resources", three main components of any&#xd;
collaborative-tagging system. Particularly we are interested in finding whether there&#xd;
are social structures that could be used to increase the usability of these systems&#xd;
for content retrieval and navigation. Our results show that people mainly use tags&#xd;
for their own informational needs which are personal rather than social. Any social&#xd;
structure or communities around tags and users is rare and weak which suggests that&#xd;
collaborative tagging has not added much to personal bookmarking. However, we&#xd;
show some regularities in tagging behavior that could be utilized for user experience&#xd;
improvement.</description>

   <description>A detailed investigation of Zr-polymeryl intermediates, present during ethylene and propylene polymerization by metallocene and non-metallocene catalysts, is presented. In this regard, the potential use of bromine as a quenching agent to give polymers with brominated end groups is investigated. Using NMR spectroscopy, these groups can be identified as primary or secondary and quantified, thus providing information on the nature of the Zr-polymeryl linkage(s) and their relative concentration(s). Bromine quenching was examined for ethylene polymerization by Cp2ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3, and for propylene polymerization by Cp2ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3, (indenyl)2ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3, and rac-{C2H4(1-indenyl)2}ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3. Polymers with primary alkyl bromide end groups were obtained. In the case of propylene polymerization by [ONNO]Zr(CH2C6H5)2/MAO/2,6-di-tbutylphenol, both primary and secondary alkyl bromide end groups were detected. Primary alkyl bromide end groups result from the cleavage by bromine of primary Zr-CH2~polymeryl linkages while secondary alkyl bromides are the result of the cleavage by bromine of secondary Zr-CH(Me)CH2~polymeryl linkages. The concentration of Zr-CH2~polymeryl intermediates was found to be low, suggesting that the catalyst deactivates during the polymerization. &#xd;
A second objective of this research is to investigate the formation of Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes as these species are proposed to arise during the polymerization and deactivate the catalyst. Compounds of type [Cp2ZrMe]+ were found to react with vinylidene compounds of type CH2=C(Me)R, (R = CH2CHMe2 and CH2CH(Me)C3H7), to form methane and Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes. The reaction of Cp2ZrMe2/[Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] with CH2=C(Me)CH2CHMe2 involves the unprecedented [Cp2Zr(Me)(CH2CMeCH2CHMe2)]+ intermediate, detected by low temperature one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The observation of this intermediate represents the first direct experimental evidence for a d0 metal-alkyl-olefin complex. The dynamic behavior and the kinetics of formation of Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes were also investigated by NMR spectroscopy. In situ propylene polymerization studies indicate that Cp2Zr+-allyl polymeryl intermediates form under catalytic conditions when either Cp2ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3 or Cp2ZrMe2/[Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] are used. Formation of Zr-allyl species occurs in the early stages of the polymerization process, even before the [Cp2ZrMe]+ catalyst is completely consumed, by recoordination of the polypropylene-containing vinylidene end groups, which are the normal products of chain transfer reactions via -H elimination, to the active catalyst.</description>

   <description>The public relations practices of the government of Alberta have elicited substantial controversy, particularly under the administration of Premier Klein.  However existing analyses have been insufficiently comparative.  This dissertation is a within-case comparison of the evolution of government public relations practices under the three Progressive Conservative administrations of Premiers Lougheed, Getty and Klein.  The theoretical framework rejects democratic justifications for government public relations, but accepts an “administrative imperative” that recognizes the use of government public relations techniques to accomplish particular policy goals.  At the same time, it recognizes that these practices are often linked to important transformations in the broader political economy.  A model of incentives and opportunities of why politicians use public relations strategies to accomplish their goals is introduced to examine the particular evolution in the Alberta case.  Premier Lougheed’s administration created a new public relations agency dedicated to improving the administrative efficiency of the government’s public relations function.  It was marked by restrained forms of government advertising and a documented commitment to a distinct space for government public relations, insulated from the political demands of the elected level of government.  Periodic television appearances by the premier appear to be the most aggressive forms of public relations activities.  Premier Getty adopted this model, despite a substantially transformed political environment and despite documented advice to change his government’s practices.  Premier Klein recognized this transformed political landscape and substantially reformed government public relations, increasing public opinion research, adopting manipulative and aggressive news management tactics, politicizing and centralizing the public relations staff and integrating the entire range of public relations techniques into regular politically contentious advertising campaigns. These reforms help to explain some of Premier Klein’s political and policy successes.  The dissertation concludes with some of the deleterious consequences of extensive public relations practices by governments in Canada and some recommendations as to how to mitigate against those consequences.</description>

   <description>Background:  It has been reported that the ratio of limb fat to trunk fat (LF/TF) is associated with markers of cardiometabolic risk in elderly men and women.  However, it is unknown if LF/TF is associated with cardiometabolic risk beyond that explained by LF and TF independently.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Objective:  To determine if LF/TF is associated with markers of cardiometabolic risk in elderly men and women after control for LF and TF.  A secondary objective was to examine the independent associations of LF and TF with markers of cardiometabolic risk.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods:  Subjects included abdominally obese men (n=58) and women (n=78) between 60 and 80 years of age.  Regional adiposity was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging.  Insulin resistance, fasting glucose, HDL-cholesterol, plasma triglycerides and adiponectin were determined.  Regression analyses and partial correlations were used to assess the independent associations between variables.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results:  After control for potential confounders, TF was positively associated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance and plasma triglycerides, and negatively associated with HDL-cholesterol (p&lt;0.05).  These associations were strengthened after further control for LF (p&lt;0.05).  LF was not associated with any marker of cardiometabolic risk after control for potential confounders (p>0.05).  However, after further control for TF, LF was positively associated with HDL-cholesterol and negatively associated with plasma triglycerides (p&lt;0.05).  Plasma adiponectin was independently associated with both LF and TF in elderly women (p&lt;0.05) but was not independently associated with either depot in elderly men (p>0.05).  LF/TF was not associated with any marker of cardiometabolic risk after control for LF and TF.&#xd;
  &#xd;
Conclusions:  These results suggest that it is the absolute, rather than relative amounts of LF and TF which have the greatest influence on cardiometabolic risk in elderly men and women.  Further, these results suggest that the associations between plasma adiponectin and regional adiposity are significantly influenced by sex in elderly men and women.</description>

   <description>Enormous efforts have been made to optimize the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, but there is to date no generally useful protocol and forcing conditions are often required. One reaction variable that has often been neglected is the extent to which the supposed catalysts, bisphosphinepalladium(0) complexes, are actually formed from the variety of popular precatalysts used.  There is in fact little evidence that these precursors produce bis-ligated Pd(0) complexes and it is possible that the rate limiting factor may be catalyst formation. If so, then the development of an optimized method for forming these catalytic species would be a significant contribution to this field.  The following work describes research efforts to determine the optimum conditions to generate PdL2 (L = PCy3, PMeBut2, PBut3) cleanly and quantitatively from Pd(3-C3H5)(5-C5H5) and Pd(3-1-Ph-C3H5)(5-C5H5). &#xd;
Furthermore, the conditions under which PdL3 species may exist in equilibrium with the PdL2 species are defined.  NMR studies indicate that while Pd(PBut3)2 shows no inclination to increase its coordination number, Pd(PCy3)2 and Pd(PMeBut2)2 react with added phosphine to form 3:1 compounds. Equilibrium constants for dissociation of the PdL3 compounds were measured over a range of temperatures, yielding the thermodynamic parameters of dissociation and estimated Pd-P bond dissociation energies.  Additionally, the generation of heteroleptic species serve to confirm the existence of 3:1 compounds.&#xd;
A kinetic study of the oxidative addition of PhBr to Pd(PCy3)2 was also performed.  It was found that oxidative addition was first order in palladium, but that added bromide had no effect on the rate of oxidative addition.  Added PCy3 inhibited oxidative addition, possibly due to the conversion of palladium(0) into the less active 3:1 compound.  &#xd;
The formation of the catalytically less active 3:1 compounds has serious implications for many catalytic cross-coupling processes which involve catalyst formation via the slow reduction of palladium(II) in the presence of excess phosphine; for many systems, relatively little of the added palladium may actually be present as the active bisphosphinepalladium(0) compound.</description>

   <description>Linear programming (LP) decoding of low-density parity-check codes was introduced by Feldman et al. in [1]. In his formulation it is assumed that communication takes place over a memoryless channel and that the source is uniform.  Here, we extend the LP decoding paradigm by studying its application to scenarios with source non-uniformity and to decoding over channels with memory. We develop two decoders for the scenario of non-uniform memoryless sources transmitted over memoryless channels. The first decoder uses a modified linear cost function which incorporates the a-priori source information and works with systematic codes. The second decoder differs by using non-systematic codes obtained by puncturing lower rate systematic codes and using an “extended decoding polytope.” Simulations show that the modified decoders yield gains over the standard LP decoder. Next, LP decoding is considered for two channels with memory: the binary additive Markov noise channel and the infinite-memory non-ergodic Polya-contagion channel. For the Markov channel, no linear cost function corresponding to maximum likelihood (ML) decoding could be obtained and hence it is unclear how to proceed. For the Polya channel, two LP-based decoders are developed. The first is derived in a straightforward manner from the ML decoding rule of [2]. The second decoder relies on a simplification of the same ML decoding rule which holds for codes containing the all-ones codeword. Simulations are performed for both decoders with regular and irregular LDPC codes and demonstrate relatively good performance with respect to the channel epsilon-capacity.</description>

   <description>Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is an integral membrane protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily that utilizes ATP binding and hydrolysis to transport various endogenous substrates and/or xenobiotics across membranes against a concentration gradient.  The overall goal of my research was to examine the nucleotide and protein interactions of MRP1 using various biochemical methods.  In the first study,  Cu2+(Ph)3 which promotes cross-linking of two nearby Cys residues and limited proteolysis were used to study conformational changes of MRP1 at different stages of ATP binding and hydrolysis at the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs).  The limited trypsin digestion patterns indicated that some Cys residues of MRP1 could be cross-linked in the nucleotide-free state and that the Cys cross-linked MRP1 was more susceptible to trypsinolysis.  Furthermore, binding of ATP, AMP-PNP, and trapping of ADP by MRP1 prevented the cross-linking events from occurring, but binding of ATPγS did not.  However, the ATPγS-bound MRP1, like nucleotide-free MRP1, showed enhanced sensitivity towards trypsinolysis.  These studies show that the two ATP analogs, AMP-PNP and ATPγS, interact with MRP1 in different ways.  In the second study, the interaction of MRP1 with other cellular proteins was examined.  An in vivo chemical cross-linking approach combined with affinity purification and MS analysis was initially used to identify protein partners directly interacting with MRP1.  When this approach proved unsuccessful, a second approach involving immunoaffinity purification of MRP1-containing complexes followed by MS analysis was adopted.  Six potential candidate interacting protein partners of MRP1 were identified via this approach and two of them, FUS and drebrin, were further characterized by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments.  FUS seems unlikely to be an important binding partner of MRP1 since confocal and subcellular fractionation studies showed it to be exclusively localized in the nucleus.  On the other hand, drebrin depletion by siRNA knock-down resulted in a moderate decrease in MRP1 overall expression levels although the membrane localization of MRP1 remained unchanged.</description>

   <description>The energy security and climate change risks of fossil fuel consumption have stimulated interest in developing renewable energy sources. Canada’s vast biomass potential is an attractive local resource but high transportation costs are a barrier to implementation. This study assesses how transformative systems can enable large-scale bioenergy production through integration with existing transportation corridors and fossil fuel infrastructure. Potential bioenergy corridors include the network of natural gas pipelines and the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway (GLSLS).&#xd;
Sustainable lignocellulosic biomass production integrated with traditional food and fibre production was assumed to occur on 196 Mha of land within 100 km of pipelines. Conservative (81 Mt of dry biomass per year) and aggressive (209 Mt) scenarios were investigated for converting biomass to synthetic natural gas (SNG) via gasification, methanation, and upgrading, yielding enough pipeline-quality gas to meet 20% to 60% of Canada’s current needs. A systems analysis approach was used to calculate bioSNG life-cycle emissions of 15 to 18 kgCO2e GJ-1, compared to 68 or 87 for conventional or liquefied natural gas, respectively. Production costs ranged from $16 to $20 GJ-1, which were high compared to regional gas prices ($5 to $10 GJ-1).&#xd;
The biomass potential on 125 Mha of land area within 100 km of the Canadian portion of the GLSLS and railway lines ranged from 36 to 80 Mt(dry) per year, which was enough to displace coal-fired power in Ontario plus produce 1.6 to 11 billion L of green diesel that could offset 14% to 96% of fossil diesel in GLSLS provinces. Life-cycle emissions ranged from 110 to 130 gCO2e kWh-1 for biopower (compared to 1030 for coal) and 20 to 22 kgCO2e GJ-1 for green diesel (compared to 84 for conventional diesel). Cost estimates ranged from $130 MWh-1 for biopower (compared to an average market power price of $54 MWh-1) and $28 to $36 GJ-1 for green diesel (compared to $16 to $24 GJ-1 for diesel). The auxiliary benefits (energy security, climate change, air quality, and rural development) were seen as justification for supportive bioenergy policies.</description>

   <description>This research examines the process by which rights to public resources, including public land, were negotiated during the Olympic bidding process in one modern western city. Toronto’s 2008 Olympic bid involved not only the framing of an important public symbol but also the shaping of symbolically significant space, the city’s waterfront. Toronto’s waterfront has always reflected a negotiation between large institutional interests and the voice of the local citizenry. The nature of this space and the implied right of the public to define and use this space has made the representation of urban public interest a matter of crucial significance. To examine the relationships between sport, space and symbols during the bidding process for the Olympic Games is to expose an ongoing ideological battle over the ownership of public land. When the development of a particular parcel of public land is said to be in the public interest, it suggests that city residents from a wide variety of publics have collaborated and developed a shared and agreed upon position about how that development should proceed. The process of adjudication that serves to legitimate the production of space and symbols is important because it has crucial implications for the production of urban order. This research demonstrates that the Olympic bidding process can be understood as a moment that fosters an articulation of social and cultural claims, that offers an opportunity for masses of citizens to mobilize, and that facilitates visions of progress. On the other hand, it can also be the occasion for the defeat of public interest.</description>

   <description>Studies described in this thesis were aimed at characterizing the mechanism(s) of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) pulmonary carcinogenesis by addressing the formation, prevention, and repair of AFB1-induced oxidative DNA damage.&#xd;
	The ability of AFB1 to cause oxidative DNA damage in different lung cell types of the A/J mouse was examined.  The formation of 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in freshly isolated mouse lung alveolar macrophages, alveolar type II cells, and nonciliated bronchial epithelial (Clara) cells, was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.  An increase in 8-OHdG formation occurred in macrophage and Clara cell preparations isolated from A/J mice two hours following in vivo treatment with a single tumourigenic dose of AFB1.  Prior treatment with polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase (PEG-CAT) prevented the AFB1-induced increase in 8-OHdG levels in all mouse lung cell preparations.  These results support the possibility that oxidative DNA damage in mouse lung cells contributes to AFB1 carcinogenicity.&#xd;
	Mouse lung tumourigenesis was assessed following treatment of A/J mice with PEG-CAT and/or AFB1.  Unexpectedly, the mean number of tumours per mouse and tumour size in the PEG-CAT + AFB1 group were greater than those of the group treated with AFB1 alone.  There was no difference in K-ras exon 1 mutation spectrum or in the histological diagnosis of tumours between treatment groups.  In vitro incubation with mouse liver catalase (CAT) resulted in conversion of [3H]AFB1 into a DNA-binding species, a possible explanation for the results observed in vivo.  These results demonstrate that PEG-CAT is not protective against AFB1 carcinogenicity in mouse lung despite preventing DNA oxidation.&#xd;
	The effect of in vivo treatment of mice with AFB1 on pulmonary and hepatic base excision repair (BER) activities and levels of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) was investigated.  AFB1 treatment increased 8-OHdG levels and BER activity in mouse lung, but did not significantly affect either in liver.  Levels of OGG1 immunoreactive protein were increased in both mouse lung and liver.  These results indicate that oxidative DNA damage may be an important mechanism in the carcinogenicity of AFB1.  However, BER activity is increased by AFB1 treatment, possibly representing a compensatory response to the production of oxidative DNA damage.</description>

   <description>Transient replication assays have identified a late expression factor 3, LEF-3, to be essential for DNA replication and late gene expression in the baculovirus species, AcMNPV. Although its specific role in these two processes has not been determined, this single-stranded DNA binding protein is multi-functional. LEF-3 forms a homo-oligomer, binds single-stranded DNA, interacts with components of the viral replication complex and is required to transport the helicase protein P143 into the nucleus of infected cells. Various regions within LEF-3 were deleted to determine the domain essential to its function and the N-terminal amino acids 1-125 were found to be sufficient for late gene expression. This N-terminal region includes the 56 amino acid region of LEF-3 required for nuclear transport. In order to define this domain, the effect of site-specific mutagenesis of LEF-3 on its intracellular distribution was determined. Fluorescence microscopy of expression plasmid transfected cells demonstrated that amino acids 14 to 37 formed the core nuclear localization signal (NLS), but the flanking amino acids may act as regulatory elements. Comparison with other group 1 Alphabaculoviruses suggested that this core region contained a functionally duplicated NLS. The AcMNPV LEF-3 also functioned in mammalian cells indicating that the protein nuclear import systems in insect and mammalian cells are conserved. Mutagenesis of two conserved cysteine residues located at amino acids 82 and 106 were not essential for nuclear localization or for interaction with P143. However, by using a modified construct of P143 that localized on its own to the nucleus, it was demonstrated that a functional nuclear localization domain on LEF-3 was required for an interaction between LEF-3 and P143.</description>

   <description>There is currently a dearth of information suitable for the development of evidence-based physical activity and screen time guidelines for children and youth.  The overarching purpose of this thesis was to generate findings that could be used to inform public health recommendations for physical activity and screen time.  A series of six manuscripts were completed to explore the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and health in youth.&#xd;
The first manuscript examined the dose-response relation between objectively measured total and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with blood pressure and hypertension.  Participating in 30 and 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day decreased the odds of hypertension in youth by 50% and 63%, respectively. &#xd;
The second manuscript explored the influence of intensity of physical activity and incidental movement on total and trunk adiposity.  Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was found to predict total and trunk adiposity beyond other intensities and incidental movement.&#xd;
The third manuscript sought to determine whether or not physical activity accrued in bouts was more beneficial than total physical activity with relation to being overweight.  The inclusion of short and medium-to-long bouts of physical activity decreased the odds of overweight above and beyond total physical activity level. &#xd;
The fourth manuscript included a detailed examination of the relation between physical activity and screen time by considering different forms of physical activity, different physical activity environments, and various screen time behaviours.  By and large, physical activity and screen time were not related.&#xd;
The fifth manuscript determined the proportion of Canadian youth meeting screen time guidelines.  Only 18% of girls and 14% of boys in grades 6 to 10 met screen time guidelines of no more than 2 hours per day.&#xd;
The final manuscript examined the relationship between screen time and metabolic syndrome.  A dose-response relation was observed between screen time and metabolic syndrome independent of physical activity level.&#xd;
It is hoped that the findings from this thesis will provide useful information that will be considered in developing and modifying physical activity and screen time recommendations for the paediatric population.</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects Aboriginal peoples in Canada.  Supportive care, comprised of services, resources or support designed to improve the quality of life for persons with diabetes is an important part of the diabetes management system.  Diabetes Education Centres (DECs) provide support and education to patients diagnosed with diabetes. There is currently no comprehensive description of diabetes supportive care programs available to Aboriginal populations through DECs, nor is there information about the cultural relevance of such programs.&#xd;
PURPOSE: To document and describe the nature, scope, variation and cultural content in diabetes supportive care services and resources available to Aboriginal persons through Diabetes Education Centres (DECs) in Ontario.  Findings from this project will be used to develop recommendations for government agencies that fund DECs and DEC program managers and employees.&#xd;
METHODS: Diabetes care providers (n=56) identified as serving Aboriginal clients were systematically surveyed by telephone in order to document and describe the nature and variation of diabetes supportive care services available to Aboriginal persons with diabetes.  Quantitative and qualitative questionnaire items were used to examine strategies used to enhance cultural relevance of diabetes programs, services, and resources.  Quantitative results were analyzed in SPSS and Microsoft Excel, while qualitative responses were recorded, transcribed, and imported into NVivo 8 where inductive and deductive content analysis was performed.&#xd;
RESULTS: Findings from the quantitative analyses revealed that the use of cultural strategies varied according to client place of residence and DEC client volume.  Integration of cultural strategies was more common for (a) DECs serving an on-reserve clientele, compared to DECs serving an off-reserve clientele; and (b) DECs serving a higher volume of Aboriginal clients.  Qualitative analyses revealed differences in (a) program delivery methods for Aboriginal clients, and (b) perceived barriers to providing Aboriginal clients with effective diabetes care.&#xd;
CONCLUSION: Now that we know many Ontario DECs are trying to integrate cultural strategies to various degrees, research efforts can attempt to connect culturally relevant diabetes programs to client outcomes. A positive relationship would have important policy and practice implications.</description>

   <description>Wind energy systems are being closely studied because of its benefits as an environmentally friendly and renewable source of energy.  Because of its unpredictable availability, power management concepts are essential to extract as much power as possible from the wind when it becomes available. &#xd;
The purpose of this thesis is to presents a new adaptive control algorithm for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in wind energy systems.  The proposed control algorithm allows the generator to track the optimal operation points of the wind turbine system under fluctuating wind conditions and the tracking process speeds up over time.  This algorithm does not require the knowledge of intangible turbine mechanical characteristics such as its power coefficient curve, power characteristic or torque characteristic.  The algorithm uses its memory feature to adapt to any given wind turbine and to infer the optimum rotor speeds for wind speeds that have not occurred before.  The proposed algorithm uses a modified version of Hill Climb Search (HCS) and intelligent memory to implement its power management scheme. This algorithm is most suitable for smaller grid or battery connected wind energy systems.  PSIM simulation studies have been done to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

   <description>Source transformation systems are special-purpose programming languages, or in some cases suites of languages, that are designed for the analysis and transformation of computer languages. They enable rapid prototyping of programming languages, source code renovation, language-to-language translation, design recovery, and other custom analysis techniques. With the emergence of these systems a serious problem is evident: expressing a parser for common computer languages is sometimes very difficult. Source transformation systems employ generalized parsing algorithms, and while these are well suited for the kind of agile parsing techniques in use by transformation practitioners, they are not well suited for parsing languages that are context-dependent. Traditional deterministic parser generators do not stumble in this area, but they sacrifice the generalized parsing abilities that transformation systems depend on. When it is hard to get the input into the system as a correct and accurate parse tree the utility of the unified transformation environment is degraded and more ad hoc approaches become attractive for processing input.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis is about the design of a new computer language transformation system with a focus on enhancing the parsing system to support generalized context-dependent parsing. We argue for the use of backtracking LR as the generalized parsing algorithm. We present an enhancement to backtracking LR that allows us to control the parsing of an ambiguous grammar by ordering the productions of the grammar definitions. We add a grammar-dependent lexical solution and integrate it with our ordered choice parsing strategy. We design a transformation language that is closer to general-purpose programming languages, yet enables common transformation techniques. We add semantic actions to our backtracking LR parsing engine and encourage the modification of global state in support of context-dependent parsing. We introduce semantic undo actions for reverting changes to global state during backtracking, thereby enabling generalized context-dependent parsing. Finally, we free the user from having to write undo actions by employing automatic reverse execution. The resulting system allows a wider variety of computer languages to be analyzed. By focusing on improving parsing abilities and moving to a transformation language that resembles general-purpose languages, we aim to extend the transformation paradigm to allow greater use by practitioners who face an immediate need to parse, analyze and transform computer languages.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-15 21:08:25.539</description>
   <description>This dissertation seeks to show that the figure of the female letter-writer in English Renaissance literature, rather than reflecting the culture’s desire to contain, undermine, or destroy the notion of women’s textual production, in fact represents the culture’s desire to imagine and see women as writers.  The image of the female letter-writer was sufficiently pervasive both to normalize the idea that real women might properly engage in textual production, and to function as a literary trope which was used to investigate issues beyond gender ideology.  “Author of Prodigies” explores representations of women’s epistolary creation in a broad selection of fictional texts, primarily drama.  Based on these representations, I argue that the figure of the female letter-writer functioned as a means through which the fragile and epistemologically fraught relationship between the subject and the writing in which she engages was explored.  In Chapter One, I focus primarily on the history of early feminist criticism, issues of how letters are related to non-epistolary texts, Renaissance notions of subjectivity and its relationship to gender, and how subjectivity was understood to adhere in epistolary writing.  In Chapter Two, I examine texts in which female characters pen letters in their own blood.  Blood letters figure the fragility, marginality, and vulnerability associated with self revelation in a context in which female subjectivity was not comfortably acknowledged.  Chapter Three features texts that contemplate the fantasy of female characters wooing their beaux by merging epistolary production and metadramatic performances of femininity.  These characters use gendered social constraints to their advantage, revealing themselves to be sufficiently skillful to manipulate social and material signs of their marginalized position in order to achieve their personal desires.  Chapter Four focuses on male fetishization of women’s intellectual labour through letter-writing, and the ways in which women writers anticipate and manipulate this response.  These depictions of women’s mental work are infused with mystery, which is integral to the pleasure of imagining women engaged in letter-writing.  However, as the terms of the fetish are being established in these texts they are also in the process of being normalized.</description>

   <description>The symptoms of adolescent depression are often dismissed as quirks of the age—increased irritability or agitation, lack of concentration, frequent complaints, sleep disturbances, eating disturbances, decrease in grades or missed assignments. The impact of these symptoms reaches deeply into the both the academic and social lives of these adolescents. &#xd;
Exercise is beginning to emerge as a potential alternative to standard drug treatment for depression; however, very little research has been conducted with adolescents. The purpose of this case study is to describe the experiences (thoughts, feelings and actions) of four adolescent males with symptoms of depression from multiple perspectives, while they were participating in a daily aerobic exercise program. &#xd;
Throughout an eight-week program of daily three-on-three basketball scrimmages led by the researcher, four “at risk” boys aged 10-13 were invited to describe their experiences: their thoughts, feelings, attitudes and their beliefs about their social and academic life. Their parents and teachers also shared their perspectives through questionnaires, interviews and informal conversations.  Researcher observations and field notes made by the researcher throughout the school day, in addition to the other data were used in a cross-case analysis to develop an understanding of exercise and its effects on the social, emotional, and academic lives of these boys.</description>

   <description>Experimental studies were undertaken to improve the radiation dose response and ease of manufacture of polymer gel dosimeters that use N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) as the monomer. An alternative carageenan gelling agent was tested in place of gelatin. Although the carageenan did reduce the gelling time for the dosimeter solution, the dose response of the dosimeters was unsatisfactory. An alternative antioxidant system, ascorbic acid and Cu2+, was investigated with the aim of reducing the toxicity of dosimeter materials and providing opportunities for commercial production of prepackaged dosimeter kits. Unfortunately, the new antioxidant was ineffective for the NIPAM-based dosimeters that were studied. Three cosolvents, glycerol, N-propanol and isopropanol, were used to increase the solubility of N,N’-methylene-bisacrylamide (Bis) crosslinker in polymer gel dosimeter recipes that use NIPAM. These cosolvents enabled the manufacture of polymer gel dosimeters with higher levels of dissolved crosslinker than was previously possible. Preliminary results using x-ray computed tomography to read the resulting gels are very promising, due to enhancements in dose sensitivity.  Dosimeters with high N,N’-methylene-bisacrylamide content that used isopropanol or glycerol as cosolvents had good optical clarity prior to irradiation, but did not produce reliable optical CT results for non-uniformly-irradiated gels. Further experiments and recipe optimization are required to determine whether gels with cosolvents and high levels of N,N’-methylene bisacrylamide can be used effectively for verifying spatially non-uniform dose distributions using x-ray computed tomography.&#xd;
A mathematical model that includes inhibition of NIPAM-Bis polymerization was developed and the inhibition effects of MEHQ and oxygen in polymer gel dosimeters were simulated. Kinetic parameters were obtained from the literature and were estimated using experimental data obtained by our research group.  Good agreement was obtained between model predictions and experimental data with and without oxygen contamination. Simulation results indicate that MEHQ has little influence on the duration of the inhibition period and the rate of polymerization when no oxygen contamination is present, so that removal of MEHQ from dosimeter recipes is not required. Effective oxygen removal is very important to achieve reliable dosimeter results.</description>

   <title>Modifying the Three-Phase Synchronous Reference Frame Phase-Locked Loop to Remove Unbalance and Harmonic Errors</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-17 12:38:02.589</description>
   <description>As an increasing number of distributed power generation systems (DPGS) are being connected to the utility grid, there is a growing requirement for the DPGS to be able to ride through short grid disturbances. This requires improvements to be made to the grid-side control scheme of the DPGS. An important part of the grid-side control scheme is the grid synchronization method, which is responsible for tracking the phase angle of the grid voltage vector. The state-of-the-art grid synchronization methods being used today are phase-locked loops. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents a modified phase-locked loop which is more robust towards grid disturbances. It consists of a multi-block adaptive notch filter (ANF) integrated into a conventional three-phase synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL). The addition of the multi-block ANF to the system allows it to become frequency adaptive. Also, since the multi-block ANF consists of multiple ANF blocks in parallel with one another, the system is able to remove multiple input signal distortions. Thus, the proposed system is able to eliminate the double frequency ripple that is caused in the conventional three-phase SRF-PLL by input unbalance, as well as harmonic errors, despite the presence of frequency variations in the input signal.&#xd;
&#xd;
Simulation results found using Matlab/Simulink, and experimental results found using the dSPACE DS1103 DSP board, demonstrate the feasibility of the modified SRF-PLL. Also, the modified SRF-PLL is compared to a conventional three-phase SRF-PLL, as well as to a conventional three-phase SRF-PLL with a simple notch filter, and the advantages of the modified SRF-PLL are discussed.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research was to determine if Chinese- English bicultural individuals show discomfort when conflicting behavioural norms are simultaneously activated. I first identified behaviours that differentiated Canadian and Chinese along a cultural value dimension. Participants then rated four muted video clips of female actors engaged in the&#xd;
behaviours that were either consistent with Chinese or Canadian behavioural norms identified earlier. Within the set four video clips, the language spoken (English versus Chinese) and the topic (representing Canadian values or Chinese values) were crossed, such that each video contained a unique combination of the language and topic. As predicted, when actors spoke Chinese, they were rated more positively for the Chinese&#xd;
value topic than for the Canadian value topic. Additionally, within the Canadian topic, a comparison of the language spoken revealed that actors were rated significantly more positively when they spoke English than when they spoke Chinese. Contrary to&#xd;
predictions, however, European-Canadians in the control condition were better than chance at guessing the language actors spoke. European-Canadians in the experimental condition and Chinese participants in either condition did not perform better than chance&#xd;
levels in the language guessing task. One major weakness of the study was that none of the behaviours thought to reflect Chinese culture were rated significantly differently by Chinese and European-Canadians. For that reason, the results did not completely support the predicted outcomes. Furthermore, European-Canadians’ familiarity with body language associated with speaking English may have accounted for the results of the language guessing task.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-18 12:22:27.663</description>
   <description>Clastic varves and tree-rings offer unique opportunities to decipher various changing paleoclimatic and environmental conditions through the past. The environmental signals they contain can differ greatly from one proxy to the other, but given their common annual resolution, these signals can be isolated, compared and&#xd;
eventually brought together to obtain a clearer picture of local, regional or global environmental changes. This thesis examines three different approaches by which&#xd;
climatic, paleoclimatic and sedimentary time series from northeastern North America can be used as proxies of changing environmental conditions. Using existing and new paleoclimatic records from the eastern Canadian Boreal biome and the Arctic, we show that common variance shared by different independent proxies appears to correspond to an oscillation in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures commonly referred as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and demonstrate that&#xd;
the AMO can be traced back to 1550 in the Canadian Arctic. By comparing historical climate records with an integrated record of North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies, we show, seasonally, the extent of the North Atlantic influence on the eastern and Arctic climate. Our analysis demonstrate the relative importance of the AMO on summer and spring climate in northern Canada as well as its imprint along the St. Lawrence during the winter months. Finally at the local level, using an array of techniques, we investigate the sedimentary history of Temiskaming Lake (Québec/Canada). The recent clastic varve sediments found this lake appear to be the product of three main controls: (1) a significant increase in fluvial input to the lake and accessibility to large supply of fine grained sediments due to historical land use changes; (2) an open, unstable landscape that promotes fluvial erosion and rapid streamflow during snowmelt period; and, (3) highly seasonal river discharge and presence of winter ice cover conditions that ensure the&#xd;
formation of annual structures within the sediments. These conditions have previously not been investigated or reported in the boreal region of North America and these results point to the potential for other recent varve records in areas with suitable lakes and postglacial sediment supplies.</description>

   <description>Face-to-face communication is one of the most natural forms of interaction between humans. Speech perception is an important part of this interaction. While speech could be said to be primarily auditory in nature, visual information can play a significant role in influencing perception. It is not well understood what visual information is important or how that information is collected. Previous studies have documented the preference to gaze at the eyes, nose, and mouth of the talking face, but physical saliency, i.e., the unique low-level features of the stimulus, has not been explicitly examined. Two eye-tracking experiments are presented to investigate the role of physical saliency in the guidance of gaze fixations during audiovisual speech perception. Experiment 1 quantified the physical saliency of a talking face and examined its relationship with the gaze behaviour of participants performing an audiovisual speech perception task and an emotion judgment task. The majority of fixations were made to locations on the face that exhibited high relative saliency, but not necessarily the maximally salient location. The addition of acoustic background noise resulted in a change in gaze behaviour and a decrease in correspondence between saliency and gaze behaviour, whereas changing the task did not alter this correspondence despite changes in gaze behaviour. Experiment 2 manipulated the visual information available to the viewer by using animated full-feature and point-light talking faces. Removing static information, such as colour, intensity, and orientation, from the stimuli elicited both a change in gaze behaviour and a decrease in correspondence between saliency and gaze behaviour. Removing dynamic information, particularly head motion, resulted in a decrease in correspondence between saliency and gaze behaviour without any change in gaze behaviour. The results of these experiments show that, while physical saliency is correlated with gaze behaviour, it cannot be the single factor determining the selection of gaze fixations. Interactions within and between bottom-up and top-down processing are suggested to guide the selection of gaze fixations during audiovisual speech perception.</description>

   <description>The mobility of contaminants via runoff at sites which require soil excavation as source removal can be controlled through the use of surface permeable reactive barriers.   This has been accomplished at a remote military site in the Canadian Arctic for soils contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  The design of these barriers should incorporate criteria for both granular as well as geotextile filters to maximize particle retention, without hindering hydraulic performance and with the consideration for adsorption/reaction mechanisms.   Field observations and laboratory testing in the form of batch and column tests were conducted to evaluate design criteria, filter performance and mechanisms of PCB retention.  The initial barrier prototype was constructed on site in July of 2003.  Modifications were required to improve hydraulic performance in the barrier and maximize sedimentation processes in the field.  These modifications resulted in an increase to funnel area, constructed flow impediments, and more permeable materials in the gate.  Two additional barrier systems were constructed in August of 2005.  Subsequent field and laboratory work demonstrated that granular materials trapped the majority of PCB-contaminated soil without impeding hydraulic performance; however, fines were escaping. Extensive column testing in the laboratory has shown that a nonwoven geotextile filter can be applied with success with a granular permeable reactive barrier system.  Batch and column testing indicated that particle retention was the most important factor in trapping PCBs in the filter system.  However, field sample results indicated that up to 62 ± 11% percent of PCB by mass was being partitioned on to the GAC (Granular Activated Carbon), a mechanism that was being inadequately captured by traditional batch and column tests.  Cold temperature laboratory tests (2-4oC) demonstrated that the presence of water had no effect on PCB adsorption to GAC and that particle-particle partitioning was affected by temperature.  Cold temperature column tests indicated that the primary mechanism of PCB transfer in the barrier system was via particle-particle partitioning.  The sequestration of PCBs in a permeable reactive barrier has important implications for both surface and subsurface remediation.</description>

   <description>The free radical addition of saturated polymers and small molecules to unsaturated monomers is used to prepare functional derivatives under solvent-free, reactive extrusion conditions. Of particular interest are the dynamics and yields of conventional peroxide-initiated grafting of vinyltrialkoxysilanes to polyethylene, as well as the mechanisms through which bicumene initiates the process at high temperatures.  Knowledge of these commercial processes is applied toward the development of new graft modification technology, including radical initiated polymer addition to alkynes, and a new variation of precipitation polymerization chemistry.&#xd;
&#xd;
The thermolysis of bicumene at temperatures ranging from 220°C to 270°C was used to initiate C-H bond addition from alkanes to vinylsilanes in a high-temperature analogue of conventional grafting practice.  The initiation mechanism is shown to involve direct hydrogen atom abstraction by intermediate cumyl radicals, as well as autooxidation processes involving cumyl radicals and available oxygen. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conventional peroxide initiated graft modifications of polyethylene with vinylsilanes are examined from the standpoint of reaction dynamics and yields.  The influence of peroxide loading and monomer concentration on these reaction variables can be described using a simple quasi-steady state kinetic analysis, while the unusual insensitivity of reaction yields to temperature requires further investigation.&#xd;
A new chemical modification of saturated polymers involving free radical addition to mono-substituted alkynes is presented and examined in terms of reaction yield, graft structure, and changes to molecular weight. Model compounds are used to characterize alkyne grafting products, and to probe the relationship between reagent properties, reaction yields, and product structures.&#xd;
&#xd;
The discovery of cross-linked particles in the products of polypropylene graft modifications with triallyltrimesate has led to a variation of precipitation polymerization wherein C-H bond addition to an allyl monomer contributes to molecular weight growth, thereby incorporating a significant amount of saturated hydrocarbon into the solid phase.  The relationships between reaction conditions and solid-phase composition and morphology are discussed.</description>

   <title>Validation of conformal radiotherapy treatments in 3D using polymer gel dosimeters and optical computed tomography</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-18 15:46:33.78</description>
   <description>Polymer gel dosimeters are a three dimensional (3D) dosimetry system that may be conveniently applied for verifying highly conformal radiation therapies where standard dosimetry techniques are insufficient.  Polymer gel dosimetry with optical computed tomography (OptCT) can be used to measure spatial dose distributions with high resolution.  While long experience with MRI has yielded many studies reporting on experiments involving validation of clinical deliveries using polymer gel dosimeters, there are very few studies of this type where OptCT is used.  OptCT is a relatively new technique and consequently has not yet been adopted into the clinical environment.  As a result, methods and software tools for integrating OptCT measurements into clinical systems are not available.  Previous studies from the Medical Physics research group at the Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario (CCSEO) and Queen’s University have therefore been limited to simple deliveries and two dimensional (2D) comparisons.  In this thesis various software tools and calibration techniques have been developed to allow comparative analysis between OptCT measurements with dose distributions calculated by treatment planning software.  Further, a modification of the γ-evaluation (Low et al. 1998) is presented whereby the vector components of γ are used to identify the sources of disagreement between compared dose distributions. Test simulations of the new γ-tool revealed that individual vector components of γ, as well as the resulting vector field can be used to identify certain types of disagreements between dose distributions: especially spatial misalignments caused by geometric misses.  The polymer gel dosimetry tools and analysis software were applied to a clinical validation mimicking a prostate conformal treatment with patient setup correction using image guidance.  In one experiment greater than 90 % agreement was found between dose distributions in 4%T 50%C NIPAM/Bis dosimeters (Senden et al. 2006) measured with the Vista OptCT unit and dose distributions calculated by Eclipse treatment planning software.</description>

   <title>On the Simulation and Prediction of Bed Morphological Adjustments of Equilibrium in Alluvial Meandering Streams</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-19 21:32:06.645</description>
   <description>This thesis concerns the computation of bed adjustments of equilibrium in alluvial meandering streams. It is assumed that the channel centerlines follow sine-generated curves, the banks are rigid, and the steady-state flow is turbulent and sub-critical. The flow width is assumed to remain constant in the streamwise direction, and the flow width-to-depth ratio is large (>=15, say). The bed material is cohesionless and homogeneous. &#xd;
The purpose of the thesis is to develop and test a numerical model for the computation of bed development, given the aforementioned idealized conditions. The model comprises: 1- an initial bed topography generator, to generate the bed at time t = 0 of the calculations; 2- the vertically-averaged hydrodynamic model of Zhang (2007) to calculate the flow fields; and 3- a sediment transport model to relate the bed deformation to the flow. Both the initial bed topography generator (expression of the deformed bed surface) and the numerical sediment transport model based on the sediment transport continuity equation are original and developed entirely by the author. The resulting model is computationally very efficient. In contrast to previous works on the theoretical determination of bed deformation, the beds at the beginning of the calculations may represent any stage of the development process, and not necessarily the initial flat bed.&#xd;
	The bed deformation was tested for several test cases, devised on the basis of laboratory runs available in the literature. These include Run ME-2 by Hasegawa (1983) in a 30-degree-channel, Run 3 by Binns (2006) in a 70-degree-channel and the run by Termini (1996) in a 110-degree-channel.&#xd;
	The erosion/deposition patterns of the computed equilibrium bed topographies were found to be in reasonable agreement with their measured counterparts. However, as evidenced by the difference plots included in this thesis, in detail there are substantial differences between the computed and measured equilibrium beds, especially in the regions near the banks.&#xd;
	As a by-product of the present thesis, the functions representing the parameters required by the hydrodynamic model of Zhang (2007) were also evaluated. In particular, the present results suggest that the coefficient Alpha-q appearing in the expression of the local friction factor (used in the flow model of Zhang 2007) depends on the flow width-to-depth ratio and bed roughness to a much larger extent than previously thought. Considering this, a generalization of the expression of Alpha-q due to El-Tahawy (2004) (and adopted by Zhang 2007 in her model) is proposed.&#xd;
	Future work should be carried out to address the application of the present model to real river conditions, including generalizations to irregular meandering plan shapes, unsteady-state flows and non-homogenous bed materials.</description>

   <description>“Holding Hands With Wampum” weaves a story of disparate peoples who came together to create a new North American World over a period of more than five centuries.  The Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora member nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy conceptualized their universe according to the kaswentha ethic and above all treasured autonomy on local, national, and confederate scales.  “Holding Hands With Wampum” traces the spiritual foundations of this Haudenosaunee worldview and then uses ethical discourse to explain the evolution of Haudenosaunee-European relationships through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to Canadian Confederation and, finally, to the modern age of land reclamations and assertions of Haudenosaunee sovereignty.  Unravelling a uniquely Haudenosaunee perspective of the past, “Holding Hands With Wampum” is a cultural form of intellectual history, as it employs Haudenosaunee culture and ethical discourse to understand the place of a diverse community in the very public world of council fires and other political interactions.  As an exercise in ethnohistory, “Holding Hands With Wampum” combines the documentary record with wampum belts and oral interviews in an effort to create a balanced historical narrative that situates culture in a constantly changing geo-political reality.  The concept of métissage also provides a framework for understanding how these dramatically different peoples came together in the eighteenth century and created a new, common diplomatic protocol.  Only by shedding light upon Haudenosaunee-European relations over such a long period can we hope to understand contemporary issues of land and treaty rights and, perhaps, learn how to rekindle the métissage of a not so distant past.</description>

   <description>Using paired tests of high and low minimum investment group funds on several performance measures for hedge funds and funds-of-funds from 1991-2005, we find that funds imposing a higher entry fee requirement on their investors produce significantly better performance both on a raw basis and a risk-adjusted basis. Differences in the performance of the high and low entry fee funds are found to be less significant economically and statistically in later years, suggesting a diminishing gap in performance differences. We also find that there is considerably more cross-sectional dispersion in investing in funds with lower minimum investment levels, which indicates a much higher level of fund selection risk for undiversified investors desiring investment in funds with low entry fee barriers.</description>

   <description>Hardpans, or cemented layers, form from precipitation and subsequent cementation of secondary minerals in mine tailings and can act as both physical and chemical barriers. During precipitation, metals in the tailings are sequestered, making hardpan a potentially viable method of natural attenuation. At Montague Gold Mines, Nova Scotia, tailings are partially cemented by the iron (Fe) arsenate mineral scorodite (FeAsO4•2H2O). Scorodite is known as a phase that can effectively limit aqueous arsenic (As) concentrations due to its relatively low solubility (&lt;1 ppm, pH 5) and high As content (~30 wt.%). However, scorodite will not lower As concentrations from waters to below the Canadian drinking water guideline (0.010 ppm). &#xd;
&#xd;
To identify current field conditions influencing scorodite precipitation and dissolution and to better understand the mineralogical and chemical relationship between hardpan and tailings, coexisting waters and solids were sampled to provide information on tailings-water interactions. Hardpan cement compositions were found to include Fe arsenate and Fe oxyhydroxide in addition to scorodite. End-member pore water chemistry was identified based on pH and dissolved concentration extremes (e.g. pH 3.78, As(aq) 35.8 ppm) compared to most other samples (avg. pH 6.41, As(aq) 2.07 ppm). These end-member characteristics coincide with the most extensive and dispersed areas of hardpan.&#xd;
&#xd;
Nearly all hardpan is associated with historical arsenopyrite-bearing concentrate which provides a source of acidity and dissolved As+5 and Fe+3 for scorodite precipitation. A proposed model of progressive arsenopyrite oxidation suggests localized As cycling involving scorodite is occurring but is dependent on sulfide persistence. Therefore, permanent As sequestration is not expected. Remediation efforts would have to consider the possibility of scorodite dissolution after complete sulfide consumption or as a consequence of applying certain technologies, such as a cover. Conversely, if scorodite stability were maintained, the hardpan could be considered as a component in remediating the tailings at Montague.</description>

   <description>This thesis is a first step to a gender analysis of South Africa’s social medicine experiment of the 1940s. The research focused on the work of the Health Centres, in particular Grassy Park and Polela, which were established in South Africa between 1940 and 1959, i.e., the date when all Health Centres were either closed down or converted into ordinary outpatient clinics for the Provincial Hospitals.  It is based on an examination of archival records such as the reports of the Health Centres, in, and the official records prepared by the then Department of Public Health and the Medical Officers-in-Charge of the Health Centres. In order to undertake a gender analysis, I asked two main questions: how Health Centre Practice (HCP), i.e. discourse and work of the Health Centres, responded to gender roles and relations it encountered in the community where it operated and secondly, how HCP advocates constructed a particular discourse about black people’s health that effectively depoliticized health, poverty and the role of the state in the creation and maintenance of disease and poverty. There is sufficient evidence to show that the Health Centres provided a valuable service to black women at a time when the state did not prioritize black people’s health, however, the historical moment within which HCP was conceived and implemented, implies that neither the project nor its implementers could escape the dominant racist, patriarchal political values.</description>

   <description>Modern speech communication technologies expose users to perceptual quality degradations that were not experienced earlier with conventional telephone systems. Since perceived speech quality is a major contributor to the end user's perception of quality of service, speech quality estimation has become an important research field. In this dissertation, perceptual quality estimators are proposed for several emerging speech communication applications, in particular for i) wireless communications with noise suppression capabilities, ii) wireless-VoIP communications, iii) far-field hands-free speech communications, and iv) text-to-speech systems.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, a general-purpose speech quality estimator is proposed based on statistical models of normative speech behaviour and on innovative techniques to detect multiple signal distortions. The estimators do not depend on a clean reference signal hence are termed ``blind." Quality meters are then distributed along the network chain to allow for both quality degradations and quality enhancements to be handled. In order to improve estimation performance for wireless communications, statistical models of noise-suppressed speech are also incorporated.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Next, a hybrid signal-and-link-parametric quality estimation paradigm is proposed for emerging wireless-VoIP communications. The algorithm uses VoIP connection parameters to estimate a base quality representative of the packet switching network. Signal-based distortions are then detected and quantified in order to adjust the base quality accordingly. The proposed hybrid methodology is shown to overcome the limitations of existing pure signal-based and pure link parametric algorithms.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Temporal dynamics information is then investigated for quality diagnosis for hands-free speech communications. A spectro-temporal signal representation, where speech and reverberation tail components are shown to be separable, is used for blind characterization of room acoustics. In particular, estimators of reverberation time, direct-to-reverberation energy ratio, and reverberant speech quality are developed.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Lastly, perceptual quality estimation for text-to-speech systems is addressed. Text- and speaker-independent hidden Markov models, trained on naturally produced speech, are used to capture normative spectral-temporal information. Deviations from the models, computed by means of a log-likelihood measure, are shown to be reliable indicators of multiple quality attributes including naturalness, fluency, and intelligibility.</description>

   <description>Two common strategies used to identify specific genes that influence aging in Drosophila melanogaster are overexpression screens and candidate gene approaches.  Both of these strategies rely on gene expression systems.  A very popular gene expression system in Drosophila is the bipartite UAS/GAL4 system, where binding of GAL4 to a UAS sequence can direct the expression of a UAS-linked transgene in a pattern determined by GAL4.  Although the UAS/GAL4 system allows for spatial regulation of transgene expression, it does not allow researchers to control when transgene expression will occur.  This is an important consideration since aging research is primarily interested in identifying genes that influence aging during adulthood, therefore requiring that transgene expression be effectively blocked during pre-adult stages.  Both the Gene-Switch and the Tet-Off/GAL80 systems are attempts to establish temporal control over GAL4 activity. The Gene-Switch system is based on a modified form of GAL4 whose transcriptional activity can be controlled through the antiprogestin molecule RU486.  The Tet-Off/GAL80 system, where expression of GAL80 (a negative regulator of GAL4) is under the control of a tetracycline sensitive expression system, allows regulation of GAL4 activity through the antibiotic tetracycline.  Characterization of these systems reveals that although neither system can completely repress leaky transgene expression, the Tet-Off/GAL80 system is much better at preventing unwanted transgene expression at most stages of the fly life cycle.  Furthermore, comparison of muscle specific GAL4 and Gene-Switch strains revealed that upon treatment with their respective inducers, the Tet-Off/GAL80 system allows for GAL4 activity in the muscles, while the Gene-Switch system results in GAL4 activity in other tissues in addition to the muscles.  In other characterized Gene-Switch strains, GAL4 activity is achieved only in a subset of the cells of the targeted tissue, suggesting that the Gene-Switch system may be ill-suited for aging studies.  These findings, along with the fact that the Tet-Off/GAL80 but not the Gene-Switch system is compatible with the hundreds of characterized GAL4 lines presently available which allows transgene expression to be targeted to most tissues, indicate that the Tet-Off/GAL80 system is the best-suited for aging studies in Drosophila at present.</description>

   <description>Results are reported from full-scale testing of a buried, deep-corrugated, large-span box culvert with a 2.4 m rise and 10.0 m span under controlled laboratory conditions. A total of twenty-one experiments were conducted on the structure, measuring its response without backfill, during backfilling, under a loaded tandem axle dump truck, and under simulated vehicle loading with force applied by an actuator. Surface strain measurements were used to calculate bending moments and thrusts, while deflections were monitored using an electronic theodolite.&#xd;
	Tests conducted to a maximum force of truck loading specified by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code multiplied by a dynamic load allowance factor were performed at three cover depths. The maximum moment increased from 6 to 41 kNm/m as the cover was reduced from 1.5 to 0.45 m. This was attributed to less load distribution and decreased soil-structure system stiffness at shallower cover. The maximum bending moments were consistently observed directly beneath the applied force.&#xd;
	Tests were also conducted at forces larger than the design values to identify the ultimate limit state(s) of the structure. An ultimate limit state was encountered at approximately 800 kN where the geotechnical resistance beneath the loading pads was exceeded. A subsequent test with the loading pad force spread over larger areas permitted larger forces to be applied. An ultimate limit state of the structure involving the formation of three plastic hinges occurred at 1100 kN. The plastic hinge initially formed at the crown, followed by hinges located at each shoulder. Post-test observations showed evidence of local buckling of the conduit wall, gaps between the plates at the seams, the tilting of bolts along the longitudinal seams, and surface cracks in the soil. Applying the material resistance factor of 0.9 to the ultimate load limit of 1100 kN measured for the structure yields a reserve capacity of 1.7 when compared to the fully factored load including dynamic load allowance and live load factors.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-23 12:25:09.685</description>
   <description>This thesis explores two hybrid systems employing a core material reinforced by an external skin, namely, cladding walls composed of polyurethane foam core sandwiched between fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) skins, and beams composed of concrete-filled FRP or steel tubes. The walls were studied in two phases. In phase I, the polyurethane foam core was injected between two carbon-FRP (CFRP) skins. Ten panels were tested to investigate their structural performance and failure modes. Test parameters included quality control in terms of reproducibility of test results, moment-shear ratio, and the orientation of an architectural masonry-like coating. The study showed that design is governed by stiffness and not strength and that the CFRP was underutilized. Also, quality control was shown to be poor for this method of fabrication. As such, in phase II, ten panels were fabricated by laminating glass-FRP (GFRP) skins to prefabricated polyurethane foam blocks. Similar flexural testing was carried out to investigate two different densities of foam, and moment-shear ratio.  The study showed evidence of high quality control and that the density of the foam core significantly affected flexural capacity and stiffness. &#xd;
Rectangular concrete-filled tubes (CFTs), with either steel or pultruded GFRP tubes were fabricated and tested as beams in three-point bending, at different shear span-to-depth (a/d) ratios of 1 to 5 to examine crack patterns, strength and failure modes. It was shown that the critical (a/d) ratio, at which moment capacity drops, is between 4 and 5 for CFTs with GFRP tubes and between 1 and 2 for CFTs with steel tubes. It was also shown that ductility is drastically reduced at (a/d) ratios below 3 for steel tubes. Crack pattern and size were highly dependent on the magnitude of slip between the concrete and tube. A major full depth flexural crack developed in all CFTs with GFRP tubes. However, when internal steel rebar was added, major diagonal cracks were formed in addition to fine flexural cracks. In CFTs with steel tubes, fine flexural cracks developed, except at a/d = 1, where fine diagonal cracks were predominant. A strut-and-tie model was developed and provided reasonable agreement with test results.</description>

   <description>Two field studies of surface displacements during pipe bursting were conducted.  The first field study consisted of a controlled experiment in clay soil.  Three vitrified clay pipelines, each at a different burial depth, were up-sized to high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes using static pipe bursting techniques.  Surface displacements during the pipe bursting process were monitored using digital imaging techniques as well as surveying.  It was found that ground displacements were largest in the vertical direction, such that the maximum vertical displacements measured during pipe bursting ranged from 71.8 ± 7.5 mm at a depth of cover of 0.6 m and 11.2 ± 1.2 mm at a depth of cover of 1.5 m.  Transverse displacements generated during pipe bursting were found to correspond to tension cracking of the ground surface above the pipe.  The second field study examined pipe bursting installations which took place at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police College campus in Ottawa, Ontario.  During this study, five pipe bursting installations were monitored.  Each installation varied in terms of the surface and subsurface conditions, host pipe size and material, replacement pipe size, and depth of cover.  The pattern of displacements distributed in all three directions was consistent with the results from the controlled study.  However, greater variability in results was found during the Ottawa project.  Vertical displacements were found to range from 0.6 ± 0.1 mm to 11.3 ± 0.2 mm for pipe bursts carried out to the same up-size dimension, at approximately the same depth of cover, surrounded by similar surface and subsurface conditions.  In general, pipe bursting in clayey soils with an unpaved surface resulted in larger displacements having a narrower distribution over the ground surface than the paved installations.  Additionally, increased variability in results occurred under real construction conditions due to inherent variability in subsurface and host pipe conditions.</description>

   <description>Background: As Electronic Medical Records(EMRs) are being utilized increasingly in primary care physician’s offices, the potential exists to collect a vast amount of clinical information for research purposes. However, variation in clinician documentation of diagnoses makes it challenging to accurately identify diseases within the EMR. We set out to develop and validate a text-mining tool to identify MI diagnoses within the EMR.&#xd;
Methods: We selected a random 5% sample from the 19,376 active adult patients in our EMR database. This sample of 1293 charts was reviewed by trained abstractors and used as the gold standard for the evaluation of the validity and reliability of the automated text-mining tool in identifying myocardial infarction patients. We also compared the results of the manual EMR abstraction with the hospitalization records of each patient to evaluate the validity and reliability of myocardial infarction diagnosis in the EMR. We manually reviewed all discordant records to investigate and categorize the reasons for discordance.  Lastly, we compared the results of using administrative data versus EMR data for the measurement of selected MI quality indicators.&#xd;
Results: When compared with the gold standard of manual chart review, the text-mining tool had a sensitivity of 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.8%–99.2%), a specificity of 96.2% (CI 94.9%–97.4%), a positive predictive value (PPV) of 88.9% (CI 85.5%–92.7%) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.1% (CI 98.6%–99.3%). When compared with the current standard of hospital discharge abstracts the EMR manual chart review had a sensitivity of 94.9% (CI 92.0%–97.7%), a specificity of 91.7% (CI 90.0%–93.5%) and PPV of 71.6% (CI 66.6%–79.2%) and a NPV of 98.8% (CI 98.1%–99.0%). The assessment of MI quality indicators were the same whether measured using the EMR or administrative data, with the exception of the proportion of patients on ASA (p&lt;0.001). &#xd;
Conclusion: The text-mining tool identified myocardial infarction diagnosis in the EMR with a high level of accuracy. In addition, EMRs may represent an important data source for a comprehensive identification of MI patients and the evaluation of quality of care.</description>

   <description>The design of service connections to deeply buried sewers involves a number of challenges. In practice, the loads that develop from vertical risers can damage the Tee or Wye fitting to which it is connected. This thesis studies the expected loads and resistance of these connections, and provides some recommendations for the solution of this engineering problem.&#xd;
	Laboratory tests have been performed to explore the capacities of the existing fittings both in air and when buried in uniform sand. A test procedure different from the standard quality control test methods described in ASTM F1336-02 is used to study the performance of the fittings in air. A special test configuration was also developed for an existing pipe test cell to explore the capacities of the existing PVC Tee and Wye fittings when buried in uniform sand.&#xd;
	An analytical formula analogous to pile downdrag and numerical analyses have been used to evaluate the test results, to calculate the capacities of the buried heavy-wall fittings, and to explore the downdrag forces that develop along vertical risers. Through comparisons with experimental measurements, it was demonstrated that these methods of analysis can be used to estimate the downdrag forces and determine the adequacy of specific fittings to resist those forces.&#xd;
	The major conclusions drawn for the specific fittings tested in this project are summarized as follows. When axially loaded in air, both Tee and Wye fittings experience plastic yield failure. When buried, the Tee fitting fractures or yields only along the base of the riser part; while the Wye fitting itself does not fail, the riser cracks near its base where it connects to the curved pipe (450 elbow) above the Wye. Both the capacities and stiffness of the buried fitting system (either Tee or Wye) are approximately linear functions of the confining stress supplied by the surrounding soil. The accumulated downdrag along the riser in the coarse-grained soil is much smaller than that in fine-grained soil.&#xd;
	Various practical solutions for the vertical riser problem are then discussed and recommended.</description>

   <description>Benthic uptake of mercury (Hg) governs bioavailability to fish yet there are still large gaps in our knowledge of what mediates this process.  Without this information it is difficult to ascertain where Hg accumulation in the foodweb will be greatest.  In the St. Lawrence River Area of Concern (AOC) at Cornwall, one contaminated zone (Zone 1) shows elevated Hg in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and their prey items compared to those from other zones in the AOC.  Greater availability of Hg to benthos due to unique physical features (large deposition of woodfibre deposits) of Zone 1 is hypothesized to account for this observation.  In this study, amphipods (Gammarus fasciatus) and (Echinogammarus ischnus) were collected in Zone 1 using artificial substrates between June-September 2007, and Hg concentrations compared to those obtained in sediments and porewaters of surficial sediments, as well as methane gas evasion rates.  Methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in amphipods were significantly related to porewater total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations.  No parallel relationship was found for sediment Hg concentrations or methane bubbling rates from sediments.   Spatial and temporal trends in Hg bioavailability were evident from significant relationships with water column depth and temperature.  Water column depth was associated with higher MeHg concentrations in amphipods and porewaters.  Concentrations of porewater MeHg were above the detection limit in all of the June samples, the month which also coincided with highest amphipod MeHg concentrations.  Finally, sediment organic matter may be influencing patterns of MeHg availability in Zone 1, and displayed a negative relationship to amphipod MeHg. Although bubbling from contaminated sediments did not directly correlate with amphipod Hg uptake, future studies should look at the influence of bubbling on the redistribution of contaminated sediment particles within the zone.</description>

   <description>Efforts to commercialize water supply and sanitation in Dhaka, Bangladesh, have been pushed vigorously by internal and external proponents of neo-liberalism. The thesis takes a critical look at these developments and analyzes the role of multinational finance institutions in this process. In particular, it looks into the role of these finance institutions in funding reform projects to corporatize Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA), examining the impacts on end users, especially marginalized sections of society. The thesis describes how, in the process of corporatization, Dhaka WASA is and will continue to be more assertive in its commercial orientation than it was previously. The paper also studies a highly touted ‘successful’ co-operative model for revenue management called Program for Performance Improvement (PPI), seen by some as an alternative to privatization. I argue that the model in fact emerged as a consequence of the commercialization efforts of neoliberal reforms and that the revenue management model has created an isolated business unit with a reclusive management that undermines the egalitarian objectives of the water utility as a public service entity.</description>

   <description>Determination of water masses and circulation in the eastern Great Australian Bight, in conjunction with analysis of δ18O values and trace element concentrations in the articulated brachiopod Anakinetica cumingi, indicate that brachiopods faithfully record ambient temperatures and oceanographic conditions. Five water masses are identified on the shelf during March 1998, on the basis of temperature, salinity, δ2H and δ18O values. The warm, high salinity Great Australian Bight Plume occurs in the western part of the study area both at the surface and at depth, and the cool, low salinity Flinders Current flows west along the continental slope. The Flinders Current provides upwelling water along the Eyre Peninsula and in the central Great Australian Bight, and mixing of this water with Great Australian Bight Plume and shelf waters forms the combined water masses Flinders Current + Great Australian Bight outflow, Modified Flinders Current and Mixed waters. The Great Australian Bight Plume and Flinders Current are isotopically distinct, with Great Australian Bight Plume waters having lower δ18O values and higher δ2H values than Flinders Current waters.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using mean annual temperatures and δ18O values of seawater, brachiopod temperatures calculated from their δ18O values are within 1°C of measured temperatures. δ18O values in the brachiopods, in conjunction with seasonally variable temperatures and δ18O values of seawater, provide evidence for brachiopod major growth periods. Calculated brachiopod temperatures are most accurate assuming 70% of brachiopod growth occurs during summer when upwelling is occurring and 30% of growth occurs during the rest of the year. Brachiopods may be growing more during upwelling periods in response to increased food supply. &#xd;
&#xd;
Ba, Ni and V concentrations in the brachiopod shells show spatial variation that matches with water mass distribution on the shelf. Ba positively correlates with nitrate contents in the water and is enriched in brachiopods growing in upwelling areas. Ni and V positively correlate with seawater temperatures, suggesting that incorporation of these two elements into brachiopod calcite is temperature dependant. All three elements reflect the anticlockwise circulation pattern present in the eastern Great Australian Bight during the summer major growth period.</description>

   <description>A mathematical model of a steam-methane reformer (SMR) was developed for use in process performance simulations and on-line monitoring of tube-wall temperatures.  The model calculates temperature profiles for the outer-tube wall, inner-tube wall, furnace gas and process gas.  Reformer performance ratios and composition profiles are also computed.  The model inputs are the reformer inlet-stream conditions, the geometry and material properties of the furnace and catalyst-bed. The model divides the furnace and process sides of the reformer into zones of uniform temperature and composition.  Radiative-heat transfer on the furnace side is modeled using the Hottel Zone method.  Energy and material balances are performed on the zones to produce non-linear algebraic equations, which are solved using the Newton-Raphson method with a numerical Jacobian.  Model parameters were ranked from most-estimable to least estimable using a sensitivity-based estimability analysis tool, and model outputs were fitted to limited data from an industrial SMR.  The process-gas outlet temperatures were matched within 4 ºC, the upper and lower peep-hole temperatures within 12 ºC and the furnace-gas outlet temperature within 4 ºC.  The process-gas outlet pressure, composition and flow rate are also accurately matched by the model.  The values of the parameter estimates are physically realistic.  The model developed in this thesis has the capacity to be developed into more specialized versions.  Some suggestions for more specialized models include modeling of separate classes of tubes that are in different radiative environments, and detailed modeling of burner configurations, furnace-gas flow patterns and combustion heat-release patterns.</description>

   <description>The Denault Formation (2.1-1.9 Ga) outcrops in the Labrador Trough, northeastern Quebec and western Labrador. The Denault crops out around the town of Schefferville and at Marion Lake, fifty kilometers east-northeast of Schefferville. In June 2007, four stratigraphic sections were measured and samples were collected from eight locations. Occurrences of the Denault near the town of Schefferville contain textural characteristics consistent with deposition on the middle and outer portions of a storm-influenced shallow ramp. Mid-ramp facies consist of intraclastic grainstones with hummocky cross-stratification (HCS), swaley cross-stratification (SCS), current ripples, and graded event beds. Further outboard, grainstones grade into deeper water laminites that are composed of even, mm-scale couplets of flat-lying organic and micritic laminae. Scours within the laminites suggest occasional storm activity. Laminites gradually grade into outer ramp deep-water shales. Separated from these ramp facies by 50km (present day) is an isolated eastern stromatolitic accumulation. This outcrop can be interpreted as the remnant of a near-continuous margin or may simply represent an isolated accumulation that developed on a pre-existing topographic high. &#xd;
Microscopic (2-10µm) lathes of dolomite are interpreted to be pseudomorphs after gypsum. The presence of such pseudomorphs and solution-collapse breccias provide evidence for evaporative conditions during the deposition and early diagenesis of the Denault. Seepage-reflux of brines generated through evaporation during the deposition of the Denault and the overlying Fleming Formation are interpreted to have caused early, mimetic dolomitization in a shallow burial setting. Subsequent burial diagenesis resulted in recrystallization of some rock to fabric-destructive, anhedral dolomite.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-08 20:38:56.433</description>
   <description>Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (S-SWCNTs) have direct band gaps&#xd;
with a range of 0.5 to 2 eV depending on the SWCNT chirality. The photoluminescence&#xd;
(PL) quantum efficiency and the carriers’ radiative lifetime have been previously&#xd;
studied but neither of them have been confirmed due to the large variation resulting&#xd;
from ensemble averaging, environmental effects, SWCNT defects, and SWCNT bundles.&#xd;
For example, quantum efficiency was estimated to be 0.01% to 7% and radiative&#xd;
lifetime was estimated or calculated to be 10 to 100 ns. In this thesis, we study absorption&#xd;
cross section, PL quantum efficiency and exciton relaxation dynamics from&#xd;
single air-suspended S-SWCNTs and extract “intrinsic” S-SWCNT properties.&#xd;
&#xd;
The photo-excited carriers are electron-hole pairs (called excitons) in a SWCNT&#xd;
due to the strong Coulomb interactions in the nm-scale system. We selected relatively&#xd;
bright and less defected S-SWCNTs on our samples for investigation. For each SSWCNT,&#xd;
the tube length, orientation, absorption and emission spectra were recorded.&#xd;
Experimentally, we observed that PL from a single S-SWCNT increases linearly at&#xd;
low excitation intensity (linear regime) and saturates at higher intensity (saturation&#xd;
regime). We also studied the exciton relaxation dynamics on each S-SWCNT by&#xd;
femtosecond excitation correlation (FEC) spectroscopy and resolved two relaxation&#xd;
time constants which were independent of the excitation intensity. We compare the&#xd;
simulation results based on a stochastic model to the experimental data and extract essential parameters including S-SWCNT unitless absorption coefficient (typically&#xd;
0.02 to 0.06), PL quantum efficiency (typically 7 to 20 %) and exciton relaxation&#xd;
time constants. We observed very fast nonlinear exciton-exciton annihilation rate (>(2 ps)^−1) in a typical 5 μm-long S-SWCNTs. The exciton dynamics were consistent&#xd;
from 4 different S-SWCNTs in the saturation regime and the average total exciton&#xd;
number per pulse per tube in this saturation regime ranges from 2 to 12.&#xd;
&#xd;
Compared to past work, the results (PL saturation curves and FEC data) between&#xd;
S-SWCNTs are very consistent which supports our belief that we are studying&#xd;
“intrinsic properties”. We found a higher absorption coefficient, and higher PL quantum&#xd;
efficiency of S-SWCNTs compared to previous work. We also observe very fast&#xd;
nonlinear exciton-exciton annihilation in a relatively longer S-SWCNT and at lower&#xd;
exciton numbers.</description>

   <title>Accessing Resources in a Global Economy: Three Essays on Outsourcing and Immigration</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-12 13:55:27.301</description>
   <description>This thesis is a collection of three manuscripts. In the first manuscript I develop a general equilibrium model that explains the growth and maturation of outsourcing – an outsourcing lifecycle – based on industry learning and market feedback. When outsourcing starts, buyers lack the knowledge to develop effective contracts so they rely on relationships. As contract knowledge develops, contracts become stronger and eventually replace relationships as the primary form of governance and the market grows. Under contractual governance, continued strengthening of contracts benefits buyers. The size of the market determines whether suppliers benefit or suffer with increased contracts strength. &#xd;
&#xd;
The second manuscript explores the design of an optimal skills-based immigrant selection system based. This system is based on two factors: a threshold in predicted-earnings that is used to determine whom to accept and reject, and a human-capital-based earnings regression for making error-minimizing predictions of immigrant success in the host labor market. We first show how to design a points system based on what we assume to be the optimal predicted-earnings threshold and the optimal prediction regression. We next develop a method for identifying the optimal threshold given the prediction regression. The method produces a “selection frontier” that dictates the options facing policy makers. The frontier shows the tradeoff between the average quality of admitted immigrants and the number of immigrants admitted. The frontier shifts out with improved accuracy in predicting earnings as well as with increases in the variation and average quality of the applicant pool. Finally, we show how the policy maker chooses the optimal selection system given the selection frontier. &#xd;
&#xd;
The third manuscript demonstrates the feasibility of the optimal immigrant selection method by developing an illustrative points system. We also explore how the selection system can be improved by incorporating additional information such as country-of-origin characteristics and intended occupations. We discuss what our findings imply for the debate about the relative merits of points- and employment-based systems for selecting economic immigrants.</description>

   <description>One of the main notational contexts in which model-driven software development has been studied is the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the de facto standard in software modelling.  The current trend in software development is not just towards the use of models, but the use of executable models.  In 2006, the Object Management Group issued a Request for Proposal (RFP), soliciting the definition of an Executable UML Foundation, with a fully specified executable semantics.  The purpose of such a version of UML is to make the advantages of executable models available to UML users by enabling "a chain of tools that support the construction, verification, translation, and execution" of models.   &#xd;
&#xd;
An oft-voiced criticism of UML is its lack of a formal, unambiguous description of its semantics.  In an effort to improve the support for model-driven development, especially with respect to executable modelling, the UML 2 specification introduced a novel three-layer semantics architecture.  This architecture provides a stratification of the description of UML models that clearly separates 'low-level' behavioural specification mechanisms, such as actions, from 'high-level' behavioural formalisms, such as activities, state machines and interactions.  Although UML describes the effect of actions, it does not provide either the concrete syntax or the formal semantics of an action language.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our research focuses on a top-to-bottom slice of the three-layer architecture.  We formally define the execution semantics of two-thirds of UML actions, including the most complicated actions---invocation actions.  Our formal definition is expressed in terms of state changes to a global state machine representing an executing UML model.  Our work provides an alternate formalization to that of the current submission to the RFP and could be used to enhance that submission.&#xd;
&#xd;
To validate our formal semantics and to determine the usefulness of the three-layer architecture, we have created an interpreter for UML actions and activities.  This interpreter was designed in accordance with the complex token passing semantics of UML  and provides analysis capabilities that have been successfully used to identify problems even in published activity diagrams.  In effect, we have created a tool that supports the construction, verification and execution of a subset of UML models, namely activities.  Our handling of this slice of the three-layer architecture is a preliminary step to realizing the grander vision of general executable (and analyzable) models.</description>

   <description>Plant-wide communication between tissues and cells is organized, in part, by a suite of compounds called hormones.  I have chosen to focus on the effects of one plant hormone, ethylene; how its synthesis is controlled and how its perception is mediated to differentially control cell development and response to pathogens. &#xd;
&#xd;
In the production of ethylene, one level of control is by modulating the levels of the immediate precursor to ethylene, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC).  I characterize here a plant encoded gene homologous to bacterial ACC Deaminases, AtACD1, and show through up- and down-regulation of the gene that it can modulate the plants sensitivity to exogenous ACC.  Once ethylene is produced, it is sensed in Arabidopsis thaliana by a family of 5 receptors.  I show that ETR2 in Arabidopsis is responsible for modulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton assembly as loss-of –function mutations to this gene cause randomized microtubule assembly in trichomes and increase sensitivity to microtubule depolymerising drugs in root hairs.  In studies of plant:pathogen interactions, ethylene is a central signaling agent required for plant resistance.  While it has been shown that etr1 mutants show increased susceptibility to fungal pathogens, exogenous ethylene has also been shown to speed the progress of pathogenesis.  Using Fumonisin B1 (FB1) to induce cell death I show that etr1-1 has accelerated cell death while ein4-1 has a reduced rate of necrosis.  Further to this, mutations to the other three ethylene receptors do not have any effect on the rate of cell death.&#xd;
&#xd;
My interest in cell development led to the characterization of an activation tagged Populus tremula x P. alba line with increased trichome initiation. The gene responsible for these phenotypes was identified as PtMYB186, which also affected growth rate, transpiration rate, photosynthetic capacity, and resistance to the Tussock moth larvae.&#xd;
&#xd;
Together these studies provide a new framework for our understanding of how the ethylene signal is modulated in plants and the controls behind cellular development.  This knowledge will help reconcile studies which show that ethylene has different effects on plant development and provide new avenues of research into trichome development.</description>

   <description>Alkylphenanthrenes such as retene (7-isopropyl-1-methylphenanthrene) are aquatic contaminants commonly found in anthropogenically-, industrially-, and petroleum-contaminated environments, and have been implicated in crude oil toxicity.  In the early life stages (ELS) of fish, exposures to alkylphenanthrenes produce signs of toxicity typical of those observed in exposures to halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).  TCDD, the most toxic congener, serves as the basis of the current mechanism-based risk assessment model.  The model assumes that congeners that produce TCDD-like toxicity share a common mode of action and act additively.  The mechanism of TCDD-like toxicity is assumed to be mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in the xenobiotic response (e.g., induction of cytochrome P450 1A enzymes; CYP1A) and in normal development.  CYP1A enzymes are not involved in the mechanism of TCDD toxicity. Alkylphenanthrenes toxic to the ELS of fish are AhR ligands, but in contrast to TCDD, are readily metabolized by CYP1A enzymes.  The byproducts of CYP1A metabolism have been implicated in retene toxicity.  However, the target tissue of retene and the direct roles of AhR and CYP1A in retene toxicity are unknown, but are expected to be similar to those of TCDD. The results presented in this thesis suggest that in the ELS of fish: (1) the primary target of retene is the cardiovascular system (Chapters 2 &amp; 5); (2) retene toxicity is stage-specific (Chapter 2); (3) the mechanism of retene toxicity is mediated by AhR2, and is independent of CYP1A enzymes (Chapter 5); (4) multiple CYP1A-independent toxicities can result from exposures to different mixtures of CYP1A inducing (retene) and CYP1A inhibiting (alpha-naphthoflavone or 2-aminoanthracene) PAHs (Chapters 3 &amp; 4); and (5) multiple concentration-dependent mechanisms of toxicity (i.e., synergism and response addition) can occur in co-exposures of a CYP1A inducer (retene) with a range of CYP1A inhibitor (alpha-naphthoflavone) concentrations (Chapter 3).  Thus, retene toxicity is mechanistically similar to that of TCDD toxicity, suggesting alkylphenanthrenes can be included in the current risk assessment model.  However, the observed variable mixture toxicities and species differences in retene toxicity raise questions about the effectiveness of this model.</description>

   <description>The electrochemical performance of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell is known to be dominated by the cathode processes comprising the various reaction and transport steps in the overall oxygen electro-reduction to water occurring in the catalyst layer (CL). This thesis is concerned with one such transport process – oxygen transport in ionomer phase of the CL – and the synthesis/characterization of platinum catalyst on an alternative support – carbon nanotubes (CNT). Specifically, the objectives of the thesis are: (i) exploration of methods for determining the effective permeability of oxygen in the ionomer phase of the carbon-ionomer composite representing the PEMFC catalyst layer (ii) synthesis of Pt/CNT catalysts and characterization thereof.&#xd;
An electrochemical method for determination of oxygen permeability in Nafion and Nafion-carbon composite films was explored. Since the method is suitable for dense films, mathematical model for data analysis had to be modified to allow treatment of porous films. Applying the modified model to the porous Nafion film, the oxygen permeation in the Nafion phase was found to agree with the literature data for oxygen permeation in Nafion membranes. However, no relationship between the effective permeability and ionomer content was found. &#xd;
Two methods for synthesis of Pt/CNT catalysts were studied – the precipitation method and the colloidal/ethylene glycol method. Functionalization of CNTs was found to be critical to obtaining any significant amount of Pt deposition on CNT. The precipitation method did not yield reproducible results. Pt/CNT catalysts of desired properties were synthesized via the colloidal/EG method. It was found that a high pH of 8.5 to 10.5 resulted in smallest Pt particle size. The Pt particles size was determined to range 2-4 nm. The synthesized Pt/CNT catalysts were also tested in a fuel cell environment. Steady-state polarization curves in humidified H2/Air system were obtained that demonstrated performance comparable to commercial electrodes in that cell potential of greater than 0.6 V at current density of 800 mA/cm2 electrode area and a limiting current density of 1200 mA/cm2 electrode area were observed.</description>

   <description>The ageing of high density polyethylene geomembrane (GM) liners used to minimize advection and diffusion of contaminants in municipal solid waste landfill leachate and in hydrocarbon spills to the environment is examined.&#xd;
&#xd;
The evaluation of the ageing of GMs used in landfills involved four components. First, a laboratory-accelerated ageing investigation of a GM exposed to air, water and leachate at elevated temperatures. Service life of a GM (Stage I: Antioxidant depletion, Stage II: Induction, and Stage III: Polymer degradation) is examined. The results demonstrate the critical role of antioxidants in protecting against oxidative degradation. The service life of the GM is predicted. Second, a study was conducted to provide an estimate of Stage I for a GM in a composite liner. The results indicated that immersion tests are too severe and the service life is substantially greater for a GM in composite liner than implied by leachate immersion tests. Third, a comparison of ageing with three different “protection” layers between the GM and overlying gravel and leachate is reported. A slower antioxidant depletion rate is observed when geotextile-geosynthetic clay liner and geotextile-sand-geotextile are applied than with a typical geotextile alone. This could be partially attributed to the attenuation of leachate constituents by the protection layer as well as the buildup of antioxidant concentration on either side of GM thereby reducing the concentration gradient and outward diffusive flux of antioxidants. Fourth, diffusion modelling is used to evaluate the results from immersion and composite liner simulation tests. Diffusion modelling provided a means for predicting the performance of the GMs in conditions other than the typical test conditions.&#xd;
&#xd;
The evaluation of the ageing of GM used in barrier system for hydrocarbon involved two components. First, untreated and fluorinated GMs immersed in jet fuel were tested. Results show that antioxidants depleted at slower rate from fluorinated GM than untreated GM. This suggested a significant beneficial effect of fluorination. Antioxidant depletion time is predicted at field temperatures. Second, the time dependant change in GM samples used at jet fuel containment site constructed in 2001 is reported. The GM is shown to be performing very well.</description>

   <description>Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) has been used internationally for the trenchless installation of utility conduits and other infrastructure. However, the mud loss problem caused by excessive mud pressure in the borehole is still a challenge encountered by trenchless designers and contractors, especially when the drilling crosses through cohesionless material. Investigation of mud loss problem is necessary to apply HDD with greater confidence for installation of pipes and other infrastructure.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The main objectives of this research have been to investigate the maximum allowable mud pressure to prevent mud loss through finite element analysis and small scale and large scale laboratory experiments. The recent laboratory experiments on mud loss within sand are reported. Comparisons indicate that the finite element method provides an effective estimation of maximum mud pressure, and “state-of-the-art” design practice- the “Delft solution” overestimates the maximum mud pressure by more than 100%. The surface displacements exhibit a “bell” shape with the maximum surface displacement located around the center of the borehole based on the data interpreted using Particle Image Velocimetry (Geo-PIV) program. &#xd;
&#xd;
A parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters such as the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest K0 on the maximum allowable mud pressure within sand. An approximate equation is developed to facilitate design estimates of the maximum allowable mud pressure within sand.  &#xd;
&#xd;
A new approach is introduced to consider the effects of coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest K0 on the blowout solution within clay. The evaluations using finite element method indicate that the new approach provides a better estimation of the maximum allowable mud pressure than the “Delft solution” in clay when initial ground stress state is anisotropic (K0 ≠1). Conclusion of this research and suggestions on future investigation are provided.</description>

   <description>Since the events of 9-11, aviation security has become a mounting concern for both the American and Canadian government.  Because of the alleged “threats to security,” the Canadian government has followed in American footsteps and enacted the Passenger Protect Program, otherwise known as the “no fly list.”  This thesis will examine the emergence of the Canadian version of the no fly list in the context of the U.S. “Secure Flight” program in order to analyze the claim that the Canadian list is unique and distinct from the American version.  Drawing from the literature on surveillance and risk, this thesis suggests that both lists are operating on the precautionary principle and are thus not distinct in purpose, process or overall outcome, and that a “made in Canada” approach is a misleading notion.  In fact, this thesis will show that the Canadian and U.S. governments continue to share no fly lists, use the same criteria and sources for placing an individual’s name on the list, and handle redress issues in the same manner.  Most importantly, the consequences for ordinary citizens are the same regardless of whether one finds themselves on the Canadian or the American list.  This thesis will (a) describe the origins of the no fly list in Canada and the USA, (b) examine the ways in which personal data are obtained from the Passenger Name Record (PNR), how these are used to construct the list(s) and how they are mined for further purposes and (c) what the consequences are for specific classes of persons, especially minorities, refugee and asylum claimants, civil libertarians, peace activists and others.</description>

   <description>Recently, a multi-resolution, hierarchical version of the hexagon mesh was introduced. In order for computers to display this mesh of hexagons, it must be triangulated. This thesis describes an algorithm to triangulate the multi-resolution, hierarchical hexagon mesh. The triangulation provides good triangle strips, which result in efficient rendering of the hexagon mesh, and well-proportioned triangles, which avoid rendering artifacts. This algorithm was designed for the rendering of hexagon meshes on the globe, though it currently does not support the pentagons of the truncated icosahedron.</description>

   <description>During orthopaedic surgery, preoperative CT scans can be aligned to the patient to assist the guidance of surgical instruments and the placement of implants.  Registration (i.e. alignment) can be accomplished in many ways: by registering implanted fiducial markers, by touching a probe to the bone surface, or by aligning intraoperative two dimensional flouro images with the the three dimensional CT data.  These approaches have problems: They require exposure of the bone, subject the patient and surgeons to ionizing radiation, or do both.  Ultrasound can also be used to register a preoperative CT scan to the patient.  The ultrasound probe is tracked as it passes over the patient and the ultrasound images are aligned to the CT data.  This method eliminates the problems of bone exposure and ionizing radiation, but is computationally more difficult because the ultrasound images contain incomplete and unclear bone surfaces.  In this work, we compare three methods to register a set of ultrasound images to a CT scan: Iterated Closest Point, Mutual Information and a novel method Points-to-Image.  The average Target Registration Error and speed of each method is presented along with a brief summary of their strengths and weaknesses.</description>

   <description>Maternal and fetal stressors during development can permanently alter various physiological functions and impact long-term health. These alterations are said to be programmed because they persist long after the original insult. Current evidence indicates that iron deficiency (ID) during pregnancy can induce a host of long-term programming effects, including cardiovascular complications and behavioural deficits.&#xd;
&#xd;
Despite the relevance of ID as a model of developmental programming, these effects have not been extensively studied. The purpose of the present series of experiments was to develop a model of maternal ID throughout pregnancy to study its long-term cardiovascular and behavioural consequences in neonatal and adult offspring.&#xd;
&#xd;
Female rats were fed either a low iron diet (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Fe) or a control diet (> 225 mg/kg Fe) prior to and throughout gestation. At birth, all dams were fed a control diet (270 mg/kg Fe). This treatment caused altered growth trajectories which persisted in adulthood. Adult perinatal ID (PID) offspring, despite showing no signs of anemia at that time, had persistent elevations in arterial pressure (AP), as well as enhanced responsiveness of AP to high and low sodium intake. These animals also had altered responsiveness of renal medullary blood flow to changes in AP. PID offspring also had altered function of intrarenal and vascular nitric oxide signaling. Similar studies performed in acute ID animals revealed opposite trends in intrarenal and vascular NOS function, as well as in effects on the cardiovascular system.&#xd;
&#xd;
In addition to the cardiovascular effects, adult PID male offspring exhibited a number of behavioural changes, as assessed by monitoring locomotor activity in their home cages (by radiotelemetry) as well as in a novel environment. PID male offspring also performed poorly in a Morris water maze compared to controls. These differences were not observed in female PID animals.&#xd;
&#xd;
In summary, these studies provide evidence that ID during gestation has deleterious effects on various aspects of the offspring’s physiology. Given the global incidence of ID, as well as its propensity to afflict pregnant women, developmental programming from this condition could have profound implications on global health.</description>

   <description>"Beyond the Ethnonational Divide: Identity Politics and Women in Northern Ireland and&#xd;
Israel/Palestine" is a comparative analysis of the conflict resolution processes and peace-building strategies employed in Northern Ireland and Israel/Palestine, focusing on the experiences of women’s feminist peace movements. I draw on feminist thought in the international relations and&#xd;
comparative politics literatures, as well as the critical identity politics literatures developed outside these fields, to demonstrate the value of broadening our understanding of social identity in conflict. In particular, I apply a post-positivist realist approach to identity to evaluate the extent to which women’s feminist peace communities develop untested ideas related to conflict resolution&#xd;
and peace-building in these cases. I argue that the dominant ethnonational conflict resolution literature, developed largely&#xd;
within the comparative politics field, advances an ‘elite accommodation’ strategy for resolving conflict that grants the most militant and sometimes violent ethnonational leaders the authority to speak for the body public during transformative constitutional moments. I propose that conflict resolution schemes that privilege ethnonational elite political figures and treat the interests of all actors in intrastate conflict as fundamentally derived from ethnonational interests do not produce a stable post-conflict period of peace and governance, they fail to secure human rights, equality guarantees and justice provisions for all communities in a post-conflict period, and they fail to&#xd;
capitalize on the local, participant knowledge and alternate visions of conflict resolution and peace that are developed in “subaltern” identity-based communities.&#xd;
In my view, when we consider the genesis and development of the feminist peace movements in Israel/Palestine and Northern Ireland, we can see how a politics based on solidarity&#xd;
and alliances, across ethnic, national, gender, class and sexuality divides, is informed by the endogenous conditions of conflict and also the exogenous development of transnational feminist theory and praxis. The negotiation of identity in women’s feminist peace communities has been complex and, at times, difficult. However, it has also led to the development of novel ideas related to peace, inclusion, human rights and justice that have been sidelined, to varying degrees, in the conflict resolution processes in both cases.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-24 10:02:24.877</description>
   <description>Medical education has been the subject of ongoing reform since the second part of the 18th century (Papa &amp; Harasym, 1999). Most recently, medical education has been redefined to include a broad set of competencies over and above traditional expertise. In an attempt to facilitate this approach, different instructional models have been proposed. Most of these seek to foster learner engagement and active participation and promote life-long learning. Nevertheless, there is no consensus amongst medical educators about the optimal way to teach future physicians.&#xd;
	Despite the efforts of both researchers and local champions, instructional innovations frequently fail. Fullan (2001) ascribes this to faulty assumptions on the part of planners as well as to the inherent complexity of the organizations involved, further stating that effective change requires some degree of reculturing. This study examines the process of educational change in an undergraduate medical course over a three-year period. Formerly taught exclusively by large class lectures, the course was redesigned to include a blend of e-learning and Team-Based Learning (TBL). The process of change is described and viewed in parallel from the perspectives of both student and teacher while uncovering contextual and process elements that contributed to the outcome. &#xd;
	Shifting student attitudes to teaching and learning were identified over time, suggesting that these evolve in parallel to faculty experience implementing a new teaching strategy. Van Melle (2005) has suggested that acceptance of educational innovation is dependent on the environment and organizational context. The results of this study highlight the importance of these factors in the successful introduction of a new instructional paradigm as well as the value of longitudinal evaluation of instructional changes in order to better understand their transformational potential.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Art History) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-26 09:01:22.591</description>
   <description>This thesis addresses the growing impulse towards establishing a public, national collection of Old Master pictures for Britain, located in London, in the last quarter of the eighteenth-century.  It does so by identifying the importance of individual conceptualizations of what such a collection might mean for a nation, and how it might come to be realized for an imprecisely defined public.  My thesis examines the shifting dynamics between private and public collections during the period of 1775 to 1800, repositioning notions of what constituted space for viewing and accessing art in a national context, and investigates just who participated in the ensuing dialogues about various uses of art for the nation.  To this end, three case studies have been employed.  The first examines the collection of pictures assembled by Sir Robert Walpole and their public legacy.  The second explores the proposal for a national collection of art put forth by art dealer Noel Desenfans.  The third examines the frustrated plans of Sir Joshua Reynolds for his collection of Old Master pictures.  &#xd;
	Through the respective lenses provided by the case studies, it is demonstrated that the envisioning of a national gallery for Britain pitched competing perspectives against each other, as different kinds of people jockeyed for cultural authority. The process of articulating and shaping these ambitions with an eye towards national benefit was only beginning to be explored, and negotiations of private ambitions and interests surrounding picture collections for the public was further complicated by factors of social class and profession.  This thesis demonstrate that the boundaries of participation in matters concerning art for the nation were not fixed regarding Old Master pictures and the value placed on them in late eighteenth-century London.</description>

   <description>DEAP (Dark Matter Experiment with Argon and Pulse Shape Discrimination) is&#xd;
an experiment that aims to directly detect dark matter particles via nuclear recoils&#xd;
in liquid argon. The experiment uses the scintillation property of liquid argon as a&#xd;
means to discriminate the γ and β backgrounds from the expected signal. DEAP-1&#xd;
is a 7 kg single phase liquid argon detector. It was constructed to demonstrate the&#xd;
scalability for a larger (3600 kg) detector. The detector was originally operated at&#xd;
Queen’s University, where the background rejection level achieved was 6.3×10−8 for&#xd;
the recoil detection efficiency of 97.1%. The detector was relocated to SNOLAB,&#xd;
where the background in the energy region of interest was reduced by a factor of&#xd;
7.7 (from 4.61±0.17 mHz to 0.60±0.05 mHz.). The background rejection level of&#xd;
9.64×10−9 (10.4 part per billion) was achieved from the combined data set (Queen’s&#xd;
University and SNOLAB) for a recoil detection efficiency of 35.5 ± 1.3 %. With&#xd;
the current background rate, the background rejection level required for the 3600 kg&#xd;
detector (1.8×10−9 ) is projected to be achieved in 382 days at the neutron efficiency&#xd;
of 9.1±0.6 %.</description>

   <title>MIMO-aware Medium Access Control in IEEE 802.11 Networks</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-26 10:11:16.729</description>
   <description>Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are dynamically self-organized and self-configured, where the nodes in the network automatically establish an ad hoc network and maintain mesh connectivity. These properties make WMNs a key technology for next generation wireless networking. However, supporting Quality of Service (QoS) to enable multimedia services is still one of the major issues in next-generation WMNs. &#xd;
&#xd;
In distributed systems like WMNs, the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is considered very important in the IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks, as it supports many crucial operational functions. Hence, QoS support in WMNs can be enhanced through the efficient cross-layer design of MAC protocols that utilizes advanced physical layer technologies viz Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) with its multiple spatial channels that are capable of simultaneous receive or transmit streams. MIMO has become a very attractive technology in providing support for different QoS requirements.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis we propose a novel QoS MIMO-aware MAC Protocol (QMMP). QMMP is a MAC protocol framework that exploits the MIMO system gains to boost QoS support. The proposed MAC framework includes the following components. The first component enables concurrent sharing of the increased MIMO bandwidth, i.e., instead of allocating all the spatial channels to one connection, connections can concurrently share the increase bandwidth via splitting the spatial channels. The second component reduces the medium access collisions problem. In distributed systems like WMNs, medium access collisions have a noticeably negative impact on resource (bandwidth) utilization as they leave the bandwidth unutilized for a long time. To address this problem, we propose a spatial channels sharing scheme during medium contention period. The third component boosts the bandwidth utilization during data transmission. We propose resource management schemes that adapt the physical data rate and the aggregation frame length according to the instantaneous channel quality. Then we propose a QoS-aware bandwidth provisioning mechanism that performs effective bandwidth distribution to further boost QoS support.</description>

   <title>The Role of Neu1 Sialidase in Toll-Like Receptor Activation</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-26 12:33:32.743</description>
   <description>Receptor glycosylation is critical in receptor-ligand interactions in immune cells, but the exact role of glycosylation in receptor activation upon ligand binding has not been elucidated. In neuronal cells, we have shown that when neurotrophic factors bind their respective Trk tyrosine kinase receptors, receptor activation and subsequent neurotrophin-mediated signaling is dependent upon the induction and activity of an endogenous sialidase enzyme. In this thesis, we report that toll-like receptor (TLR) activation upon ligand binding is similarly dependent on the induction of a cellular sialidase, which we have identified as Neu1 sialidase, which specifically targets and hydrolyses alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid residues on the receptor. Blocking Neu1 sialidase activity with specific inhibitor Tamiflu detrimentally impacts ligand-induced TLR4/MyD88 interaction, NFkappaB activation and TLR-mediated effector responses like nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Diminished cytokine production is also seen in vivo in Neu1-deficient mice.  We propose a mechanism for the induction of Neu1 sialidase, upon ligand binding to TLR, that involves the activation of heterotrimeric G-alpha protein-dependent G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling to activate a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzyme, likely MMP-9. It is suggested that MMP-(9) targets the cell surface elastin receptor complex of Neu1/protective protein cathepsinA/elastin binding protein (EBP), which potentially catalytically activates Neu1. In addition, we report an association between Neu1 and TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 on the plasma membrane that has not previously been described. The idea that the multiple functionality and diversity of TLRs and TLR-mediated signaling may be an immunologic paradigm capable of explaining all human disease is provocative but plausible. Certainly, the structural integrity of TLRs, their ligand interactions and activation are essential for immunological protection. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism of Neu1 sialidase regulation of TLR activation will provide important opportunities for disease control through TLR manipulation. The future directions of this research will also open a new area of glycobiology research (the glycomics of innate immune responses) and will widen the scope for the development of novel therapeutic drugs to combat infections and inflammatory diseases.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-27 10:09:43.902</description>
   <description>The collapse of buildings and infrastructure is an unfortunate consequence of major earthquakes (e.g., the 1964 Alaskan earthquake, the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan and the 2007 Pisco earthquake in Peru). Liquefaction-induced lateral spreading is known to be one cause of severe damage to deep foundation systems. However, the dynamic soil-structure interaction between liquefied soil and piles is extremely complex and further work is required to define the appropriate design pressures and to understand the mechanisms at work.&#xd;
This thesis presents the findings of an experimental program carried out using the large geotechnical centrifuge at C-CORE in St John’s Newfoundland, to investigate the mechanism of lateral spreading and its implications for dynamic soil-pile interaction. Soil and pile responses were measured using accelerometers, pore pressure transducers, and digital imaging using a high speed camera. Using these images, transient profiles of slope deformation were quantitatively measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). These tests illustrate the potential for earthquake shaking to excite the natural frequency of the liquefied soil column, which can lead to increased transient lateral pressures on piles in liquefiable ground. This study recommends that this potential for “auto tuning” should be anticipated in design and proposes a new limiting pseudo-static backbone p-y curve for use in the design of piles subjected to lateral spreading ground deformation.</description>

   <description>Environmentally friendly renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar energy systems are among the fleet of new generating technologies driving the demand for distributed generation of electricity. Power Electronics has initiated the next tech¬nological revolution and enables the connection of distributed generation (DG) systems to the grid. The challenge is to achieve system functionality without extensive custom engineering, yet still have high system reliability and generation placement flexibility. Nowadays, it is a general trend to increase the electricity production using DG systems. If these systems are not properly controlled, their connection to the utility network can generate problems on the grid side. Therefore, considerations about power generation, safe running and grid synchronization must be done before connecting these systems to the utility network.&#xd;
This thesis introduces a new grid-synchronization, or more visibly a new “power signal processor” adaptive notch filtering (ANF) tool that can potentially stimulate much interest in the field and provide improvement solutions for grid-connected operation of DG systems.  The processor is simple and offers high degree of immunity and insensitivity to power system disturbances, harmonics and other types of pollutions that exist in the grid signal. The processor is capable of decomposing three-phase quantities into symmetrical components, extracting harmonics, tracking the frequency variations, and providing means for voltage regulation and reactive power control.  In addition, this simple and powerful synchronization tool will simplify the control issues currently challenging the integration of distributed energy technologies onto the electricity grid. All converter-interfaced equipments like FACTS (flexible ac transmission systems) and Custom Power Controllers will benefit from this technique. The theoretical analysis is presented, and simulation and experimental results confirm the validity of the analytical work.</description>

   <description>The Bahamian Archipelago is one of the few locations in the world where ooid formation is actively occurring. Ooid cortices from six locations in the region were incrementally dissolved and analyzed for 14C, δ18O, δ13C, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios. Ooids were examined under SEM after each step in the incremental analyses to characterize the nature of dissolution. Radiocarbon dating indicates that surface ooids began forming across the Archipelago between 1000 and 2800 yr BP and continue to form today. &#xd;
The ooids have the same pattern of microboring alteration across the region.  The surface and outer cortex of the ooids are punctuated with unfilled microborings, whereas the inner cortex contains two morphologies of aragonite cement filling the microborings. The two morphologies of cement form in association with two different species of cyanobacteria, one is Solentia sp. the other is interpreted to be Hyella sp..  &#xd;
The chemistry of ooids from across the region is remarkably similar. δ18O and δ13C values for all samples vary directly, having a slope of approximately 1.  The outer cortex has low δ18O and δ13C values of -3.4‰ and 0.2‰ respectively, whereas the δ18O and δ13C values of the inner cortex are high with values of 1.9‰ and 6.8‰ respectively. The presence of aragonite cement in microborings in the inner cortex increases the overall isotopic composition of both oxygen and carbon in the ooid, causing it to appear close to equilibrium with seawater. The isotopic variation in δ18O and δ13C within the cortex can be characterized as a mixing line between the low values in the unaltered ooid laminae and the aragonite cement in the microborings. &#xd;
The most exterior portion of the ooid has very high Mg/Ca values and is interpreted as an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) coating. There are two other phases in the cortex, both being aragonite.  The outer cortex has a higher Mg/Ca ratio and lower Sr/Ca ratio than the inner cortex. This difference in chemistry is a result of the presence of aragonite cement in the inner cortex. &#xd;
Stable isotopic and trace element results coupled with SEM investigations indicate that microbes do not play a role in ooid formation, but instead alter the texture and chemistry of ooids after they have formed. This alteration occurs throughout the entire shoal region. A new model of ooid formation is proposed whereby a veneer of ACC precipitates on an ooid while it is at the sediment-water interface (the active phase).  This veneer of ACC later recrystallizes to aragonite needles, possibly nucleating on organic material and a new cortex layer is formed. Observations from this study lead to a deeper understanding of the chemical processes involved in ooid genesis, which allows for a better understanding of paleoenvironments hosting ooid formation.</description>

   <description>Traditional peripheral displays rely on drawing the user's attention and gaze through alerts. These displays function best when the central task does not require the user's constant attention. For tasks that require a user to always maintain focus, alert-based displays are not appropriate. We assert that conveying information to a user&#xd;
without drawing his gaze, allows the user to maintain constant focus on his primary task while still receiving additional information. In this thesis we use video games to examine streaming peripheral displays as a means of presenting information without drawing gaze.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results of our experiments showed no significant difference between user performance using our display encoded for peripheral viewing versus an unencoded display. Additionally, &#xd;
we found that players were successfully able to perceive information shown on a streaming peripheral display, however, as game difficulty increased the effectiveness of the streaming peripheral display decreased. Finally, we show that as game level increases, users adopt risk-tolerant strategies. Drawing from these results, we have suggested some additional heuristics pertaining to streaming peripheral displays. Moreover, we have suggested further situations where streaming peripheral displays may be useful.</description>

   <description>A case study approach is used to examine two formative computer based assessments (CBAs) used in a School of Medicine and Faculty of Education at a Canadian university. Both assessments contained primarily scenario-based, multiple-choice items however the number of items and complexity was different. The formative CBAs were examined in terms of how feedback is provided to students, the effectiveness of different types of feedback, and the characteristics of items used for assessment. Feedback was channelled to students in one case, immediately following responding to an item and in the second case, at the end of a set of items. Feedback given to students immediately following an item was more effective given that the timing captured students’ construction of knowledge. The most favoured type of feedback provided additional information. Students also indicated that feedback using a live internet link to direct them to a resource would be acceptable. Although feedback that simply stated a response was correct or incorrect was previously shown to be ineffective, students from the School of Medicine indicated this type of feedback was acceptable for low cognitive items. In both case studies, students reported that more items were required and in one case study, students recommended these items be added at the higher end of the cognitive scale.</description>

   <title>Fps/Fes Kinase Regulates Cytoskeletal Reorganization and Migration of Mast Cells</title>

   <description>Mast cells are granulocytes that require signaling from the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase Kit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) for their maturation and function. In addition to providing growth and survival signals, the Kit receptor is involved in crosstalk to β1 integrins leading to mast cell adhesion, spreading, and migration on fibronectin (FN). Previous studies reported the involvement of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases Fps/Fes and Fer in signaling downstream of the high affinity IgE receptor in mast cells and identified cell migration defects in Fer-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Fps/Fes also becomes phosphorylated downstream of the Kit receptor in BMMCs, and this involves the action of the Src family kinase Fyn as an upstream activator of Fps/Fes. In this study, the Fps/Fes SH2 domain was observed to bind the phosphorylated Kit receptor in vitro, suggesting that the SH2 domain plays a role in the activation mechanism of Fps/Fes. To investigate the function of Fps/Fes in Kit signaling, BMMCs were generated from wild-type and Fps/Fes-null mice. Analysis of downstream effectors revealed that Fps/Fes is required for maximal p38 MAPK signaling. Further examination of Fps/Fes-deficient BMMCs revealed increases in adhesion, spreading, and a defect in cell polarization on full-length FN (a ligand for multiple β1 integrins), compared to wild-type BMMCs. Similar phenotypes are observed using an α5β1 integrin-specific FN fragment (9-11) as the matrix. Reduced phosphorylation of the putative Fps/Fes substrate HS1 (a cortactin homologue involved in actin regulation) is observed in Fps/Fes-deficient BMMCs, compared to control cells, and this may contribute to the observed cytoskeletal defects. Restoring Fps/Fes expression in Fps/Fes-deficient BMMCs by retroviral transduction results in a rescue of cell spreading, polarization, and chemotaxis defects to levels similar to those of wild-type cells. This thesis provides novel insights into the potential mode of Fps/Fes activation downstream of the Kit receptor, and a role for Fps/Fes in regulating crosstalk between Kit and α5β1 integrins to promote cytoskeletal reorganization and motility of mast cells.</description>
