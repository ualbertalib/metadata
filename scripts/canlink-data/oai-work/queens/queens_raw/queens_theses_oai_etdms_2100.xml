   <description>This thesis presents results from a qualitative study of how young women make sense of their fitness practices. Fitness practices related to diet and exercise are culturally linked to both appearance and health and tend to focus more on changing or maintaining the outside of body (appearance) rather than the inside (health) (Carlisle Duncan, 1994; Dworkin &amp; Wachs, 2009; Smith Maguire, 2008).Young Canadian women are inundated with messages from both the public and private sectors about the imperative to be healthy. Many of these messages suggest that getting healthy will change our lives for the better.  Four university-educated, middle class, white women; the demographic which is most marketed to by the fitness industry (Rhode, 2010; Smith Maguire, 2008) were recruited to take part in a study about how they understand their fitness practices. My research involved a focus group and individual follow-up interviews with each of the four participants. Discussion topics included participants’ perceptions of the ideal body that applies to them and what participants saw their motivations and influences for their fitness practices to be.The data arising from the group shifted the project’s focus from “fitness” toward broader questions about what it means to be “healthy” in today’s culture. In the context of pervasive neoliberal notions of health, my analysis explores some lines of intersection between social class and fitness/health as they relate to discourses of physical capital (Bourdieu, 1978, 1996; Shilling, 2003, 2004) and healthism in today’s society (Crawford, 1980, 2006). My analysis reveals that many young women are negotiating a paradox in that they engage in fitness practices, despite their knowledge of feminist body image critiques.  The desire to build and convert physical capital and the intense pressure to appear “healthy” in the midst of a supposed “obesity epidemic” are strong motivators for the women’s fitness practice routines. The young women in my study are reifying a socially constructed hierarchy of bodies which favours thin bodies over fat bodies.</description>

   <description>With the rise of capillary HPLC systems, open tubular liquid chromatography (OTLC) has been garnering more attention due to the possible fundamental advantages of open tubular systems over conventional packed or monolithic systems. Performance has yet to reach its potential due in part to a variety of technical challenges, resulting in the need for very small injection volumes and sensitive detection. In this work, we have shown that with modern HPLC sample introduction and detection systems, along with careful fabrication of polymer stationary phases, that reverse phase open tubular liquid chromatography may be within reach.  We have shown that, with small diameter (i.d. 30m) open tubular columns, complex multi-component mixtures (EPA 610, in-house drug mixture) can be separated.  We have also shown that these columns are robust and can function over a wide range of flow rates (200-1000 nl/min), and may be useful for general reverse phase separation in the future.  However, currently, more stationary phase development and procedure refinement is needed.  &#xd;
    Microstructured fibres (MSFs), a relatively new class of optical fibre which confine light within fibres through a refractive index change caused by the use of parallel air channels running throughout the length of the fibre, are explored as a new support material for open tubular liquid chromatography. The fine channel structures of MSFs enable reasonable sample volumes to be used compared to conventional open tubular systems, while offering a similar plug-like flow profile through the fibre.  With current sample introduction and flow technologies, we have shown that the potential advantages of MSF columns is great even when simple C18 stationary phases are used; this was able to separate a four PAH mixture.   However, a distribution in channel sizes caused by current manufacturing standards and a limited ability to evenly deposit polymer stationary phases in the fibres has kept MSF columns from reaching their full potential.</description>

   <description>FES protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activation downstream of the KIT receptor in mast cells (MC) promotes cell polarization and migration towards the KIT ligand Stem cell factor (SCF). A variety of tumours secrete SCF to promote MC recruitment and release of mediators that enhance tumour vascularization and growth. This study investigates whether FES promotes MC migration via regulation of microtubules (MTs), and if FES is required for MC recruitment to the tumour microenvironment. MT binding assays showed that FES has at least two MT binding sites, which likely contribute to the partial co-localization of FES with MTs in polarized bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Live cell imaging revealed a significant defect in chemotaxis of FES-deficient BMMCs towards SCF embedded within an agarose drop, which correlated with less MT organization compared to control cells. To extend these results to a tumour model, mouse mammary carcinoma AC2M2 cells were engrafted under the skin and into the mammary fat pads of immune compromised control (nu/nu) or FES-deficient (nu/nu:fes-/-) mice. A drastic reduction in tumour-associated MCs was observed in FES-deficient mice compared to control in both mammary and skin tissue sections. This correlated with a trend towards reduced tumour volumes in FES-deficient mice. These results implicate FES signaling downstream of KIT, in promoting MT reorganization during cell polarization and for chemotaxis of MCs towards tumour-derived SCF. Thus, FES is a potential therapeutic target to limit recruitment of stromal mast cells or macrophages to solid tumours that enhance tumour progression.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores the potential for ethico-politically committed cultural critique in investigating lived experiences of gender in the hegemonic global north, where the neo/liberal rhetoric of sexual equality tends to portray issues of gender as already sufficiently addressed. It argues that the ideological roots of dominant gender discourses can be productively explored through the interrelated histories of Christianities and neo/liberalisms that have powerfully shaped mainstream Canadian society. Supported by an extensive body of literature bringing religious studies, feminist, and queer theory to bear on sociological and political questions, this rhetoric is investigated by applying critical discourse analysis to transcripts of interviews conducted over a year of participant observation with the members of a local United Church women’s discussion group. Findings suggest a complex set of attachments, rejections, and ambivalent attitudes toward those elements of feminism that have entered into the social, cultural, political and economic discourses that have become dominant in Canada. The discussion of results considers the forces which produced respondents’ general complacency with the status quo of gender equality along with their hesitancy to make judgments about the validity of competing claims regarding gender ethics. Analysis concludes by examining the implication of these attitudes for the prospects of gender justice movements, especially those conceived in terms of allyship and coalition-building at the intersection of different axes of identity and practice.</description>

   <title>The Search for Continental Security: The Development of the North American Air Defence System, 1949 to 1956</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, History) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-14 14:08:14.101</description>
   <description>This dissertation examines the development of the North American air defence system from the beginning of the Cold War until 1956. It focuses on the political and diplomatic dynamics behind the emergence of these defences, which included several radar lines such as the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line as well as a number of initiatives to enhance co-operation between the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). This thesis argues that these measures were shaped by two historical factors.&#xd;
                                          The first was several different conceptions of what policy on air defence best served the Canadian national interest held by the Cabinet, the Department of External Affairs, the RCAF and the Other Government Departments (OGDs), namely Transport, Defence Production and Northern Affairs. For the Cabinet and External Affairs, their approach to air defence was motivated by the need to balance working with the Americans to defend the continent with the avoidance of any political fallout that would endanger the government‘s chance of reelection. Nationalist sentiments and the desire to ensure that Canada both benefited from these projects and that its sovereignty in the Arctic was protected further influenced these two groups. On the other hand, the RCAF was driven by a more functional approach to this issue, as they sought to work with the USAF to develop the best air defence system possible. Finally, the positions of the OGDs were shaped by more narrow priorities. For example, C.D. Howe and the Department of Defence Production sought to use these joint radar projects to build up the Canadian electronics industry. Canada‘s air defence policy in the 1950s, therefore, was a compromise between these various conceptions of the national interest.&#xd;
&#xd;
The other major influence on this process  was the attitude of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations towards continental air defence. This dissertation will argue that most of the measures to improve the security of the continent emerged because of the efforts of the United States, but at the same time, the Americans‘ level of interest in these defences varied greatly over this period and ultimately were not sustained. Moreover, both these administrations had to overcome opposition from the USAF‘s senior leadership, which preferred an emphasis on the offensive nuclear forces of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) over improved air defences. This dissertation thus makes an important and original argument that contributes to the scholarly literature on the Canada-U.S. defence relationship during the early Cold War.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-14 14:03:42.479</description>
   <description>This thesis presents a sociological framework for understanding food allergy. Food allergy is increasingly appearing on policy and media platforms in contemporary Western societies. Debates have emerged about the prevalence of food allergy and also about the “rights” of those experiencing food allergies in a number of public and private spheres. Food allergy is a specifically social phenomenon, emerging as a consequence of modernization processes. Additionally, the allergy “zone” is comprised of a number of actors and agents including the institutions of medicine, pharmaceutical companies, politicians, governments, lay actors and an array of medical technologies. Despite being an issue of major sociological significance, few empirical studies have explored the everyday experience of food allergy. Therefore, in order to understand the lived experience of food allergy, I construct a conceptual framework which draws upon theories of risk and social governance, the sociology of consumption and sociological studies of science and embodiment. These literatures shed important light upon how individuals negotiate and (de)construct the risks associated with their conditions. Drawing on data acquired from eight in-depth interviews with those who identify as food allergic, I argue food allergy need be understood as a form and practice of consumption. Thus, far from being passive subjects, this approach characterises individuals as being embodied and reflexive agents who actively deconstruct notions of risk and recurrently engage in practices of “edgework”. These actors negotiate the medical and scientific parameters of their conditions as well as the parameters and demands of consumer culture. Whilst these theoretical and conceptual frameworks are useful for understanding the experience of food allergy, I recommend further studies of food allergy acknowledge the diversity of actors/institutions involved in the discursive production and circulation of information about food allergy; specifically homeopathic and alternative practitioners and organizations. Additionally, I argue that future studies of allergy must acknowledge the fundamentally embodied experience of the condition and the consequences this has for its definition and experience. For the purposes of future studies of food allergy, I also suggest it would be worthwhile to further explore the ways in which individuals who experience food allergies and intolerances are enrolled and participate in biopolitical regimes.</description>

   <title>Australia’s Strategic Culture: An investigation of the concept of strategic culture and its application to the Australian case</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-15 11:17:19.326</description>
   <description>The notion that each state in the international system approaches matters of war and peace somewhat differently because they each possess a unique strategic culture is not a new or obscure one – but it nevertheless remains controversial. While some scholars dismiss the utility or practicality of examining states’ cultures when seeking to explain or predict those states’ patterns of strategic decision-making, even amongst those who accept that we should pay attention to cultural differences between states when carrying out strategic analysis there remains a frustratingly eclectic range of offerings from scholars regarding how best to do so. In short, significant uncertainty remains regarding both whether strategic culture should be used as an analytical tool and, if it is so utilized, how one should go about doing so.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis therefore explores the concept of strategic culture in great detail, both theoretical and empirical. The opening three chapters examine why the more traditional rationalist/materialistic theories should not exclusively dominate strategic analysis, then the various existing strategic cultural offerings are considered and critiqued and, finally, a new conceptual model for strategic cultural analysis is proposed which draws from the hitherto largely neglected psychological and sociological literature. Both of these fields, it is submitted in Chapter 3, have spent more time and effort developing ways of understanding and analyzing culture than the field of IR has to date, and therefore the models and methods debated and developed in these fields should, it is argued, be ‘imported’ into IR to drive further strategic cultural research. The thesis then moves in the following six chapters to consider Australia’s strategic culture. The purpose of this part of the thesis is two-fold: first, it illustrates how the model offered in Chapter 3 works and, by implication, suggests how scholars may go about applying it to other cases. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the latter six chapters  explore the twists and turns of Australia’s substantive strategic decision-making over the course of the last century or more, thereby explaining how Australia’s strategic history can be understood from a cultural perspective.</description>

   <description>Amidine-based switchable surfactants can be used as stabilizers during emulsion polymerization and the resulting latexes can then be destabilized by the removal of CO2. High Tg polymers have been successfully redispersed, as shown by recovery of primary particle size (measured by light scattering methods), but an input of energy was required. Sonication was the first method used, but lower-energy methods such as rotor-stators and a blender have also been successful in redispersing aggregated latexes. Colloidal stability was found to be reversible for at least three aggregation/redispersion cycles, and redispersibility was retained after the removal of water and addition of fresh water. Stimuli-responsive polymer colloids with reversible colloidal stability may have many uses. The shipping of latexes, for example, would be easier and less energy intensive if the latex particles could be aggregated and the bulk of the water removed. The latexes would then have to be redispersed prior to use. &#xd;
Switchable surfactants have also been used for the semi-continuous copolymerization of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate to form a high solids content (42 wt%), low-Tg latex. The latex can be destabilized with air and heat but cannot undergo redispersion because the low Tg polymer particles fuse upon aggregation. The copolymer, when dried at room temperature, formed a continuous film. Latexes with high solids content and low Tg’s are representative of latex paint formulations. Because the switchable surfactants have been shown to be successful in preparing these latexes, it is possible that they may be useful in the latex paint industry, for example as fast setting paints.</description>

   <description>In the vestry of the cathedral church of Santa Maria in Toledo hangs a large painting by El Greco entitled El Espolio, the ‘Disrobing of Christ’. Executed shortly after his arrival in Spain the painting marks a major stylistic departure from the artist’s earlier work and would command attention on that basis alone. The subject, while iconographically obscure, is, at another remove, utterly familiar as a Passion scene tied to a well known iconographical canon. Compositionally, the Christ figure predominates but the ‘legionnaire’ occupies a contrasting and almost equivalent space in his carapace of steel. These figures beg for further elaboration&#xd;
I will argue that this painting can be read as a nexus between a reformed liturgy and a post-Tridentine programme of Church renewal in Spain allied to a monarchical programme of nación under Philip II (1527-98) that was essentially one and the same.&#xd;
The salient questions needing a response are these: How, in a vestry, can we expect such a subject to have much impact beyond the very limited audience it was designed for? This is the crux of the matter in many ways. What in the painting suggests more than the straightforward analysis of the subject matter? What in the times suggests another reading of this great work of art?&#xd;
The pursuit of the answers to these questions constitutes the driving force behind this investigation. Biography, the intellectual and artistic formation of the artist, are positioned with reference to the intellectual ferment of the period, the religious upheaval&#xd;
iii&#xd;
in Christendom, the advances in the understanding of the nation state. More specifically, the altered relationship between the monarchy and the church in Spain, following the Council of Trent (1545-63)will be shown to have a reflection in El Espolio.&#xd;
El Greco’s work has mostly been treated as the product of a painter of the spirit, of religiosity, even of mysticism. El Espolio has been interpreted here within a broader frame of reference and the argument suggests our understanding of El Greco’s oeuvre has been somewhat narrow.</description>

   <description>The vascular endothelium is a single layer of cells that lines the interior surface of our blood vessels. The endothelium plays a key role in vasoprotection and vasoregulation and its proper function is therefore essential to the maintenance of vascular health. The endothelial cells respond to the frictional force (shear stress (SS)) that occurs with an increase in blood flow. As a response, vasoactive substances are released, causing the artery to dilate, this is termed flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Endothelial cell function can be assessed by measuring the vasodilatory response to an increase in SS. Currently however, our ability to interpret the results of FMD assessment in order to make accurate judgements regarding arterial health is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the “dose-response” relationship between SS and FMD. The dose-response relationship is characterized by 1) the SS stimulus required to elicit an FMD response (threshold), 2) the magnitude of dilation for a given increase in SS (the slope of the SS-FMD relationship), and 3) the point at which further increases in SS no longer elicit dilation (the ceiling). The primary purpose of the current study was to characterize the magnitude and day-to-day variability of the parameters described above. N=20 males (mean 22-years). Brachial artery diameter (BAD) and blood velocity (BV) were assessed with echo and Doppler ultrasound. SS was estimated as shear rate (SR=BV/BAD). Subjects performed 2 incremental handgrip exercise trials on two separate visits (V1 and V2). CV=co-efficient of variation. The SS-FMD relationship was characterized by a shallow slope followed by an inflection point (threshold (T1)) and a steeper slope (pre vs. post T1 slope p=0.002). There was no difference between V1 vs. V2 in the SR-FMD slope or threshold (p>0.05), but there was considerable within-subject variability in the SR-FMD parameters: pre-T1 slope CV = 47.0 ± 33.1%; post-T1 slope CV = 55.3 ± 40.7%; T1 CV = 25.6 ± 6.3%. In conclusion, %FMD did not plateau with increasing SR, therefore no ceiling was identified. The inflection in slope may indicate the involvement of different or additional vasodilator mechanisms post-threshold.</description>

   <title>Validation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method for Direct Numerical Simulation of Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows</title>

   <description>In this work, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was validated for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of wall-bounded turbulent flows. The LBM is a discrete-particle-based method that numerically solves the Boltzmann equation as opposed to conventional DNS methods that are based on the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The advantages of the LBM are its simple implementation, its ability to handle complex geometries, and its scalability on modern high-performance computers.&#xd;
&#xd;
An LBM code was developed and used to simulate fully-developed turbulent channel flow. In order to validate the results, the turbulence statistics were compared to those calculated from a conventional NS-based finite difference (FD) simulation. In the present study, special care was taken to make sure the computational domains for LBM and FD simulations were the same. Similar validation studies in the literature have used LBM simulations with smaller computational domains in order to reduce the computational cost. However, reducing the size of the computational domain affects the turbulence statistics and confounds the results of the validation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The turbulence statistics calculated from the LBM and FD simulations were found to agree qualitatively; however, there were several significant deviations, particularly in the variance profiles. The largest discrepancy was in the variance of the pressure fluctuations, which differed by approximately 7%. Given that both the LBM and FD simulations resolved the full range of turbulent scales and no models were used, this error was deemed to be significant.&#xd;
&#xd;
The cause of the discrepancy in the pressure variance was found to be the compressibility of the LBM. The LBM allows the density to vary, while the FD method does not since it solves the incompressible form of the NS equations. The effect of the compressibility could be reduced by lowering the Mach number, but this would come at the cost of significantly increasing the computational cost. Therefore, the conclusion of this work is that, while the LBM is capable of producing accurate solutions for incompressible turbulent flows, it is significantly more expensive than conventional methods for simple wall-bounded turbulent flows.</description>

   <description>The notion that learning and memory processes are highly dependent on central cholinergic neurotransmission has been widely accepted. However, studies documenting the importance of Acetylcholine (ACh) in attention have led some to suggest that attention impairments may underlie the deficits in learning and memory resulting from cholinergic disruptions. Using a visual discrimination task, I attempted to discern whether performance impairments by Scopolamine were predominantly due to the importance of muscarinic receptor integrity in attention, or memory consolidation in learning. Rats were trained in a visual discrimination task using a Y-shaped water maze apparatus. To successfully navigate to a hidden platform located in one of the two goal arms, rats learned to discriminate between 2 distinct visual cues, indicating the platform’s presence (CS+) or absence (CS-), respectively. Following task acquisition, testing continued using a combination of Regular trials (RT; both CS+ and CS- present) and Probe trials (PT; only one of the cues present). Results indicated that performance on PT was impaired due to greater task difficulty under conditions of reduced information, while Scopolamine (1 mg/kg) further impacted PT performance without affecting RTs. In a second experiment, PTs were administered with the platform present to provide reinforcement and a learning opportunity. Animals still exhibited poorer PT performance, but rapidly learned to rely on a single cue for accurate platform localization. Interestingly, this learning was not apparent under conditions of Scopolamine treatment (1 mg/kg), even though RT performance was completely unaffected. To examine experience-dependent changes in neuronal responding after visual discrimination learning, a subset of animals were anesthetised and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in V1 and area CA1 of the hippocampus were recorded in response to CS+, CS-, and novel stimuli. In both the V1 and CA1, the VEP amplitudes elicited to familiar and novel stimuli were not significantly different. First, these experiments demonstrate the importance of the cholinergic system in sustaining visual attention and acquiring a new single-cue strategy. Furthermore, the null electrophysiology findings do not rule out the plastic response properties of the mature V1 and CA1, but remind us of the complex nature of memory encoding in the brain.</description>

   <description>Solar grade silicon is currently produced mainly through blending semiconductor grade silicon waste with metallurgical grade silicon. As the demand for solar cells continues to increase rapidly, soon demand will outstrip supply of semiconductor grade silicon waste. A process for producing solar grade silicon efficiently and without relying on other industries is needed. It is proposed to produce solar grade silicon of 6N purity (99.9999%) by reacting silicon tetrachloride with aluminum monochloride via the following reaction:&#xd;
2 AlCl(g) + SiCl4(g)= Si(s) + 2 AlCl3(g)&#xd;
Aluminum monochloride is proposed as the reductant for silicon tetrachloride because it is an extremely strong reducing agent and the reaction will produce all gaseous by-products. Additionally, the aluminum trichloride produced can be recycled to form more aluminum monochloride, which is produced by reacting aluminum metal with aluminum trichloride in the following reaction:&#xd;
AlCl3(g) + 2 Al(l)= 3 AlCl(g)&#xd;
High yields of AlCl have only been found above 1200°C, with very little AlCl present in equilibrium with Al and AlCl3 at lower temperatures. The high temperatures under which AlCl can be found in larger quantities makes it difficult to determine if the AlCl3 reacting with Al is actually producing AlCl as opposed to another subhalide such as AlCl2. Numerous IR spectroscopy studies have been undertaken to confirm that the reaction of aluminum trichloride gas with molten aluminum does produce aluminum monochloride, with all such studies confirming that this theoretical path is correct. Unlike previous studies, which pass the AlCl3 gas over molten aluminum, it is proposed to bubble the AlCl3 gas into the molten aluminum. This should increase yield of aluminum monochloride, which was not a priority in previous studies. &#xd;
In order to achieve the project objectives a literature review of silicon manufacturing techniques as well as aluminum monochloride production was completed. Experiments to determine the rate of sublimation of aluminum trichloride were to be done in order to determine what temperature at which to sublime the aluminum trichloride. Aluminum trichloride was bubbled into aluminum metal to form aluminum monochloride with experimental conditions being varied to increase yield. Yield was determined through analysis of the reaction products, which was difficult due to the instability of aluminum monochloride, which dissociates at room temperature back into aluminum trichloride and aluminum metal. After the yield of aluminum monochloride was maximized, silicon tetrachloride was introduced into the reactor to react with the aluminum monochloride to form silicon metal.</description>

   <description>Effective everyday hearing requires the auditory system to organize auditory input into perceptual streams corresponding to objects of interest. Changes in this process may be responsible for age-related deterioration in the capacity to effectively hear important sounds masked by background noise. Younger (18-25) and older (55+) adults with healthy hearing listened to 10-second intervals of a simple pattern of “ABA” tone triplets. The ABA patterns are used as a model of real-world auditory streaming, because they are initially perceived as one integrated stream, and over time are reorganized into two segregated streams. Participants performed a target-detection task designed to index their perceptual organization of the tones, which does not depend on potentially-biased, subjective judgment (Thompson, Carlyon, &amp; Cusack, 2011). Complex tones with narrowly-spaced, unresolvable frequency components were used in this experiment to control for age-related decreases in frequency selectivity. Both groups demonstrated a capacity for segregating the A and B tones based on differences in harmonic spacing, as predicted. However, despite our acoustic controls the older adults showed significantly less segregation of the 6ST stimuli, indicating that there are additional age-related changes in auditory streaming, which make them less likely to segregate in response to harmonic spacing differences. Additionally, older adults showed significantly better overall performance on the task than younger adults, indicating that the age differences are not simply due to age-related deficits in task execution. The ABA intervals were presented either continuously, or with 5-second interruptions prior to each trial that have previously been shown to “reset” perceptual streaming back to an integrated percept (Cusack, Deeks, Aikman, &amp; Carlyon, 2004). For both age groups interruptions preceding the ABA intervals were shown to be capable of resulting in decreased segregation, as predicted. Targets were presented at 4 time points (2, 4, 6, and 8 seconds) in order to test for age differences in the time course of streaming. In the results for the 8-semitone stimuli, we observed strong evidence for delayed build-up in older adults, in response to the Gap condition. However, this evidence was not statistically conclusive and future experiments are needed determine the effect’s validity.</description>

   <description>Electrochemically formed passive layers on titanium and zirconium, and their optical, surface and corrosion properties are presented.  With the use of higher applied AC voltages, the passive layers become thicker and more protective of the underlying metal, as determined from thickness measurements by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam instruments, as well as passive layer corrosion resistance measurements by electrochemical polarization curve and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry experiments.  The surface morphology of all samples was studied with atomic force microscopy, profilometry, visible light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and finally electron backscattered diffraction experiments.  The passive layers were found to be uniform in their surface structure with no cracks or fractures.  However, the samples prepared at VAC = 60-80 V showed defects, which were increasingly prevalent at higher VAC.  These defects are thought to be attributed to a process of localized electrochemical breakdown.  The aforementioned increase in corrosion resistance is in spite of the defects, which were observed for the samples prepared at VAC = 60-80 V.  Surface morphology, in relation to optical properties, was also investigated through reflectance spectroscopy measurements.  A correlation between grain colouration and light reflected from the sample surface was observed through measurements using visible light microscopy as well as near infrared ultraviolet visible reflectance spectroscopy.  These experiments showed a red-shift of wavelength maxima (λmax) values as voltages, and therefore thickness, were increased.  This is the reason that different colours are seen for different thicknesses; the red shift causes different wavelengths to be reflected constructively and destructively.  Overall, these passive layers are protective of an already remarkable metal and, with greater knowledge of their properties, their potential may be observed in a wide range of applications.</description>

   <description>The Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling of aryl halides and aryl boronic esters has become one of the most important and oft used C-C bond forming reactions in industry and academia alike. Recently, substantial effort has been invested in expanding this reaction to include alkyl boronic esters as coupling partners, though until recently, success has been limited to primary alkyl boronic esters. Secondary alkyl boronic esters, with the inherent possibility of being chiral, have proven to be more difficult to couple. As a means of expanding our program on the enantio- and regioselective hydroboration of styrene derivatives, we sought to develop conditions that could couple benzylic (secondary) boronic esters. Not only was the coupling to aryl iodides achieved in moderate to good yield with a commercially available (and relatively cheap) catalyst system and phosphine, but the coupling reaction proceeds with almost complete retention of the stereochemistry installed during the hydroboration reaction. Interestingly, these conditions leave primary (linear) alkyl boronic esters completely untouched. Further examination of the chemoselectivity of the reaction revealed that, despite being unable to cross-couple strictly aliphatic secondary boronic esters, our silver-mediated protocol was able to effectively cross-couple chiral allylic boronic esters in high yield and good regioselectivity.&#xd;
The asymmetric syntheses of novel secondary boronic esters have also been developed to overcome the substrate limitations of the hydroboration reaction. Together with our effective cross coupling strategy, these novel chiral boronic esters have led to&#xd;
the synthesis of exciting new classes of molecules, most notably, the asymmetric triarylmethanes.&#xd;
Finally, the stability of mesoporous silica supports used in Pd catalysis was assessed. Though silica supports effectively reduce Pd-contamination in reaction mixtures to sub-ppm levels, their long-term reusability is hindered by material degradation caused by harsh reaction conditions. It was found that aqueous base, required for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, is responsible for silica degradation and the collapse of mesostructure. Interestingly, it was determined that the reaction itself had a protective effect on the material, with the boric acid side-product mitigating the deleterious effect of the base.</description>

   <description>It is difficult to develop a program that is completely free from vulnerabilities. Despite the applications of many approaches to secure programs, vulnerability exploitations occur in real world in large numbers. Exploitations of vulnerabilities may corrupt memory spaces and program states, lead to denial of services and authorization bypassing, provide attackers the access to authorization information, and leak sensitive information. Monitoring at the program code level can be a way of vulnerability exploitation detection at runtime. In this work, we propose a monitor embedding framework DESERVE (a framework for DEtecting program SEcuRity Vulnerability Exploitations). DESERVE identifies exploitable statements from source code based on static backward slicing and embeds necessary code to detect attacks. During the deployment stage, the enhanced programs execute exploitable statements in a separate test environment. Unlike traditional monitors that extract and store program state information to compare with vulnerable free program states to detect exploitation, our approach does not need to save state information. Moreover, the slicing technique allows us to avoid the tracking of fine grained level of information about runtime program environments such as input flow and memory state. We implement DESERVE for detecting buffer overflow, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting attacks. We evaluate our approach for real world programs implemented in C and PHP languages. The results show that the approach can detect some of the well-known attacks. Moreover, the approach imposes negligible runtime overhead.</description>

   <description>This study examined the societal factors and subjective beliefs that are hypothesized to be affecting the lives of trans persons accessing Ontario health care services. The purpose of this study was to uncover information pertaining to trans persons’ needs and fulfillments within Ontario’s health care system in order to discover what the specific health care needs of trans persons accessing health care services are as well as if they are alienated and/or systemically discriminated against when seeking medical attention. The research questions were addressed through a secure, anonymous, online questionnaire taking approximately 30 to 45 minutes to complete. A small sample of 18 to 26 individuals who identified as trans, living in Ontario and have accessed, or are currently accessing, Ontario health care services were recruited through relevant list-servs and website postings. Participants accessed a variety of open-ended and closed questions concerning sociodemographics, sexuality, health care access experiences, and  health care needs. Qualitative results showed that access to Ontario health care is complicated by race, class and language for participants in this study. Experiences for trans persons with Ontario health care services varied from individual to individual; some reported no negative experiences at all, some have been refused services by the Center for Addiction and Mental Health’s Gender Identity Clinic, and some avoided health care services entirely due to discrimination from medical professionals.</description>

   <description>This project questions western hegemonic discourse about the non-western Other, specifically the Muslim woman subject, through a post-colonial critical point of view. It takes the debate on Islamic feminism, especially in North American academy as a departure point of a discussion relating that discourse to the western feminist arguments over the usefulness and nature of Islamic feminism. The project has two phases: One summarizes and discusses the Islamic feminism debate in North American academia while second takes secular feminism in contemporary Turkey as a field of study where the debates on Islamic feminism in North America resonate and are reproduced at the discursive level. The project analyzes the special volume of secular feminist journal Pazartesi on religion in order to ask whether a colonialist/orientalist discourse underpins the refusal to acknowledge Islamic feminism as a feminist endeavour for gender equality from within Islam for both the western academic community and secular feminist circles in Turkey.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis was to develop the first examples of multifunctional triarylboron-functionalized 8-hydroxyquinoline, their respective aluminum (III) complexes, Al(1)3 and Al(2)3, and diboron analogues, B1 and B2. There was particular focus in investigating the electron accepting characteristics of these systems for potential use as electron transport materials (ETMs) in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).&#xd;
The first part of the thesis will discuss the aluminum complexes. Through the introduction of the triarylboron moiety these derivatives of the well-known ETM tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) exhibited better electron accepting properties than the parent compound. Furthermore, the complexes were able to act as sensors and indicators towards soft Lewis acids such as CN- and hard Lewis acids such as F-, respectively.  &#xd;
First the structures of the compounds were investigated using COSY NMR, leading to the discovery that similar to Alq3 the new aluminum complexes possessed the commonly observed mer-isomeric form. Furthermore, their photophysical characteristics were investigated using UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic measurements. The solid state fluorescence quantum yield of Al(1)3 (Φ=0.06) and Al(2)3 (Φ=0.02) were measured and compared to Alq3 (Φ=0.14). In order to better understand these results and gain insight into the electronic transitions of the aluminum complexes, DFT calculations were employed using the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. &#xd;
The second part of the thesis will discuss the only examples of diboron-functionalized 8-hydroxyquinoline complexes to date, with one three-coordinate and one four-coordinate boron moiety. Based on CV measurements and DFT calculations, it was discovered that the LUMO of the diboron compounds were lowered substantially compared to their aluminum analogues discussed earlier. More interestingly, it was found that only B1 has any contributions to its LUMO from the triarylboron moiety, leading to the slightly stronger electron accepting ability of B1 compared to B2. Furthermore, these compounds were both able to act as sensors towards small anions such as F-.</description>

   <description>A sound understanding of rock mass characteristics is critical for the engineering prediction of tunnel stability and deformation both during construction and post-excavation.  The rock mass modulus of deformation is a necessary input parameter for many numerical analysis methods to describe the constitutive behavior of a rock mass. Tests for determining this parameter directly by in situ test methods are inherently difficult, time consuming and expensive, and these challenges are more problematic when dealing with tunnels in weaker, softer rock masses where errors in modulus (stiffness) estimation have a profound impact on closure predictions.  In addition, rock masses with modest structure can be candidate sites for highly sensitive structures such as nuclear waste repository tunnels. For these generally stiffer rock masses, the correct modulus assessment is essential for prediction of thermal response during the service life of the tunnel.&#xd;
Numerous empirical relationships based on rock mass classification schemes have been developed to determine rock mass deformation modulus in response to these issues. The empirical relationship provided by Hoek &amp; Diederichs (2006) based on Geological Strength Index (GSI) has been determined from a database of in situ test data describing a wide range of rock masses with GSI values greater than 25 and less than 80. Within this range of applications there is a large variation in measured values compared to the predicted relationship and predictive uncertainty at low GSI values.  In this research, a practical range of rock mass quality, as defined by GSI, including "Blocky\Disturbed\Seamy" rock masses, "Very Blocky" and relatively competent rock masses are analyzed using discretely fractured numerical models. In particular the focus is on tunnel response. Tunnel closure in these simulations is compared to predictions based on modulus estimates.  The proposed refinement to the Generalized Hoek-Diederichs relationship is made on the basis of these simulations for tunnelling applications.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-22 02:48:14.824</description>
   <description>Analog circuits that operate with low voltage supply headroom generally suffer from poor linearity performance, poor noise performance, etc. However, with the aggressive scaling of the supply voltage in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology and the advent of System-On-Chip (SOC) technologies, it is inevitable that these circuits are to be operated with low voltage supply headroom. In this thesis, three low-voltage Integrated Circuits (IC) for Radio Frequency (RF) communication systems are presented. They are all designed and fabricated with 0.13um CMOS technology. Their experimental verifications are performed on die with Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) probes.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first circuit is an ultra-low-voltage low-power single-balanced $\times$2 subharmonic down-conversion mixer. A linearity analysis for the inductive source degenerated transconductor of the mixer is provided using Volterra series. This analysis provides a guideline for designing the inductive source degenerated transconductor with high linearity at the RF frequency of 8.6 GHz. The circuit achieves a conversion gain of 6.0 dB and an $IIP_{3}$ of -8.0 dBm at the RF frequency of 8.6 GHz while consuming 0.6 mW of DC power with the supply voltage of 0.6 V.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second circuit is a low-voltage low-noise wideband down-conversion mixing frontend that consists of a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) and a passive mixer. The linearity analysis for the LNA, which is used as a transconductor, is analyzed using Volterra series. Through this analysis, the trade-off between noise cancellation and distortion cancellation is discussed. A simple distortion cancellation scheme that decouples the design guidelines from this trade-off is proposed. From 300 MHz to 1.2 GHz, the circuit achieves a conversion gain of 8.8 dB and a maximum $IIP_{3}$ of -0.8 dBm, while having less than 4.8 dB noise figure. The overall circuit consumes 24.0 mW of power with the supply voltage of 0.9 V.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third circuit is a low-voltage low-noise wideband active balun. The linearity analysis for the active balun circuit is also analyzed using Volterra series. The design consideration involving noise cancellation and distortion cancellation is discussed through this analysis. A simple distortion cancellation scheme that aims at improving the linearity performance of the circuit with low-voltage supply constraint is proposed. From 300 MHz to 2.4 GHz, the circuit achieves an average voltage gain of 15.5 dB and a maximum $IIP_{3}$ of -1.7 dBm, while having less than 4.0 dB noise figure from 500 MHz to 3.0 GHz. The overall circuit consumes 15.8 mW of power with the supply voltage of 0.9 V.</description>

   <description>This thesis is about exploring and theorizing about the contemporary meanings and (re)production of El Güegüense, a politically charged ancient Nicaraguan dance-drama.  The ethnographic affair revolves around the researcher’s experiences learning the Güegüense tradition at the Nicaraguan Academy of Dance in Managua. Utilizing “the apprenticeship” as methodology, which has perhaps most effectively been teased out in Loïc Wacquant’s (2004) Body and Soul, the researcher fleshes out under what circumstances one becomes a practitioner of the Güegüense tradition, what it means to be a cultural performer, and whether this ancient physical tradition still demonstrates and embodies its anti-colonial themes.  After conducting interviews with leading practitioners, the author utilizes the performance as a vector of knowledge and speaks not only to how the performance culturally manifests but also to how contested its meanings truly are, as well as the recent depoliticizing of the performance, which it is argued is a direct result of the state becoming involved with this ancient physical tradition.</description>

   <description>While engineers and their patrons have always claimed that technology has advanced the common good, I intend to show that more often than not engineers have been mercenaries for those at the center of knowledge, power, and wealth. Engineers design technology that marginalizes certain types of knowledge, people, and culture in favor of those at the center. Far from being a common good, engineered systems have advanced social and environmental inequity by being designed using exploitative social, political, and economic methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
In response to the negative impacts of engineered systems, the mainstream engineering profession has committed in recent years to being much more socially and environmentally responsible. However, the discourse of responsibility adopted by the profession is narrow in scope as it does not recognize the context and process in which technology is designed. Seeking a different way, some engineering reformers are attempting to create different cultures in engineering, in which the technology designed by engineers not only minimizes damage but seeks to create more equity in our communities.&#xd;
&#xd;
These new cultures have been articulated as Humanitarian Engineering or Peace Engineering or Social Justice and Engineering. A key component of these cultures is the concern for the needs of the marginalized whether in communities far away or close to us. While much has already been written about changing the education curriculum, little has been written about how engineers may design technology that values and advances knowledge, people, and culture at the margins.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis will theorize as to how engineers may design technology in a socially just manner by articulating an engineering design theory based on power and resistance. This design theory is then validated through discourse analysis of a contentious engineering project, the Site 41 landfill in northern Ontario. I show through the analysis of engineering design discourse at Site 41 that dominant power relations created structures of oppression that marginalized non-experts, Aboriginal communities, and the environment. Alternative design methods that resist these oppressive structures such as participatory, ecofeminist, deep ecological, and decolonized design are proposed as a way for engineers to have worked more justly at Site 41.</description>

   <description>Provoked Vestibulodynia (PVD) is a common form of chronic genital pain, affecting approximately 12% of premenopausal women. Even though knowledge of vulvodynia has been present in the medical field for many years, it was previously thought to be of psychogenic origin and has never been thoroughly investigated for the purpose of pain classification. When investigating any pain condition, one of the most important distinctions to make is whether or not the pain is neuropathic. Even though this possibility has never been investigated in women with PVD, some have claimed that PVD pain contains elements of neuropathy, even treating this pain with medication created for neuropathic pain conditions. The purpose of this study was to use standardized measures and determine whether PVD may have a neuropathic component.&#xd;
Women with PVD completed an online survey assessing various pain and psychosocial variables. Their responses were compared with those of pain-free controls and women experiencing an established neuropathic pain condition, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Women with PVD scored above established cut-offs on measures of neuropathic pain (NP). Further, for some NP measures there was no difference in scores between PVD and PHN women. Women with PVD also had similar psychosocial profiles as those with PHN, although women with PHN reported poorer health-related quality of life. Interestingly, the number of NP symptoms did not predict pain/psychosocial disturbance, or vary as a function of pain duration or intensity. Overall, these results lend support to the argument that PVD is a chronic pain condition. Further, these results indicate that women with PVD likely experience some form of NP. These results add to the understanding and classification of PVD, justifying further investigation, for example, via psychophysical testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

   <description>Attitudes toward human germline engineering were assessed across three studies. In Pilot Study One, we evaluated participant familiarity ratings for a preliminary item pool consisting of potential targets of germline modification in order to screen out unfamiliar targets. The results were used to screen out 54 of 170 items. In Pilot Study Two, we used participant representativeness ratings to validate categorizations for the remaining items by removing items that were indifferently representative of specific goals (therapeutic or enhancing) and types (physical, cognitive, or personality) of germline modifications. The results also indicated that for many items, the distinction between cognitive and personality characteristics broke down, leading us to collapse these categories into a new type category based on general psychological traits. In Study One, we compared mean approval ratings for potential targets of germline engineering sorted according to the goal of modification (therapeutic or enhancing) and the type of characteristic being targeted (physical or psychological). The results indicated that approval was higher for therapeutic modifications than for enhancing modifications, and higher for modifications targeting physical traits than for those targeting psychological traits. A regression analysis showed that approval correlated positively with knowledge, Big Five Agreeableness, and negatively with perceived risk and female gender. Contrary to expectations, approval did not correlate with psychological essentialism or Big Five Openness. Implications and limitations are discussed.</description>

   <description>The Hippo-LATS signaling pathway originally identified in Drosophila is conserved in mammalian systems and serves essential roles in mediating size control as well as tumorigenesis.  In humans, the core kinase cassette consisting of adaptor proteins WW45 and MOB1, and Ser/Thr kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2 signal by phosphorylating and inactivating transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ, causing cell growth arrest.  As the central kinases within the Hippo-LATS pathway, examining the cellular and molecular phenotypes of LATS1 and LATS2 (LATS) will provide insight into the role of this pathway in tumorigenesis.  &#xd;
By simultaneously knocking down both LATS1 and LATS2, genes that were differentially expressed were identified through a whole human genome microarray screen.  The multitude of genes identified including CYR61, MYLK, CDKN1A, SLIT2, and TP53INP1 not only provide further evidence for the role of LATS in cell proliferation and apoptosis, but also implicate LATS in novel functions such as cell motility.  Loss of LATS1 and/or LATS2 enhances cell migration whereas overexpression of LATS1 dramatically inhibits cell migration in multiple cell lines.  The ability of LATS to regulate cell migration occurs through two potential mechanisms.  Firstly, LATS functions through its kinase substrates YAP and/or TAZ, or alternatively, LATS1 directly binds actin and inhibits actin polyermization.  Thus, through loss of functions studies, we identified a novel role for LATS in regulating cell migration as well as novel mechanisms of LATS function.&#xd;
As an important signaling molecule within the cell, LATS and the Hippo-LATS pathway are tightly regulated.  Using clues from the Drosophila pathway, we examined how the previously uncharacterized gene, hEx, functions within this pathway.  Importantly, this thesis characterizes hEx as a putative tumor suppressor showing that it can inhibit cell proliferation, sensitize cancer cells to Taxol treatment as well as inhibit tumor growth in nude mice.  However, unlike Drosophila expanded, hEx functions independently of the Hippo-LATS pathway, suggesting that the mammalian signaling pathway is more complicated.&#xd;
The research findings from this thesis enhance our knowledge of the Hippo-LATS pathway in tumorigenesis by elucidating new functions and mechanisms of LATS functions as well as by exploring how upstream components function in relation to this pathway.</description>

   <description>Patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) often experience cognitive impairment that accompanies degeneration of the motor system. A valuable tool for assessing cognitive control over behaviour is the antisaccade task which requires: 1) inhibition of the automatic response to&#xd;
look towards an eccentric visual stimulus (prosaccade) to instead 2) redirect gaze in the opposite direction of the stimulus (antisaccade). Psychometric tests were used to quantify the degree of impairment, while eye tracking, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural MRI were combined to identify the neural correlates of cognitive impairment in ALS. We predict&#xd;
ALS patients will have executive dysfunction and grey matter loss in executive and oculomotor control areas that will affect antisaccade performance and will alter the corresponding brain activation. ALS patients and age-matched controls participated in a rapid-event-related fMRI design with interleaved pro- and antisaccade trials. Catch trials (no stimulus presented after&#xd;
instructional cue to prepare pro- or antisaccade) allowed us to discern the preparatory period from the execution period. ALS patients were biased towards automatic saccade responses, and&#xd;
had greater difficulty with antisaccades relative to controls in terms of correct and timely responses. We found that worsened antisaccade performance in ALS correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. Generally, we found trends of increased brain activation during the&#xd;
preparatory period of antisaccades in ALS patients compared to controls in most oculomotor areas; meanwhile few differences were seen during execution. Structural analyses revealed ALS patients had decreased grey matter thickness in frontotemporal and oculomotor regions such as the frontal and supplementary eye fields (FEF, SEF) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). These findings suggest that loss of structural integrity and executive dysfunction may elicit compensation mechanisms to improve functional and behavioural performance. Despite this compensation, ALS patients still performed worse on antisaccades than controls. Further investigation to expand the current data set should improve our ability to assuredly identify the neural correlates of cognitive decline in ALS, and may provide a model system to use for critical evaluation of future therapies and interventions for ALS.</description>

   <description>This study, employing sequential explanatory mixed methods research design, examined: 1) the academic self-concept, academic motivation, and academic achievement of Indian immigrant adolescents in Canada in comparison to their peers in India; 2) the mediational role of academic motivation in the association between academic self-concept and academic achievement among Indian immigrant adolescents and Indian adolescents; and 3) the perspectives, beliefs, and recommendations of Indian immigrant adolescents and Indian adolescents in regard to classroom environments/instructional practices affecting their academic engagement and achievement. Surveys were administered among secondary students in Canada (N = 355) and India (N = 363) to assess their academic self-concepts, academic motivation, and academic achievement. Eight focus group interviews were conducted, four each in Canada and India, to glean the perceptions and views of Indian immigrant and Indian adolescents. Descriptive discriminant analysis (DDA) revealed that the Indian immigrant adolescents in Canada did not differ markedly from their counterparts in India. When non-standardized GPA scores were used, English and overall school GPAs and verbal self-concept were associated with group separation in DDA. When standardized GPA scores were used, however, verbal self-concept alone was associated with group separation in DDA. Mediation analyses indicated the mediational role of intrinsic motivation in the association between academic self-concept and academic achievement among Indian immigrant and Indian adolescents. Extrinsic motivation as well mediated the relations between academic self-concept and academic achievement for the Indian immigrant adolescents in Canada. Focus group discussions suggested that the Indian immigrant and Indian adolescents were primarily extrinsically motivated toward school and academics. Further, both the Indian immigrant and Indian adolescents perceived their classroom teachers as controlling rather than autonomy-supportive. Implications of the findings for educational practice and future research are discussed.</description>

   <description>The presence of a blind adjacent to a window affects the natural convective air flow over the window and natural convective heat transfer from the window to the room. Most numerical studies of convective heat transfer between a window-blind system and a room are based on the assumption that the flow remains laminar. However, in the case of larger windows it is to be expected that transition to turbulent flow will occur in the flow over the window. The aim of the present study was to numerically determine the effect of Venetian blind on laminar-to-turbulent transition in the flow over a simple recessed window and on the convective heat transfer from the window. An approximate model of a recessed window that is covered by a venetian blind has been considered. The fluid properties have been assumed constant except for the density change with temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this being dealt with using the Boussinesq approach. Radiant and conductive heat transfer effects have been neglected. However in the present study the case where there is a constant heat generation rate in the blind slats, as the result of solar radiation absorbed by the slats of the blind, has been considered. The k-epsilon turbulence model with the full effects of the buoyancy forces being accounted for has been used in obtaining the solution. The turbulent, steady and two dimensional governing equations have been solved using the commercial finite-volume based CFD code FLUENT. Results are generated for different blind slat angles, for different distances of the pivot point of the slats from the window and for different constant heat generation rates in the slats. The results show that over a wide range of Rayleigh number, the distance of the blind to the window has a stronger effect on the convective heat transfer from the window and also on the laminar to turbulent transition in the flow over the window than the blind slat angle. Heat generation in the slats increases the Mean Nusselt number and this effect increases as the Rayleigh number decreases.</description>

   <description>Robert Agnew’s general strain theory (1992, 2001, 2006a) proposes that strain leads to crime and deviance. Substance use is a specific type of criminal behaviour that the theory attempts to explain. This thesis uses general strain theory to examine how a number of specific types of strain – homelessness, childhood abuse, criminal victimisation, and sex work – are related to substance use. In addition, the relationships between strain and negative emotions are examined. This thesis also examines how the relationships between strain and substance use are conditioned by negative emotionality/low constraint, deviant peers, deviant values, coping skills, self-esteem, and emotional support. Finally, the role of gender in all of the above-mentioned relationships is explored. In short, this thesis represents a fairly comprehensive test of general strain theory as it applies to substance use. In order to conduct this test, data was obtained between May 2009 and August 2010 by administering a survey to 400 homeless street youth in Toronto, Ontario.&#xd;
	The results yield substantial support for some of GST’s main propositions. In particular, support is found for hypothesized relationships between strain and substance use as well as strain and negative emotions. Additionally, certain factors are found to condition the relationships between strain and substance use. Finally, gender differences in the relationships between strain and substance use are observed. These supportive results suggest that general strain theory is a novel way of explaining substance use by homeless street youth in Canada. Consequently, suggestions for future research and social policy are offered.</description>

   <description>The work presented herein focuses on expanding the use of CO2-triggered switchable surfactants in emulsion polymerization of hydrophobic and hydrophilic&#xd;
monomers. Bicarbonate salts of the following compounds were employed as surfactants in the emulsion polymerization of styrene, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and/or butyl methacrylate (BMA): N’-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethylacetamidine (1a), N’-dodecyl N,N-dimethylacetamidine (2a) and N’-(4-decylphenyl)-N,N-dimethylacetamidine (3a). A systematic study of the effects of surfactant and initiator concentrations and solids&#xd;
content on the resulting particle size and ζ-potential was carried out, showing that a wide range of particle sizes (40 – 470 nm) can be obtained. It was found that as the basicity of the surfactant decreased, the particle size generated from emulsion polymerization increased. Destabilization of these latexes did not require the addition of salts and was carried out using only non-acidic gases and heat. It was shown that solids content,&#xd;
temperature, particle size and surfactant basicity greatly affect the rate of destabilization of latexes. The area occupied by N’-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylacetamidinium acetate on PMMA particles was determined to be 104 Å2. The monomer-D2O partition coefficient of 2a was determined to be 21 for styrene and 2.2 for MMA. The monomer-D2O partition coefficient of the bicarbonate salt of 2a was determined to be 1.2 for styrene and&#xd;
0.85 for MMA. An initial assessment of the use of switchable surfactants in the generation of inverse emulsions was carried out. It was determined that butylated polyethyleneimine (BPEI) can successfully stabilize inverse emulsions of cyclohexane and aqueous 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate. Upon CO2 introduction, this emulsion separates into two distinct phases.</description>

   <title>Detection of Chemical Compounds Using Amplified Fiber Loop Ring-Down Spectroscopy</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-23 18:27:47.65</description>
   <description>Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is an absorption spectroscopic technique. In&#xd;
CRDS the concentration of an analyte is determined by measuring the reduction in finesse of an optical cavity made from two highly reflective (R>99.9%) mirrors once a sample is introduced.&#xd;
Optical loss is traditionally determined from the exponential intensity decay of a short laser pulse that was injected into the cavity. This decay is the longest for an empty, high finesse cavity and&#xd;
is reduced when the sample absorbs or scatters light.&#xd;
In this project, the optical cavity is made from fiber optic waveguides and the light source is a continuous wave (cw) diode laser. It is used to detect analytes such as acetylene, ammonia&#xd;
and other amines through their overtone absorption in the telecom region at 1500 nm. The experiment is done by increasing the ratio of desired loss (extinction caused by the sample), to undesirable loss (from the waveguide or solvents) through amplification of the ringdown signal using an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). The EDFA is inserted into a fiber-optic loop and its gain is increased above the lasing threshold. The gain of the, now lasing, fiber loop is "clamped" to a high and constant value, thereby removing unwanted gain fluctuations, and all losses in the loop are compensated for. If one now inserts a laser light pulse at the lasing wavelength of the loop it would circulate through the loop indefinitely, whereas a light pulse at a wavelength that is being absorbed by an analyte would experience a decrease with time at a rate that depends only on the magnitude of the sample absorption. By enclosing the sample gap with a gas cell both acetylene and ammonia have been detected down to ~25 ppm and ~5.9 Torr respectively. Subsequently, a 1% solution of aminotoluene was detected in an interrogation&#xd;
volume of 5.65 pL by having inserted a fiber with a hole drilled in it as the sample gap. At present, the drilled fiber has been replaced with photonic crystal fiber such that small volumes of gases may be detected with a longer effective path length.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Art History) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-27 12:34:58.813</description>
   <description>The objective of my thesis is to extend the scholarship on colour in painting by focusing on how it is employed within the structuring framework of the orthogonal grid in the paintings of three contemporary artists, Ad Reinhardt, Agnes Martin and Gerhard Richter. Form and colour are essential elements in painting, and within the “essentialist” grid painting, the presence and function of colour have not received the full discussion they deserve. Structuralist, post-structuralist and anthropological modes of critical analysis in the latter part of the twentieth century, framed by postwar disillusionment and skepticism, have contributed to the effective foreclosure of examination of metaphysical, spiritual and utopian dimensions promised by the grid and its colour earlier in the century. &#xd;
Artists working with the grid have explored, and continue to explore the same eternally vexing problems and mysteries of our existence, but analyses of their art are cloaked in an atmosphere and language of rationalism. Critics and scholars have devoted their attention to discussing the properties of form, giving the behavior and status of colour, as a property affecting mind and body, little mention. The position of colour deserves to be re-dressed, so that we may have a more complete understanding of grid painting as a discrete kind of abstract painting. &#xd;
Each of the three artists I have examined here employed colour and grid in strategies unique to their work and its purposes. Ad Reinhardt arrived at his 1960s “black” paintings out of a background that included strong political beliefs, resistance to the dominant strain of 1950s Abstract Expressionism, and a deep interest in eastern religions and Buddhism. Agnes Martin shared Reinhardt’s interest in Buddhism and eastern religions, but chose to move toward the light in the atmospheric colour of her paintings, speaking of the quest for perfection of the mind in her writings and interviews. Gerhard Richter’s colour charts, a longstanding major subset of the vast range of this prolific artist’s work, speak to a need to go beyond his love of painting to the ungraspable substance of colour itself.</description>

   <description>Most of the conventional communication systems use channel interleaving as well as hard decision decoding in their designs, which lead to discarding channel memory and soft-decision information. This simplification is usually done since the complexity of handling the memory or soft-decision information is rather high.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, we design two lossy joint source-channel coding (JSCC) schemes that do not use explicit algebraic channel coding for a recently introduced channel model, in order to take advantage of both channel memory and soft-decision information.&#xd;
The channel model, called the non-binary noise discrete channel with queue based noise (NBNDC-QB), obtains closed form expressions for the channel transition distribution, correlation coefficient, and many other channel properties. The channel has binary input and $2^q$-ary output and the noise is a $2^q$-ary Markovian stationary ergodic process, based on a finite queue, where $q$ is the output's soft-decision resolution.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also numerically show that the NBNDC-QB model can effectively approximate correlated Rayleigh fading channels without losing its analytical tractability. The first JSCC scheme is the so called channel optimized vector quantizer (COVQ) and the second scheme consists of a scalar quantizer, a proper index assignment, and a sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder, designed to harness the redundancy left in the quantizer's indices, the channel's soft-decision output, and noise time correlation. We also find necessary and sufficient condition when the sequence MAP decoder is reduced to an instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder, i.e., a simple instantaneous mapping.</description>

   <description>The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is important during development of neural crest-derived tissues, particularly the enteric and sympathetic nervous systems, and in kidney morphogenesis.  Activation of RET requires complex formation between a member of the Glial cell line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor family of ligands and a member of the GDNF-Family Receptor α co-receptors. Upon complex formation, RET becomes phosphorylated and subsequently activates multiple downstream signaling pathways, including those for cell-survival, differentiation, and migration. Mutations in RET can either interfere with or enhance normal RET signaling. Inhibiting RET mutations are associated with development of Hirschsprung disease, which is characterized by a lack of mature ganglia in the gut. Conversely, activating RET mutations are associated with several thyroid cancers. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is frequently associated with sporadic translocations between RET and other genes, known collectively as RET/PTC. A variety of heritable RET missense mutations lead to Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2, which is associated with development of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Two cellular processes disrupted downstream of RET in these diseases are gene-expression and cell-migration. In order to clarify the effects of oncogenic mutations on gene-expression downstream of RET, we analyzed expression microarrays in a model using single mutant and isoform RET expression. We also examined the molecular mechanisms of cell-migration, using both functional cell-based assays and examination of integrins, cell-adhesion molecules important for cell-migration. Finally, we used a large cohort of thyroid tissues to examine RET and integrin expression. We showed that different forms of oncogenic RET do not affect transcription of different target genes, but rather target-gene transcription is proportional to phosphorylatability of mutant RET. We were also able to show that RET leads to activation of at least two integrin subunits (ITGB1 and ITGB3), and that they have unique activation patterns downstream of RET that correlate with cell-adhesion and migration. Finally, we showed that co-expression between RET, ITGB1, and ITGB3 is more frequent in malignant subtypes of thyroid tissues and that their co-expression is correlated to more aggressive thyroid cancer subtypes. Together, we have clarified how RET is able to mediate two important processes, gene-expression and cell-migration.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores the varied and often conflicting ways in which literacy is addressed in Canadian discourse in order to propose a progressive way forward for Canadian literacy policy.  The historically conventional meaning of literacy, that of the ability to read and write, is increasingly falling out of favour among theorists, educators and policymakers alike.  It remains, however, a dominant influence in how literacy is written about today, and more progressive theories, such as notions of critical literacy, multiliteracies, and literacy as communication across difference, rest in the peripheries.  This thesis examines the ways in which current organizations in Canada are negotiating between literacy’s conventional meaning and the myriad of progressive literacy theories that have been developed in academia.  The conceptual framework that informs the research is influenced by cultural theorists Stuart Hall, Paulo Freire, Henry A. Giroux, Edward Said and Michel Foucault, and work that they have done relating to communication, education, difference and power.  This thesis gathers data from the websites of three national literacy organizations, Frontier College, World Literacy Canada, and ABC Life Literacy, as well as from  Bill C-401, “An Act to establish a national literacy policy.”  Taken together, they allow for generalized conclusions about what literacy theories have been incorporated into contemporary Canadian discourse, and what further work and challenges lie ahead for a progressive national literacy policy.</description>

   <description>Reported in this thesis are the studies of micellar aggregates of four triblock copolymers and the unimolecular micelles of a triblock copolymer.  &#xd;
The micelles were prepared from BCF and ACF copolymers.  Here A, B, C, and F denote poly(acrylic acid), poly(tert-butyl acrylate), poly(2-cinnamoyloxylethyl methacrylate), and the liquid crystalline poly(perfluorooctylethyl methacrylate) block, respectively.  At room temperature (21 oC) in solvents that were selective for the A or B blocks, three of the four copolymers formed exclusively cylindrical micelles regardless of their block ratios.  Cylindrical micelles were formed because their geometries best accommodated the mesogen-ordering requirement of the core-forming F block, as supported by the results from wide angle X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetric studies.  Mesogen-driven cylinder formation was further supported by the observation of ridges formed by collapsed coronal chains on the surfaces of dried cylinders.  We also observed a morphological transformation from other micellar morphologies to cylindrical micelles at 70 oC, which is near the isotropic-to-smectic A phase transition temperature for the F blocks.  This inter-conversion between the vesicular and cylindrical micelles of an ACF sample could be reversed repeatly by temperature cycling.   These results provided additional evidence for the mesogen-driven micellization hypothesis.  &#xd;
Unimolecular micelles were prepared from CDC triblock copolymers, where D and C denote poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(2-cinnamoyloxylethyl methacrylate), respectively.  In selective solvents for the D block at high dilutions, the D chain formed a loop, and the terminal C blocks of the isolated unimer chain associated together as a globule, thus closing the loop and rendering a cyclic structure.  Alternatively, the terminal C blocks formed individual globules, thus yielding a pompom-coil-pompom structure.  To lock in these structures, the globules were photo-crosslinked.  The D block chain was subsequently enlarged for AFM observation through a quaternization step, which increased the chain’s diameter and introduced cations to the chain.  The semi-flexible thickened polymer chains and the globules were observed by AFM, confirming unambiguously the hypothesized architectures of the unimolecular micelles.  The AFM images also allowed the quantification of the macrocyclic structures, and a correlation between the direct AFM results and determined from a traditional size exclusion chromatography technique.</description>

   <description>There is a dearth of studies investigating attention and cognitive executive functions (EFs) in adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), dyslexia, and AD/HD with comorbid dyslexia. Of the available studies, few have compared cognitive performance based on comprehensive theoretical models of attention and EFs and addressed methodological limitations of past research (e.g., sample inclusion and task validity confounds). This dissertation  reports the findings from  two studies which examined attention performance and performance pertaining to EFs and  related cognitive processes of vigilance and processing speed for  four groups of postsecondary students, those with AD/HD, dyslexia, AD/HD with comorbid dyslexia, and  normal controls. Using a diagnostically referred sample to ensure distinct disability groups and attention and EFs measures with demonstrated construct validity, cognitive task performance was examined in Study 1 based on Posner and Raichle’s (1994) model of attention which is composed of alerting, orienting, and executive attention networks. In Study 2, Pennington and Ozonoff’s (1996) conceptualization of EFs that includes inhibition, set shifting, and working memory components was applied to the students’ performance on attention, EFs (inhibition, set shifting, and working memory), vigilance, and processing speed measures. Results from the two studies showed that the groups with attention deficits (AD/HD and comorbid groups) exhibited vigilance, executive attention, and EFs deficits related to inhibition and set shifting. The groups with reading impairments (dyslexic and comorbid groups) displayed a specific EF deficit in auditory working memory and a processing speed response time deficit. The common etiology hypothesis, which posits that cognitive deficits in comorbid groups are the sum of deficits found in AD/HD and dyslexia alone, best described the performance of the comorbid group.  The results are discussed with respect to identification/assessment, compensatory strategies, and educational interventions in postsecondary students with AD/HD and dyslexia. The studies emphasize that comparing cognitive performance based on comprehensive theoretical models of attention and EFs and addressing sample inclusion and task validity confounds can effectively delineate cognitive deficits in adults with AD/HD and dyslexia.</description>

   <description>Most vertebrates suffer permanent damage after minutes of anoxia. Many insects however, have part of their life cycle in anoxia or constant hypoxia, such as during their egg-hatching phase, by living as deep burrowers, or at high altitudes. Insects are able to survive in anoxia from hours to days, or even months by developing various strategies through evolution. For example, the locusts (Locusta migratoria) enter a reversible coma during anoxia that is associated with an arrest of ventilation, and a reinitiation of ventilation when returned to normoxia. This coma is correlated with a surge in the concentration of extracellular potassium ions ([K+]o), and recovery from this reversible coma is dependent on re-establishing the functional [K+]o. Prior exposure to a sublethal heatshock (HS)-preconditioning grants locusts a temporary resilience to anoxia; however, the molecular mechanisms of this protection are still unclear.&#xd;
This project investigated the effects of HS-preconditioning on locusts’ ventilation, the total enzymatic activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase, as well as its distribution within the metathoracic ganglion and tested the hypothesis that HS-preconditioning alters locusts’ ventilation and increases the totally Na+/K+-ATPase activity and its concentration within neuronal membranes. I&#xd;
recorded electromyograms of locusts’ ventilatory motor patterns in the presence and absence of anoxic coma by placing a copper wire electrode on ventilatory muscles 161 or 173 in control and HS-preconditioned animals. In addition, I studied the enzymatic activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay and the localization of the Na+/K+-ATPase&#xd;
using immunohistochemistry in control and HS-preconditioned locusts at different stages of&#xd;
coma. I found that the ventilatory cycle period was decreased and the ventilatory muscle burst duration was increased after recovery from anoxic coma in HS-preconditioned locusts. I also found that anoxia did not affect the activity or the localization of the Na+/K+-ATPase. However,&#xd;
HS-preconditioning increased the total activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase and the localization of the Na+/K+-ATPase within the neuronal membranes. From this project, I concluded that HSpreconditioning affected locusts’ ventilatory motor pattern after recover from anoxia and increased the total activity and the neuronal membrane localization of the Na+/K+-ATPase.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the livelihood strategies of African dock workers in Durban, South Africa, between the Anglo-Boer War and the 1959 strikes. These labourers did not conform to common conceptions of radical dock workers or conservative African migrant workers. While Marxist scholars have been correct to stress the working class consciousness of Durban’s dock workers, this consciousness was also more ambiguous. These workers and their leaders displayed a peculiar mix of concern for workers’ issues and defences of the rights and interests of African traders.&#xd;
	Many of Durban’s dock workers were not only wage labourers. In fact, only a minority had wages as their only source of income. The Reserve economy played a role in sustaining the consumption levels of their households and, more importantly, more than half of the former dock workers interviewed for this research engaged in some form of commercial enterprise, often based on the pilferage and sale of cargoes. Some also teamed up with township women who sold pilfered goods while the men were at work. This combination of commercial strategies and wage labour has often been overlooked in the literature. By looking at these livelihood strategies, this dissertation considers how rural and urban economies interacted in households’ strategies and reinterprets the reproduction of labour and the household in order to move beyond dichotomies of proletarian versus rural consciousness. &#xd;
	The dock workers’ households were neither proletarian households that were forced to reside in the countryside because of apartheid, nor traditional rural homesteads with a missing migrant member. The households were reproduced in three geographically separate spheres of production and consumption, none of which could reproduce the household on its own. These spheres were dependent on each other, but also separate, as physical distance gave the different household members some autonomy. Such multi-nodal households not only bridged the rural and the urban, but equally straddled the formal/informal divide. For many, their employment on the docks made their commercial enterprises possible, which allowed them to retire early from urban wage labour. Consequently, the interests of wage labourers could not be divorced from those of African small-scale entrepreneurs.</description>

   <description>Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a carboxypeptidase B-like pro-enzyme that, once activated, attenuates fibrinolysis. TAFIa also possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Although liver is the main source of plasma TAFI, platelet-derived TAFI has also been reported. An alternatively spliced TAFI variant resulted from the skipping of exon 6 and a 52-base deletion in exon 10 of CPB2 mRNA (∆6+10) was described to be brain specific. This TAFI variant is reputed to possess a secretase-like activity that cleaves β-amyloid precursor protein to form β-amyloid, a process involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease.&#xd;
	In this thesis, we report the identification of CPB2 mRNA and TAFI protein in various vascular and inflammatory cells. Specifically, we describe the expression of CPB2 mRNA in the megakaryocytic cell lines MEG-01 and Dami, the monocytic cell line THP-1, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TAFI protein was detected in differentiated Dami and THP-1 cells.&#xd;
	We next describe the effect of external stimuli such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on CPB2 expression in Dami and THP-1 cells. We found that PMA treatment increases both CPB2 mRNA abundance and promoter activity in Dami cells, and decreases both CPB2 mRNA abundance and promoter activity in THP-1 cells. Deletion analysis of the CPB2 promoter indicated cell-type specific regulation of CPB2 gene expression.    &#xd;
	Finally, we evaluated the expression of alternatively spliced CPB2 mRNA variants in hepatic and non hepatic cells. We found that exon 6 skipping variants are expressed in all cell types of interest. The variant previously reported to be brain specific was also found to be expressed in platelets. We found that the alternatively spliced TAFI variants accumulated inside the cells in a non-secretable, hypoglycosylated form and showed no carboxypeptidase activity. &#xd;
	 Taken together, this thesis provides further evidence supporting the hypothesis that platelet-derived TAFI is originated from CPB2 gene expression in megakaryocytes. Moreover, our data imply a potential for site-specific anti-inflammatory control provided by macrophage-derived TAFI. Alternative splicing of the CPB2 mRNA may give rise to variants with an intracellular role, perhaps as a peptidase chaperone, and may modulate the synthesis of secretable TAFI.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-27 00:38:12.455</description>
   <description>Wireless sensor networks have applications in many places from wildlife environments to urban areas. Implementation of such a network is a challenging task because each specific application may require different constraints and objectives. To better meet the application requirements, cognitive wireless sensor network has been recently introduced. However, almost all the previous work in this area has been in theory or by simulation. Hence there is a demand to provide implementable ideas of cognition, implement, and analyze the results. The goal of this thesis is to implement a cognitive wireless sensor network with application in environment monitoring which is aware of the surrounding environment, updates its information based on the dynamic changes in the network status, makes appropriate decisions based on the gained awareness, and forwards required actions to involving nodes. An implementable cognitive idea is proposed based on the characteristics and goals of a cognitive system. Since transmission is one of the most power consuming processes in sensor nodes and non-efficient transmissions of data can lead to a shorter lifetime, this work tries to schedule nodes' transmission rate by the means of cognition and benefits from efficient scheduling of the redundant nodes to improve lifetime. To enhance a wireless sensor network with cognition, new nodes should be added to the architecture called cognitive nodes. Cognitive nodes will take care of most of the tasks in the cognition process while still there is a need to add a level of cognition to each individual node. The main contribution of this work is that it provides an implementable approach to cognition in wireless sensor networks, proposes a low complexity and low cost implementable idea for cognition, addresses implementation issues, and provides experimental results of different setups of the cognitive wireless sensor network.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-28 10:58:04.406</description>
   <description>2D-3D registration is one of the underpinning technologies that enables image-guided intervention in computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS). Preoperative 3D images and surgical plans need to be mapped to the patient in the operating room before they can be used to augment the surgical intervention, and this task is generally fulfilled by using 2D-3D registration which spatially aligns a preoperative 3D image to a set of intraoperative fluoroscopic images.&#xd;
&#xd;
The key problem in 2D-3D registration is to define an accurate similarity metric between the 2D and 3D data, and choose an appropriate optimization algorithm. Various similarity metrics and optimization algorithms have been proposed for 2D-3D registration; however, current techniques have several critical limitations. First, a good initial guess - usually within a few millimetres from the true solution - is required, and such capture range is often not wide enough for clinical use. Second, for currently used optimization algorithms, it is difficult to achieve a good balance between the computation efficiency and registration accuracy. Third, most current techniques register a 3D image of a single bone to a set of fluoroscopic images, but in many CAOS procedures, such as a multi-fragment fracture treatment, multiple bone pieces are involved.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, research has been conducted to investigate the above problems: 1) two new registration techniques are proposed that use recently developed optimization techniques, i.e. Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), to improve the capture range for the 2D-3D registration problem; 2) a multiple-object 2D-3D registration technique is proposed that simultaneously aligns multiple 3D images of fracture fragments to a set of fluoroscopic images of fracture ensemble; 3) a new method is developed for fast and efficient construction of anatomical atlases; and 4) a new atlas-based multiple-object 2D-3D registration technique is proposed to aid fracture reduction in the absence of preoperative 3D images. Experimental results showed that: 1) by using the new optimization algorithms, the robustness against noise and outliers was improved, and the registrations could be performed more efficiently; 2) the simultaneous registration of multiple bone fragments could achieve a clinically acceptable global alignment among all objects with reasonable computation cost; and 3) the new atlas construction method could construct and update intensity atlases accurately and efficiently; and 4) the use of atlas in multiple-object 2D-3D registration is feasible.</description>

   <description>Railway track ballast fouling is an ongoing issue without a clear understanding regarding either the cause for generation or the source of the fouling materials. This study was conducted to determine what physical processes are likely causing ballast fouling, where in the track sub-structure fouling material is concentrating, and what factors affect the severity of ballast fouling. &#xd;
A field investigation on a CN railway track was conducted in Joliette, QC during undercutting maintenance operations. Data for in-situ ballast, sub-ballast, and subgrade samples were gathered from a series of trenches excavated through the track embankment. The geotechnical and mineralogical characteristics of a selected set of ballast samples were gathered through a regime of laboratory testing. Grain size distribution data for the select samples was collected from sieve and hydrometer testing. Three sets of LA abrasion tests were conducted on both in-situ and freshly quarried ballast rock to determine the degradation characteristics of the various ballast types. The petrographic analysis of the sample types was conducted using bulk hand sample characterization, thin-section analysis, and X-Ray Diffraction Analysis. &#xd;
The petrographic, grain size, and LA abrasion combined analysis indicated that ballast fouling was primarily caused through degradation of the ballast. The fouling material within the ballast pores was sourced to the abraded pieces of ballast that had degraded over time through XRD and grain size distribution analysis. It was found with statistical confidence that ballast layers with harder, structureless rock types have less fouling material form within the ballast void spaces compared to ballast rock types that are soft on the Mohs hardness scale or have planes of weakness due to structural factors. Analysis of the grain size data also showed that ballast fouling was generally concentrated within the section of the ballast layer directly underlying the steel rail, within the topmost parts of the ballast layers. Overall it was recommended that the effects of chemical degradation on ballast rock types and the historical operational duration of ballast be incorporated into future ballast fouling studies.</description>

   <description>Treatment–covariate interaction is often used in clinical trials to assess the homogeneity of treatment effects over these subgroups defined by a baseline covariate, which is frequently conducted after primary analysis including all patients is completed.  When the endpoint is the time to an event, as in the cancer clinical trials, the Cox proportional hazard model with an interaction term has been used exclusively to test the significance of treatment-covariate interaction in oncology literature. But the proportional hazards assumption may not be satisfied by the data from clinical trials. Although there are several procedures proposed in statistical literature to assess the interaction based on a nonparametric measure of interaction or nonparametric models, some of these procedures do not take into the account of the nature of the data well, while some are very complicated which may have limited their applications in practice.  In this thesis, a non-parametric procedure based on the smoothed estimate of Patel–Hoel measure is first derived to test the interaction between the treatment and a binary covariate with censored data. The theoretical distribution of the test statistic of the proposed procedure is derived.  The proposed procedure is also evaluated through Monte-Carlo simulations and applications to data from a cancer clinical trial.  Jackknifed versions of two test statistics based on nonparametric models are then derived by simplifying these test statistics and applying the jackknife method to estimate their variances.  These jackknifed tests are also compared with the smoothed test and other related tests.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-27 10:52:31.588</description>
   <description>Engineers who develop fundamental models for chemical processes are often unable to estimate all of the model parameters due to problems with parameter identifiability and estimability. The literature concerning these two concepts is reviewed and techniques for assessing parameter identifiability and estimability in nonlinear dynamic models are summarized. Modellers often face estimability problems when the available data are limited or noisy. In this situation, modellers must decide whether to conduct new experiments, change the model structure, or to estimate only a subset of the parameters and leave others at fixed values. Estimating only a subset of important model parameters is a technique often used by modellers who face estimability problems and it may lead to better model predictions with lower mean squared error (MSE) than the full model with all parameters estimated. Different methods in the literature for parameter subset selection are discussed and compared.&#xd;
An orthogonalization algorithm combined with a recent MSE-based criterion has been used successfully to rank parameters from most to least estimable and to determine the parameter subset that should be estimated to obtain the best predictions. In this work, this strategy is applied to a batch reactor model using additional data and results are compared with computationally-expensive leave-one-out cross-validation. A new simultaneous ranking and selection technique based on this MSE criterion is also described. Unfortunately, results from these parameter selection techniques are sensitive to the initial parameter values and the uncertainty factors used to calculate sensitivity coefficients. A robustness test is proposed and applied to assess the sensitivity of the selected parameter subset to the initial parameter guesses. The selected parameter subsets are compared with those selected using another MSE-based method proposed by Chu et al. (2009). The computational efforts of these methods are compared and recommendations are provided to modellers.</description>

   <description>For some time, youth worldwide have faced high levels of unemployment, up to twice as high as adults in Canada (Quintini, Martin, &amp; Martin, 2007). In an environment proliferated with economic recovery initiatives responding to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010), navigation towards employment for youth is complex and dynamic. Many rural communities were damaged by the global economic downturn, particularly in eastern Ontario (Jinha, 2009). The value of career education in supporting youth with transition from school-to-work is widely supported (Bell &amp; O’Reilly, 2008). To my knowledge, a teacher’s perspective on teaching compulsory career studies within times of significant economic challenge has remained unexplored. &#xd;
Using two strands of data collection, document analysis was used to describe policies and strategies that comprised the Canadian and Ontario governments’ responses to the global economic downturn and the provincial policy on career education. I undertook interviews with a career studies teacher to document her knowledge of Canadian and Ontario governments’ responses, and how and from where she gained this knowledge. The teacher’s perceptions of challenges faced by career studies students’ when seeking employment, and of what this knowledge contributed to her teaching practice were also reported.&#xd;
The documents revealed that Canadian and Ontario governments’ had responded to the global economic downturn with similar policies and strategies, influenced by future economic security. The Ministry of Education curriculum documents included economy which was linked with the students’ learning and to the expectations of the curriculum. The teacher had limited knowledge of federal and provincial policies and strategies, although she saw connections to the career studies curriculum. The teacher supported her career studies practice through experience gained in a combined role as a teacher of cooperative education and business subjects, and the experience of colleagues. &#xd;
I concluded that the teaching of career studies was influenced by the teacher’s other teaching subjects, and career studies teachers’ need access to appropriate, current resources to meet curriculum expectations. Expanding the program to full-credit status might allow teachers greater flexibility to tailor the career studies program to meet individual students’ needs.</description>

   <description>Children have difficulty with reading for a number of reasons. One of these reasons may be temporary conductive hearing loss (TCHL) in preschool, which can be caused by otitis media (persistent fluid build-up in the middle ear), one of the most frequent medical issues in preschool children (Burt &amp; Schappert, 2004). While otitis media can be treated medically, the duration of hearing loss and the age at which the hearing loss occurred may contribute to future reading difficulties (Easterbrooks, Lederberg, Miller, Bergeron &amp; Connor, 2008).  The literature surrounding the connection between otitis media, TCHL, and reading development is inconclusive.  In addition, the nature of interdisciplinary communication to discuss the potential future challenges for children who have had TCHL is unclear. Little is known about how professionals communicate with parents about these challenges, and about how parents can best support their children. &#xd;
This research focused on providing detailed descriptions of how medical and educational professionals reported they communicated with each other and with parents about the potential reading risks associated with TCHL. This study followed standard qualitative research methods to conduct in-depth interviews with six medical and educational professionals and with two parents of children with TCHL. Results from this study have revealed important aspects that characterize what, when, and how professionals inform parents of children with TCHL about potential future reading problems. The knowledge gained through this research can guide future research and have practical implications for medical and educational professionals and provides recommendations for how parents are informed about potential future reading difficulties.</description>

   <title>Hope in the Most Unlikely Spaces: Thawra and the Contemporary Arabic Novel</title>

   <subject>Thawra and Arabic literature</subject>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-27 13:18:25.303</description>
   <description>In the early to mid-twentieth century, many novelists in the Arab world championed Arab nationalism in their literary reflections on the social and political struggles of their countries, depicting these struggles primarily in terms of spatial binaries that pitted the Arab world against the West, even as they imported Western literary models of progress and modernity into their own work. The intense experience of national awakening that infused their writing often placed these authors at a literary disadvantage, for in their literature, all too often the depth and diversity of Arabic cultures and the complexity of socio-political struggles across the Arab world were undermined by restrictive spatial discourses that tended to focus only on particular versions of Arab history and on a seemingly unifying national predicament. Between the Arab defeat of 1967 and the present day, however, an increasing number of Arab authors have turned to less restrictive forms of spatial discourse in search of a language that might offer alternative narratives of hope beyond the predictable, and seemingly thwarted, trajectories of nationalism. This study traces the ways in which contemporary Arab authors from Egypt and the Sudan have endeavoured to re-think and re-define the Arab identity in ever-changing spaces where elements of the local and the global, the traditional and the modern, interact both competitively and harmoniously. I examine the spatial language and the tropes used in three Arabic novels, viewing them through the lens of thawra (revolution) in both its socio-political and artistic manifestations. Linking the manifestations of thawra in each text to different scenes of revolution in the Arab world today, in Chapter Two, I consider how, at a stage when the Sudan of the sixties was both still dealing with colonial withdrawal and struggling to establish itself as a nation-state, the geographical and textual landscapes of Tayeb Salih‟s Season of Migration to the North depict the ongoing dilemma of the Sudanese identity. In Chapter Three, I examine Alaa&#xd;
iii&#xd;
al-Aswany‟s The Yacoubian Building in the context of a socially diseased and politically corrupt Egypt of the nineties: social, political, modern, historical, local, and global elements intertwine in a dizzyingly complex spatial network of associations that sheds light on the complicated reasons behind today‟s Egyptian thawra. In Chapter Four, the final chapter, Gamal al-Ghitani‟s approach to his Egypt in Pyramid Texts drifts far away from Salih‟s anguished Sudan and al-Aswany‟s chaotic Cairo to a realm where thawra manifests itself artistically in a sophisticated spatial language that challenges all forms of spatial hegemony and, consequently, old and new forms of social, political, and cultural oppression in the Arab world.</description>

   <title>Melancholy and the Early Modern University</title>

   <subject>Melancholy, universities, King James, Robert Burton, George Herbert, Hamlet, Shakespeare, Habermas, the public sphere</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-27 15:30:01.702</description>
   <description>Critics have observed that in early Stuart England, the broad, socially significant concept of melancholy was recoded as a specifically medical phenomenon—a disease rather than a fashion. This recoding made melancholy seem less a social attitude than a private ailment. However, I argue that at the Stuart universities, this recoded melancholy became a covert expression of the disillusionment, disappointment, and frustration produced by pressures there—the overcrowding and competition which left many men “disappointed” in preferment, alongside James I’s unprecedented royal involvement in the universities. My argument has implications for Jürgen Habermas’s account of the emergence of the public sphere, which he claims did not occur until the eighteenth-century. I argue that although the university was increasingly subordinated to the crown’s authority, a lingering sense of autonomy persisted there, a residue of the medieval university’s relative autonomy from the crown; politicized by the encroaching Stuart presence, an alienated community at the university formed a kind of public in private from authority within that authority’s midst. The audience for the printed book, a sphere apart from court or university, represented a forum in which the publicity at the universities could be consolidated, especially in seemingly “private” literary forms such as the treatise on melancholy. I argue that Robert Burton’s exaggerated performance of melancholy in The Anatomy of Melancholy, which gains him license to say almost anything, resembles the performed melancholy that the student-prince Hamlet uses to frustrate his uncle’s attempts to surveil him. After tracing melancholy’s evolving literary function through Hamlet, I go on to discuss James’s interventions into the universities. I conclude by considering two printed (and widely circulated) books by university men:  the aforementioned The Anatomy of Melancholy by Burton, an Oxford cleric, and The Temple by George Herbert, who left a career as Cambridge’s public orator to become a country parson. I examine how each of these books uses the affective pattern of courtly-scholarly disappointment—transumed by Burton as melancholy, and by Herbert as holy affliction—to develop an empathic form of publicity among its readership which is in tacit opposition to the Stuart court.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a critical exploration of the ‘revitalization’ of Toronto’s Regent Park. Regent Park is Canada’s oldest and largest government subsidized housing development. Originally designed in 1947, Toronto City Council approved the revitalization of the neighbourhood in 2003. Within this thesis, Regent Park serves as a means to examine some of the ways in which urban planning and design, public policy, architecture and landscape architecture interact with people’s daily practices in their socioeconomic and cultural contexts, to ‘rebuild the social’. In order to do this, the thesis begins by presenting an account of the original development, providing a sociohistorical context for understanding the more recent revitalization. Secondly, the thesis provides a review of relevant theoretical literature pertaining to the idea that design shapes society, discussing key aspects of modernist and postmodernist accounts of the city, arguing for the salience of a broadly ‘relational’ model inspired by the work of Julier (2008) and others. Thirdly, the thesis conducts an empirical analysis of the recent revitalization process, using a mixed methodology of documentary analysis and in-depth interviews with a key developer and the residents of Regent’s park. This analysis explores the ideological commitments at play within the planning process, as well as the practice of planning itself, investigating how theories of design and planning relate to the actual process of planning, including the political and financial obligations. The analysis then compares the intentions of the design with the inhabitant’s lived experience within the space, focusing on the inhabitants’ active role in negotiating the space in ways that were ‘unplanned’. This thesis provides a sociological exploration of Regent Park as a complex site of interaction between the design of the space (influenced by theories of design, as well as economic, political and social motivations), the materials that make up that space, and the actual use of the space by residents, the outcomes of which challenge deterministic accounts of urban development.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-27 17:57:45.647</description>
   <description>The goal of the current research was to improve on previous studies by more directly examining the relationship between perfectionism and actual procrastination behaviour.  In Study 1, participants (N = 167) were given five minutes to prepare for a verbal analogy test during which time they could complete practice materials or play a computer game.  After the first test, participants were randomly assigned to receive positive feedback, negative feedback, or no feedback.  They then had a second chance to study or play the computer game before they completed another verbal analogy test. &#xd;
 Adaptive perfectionism was a significant predictor of less procrastination behaviour on the initial test although feedback on the first test did not change the subsequent behaviour of adaptive perfectionists. Maladaptive perfectionism was not a significant predictor of procrastination behaviour on the initial task. However, for women who were higher in maladaptive perfectionism, the more upset they were from receiving negative feedback on the first task, the more they increased their procrastination on the second task.   &#xd;
The purpose of Study 2 was to examine two potential mechanisms, low performance expectations or mood repair, which may have been responsible for the increase in procrastination behaviour seen in women who were higher in maladaptive perfectionism and upset about receiving negative feedback. Participants (N = 138) all received negative feedback on the first test, which was followed by an optimism prime, positive mood prime, or neutral prime. Participants then were given a second chance to study or play the computer game before they completed another verbal analogy test.  &#xd;
The positive mood prime did not have a significant effect on procrastination behaviour.  Among women who were lower in adaptive perfectionism, the optimism prime resulted in a decrease in procrastination behaviour for women higher in maladaptive perfectionism and an increase in procrastination behaviour for women lower in maladaptive perfectionism.  These findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for the academic outcomes of adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists.</description>

   <description>This thesis consists of an analysis of electronic money (e-money), e-money’s privacy policies and relevant privacy laws.   The value of information and the development of technology enhance the risk of privacy violations in the information era.  Consumer privacy interests with respect to e-money are governed in part by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada and by the European Union’s Data Protection Directive.  The analysis is directed at whether the privacy policies of three kinds of e-money – Octopus Card, PayPal and MasterCard – comply with the spirit and letter of these laws.   In light of technology change, the laws should be interpreted to apply broadly to protect privacy interests.  Enhanced privacy protection may in fact lead to greater adoption of e-money by consumers.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines images of volunteer tourism—or voluntourism—on internet sites and describes how the photographs that appear on them contribute to maintaining global systems of power. Voluntourism is defined as either the payment of a program fee to an organization to travel to a developing country to perform various volunteer tasks or as the pause of gainful employment in one’s own country to work for an extended period of time in a developing country at a local wage. Currently there is debate as to the real benefits of volunteer tourism: is it truly the sustainable form of responsible, alternative tourism it is intended to be, or does it merely replicate the conditions of mass tourism and exploit those it is intended to benefit?  &#xd;
This study explores visual representations of voluntourism in non-Western cultures in developing countries, and the consumption of those representations by participants in Canadian-based volunteer tourism organizations. The primary focus is photographs of interpersonal relationships between “voluntourists” and “voluntoured” in an examination of how culture and skin colour are manipulated in an attempt to maintain Westerners’ positions of power in pictures and, by extension, in global power relations. I suggest that a complex interaction of the pictorial codes of tourism, colonialism and the popular media converge in voluntourism’s photographs, resulting in images that simultaneously offer potential volunteers the opportunity to “do good” in the world as well as to consume cultural difference as a commodity. &#xd;
The main body of work is a visual discourse analysis of the photographs of five Canadian volunteer organizations’ websites. I identify the thematic categories used to promote voluntourism and discuss them in relation to patterns of mass tourism, charity advertisements, colonial travel narratives and their associated visual representation. This paper includes interviews with Canadian past volunteers to assess the importance of images to their experience of voluntourism. I close with a discussion of multiculturalism in Canada which brings together the experience of working within another culture in voluntourism and the conditions of Canadian multicultural society.</description>

   <description>An outbreak of an infectious illness can have a devastating impact on a population.  Once confirmed, local health care organizations will attempt to reduce the spread of the disease by adopting a set of pre-defined guidelines.  Modelling such a system presents a number of unique challenges: timing and probability constraints must be captured, scaling must be seamless and methods for analysis must be robust and efficient.  To satisfy these requirements, an augmented form of Petri net known as a choice-point net is introduced in this thesis.  In this data structure, timing is associated with event-based transitions that may fire multiple times to simulate the same event occurring several times in parallel.  Events may result in several possible outcomes, or choices, each of which is given a probability of occurrence.  A choice-point net may be scaled without requiring structural changes to the model and may be analyzed by unravelling it into a finite-state automaton representing (perhaps portions of) its behaviour.  By translating questions about the protocol into the mathematical language of the net, recursive algorithms may then be employed to provide health-care professionals with answers to their questions.  To demonstrate the expressiveness of choice-point nets, an actual, in-use protocol to control respiratory infection outbreaks in long-term care homes is modelled.  Three similar abridged scenarios set in a small long-term care home are also modelled, analyzed and compared.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research is twofold: 1) to apply a user-centred approach to examine the usability and acceptability of an on-body ergonomic aid called the Personal Lift Assistive Device (PLAD) in a variety of industrial work environments and 2) to utilize subjective user acceptability data on discomfort, pain and overall PLAD assessment by participants to identify design features that need improvement in the next PLAD iteration. Case studies took place in four different industrial work environments: two distribution centre environments, one retail store environment and one automotive assembly plant environment. These environments were selected to represent different industrial work environments. In total, 20 industrial workers were selected to wear the PLAD and provide their feedback. Results were obtained using subjective questionnaires through verbal and written comments as well as through direct observation of the participants. Three major design changes occurred to the original PLAD iteration tested at the first industrial location. These included: 1) using different stiffness levels of springs for different sizes of individuals in an attempt to decrease discomfort and optimize the effectiveness of the PLAD, 2) an increase in pelvic spacer size and surface area contacting the user’s body to reduce discomfort and 3) modification to the shoulder harness including; shape, dimensions and amount of cushioning to reduce discomfort. Currently, three major design changes were identified and still need to be addressed. These include: 1) reduction of thermal discomfort caused by wearing the PLAD, 2) validation of selecting the appropriate spring stiffness for small, medium and large users of the PLAD (male and female) under various working postures and 3) simplification of the donning and doffing process. Additionally, a simple PLAD spring stiffness sizing chart was created to aid potential manufacturers of the PLAD to select the appropriate spring stiffness for various users of the PLAD. This sizing chart was designed to maintain an average lumbar moment reduction of 15%, while taking discomfort of the shoulders caused by the spring stiffness and overall cost into consideration.</description>

   <description>Massively multiplayer games allow hundreds of players to play and&#xd;
interact with each other simultaneously.  Due to the increasing need&#xd;
to provide a greater degree of interaction to more players, load&#xd;
balancing is critical on the servers that host the game.  A common&#xd;
approach is to divide the world into microcells (small regions of the&#xd;
game terrain) and to allocate the microcells dynamically across&#xd;
multiple servers.&#xd;
&#xd;
We describe a visibility--based technique that guides the creation of&#xd;
microcells and their dynamic allocation.  This technique is designed&#xd;
to reduce the amount of cross--server communication, in the hope of&#xd;
providing better load balancing than other load--balancing strategies.&#xd;
&#xd;
We hypothesize that reduction in expensive cross-server traffic will&#xd;
reduce the overall load on the system. We employ horizon counts map &#xd;
to create visibility based microcells, in order to emphasize primary&#xd;
occluders in the terrain. In our testing we consider traffic over a&#xd;
 given quality of service threshold as the primary metric for minimization.&#xd;
 &#xd;
As result of our testing we find that dynamic load balancing produces &#xd;
significant improvement in the frequency of quality of service failures.&#xd;
We find that our visibility-based micro cells do not outperform&#xd;
basic rectangular microcells discussed in earlier research.  We also find&#xd;
that cross-server traffic makes up a much smaller portion of overall message&#xd;
load than we had anticipated, reducing the potential overall benefit from&#xd;
cross server message optimisation.</description>

   <description>The predominant model of the human hip is a mechanical ball-and-socket joint. This description has two key implications: that the motion of the hip is purely rotational, and that the rigid articulating geometry of the hip is a sphere-on-sphere contact. Since the widespread adoption of this model, in the late 1960s, there has however been a persistent thread of literature suggesting that the articulating geometry of the hip is aspherical. The recent widespread availability of three-dimensional medical imaging now makes it possible to empirically assess the applicability of the predominant model. &#xd;
&#xd;
For this research dissertation, two arthritic groups were examined: patients either had primary early-life osteoarthritis of the hip, or hip dysplasia with secondary osteoarthritis. Computed tomography scans, taken as part of routine preoperative preparation, served as the source data for this work. The scans were manually segmented to produce 3D models of the bones of the hip, which were further refined to isolate the bony articular surfaces. These surfaces were fit to general ellipsoids and to spheres, the latter being the ball-and-socket model. The arthritic hips examined had comparable fitting accuracy for both ellipsoids and spheres; however, sixteen of nineteen hips formed geometrically incompatible ball-and-socket joints. The dysplastic&#xd;
hips examined had a notable difference in fitting accuracy, with ellipsoids being a statistically significantly better fit to the hip geometry. The ellipsoid shapes in all cases were aspherical, and in each population formed a statistically significantly aspherical group. There were no trends relating the ellipsoid shapes of bones of an individual joint, nor were there practical differences between the ellipsoid shapes between the two populations.&#xd;
&#xd;
Despite patient groups not being controlled for age, sex, or race, and accounting for typical manual segmentation errors, these results suggest that the hip is aspherically shaped. Thus, the geometric foundation of the ball-and-socket motion may be unsupported, and the conventional kinematic description of the hip may be called into question.</description>

   <description>The influence of regional processes, such as dispersal, on ecological communities has been the focal point of considerable ecological research. Evidence has shown that dispersal can impact community composition through interactions with predation, the introduction of keystone species, and maintenance of species lost due to competitive exclusion. Ecological communities can be characterized by several metrics including species richness, diversity, evenness, abundance and species co-occurrence patterns. Negative species co-occurrence patterns have historically been attributed to competitive interactions between species causing pairs of species to never co-occur. However, little attention has been paid to the contribution of dispersal on species co-occurrence patterns. I have experimentally investigated the influence of dispersal on species co-occurrence patterns in addition to local species richness, total species abundance, evenness, and Simpson’s diversity.  &#xd;
Local species richness significantly increased with dispersal, with variation in total local richness being mainly attributed to differences in the rotifer community. Local diversity, total abundance, and evenness were not significantly influenced by changes in the level of dispersal. Species co-occurrence patterns were greatly affected by changes in dispersal, with negative species co-occurrence patterns peaking at intermediate levels of dispersal. The potential for dispersal to increase the number of rare species within a community suggested that the presence of rare species could be behind the changes in the co-occurrence patterns between dispersal treatments. The effect size of the co-occurrence tests increased with the removal of rare species in the intermediate dispersal treatment and decreased in the remaining dispersal treatments. Likely, through mass effects, the presence of rare species, and the establishment of keystone predators changes in the level of dispersal strongly influenced species co-occurrence patterns. I conclude that external processes, like dispersal, can influence species co-occurrence patterns and that caution should be taken when interpreting the mechanisms driving species co-occurrence patterns across landscapes.</description>

   <description>Serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenalin (NA) increase persistent inward currents mediated by sodium and calcium channels on the dendrites of motoneurons. The ability of 5-HT and NA to modulate these channels depends on the distributions of 5-HT and NA synapses. Recent studies of the distribution of 5-HT and NA synapses on motoneurons innervating the neck muscle splenius reported that these synapses are rare on the somata and have a strong bias to dendrites with small diameters. It is unknown whether this distribution pattern represents a general principle of organization (1) for all motoneuron groups or (2) for all types of modulators. To address the first question, we have examined the distribution of 5-HT and NA synapses on flexor motoneurons, which unlike extensor motoneurons, are not able to generate self-sustained discharges known to involve the activation of persistent inward currents. To answer the second question, we have mapped the distribution dopamine (DA) synapses. The dendrites of motoneurons that innervate the neck flexor rectus capitis anterior (RCA) were stained. Synapses containing 5-HT, NA and DA were identified using immunohistochemical techniques. Observations based on five RCA motoneurons indicate that the average densities of 5-HT and NA contacts are 2.3 and 1.4 times less dense than the average densities of 5-HT and NA contacts on splenius motoneurons, respectively. Moreover, pairs of 5-HT contacts and pairs of NA contacts were found to be 3.0 and 1.8 times closer together on splenius compared to RCA motoneurons, respectively. These observations may reflect the inability of flexor motoneurons to generate self sustained discharges. Similar to splenius motoneurons, 5-HT and NA synapses were found to preferentially innervate dendrites with diameters less than 2 µm.  Thus, 5-HT and NA synapses facilitate channels in regions where excitatory or inhibitory signals undergo the largest attenuations. DA synapses on the dendritic tree were sparse (0.2 and 0.1 contacts per 1000 µm2), suggesting that the actions of DA synapses are confined to local regions on the dendritic tree. These results highlight that motoneurons do not all share the same intrinsic properties, and the distribution of modulatory synapses have a crucial role in determining these properties.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-28 18:12:53.158</description>
   <description>Many high school students are unable to consider engineering as an undergraduate program of study because they have not taken the prerequisite courses required for university entrance. In order to provide the opportunity for capable students to pursue an engineering degree and subsequently enter the engineering profession, they should be more aware of the profession of engineering prior to entering high school to enable them to select appropriate courses from the very start of their post elementary education.&#xd;
&#xd;
The focus of this study is to understand how students in grade 7 perceive the profession of engineering in two example regions across Canada. Recent literature suggests that action is underway in some areas of the United States in order to create awareness and encourage students to pursue an engineering program.  These initiatives range from integrating engineering concepts into the K-12 curriculum to providing outreach and design challenge opportunities outside of school.  In Canada, such initiatives are only present in isolated cases, with limited reach and impact. &#xd;
&#xd;
To better understand the perspectives on engineering of pre-high school students in Canada, grade 7 students were provided with surveys incorporating a variety of questions pertaining to the engineering profession.  All questions were open ended in order to promote individualized answers from the students. Survey questions were analyzed with NVIVO software to determine common themes in the understanding and perception of engineering from the perspective of the students. After the completion of the survey, select students in each location were interviewed in order to further explore their perception of the engineering profession. The questions asked during these interviews built on the themes of the written survey. In general, it was found that participants had varied and mostly inaccurate perception of what engineers do, and lacked a clear understanding of the profession. &#xd;
&#xd;
After analyzing the data, the subsequent suggested recommendations are to develop a better public perception of the engineering profession, develop programs to help teachers better relate math and science to engineering in school, and to consider further investigation of best practices from the United States and how they might be implemented in Canada.</description>

   <description>The de-facto standard for dysarthric intelligibility&#xd;
assessment is a subjective intelligibility test, performed by an expert. &#xd;
Subjective tests are often costly, biased and inconsistent because of their perceptual nature. &#xd;
Automatic objective assessment methods, in contrast, are repeatable and&#xd;
relatively cheap. Objective methods can be broken down into two subcategories:&#xd;
reference-free, and reference based. Reference-free methods employ estimation procedures that do not require information about the target speech material. This potentially makes the problem more difficult, and &#xd;
consequently, there is a deficit of research into reference-free dysarthric intelligibility estimation.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we focus on the reference-free intelligibility estimation approach.&#xd;
To make the problem more tractable, we focus on the dysarthrias of cerebral palsy (CP). First, a popular standard for blind speech quality estimation, the ITU-T P.563 standard, is examined for possible application to dysarthric intelligibility estimation. The internal structure of the standard is discussed, along with the relevance of its internal features to intelligibility estimation. Afterwards, several novel features expected to relate to some of the acoustic properties of dysarthric speech are proposed. Proposed features are based on the high-order statistics of parameters derived from linear prediction (LP) analysis, and a mel-frequency filterbank.&#xd;
&#xd;
In order to gauge the complimentariness of P.563 and proposed features, a linear intelligibility model is proposed and tested. Intelligibility is expressed as a linear combination of acoustic features, which are selected from a feature pool using speaker-dependent and speaker-independent validation methods. An intelligibility estimator constructed with only P.563 features serves as the `baseline'. When proposed features are added to the feature pool, performance is shown to improve substantially for both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent methods when compared to the baseline. Results are also shown to compare favourably with those reported in the literature.</description>

   <title>The Art of 'Governing Nature': 'Green' Governmentality and the Management of Nature</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-28 19:06:20.246</description>
   <description>This thesis seeks to unpack the notions of Michael Foucault's late work on governmentality and what insights it might have for understanding the ‘governing of nature’. In doing this it also operates as a critique of what is often termed 'resourcism', a way of evaluating nature which only accounts for its utility for human use and does not give any acceptance to the idea of protecting nature for its own sake, or any conception of a nature that cannot be managed. By utilizing a study of the govern-mentalities emerging throughout liberalism, welfare-liberalism and neoliberalism I argue that this form of 'knowing' nature-as-resource has always been internal to rationalities of liberal government, but that the bracketing out of other moral valuations to the logic of the market is a specific function of neoliberal rationalities of governing.  &#xd;
I then seek to offer an analysis of the implications for this form of nature rationality, in that it is becoming increasingly globalized, and with that bringing more aspects of nature into metrics for government, bringing new justifications for intervening in ‘deficient’ populations under the rubric of ‘sustainable development. I argue, that with this a new (global) environmental subject is being constructed; one that can rationally assess nature-as-resource in a cost-benefit logic of wise-use conservation. This acts to both marginalize those people that have alternative understandings for our relationship with nature is destructive to nature itself, further embedding the more-than-human into the economic rationality of neoliberal resourcism.</description>

   <description>Network coding (NC) is an optimal data dissemination technique where intermediate nodes linearly combine incoming packets. To recover a network-coded message, a sink must use a Gaussian elimination decoder, but this high-complexity decoder may not be acceptable in resource-constrained applications like sensor networks. A good alternative to Gaussian elimination is for the sink to apply the well-known belief propagation (BP) algorithm; however, the performance and complexity of BP decoding is dependent on the statistics of the linearly-combined packets. In this work, we propose two protocols that address this issue by applying fountain coding paradigms to network codes.&#xd;
&#xd;
For a two-source, single-relay, and single-sink network, named the Y-network, if the relay can network-code incoming packets while maintaining the key properties of the fountain code, then BP decoding can be applied efficiently to recover the original message. Particularly, the sink should see a Soliton-like degree distribution for efficient BP decoding. The first protocol, named Soliton-like rateless coding (SLRC), recognizes that certain encoded packets are essential for BP decoding to perform well. Therefore, the relay protects these important packets by immediately forwarding them to the sink. It can be shown analytically that the proposed scheme is resilient to nodes leaving the transmission session. Through simulations, the SLRC scheme is shown to perform better than buffer-and-forwarding, and the Distributed LT code.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although SLRC achieves good performance, the degree distribution seen by the sink is non-optimal and assumes that a large number of packets can be buffered, which may not always be possible. Extending SLRC, we propose the Improved Soliton-like Rateless Coding (ISLRC) protocol. Assuming a resource-constrained relay, the available resources at the relay are effciently utilized by performing distribution shaping; packets are intelligently linearly combined. The aggregate degree distribution for the worst case is derived and used in performing an asymptotic error analysis using an AND-OR tree analysis. Simulation results show that even under the worst case scenario of ISLRC, better performance can be achieved compared to SLRC and other existing schemes.</description>

   <description>Drawing upon close observation of site practices, interviews, and visitor surveys, this project analyses the programming offered at historic sites, highlighting the aspects of history that are omitted or treated superficially.  The case studies conducted at Fort Henry, Upper Canada Village, and Fort William demonstrate that women’s and gender histories continue to be minimized, stereotyped, and segregated.  Each site selectively communicates information about the past.  &#xd;
	The commemoration and preservation of the past and the tourism industry have been intricately connected in Ontario throughout the twentieth century.  Historic sites have been directed by the dual goals of educating the public about a national past and of attracting visitors and revenues.  As Ian McKay and Robin Bates have articulated, the resulting tourism/history is a narrative less interested in verity than in saleability.  Though the management of historic sites have not jettisoned the concept of accuracy, broadening the picture of the past presented to be ‘more accurate’ by addressing such issues as courtship, birth control, or marital separation is often not as high a priority as increasing visitor numbers.  The costs, financial and otherwise, of making changes to the traditional fare at historic sites are considered undesirable.  &#xd;
Sites are unprepared to invest in changes to collections or programming unless it can be shown that the investment will pay dividends.  The perpetuation of traditional political and economic narratives continues also because of the perception that this appeals to and pleases visitors.  Sites aim to give visitors what they want and to entertain them in order to secure repeat patronage.  Women’s history and gender history are considered, somewhat contradictorily, too controversial and too mundane to garner the interest of visitors.  Despite being trusted by a majority of Canadians as trustworthy sources of history, historic sites are letting down their constituents by omitting significant aspects and concerns of daily life in their narratives.</description>

   <description>Socio-cultural activity theory (SCAT) was used to examine the nature of collaborative working in a case study of school-based occupational therapy (SBOT) in Ontario. Collaborative consultation has been widely adopted in SBOT practice. However, we know little about the impact of collaboration for students and lack understanding about how the organization of SBOT service contributes to collaborative working among educators and occupational therapists. Grounded in theoretical understanding about the distributed nature of group learning, SCAT was used as a conceptual and analytical tool in this study to describe SBOT collaborative consultation from multiple stakeholder perspectives.&#xd;
The research took place in two phases. Phase One involved case study research to describe SBOT for three students with disabilities from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Data were gathered using a combination of observation, document analysis, and interviews involving participants directly involved in the delivery of SBOT with each focal participant. SCAT provided a framework for describing the nature of joint effort. Dilemmas emerging from incongruence between elements in the activity system were identified and described. Common characteristics in two cases enabled cross-case analysis to also identify features of collaborative working that facilitated educational programming and outcomes for students with developmental disability. &#xd;
In Phase Two, program administrators participated alongside service recipients and service providers in a series of focused discussion workshops to reflect on case study findings and prioritize areas for program improvement. Developmental Work Research (Engeström, 2000) and Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperrider, Whitney, &amp; Stavros, 2003) methods were used within a participatory action research approach to facilitate organizational learning among stakeholders. Engagement of stakeholders supported program administrators in critically examining decision-making for the delivery of SBOT service in the region studied. Combining practice-driven dilemmas with conceptual tools of analysis enabled a multiple-perspective understanding about the social, cultural, and historical work practices that have influenced collaborative interactions in SBOT practice and led to the development of principles for improving how work is shared. Program administrators used their shared understanding to propose a new model for delivering SBOT services.</description>

   <description>Learner autonomy, the ability to take charge of one’s own learning, is one of the most valuable skills educators can encourage their students to develop.  The ability to learn how to learn provides opportunities for students not only to take responsibility for their own learning, but also to determine its direction.  What are the avenues one can take to promote the development of learner autonomy?&#xd;
A large body of literature articulating the importance of learning as a structured, experiential process has emerged over the last three decades. The research of John Dewey and David Kolb regarding experiential education has contributed to the formal structure of a method of this kind of learning.   Kurt Hahn, whose ideas about experiential learning stress reflection and also solitude, a state of being alone, offer a significant connection to psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory, where one is “intensely involved in a meaningful activity [and is] able to remain focused for the length of time needed to achieve a deeply valued goal (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008, p. 6).  This connection is seen most clearly in what Csikszentmihalyi suggests are the conditions for flow, one of which is concentration.  The ability to concentrate is certainly a condition for higher learning processes and is therefore an important condition to take into consideration with regard to education and learning.  Conditions for concentration however, seem to be rooted in solitude (Behuniak, 2006; Csikszentmihalyi, 2008).  Although solitude is something that is needed to concentrate and to develop our complex selves, (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008) current cultural trends expose an avoidance of solitude.  Importantly, it seems that neither schools nor the culture of schooling value the importance of, nor the conditions needed to foster positive experiences of being alone, of fostering experiences in solitude.  Instead, current school climate seems to dissuade us from experiencing learning at a pace that will help develop learner autonomy, indeed the ideals of education (Gatto, 2003).  This qualitative study will explore how six participants who engage in a variety of activities during which they believe themselves to be engaged in a deep level of concentration express how concepts related to flow as a learning process affects them as learners. Additionally, the study will consider the value of experiential learning as central to the participants’ overall understanding of and success in their chosen activities.  The purpose of this study is to illustrate the value of and conditions for learning that takes place during flow-based activities; the process of learning that takes place through the practice of activities at which healthy competence and engagement at a deep level of concentration is required.  It will in turn investigate the implications these activities have in relation to the development of learner autonomy.</description>

   <description>The contribution of deficits in limb position sense to the motor impairments of children with cerebral palsy, as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders, is increasingly being recognized.  A more complete understanding of the development of multi-joint upper limb position sense is needed and has been limited, to date, by the absence of a reliable measurement technique to produce clinically meaningful information.&#xd;
&#xd;
The KINARM Exoskeleton’s bilateral position matching task, which involves passive movement of one of the subject’s arms to one of eight positions requiring different combinations of elbow and shoulder positions and active matching by the participant’s other arm, was evaluated for interrater and retest reliability.  Intraclass correlation coefficients, absolute difference, minimum detectable difference that would be considered a significant change in performance, standard error of the measure, coefficient of variation, index of reliability, limit of agreement and confidence intervals were used to determine reliability on three measures of multi-joint position sense: (1) inter-trial variability in end-point position, (2) the ratio between actual and matched position, or spatial contraction/expansion, which provides a measure of the absolute accuracy of position matching, and (3) systematic errors in matching. &#xd;
&#xd;
Interrater index of reliability was very good to excellent with values of 72% for systematic errors in matching to 93% for contraction/expansion. Interrater intraclass correlation values were fair to excellent at 0.46 for systematic errors in matching to 0.81 for contraction/expansion. Standard errors in measurement were low and ranged from 0.002 to 0.06, for inter-trial variability and contraction/expansion respectively.  Similarly, minimal detectable difference values for retest reliability ranged from 0.005 for inter-trial variability to 0.161 for contraction/expansion. Retest intraclass correlation values were fair to excellent at 0.38 for systematic errors in matching to 0.82 for contraction/expansion. &#xd;
&#xd;
Moderate to strong interrater and retest reliability and high measurement precision support the use of robot-based assessment of multi-joint position sense for developmental studies and promises to be a reliable clinical and research tool in the advancement of knowledge on sensory-motor coordination difficulties in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.</description>

   <description>Unlike men, women’s genital arousal is category-nonspecific with respect to sexual orientation, such that their genital responses do not differentiate stimuli by gender. A possible explanation for women’s nonspecific sexual response is the inclusion of women at different phases of the menstrual cycle or women using hormonal contraceptives in sexual psychophysiology research, which may be obscuring a specificity effect. The present study employs the ovulatory-shift hypothesis – used to explain a shift in women’s preferences for masculine traits during peak fertility – as an explanatory model for women’s nonspecific sexual arousal. Twenty-nine naturally-cycling women were tested at two points in their menstrual cycles (follicular and luteal) to determine the role of hormonal variation, as estimated by fertility status, on the specificity of genital (using vaginal photoplethysmograph) and subjective sexual arousal. Cycle phase at the time of first testing was counterbalanced; however, no effect of order was observed. Inconsistent with the ovulatory-shift model, the predicted mid-cycle shift in preferences for masculinity or sexual activity at peak fertility was not obtained.  &#xd;
Category-specificity of genital arousal did not increase during the follicular phase. A statistical trend was observed for higher genital arousal to couple sex stimuli during the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase, suggesting that women’s genital arousal may be sensitive to fertility status with respect to sexual activity (specifically, couple sex), but not gender. Subjective arousal was not influenced by fertility status. This study is the first to provide evidence that women’s genital arousal may be influenced by the probability of conception.</description>

   <description>Parks have a long-standing history of providing leisure and recreation environments to local neighbourhood residents. They are designed to enhance the livability of communities and to provide recreation opportunities for individual health benefits. Recent studies have found that parks are underutilized for physical activity. In order to address this concern, this thesis research included two studies addressing the association between five park characteristics (i.e., park feature and amenity type, condition, cleanliness, neighbourhood type, and a park program) and levels of park usage and physical activity behaviour.  Manuscript 1 explores park feature and amenity type, condition, cleanliness, and neighbourhood type in association with park usage and physical activity using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) and the Environmental Assessment of Public Recreation Spaces (EARPS) observational measurements. Park usage differed between park feature types (p&lt;.001) and neighbourhood types (p&lt;.001), with higher rates of park use and physical activity noted in urban neighbourhoods, and on splash pad, pool, path, and play structure feature types. Physical activity levels were associated with park feature type (p&lt;.001), condition (p&lt;.001) and cleanliness (p&lt;.001) as well as neighbourhood type (p&lt; .05). Manuscript 2 reports on the effectiveness of a family park physical activity program using questionnaire feedback (n=28), and observational comparisons’ of park usage and physical activity when the program was and was not occurring. No significant difference was found for overall park usage and physical activity levels, however the program target area significantly reported more usage (p&lt;.05) when the program was offered.  A majority of program participants were currently moderately-vigorously active (79%), met Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines (57%), came to the park with family members (93.1%), walked to the park (85.7%), and visited the park regularly (62%). From these collective findings, this thesis makes an important contribution to furthering our understanding of associations between park characteristics and park usage and physical activity levels.  Findings from this study will be useful in guiding park researchers, planners, and designers as well as, park program practitioners and community agencies in promoting and creating more user-friendly and active neighbourhood park environments, as a means to increase population health amongst Canadians.</description>

   <description>The main purpose of this study was to explore the influence of social support and self-efficacy on the physical activity beliefs and behaviours of participants in a peer-mentoring intervention embedded in a community-based exercise program. A second purpose was to explore social support, self-efficacy, and perceived barriers and facilitators to exercise program adherence for study participants within the community-based exercise program setting. Participants (N=10, plus 6 mentors) were adults with chronic health conditions living in a low-income neighbourhood. Intervention (n=4) and comparison (n=6) groups completed self-report measures of physical activity, social support, and barrier self-efficacy at baseline, 6-weeks, and 12-weeks.  Interviews were used post-intervention to explore the impact of peer mentoring, perceived social support and self-efficacy within the exercise setting, and barriers and facilitators to physical activity for study participants. Intervention participants showed greater exercise program adherence than comparison participants at 6-weeks. Qualitative findings suggest the peer mentoring intervention increased motivation and sense of obligation to adhere to the exercise program, and provided vicarious learning opportunities that may have indirectly influenced exercise program adherence for intervention and mentor participants. Findings also suggest that the exercise program was highly influential to participants’ social support and self-efficacy beliefs. Multiple barriers and facilitators to physical activity were reported. Overall, the current study supports the use of peer mentoring as an intervention strategy in combination with additional strategies to promote exercise program adherence in the study population. Practical implications are discussed in relation to the promotion of exercise program adherence in older adults with chronic health conditions participating in a community-based exercise program in a low-income neighbourhood.</description>

   <title>The Role of Prepotent Sexual Features in Female Nonspecific Sexual Response</title>

   <description>Research has found that men’s sexual response demonstrates specificity; men’s genital sexual arousal patterns to sexual stimuli match their stated sexual orientation. Heterosexual women’s genital responses are nonspecific in that they show sexual responses to both their preferred and non-preferred gender (Chivers, 2010). It is unclear why women show this pattern; however, examining the specific stimulus features associated with sexual arousal in women may provide clarification. Prepotent sexual features, that is, stimuli that involuntarily elicit nervous system activity (cf. Lang, Rice &amp; Sternbach, 1972), may be associated with an automatic sexual response (Blader &amp; Marshall, 1989; Chivers, 2005; Ponseti et al., 2006; Van Lunsen &amp; Laan, 2004). It is possible that heterosexual women show genital responses to both preferred and non-preferred stimuli because prepotent sexual features are present in both male and female sexual stimuli. &#xd;
In order to better understand women’s nonspecific genital response, we examined whether stimulus prepotency was associated with nonspecific sexual response in heterosexual women. We assessed 36 heterosexual women’s genital and subjective arousal to slideshows of male and female prepotent stimuli (erect penises and aroused vulvas), non-prepotent stimuli (flaccid penises and female pubic triangles), and neutral stimuli (images of clothed men and women engaged in nonsexual activities). Counter to prediction, women demonstrated category-specific genital and subjective sexual responses, such that sexual arousal was significantly higher to prepotent male stimuli (images of erect penises) versus prepotent female stimuli; genital responses were nonspecific to non-prepotent and neutral stimuli. Results are discussed in terms of the sexual competency of stimuli and the Information Processing Model of Sexual Response.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-29 11:13:58.516</description>
   <description>This thesis develops an account of non-domination as a principle of legitimacy that ought to govern both inter-group and intra-group relations in multicultural states. It applies this principle to the question of how political institutions should respond to claims for the accommodation of controversial minority practices, using the example of the polygamous community in Bountiful, British Columbia. In developing this account, the thesis engages with three bodies of theoretical literature – of multiculturalism, of political legitimacy, and of autonomy.&#xd;
In the dominant normative theories of multiculturalism, answers are centered on what the limits of toleration are, what it means to recognize a collective identity, or what group rights can be claimed and how group rights are balanced with individual rights. While not rejecting the importance of these issues in a pluralistic state, my approach de-centers them by subsuming them under the broader problem of what makes a political authority morally legitimate vis-à-vis particular collective - as well as abstract individual - subjects. I argue that the most promising response to this problem lies with the concept of non-domination, conceived as a foundational principle of political legitimacy for multicultural states. This principle both demands and checks a democratic method for determining specific forms of accommodation.&#xd;
In some cases the advancement of non-domination between groups conflicts with the advancement of non-domination within groups.  In political theory this question is often taken up by feminist scholars concerned with the ‘paradox of multicultural vulnerability’ and, more generally, with the dilemma of how to identify and critique internalized oppression while promoting full respect for individual moral agency. Borrowing from these debates, I outline a conception of the relational moral autonomy of the person and argue that it forms a necessary component of a non-domination- based analysis. The conclusion of the thesis with respect to minority social practices is that specific claims should be determined on the basis of a democratic process aimed at uncovering whether and when, all things considered, the accommodation of that particular practice is consistent with non-domination both between and within groups.</description>

   <description>This dissertation investigates writing practices attuned to northern places. Eight experienced teachers from six regions in Canada’s Northwest Territories agreed to think-together in a study which took a hermeneutic approach to the focusing, gathering, and the analysis of data. Writing was both the subject for the inquiry and the methodology, as I asked participants to engage in ten workshops designed to move conversations away from familiar answers to the question: what practices invite northern students to write? In a place where the majority of students are Indigenous, I hoped that the writing workshops would invite the non-Indigenous teachers to consider their relationship to the many interconnecting dimensions of place. While writing seems to take one away from the particulars of experience to more universal concerns as one tries to capture meaning, paradoxically, writing returns to the particular. In the first four chapters, I use my 19 years of experience as a northern teacher as a heuristic for the study by contrasting the thinking of ‘the new teacher who has just arrived in the North’ to the voice of ‘the researcher.’ Four data chapters take up the ideas that emerged from the thinking-together with the teachers. I examine how the teachers used complexity thinking to approach their writing pedagogy. I consider how new literacies might overlap Indigenous pedagogies and Western writing pedagogies. I assert that the qualia of individual experience might serve as engaging subject matter for student writing. And finally, I explore how teachers might orient writing practices toward the development of voice rather than overemphasize procedural text-based approaches. This study will add to the literature on teaching writing with Indigenous students and to the literature on post-process pedagogy, particularly as it draws from Geography. Through example, this dissertation may illustrate how non-Indigenous educators can draw from Indigenous education in a way that respects and integrates its philosophical foundations.</description>

   <description>J.M. Coetzee’s novels are suffused with a pervasive, though often oblique, Holocaust awareness.  Direct references to the event and to the historical era to which it belongs, subtle stylistic and thematic echoes of Holocaust writing, and the recurrent mobilization of Holocaust imagery in Coetzee’s novels all contribute to suggest the significance of the event to the author’s work and thought.  Providing Coetzee with a lens through which to view the contemporary situation, both local and global, the Holocaust offers Coetzee a means by which difficult and complex questions of ethics and historiographical truth may be approached.  Above all, the Holocaust and its representation contribute to Coetzee’s exploration of the dilemmas of translating the traumatic lived experience of atrocity – including, but not limited to, life in apartheid South Africa – into narrative form.  Taken as a whole, Coetzee’s oeuvre initially anticipates and later responds to, in characteristically oblique fashion, the narrative project(s) facing post-apartheid South Africa as the newly-democratic nation sought to make sense of its past through a variety of means, the most important of which was the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  Implicitly challenging the TRC’s findings as well as its narrative assumptions, the Coetzean oeuvre accordingly invites being read as offering a continuous and evolving counter-narrative to the TRC and its construction of a narrative of the apartheid past for the post-apartheid nation.  In utilizing the Holocaust, its representations, and the reception thereof to frame his response to apartheid, Coetzee implicates both in a critique of the Western model of modernity, suggesting, in the process, the importance of reconfiguring modernity in a more ethical shape.</description>

   <description>Background:  During the early postpartum period, new mothers commonly experience fatigue and depressive symptoms which may affect their ability to function and care for themselves and their newborn.  Given the demonstrated positive effects of physical activity on mood and fatigue, the purpose of this study was to describe physical activity levels across late pregnancy and the first three months postpartum, and to determine the associations between physical activity and postpartum functional status, mood, and fatigue at 6- and 12-weeks postpartum.&#xd;
Design:  We employed a longitudinal, descriptive study design.  Prenatal classes were used to recruit women.  Questionnaires containing validated measures of functional status, physical activity, mood, and fatigue were administered at baseline (pregnancy), 6- and 12-weeks postpartum.&#xd;
Results:  The sample consisted of 73 primiparous women with a mean age of 30 (+3.7) years.  The majority were married (83%), Caucasian (98%), educated (70%) and middle to upper-middle class.  Women in this study were physically active, with the majority being moderately active (52%).  Few women had low physical activity levels (n = 4-8) throughout the study. Household activities and walking accounted for the majority of physical activity. Women in this study reported moderate levels of fatigue, with fatigue levels decreasing over time.  For most postpartum women, mood and fatigue scores improved from six to 12 weeks; however, for 26% of women, scores did not.  Self-care and social/community activity subcategories of functional status were the slowest to improve.  Women who were low/moderately physically active at six weeks postpartum were three times as likely to have low functional status in comparison to highly physically active women (OR 3.22, 95% CI: 1.07, 9.73).  At 12-weeks women with higher mental (OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.79) and physical fatigue (OR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.40) were more likely to be in the lower functional status group at 12-weeks postpartum.  &#xd;
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that high levels of self-reported mental and physical fatigue relate to lower functional status for primiparous women at six and twelve weeks postpartum.  Women who are highly physically active at six and twelve weeks postpartum are more likely to have higher functional status, but this effect is influenced by perception of both mental and physical fatigue.</description>

   <description>This thesis is an empirical and theoretical investigation into the changing trends in place marketing as it relates to urban tourism, particularly in the city of Toronto. It begins by exploring broader discourses to do with capitalism and creativity and their impacts on city space and people’s interactions with it and within it. These perspectives are then situated in the Toronto context, a city that currently embraces the notion of the Creative City, as promulgated by Richard Florida, which encourages the branding of the city for the purpose of stimulated economic growth and in which tourism plays an increasing role. Thirdly, it examines the theoretical implications of the prominent belief that tourism and place marketing are imperative for Toronto’s economic well-being. Official efforts at place marketing and place branding construct what John Urry terms the tourist gaze, and frame the city in particular ways to particular people. Fourthly, this thesis gives an empirical account of how the gaze comes to bear on the physical city space in terms of infrastructure and financing projects in the interest of creating a Tourist City. The penultimate chapter brings to light how the rise of new media has allowed for the greater possibility to puncture the traditionally linear narrative of the city with new voices, thus fracturing the monolithic gaze in some instances. The thesis concludes by questioning the implications of new media on the existing systems of city management and promotion, recognizing the ambivalence of new media and its potential to both challenge and reproduce current discourse.</description>

   <description>A two-part paleolimnological study was conducted to: i) understand the important factors that are related to the present-day distribution of scaled-chrysophytes; ii) investigate changes in the scaled-chrysophyte assemblages in the Experimental Lakes Area northwestern Ontario, in response to recent climate warming. Scaled-chrysophyte assemblages were analyzed in the modern sediments of 40 ELA lakes to determine their relationship to measured environmental variables. The sediment record from 210Pb dated cores from six ELA lakes were analyzed at a sub-decadal resolution to evaluate if chrysophytes were changing in a consistent fashion and if these changes could be accounted for by measured climatic factors. Ordination analysis of the modern chrysophyte flora was significantly related to pH, lake depth, and the degree of thermal stratification, as well as water temperature. Mallomonas punctifera ‘small’ and Mallomonas acaroides were indicators of warm surface-waters. High-resolution analysis of six ELA lakes revealed pronounced shifts in the chrysophyte assemblages over the last ca. 150 years. The most notable shift in the chrysophyte assemblage was characterized by an overall shift towards higher relative abundances of colonial taxa. In several lakes increases in unicellular warm-water taxa were also observed. Breakpoint Analysis identified significant changes in the chrysophyte assemblages beginning in the late-1800s to mid-1900s in most lakes. An interclass correlation coefficient (ri) was used to assess the temporal coherency of the chrysophyte assemblages over the past ca. 100 years. All lakes displayed a similar directional change which was significantly coherent (p&lt;0.05). A Brien’s Test identified sub-sets of lakes that were temporally coherent and homogenous. The high coherency of two groups, (Group A, grand mean=0.89, p-value=5.3x10-15; Group B, grand mean=0.38, p-value=0.038), suggests the dominance in extrinsic factors in governing the lake responses. The average PCA axis-1 scores of Group A (r-value=0.62, p=0.03) and Group B (r-value=0.60, p=0.038) were significantly correlated to regional mean annual temperature. Collectively, the results of this study suggest that changes observed in the scaled-chrysophyte assemblages in the ELA region are consistent with recent climate warming.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-29 18:11:02.374</description>
   <description>As computing matures, it is becoming increasingly obvious that a change is necessary for the manner in which web services interact with users. Server-centric models are inconvenient for users. A new paradigm, Smart Interactions, provides a web service architecture which is centered around the user's needs, rather than the simplistic server view currently being used.  The system responds to the individual user and is able to adapt to changes to better serve the user. The Smart Internet system helps the user accomplish their tasks efficiently and intuitively. &#xd;
&#xd;
An important aspect of Smart Interactions is that of cognitive support, which provides enhanced information and guidance to the system or user linked to the current task. This thesis examines predictive analytics and its application to cognitive support in Smart Interactions, and presents and evaluates a framework for using predictive analytic support within the Smart Internet model.</description>

   <description>PURPOSE: Thermal ablation therapy is an emerging local cancer treatment to destroy cancer tissue using heat. However variations in blood flow and energy absorption rates make it extremely challenging to monitor thermal changes. Insufficient ablation may lead to recurrence of the cancer while excessive ablation may damage adjacent healthy tissues. Ultrasound could be a convenient and inexpensive imaging modality for real-time monitoring of the ablation. For the development and optimization of these methods, it is essential to have ground truth data and a reliable and quantitative validation technique before beginning clinical trials on humans. In this dissertation, my primary focus was to solve the image-to-physical space registration problem using stereotactic fiducials that provide accurate correlation of ultrasound and pathology (ground truth) images. METHOD: A previously developed validation test-bed prototype was evaluated using phantom experiments to identify the shortcomings and limitations. In order to develop an improved validation platform, a simulator was implemented for evaluating registration methods as well as different line fiducial structures. New fiducial line structures were proposed, and new methods were implemented to overcome the limitations of the old system. The new methods were then tested using simulation results and phantom studies. Phantom experiments were conducted to improve the visibility of fiducials, as well as the quality of acquired ultrasound and pathology image datasets. RESULTS: The new system outperforms the previous one in terms of accuracy, robustness, and simplicity. The new registration method is robust to missing fiducials. I also achieved complete fiducial visibility in all images. Enhancing the tissue fixation medium improved the ultrasound data quality. The quality of pathology images were improved by a new imaging method. Simulation results show improvement in pose recovery accuracy using my proposed fiducial structure. This was validated by phantom studies reducing spatial misalignment between the US and pathology image sets. CONCLUSION: A new generation of test-bed was developed that provides a reliable and quantitative validation technique for evaluating and optimizing ablation monitoring&#xd;
methods.</description>

   <description>This thesis suggests an approach to compute the short-time behaviour of the hypoelliptic heat kernel corresponding to sub-Riemannian structures on unimodular Lie groups of type I, without previously holding a closed form expression for this heat kernel. Our work relies on the use of classical non-commutative harmonic analysis tools, namely the Generalized Fourier Transform and its inverse, combined with the Trotter product formula from the theory of perturbation of semigroups. We illustrate our main results by computing, to our knowledge, a first expression in short-time for the hypoelliptic heat kernel on the Engel and the Cartan groups, for which there exist no closed form expression.</description>

   <description>The semiconductor alloy indium gallium nitride (InxGa1-xN) offers substantial potential in the development of high-efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic devices due to its wide range of direct band gaps, strong absorption and other optoelectronic properties. This work uses a variety of characterization techniques to examine the properties of InxGa1-xN thin films deposited in a range of compositions by a novel plasma-enhanced evaporation deposition system. Due to the high vapour pressure and low dissociation temperature of indium, the indium incorporation and, ultimately, control of the InxGa1-xN composition was found to be influenced to a greater degree by deposition temperature than variations in the In:Ga source rates in the investigated region of deposition condition space. Under specific deposition conditions, crystalline films were grown in an advantageous nano-columnar microstructure with deposition temperature influencing column size and density. The InxGa1-xN films were determined to have very strong absorption coefficients with band gaps indirectly related to indium content. However, the films also suffer from compositional inhomogeneity and In-related defect complexes with strong phonon coupling that dominates the emission mechanism. This, in addition to the presence of metal impurities, harms the alloy’s electronic properties as no significant photoresponse was observed. This research has demonstrated the material properties that make the InxGa1-xN alloy attractive for multi-junction solar cells and the benefits/drawbacks of the plasma-enhanced evaporation deposition system.  Future work is needed to overcome significant challenges relating to crystalline quality, compositional homogeneity and the optoelectronic properties of In-rich InxGa1-xN films in order to develop high-performance photovoltaic devices.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-29 23:47:11.775</description>
   <description>In the last fifty years, Nunavut has developed a deep dependence on diesel for virtually all of its energy needs, including electricity. This dependence has created a number of economic, environmental and health related challenges in the territory, with an estimated 20% of the territory’s annual budget being spent on energy, thereby limiting the Government of Nunavut’s ability to address other essential infrastructure and societal needs, such as education, nutrition and health care and housing. One solution to address this diesel dependency is the use of renewable energy technologies (RETs), such as wind, solar and hydropower.&#xd;
&#xd;
As such, this thesis explores energy alternatives in Nunavut, and through RETScreen renewable energy simulations, found that solar power and wind power are technically viable options for Nunavut communities and a potentially successful means to offset diesel-generated electricity in Nunavut. However, through this analysis it was also discovered that accurate data or renewable resources are often unavailable for most Nunavut  communities. Moreover, through qualitative open-ended interviews, the perspectives of Nunavut residents with regards to developing RETs in Nunavut were explored, and it was found that respondents generally supported the use of renewable energy in their communities, while acknowledging that there still remains a knowledge gap among residents regarding renewable energy, stemming from a lack of communication between the communities, government and the utility company. In addition, the perceived challenges, opportunities and gaps that exist with regards to renewable energy policy and program development were discussed with government policy-makers through further interviews, and it was discovered that often government departments work largely independently of each other rather than collaboratively, creating gaps and oversights in renewable energy policy in Nunavut.&#xd;
&#xd;
Combined, the results of this thesis were used to develop a number of recommended policy actions that could be undertaken by the territorial and federal government to support a shift towards renewable energy in order to develop a sustainable and self-sufficient energy plan in Nunavut. They include: gathering accurate renewable resource data in Nunavut; increasing community consultations on the subject of renewable energy; building strong partnerships with universities, colleges and industry; developing a knowledge sharing network; and finally increasing accessibility to renewable energy programs and policies in Nunavut.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-30 12:51:49.413</description>
   <description>The ability to accurately predict object weight is essential for skilled manipulation and recent studies suggest that such prediction is based, in part, on learned size-weight maps associated with families of objects. Weight prediction based on size-weight maps is also involved when judging weights; there is strong evidence that weight judgments are biased by expected weight, based on size. This bias is revealed by the size-weight illusion (SWI) whereby the smaller of two equally weighted and otherwise similar objects is judged to be heavier because it is heavier than expected based on its size. The overall aim of the current set of studies was to examine how size-weight maps for different families of objects are organized and represented at the perceptual and sensorimotor levels. We found that distinct and independent size-weight maps, used to predict weight, were used when lifting objects and judging their weights. At the perceptual level, interference between size-weight maps for the different sets of cubes was observed; participants could learn the inverted size-weight relationship for the green cubes when experienced alone but not when experienced along with the black cubes with a normal size-weight relationship. However, about half of participants learned to scale lift forces accurately for both sets of cubes indicating that the sensorimotor system can learn, without interference, opposite size-weight maps. We further investigated why not all participants learned to accurately scale their lift forces and found that learning to lift objects with different and arbitrary size weight maps involves visuomotor working memory resources. Moreover, an outside task that steals attentional resources can interfere even after previous learning of the size-weight maps.</description>

   <description>Performing Resistance/ Negotiating Sovereignty: Indigenous Women’s Performance Art In Canada investigates the contemporary production of Indigenous performance and video art in Canada in terms of cultural continuance, survivance and resistance. Drawing on critical Indigenous methodology, which foregrounds the necessity of privileging multiple Indigenous systems of knowledge, it explores these themes through the lenses of storytelling, decolonization, activism, and agency.  With specific reference to performances by Rebecca Belmore, Lori Blondeau, Cheryl L'Hirondelle, Skeena Reece and Dana Claxton, as well as others, it argues that Indigenous performance art should be understood in terms of i) its enduring relationship to activism and resistance ii) its ongoing use as a tool for interventions in colonially entrenched spaces, and iii) its longstanding role in maintaining self-determination and cultural sovereignty.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-30 10:02:47.285</description>
   <description>This thesis describes the host-guest chemistry between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and various guests that contain isoquinoline groups, including tacrine, papaverine, N-methyl papaverinium, N-methyl laudanosinium, 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydroisoquinoline, N, N-dimethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinium, α,α'-bis(isoquinolinium)-p-xylene and a series of 1,n-bis(isoquinolinium) alkane dications (Isq(CH2)nIsq2+, where n = 2, 4-6, 8-10 and 12). The stoichiometries and strengths of the host-guest interactions were studied using UV-visible and 1H NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A focus of this thesis is an investigation of the effects of varying the chemical structure within a series of isoquinoline-based guest  on the strength of the binding affinity . &#xd;
	The 1H NMR spectra indicates that CB[7] prefers the saturated ring of tacrine as opposed to the aromatic ring, resulting in a binding constant of (2.7 ± 0.25) x 104 M-1. The N-methylations of papaverine and 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydroisoquinoline increased their respective binding constants from those of the protonated forms and changed the nature of the interaction of the guest with CB[7]. .&#xd;
	  With the series of 1,n-bis(isoquinolinium)-alkane dications, the mode of binding to CB[7] depends on the number of carbons in the polymethylene chain that bridges the two isoquinolinium groups. When the bridge is less than six carbons, CB[7] binds sequentially on the isoquinolinium groups to form 1:1 and 2:1 host-guest complexes. If the polymethylene chain length is between six and ten carbons, or is replaced with a p-xylyl group, the first CB[7] will bind over the central bridge, resulting in both of the polar portals forming ion-dipole interactions with both positively charged nitrogens. A second CB[7] binds to a terminal isoquinolinium group, which forces the original bound CB[7] to relocate to the other isoquinolinium group.  When the polymethylene bridges contains twelve carbons, two CB[7] binds sequentially to the isoquinolinium groups, as observed with the shortest polymethylene bridges. With this series of guest, the binding constant is the largest when the bridge is two carbons long. This is due to the two isoquinolinium groups being in close proximity to each other, allowing CB[7] to interact with both nitrogens while still binding around the isoquinoline group.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-30 11:49:18.645</description>
   <description>Dual-phase (DP) sheet steels are a class of advanced high strength steels which boast a desirable combination of properties for the forming of automotive components, including: high strength, continuous yielding behaviour, and a high initial work hardening rate. The higher strength of DP steels relative to predecessors used to form automotive components allows for a reduction in part gauge, translating to the potential for reduced automobile weight, emissions, and fuel consumption.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, a form of premature failure during component forming known as `shear fracture' has become a prominent challenge to manufacturers' adoption of DP steels. Martensite particles in DP steel microstructures act as nucleation sites for the development of void damage during deformation, resulting in a deleterious effect upon formability and thought to contribute to the observed shear fractures.&#xd;
&#xd;
This dissertation contributes to the overall goal of offering guidance for the improvement of DP steel microstructures for more desirable fracture behaviour. Specifically, the role of non-ferritic phase/constituent (NFP) volume percent and spatial distribution in the accumulation of void damage in DP steels was investigated. Void damage accumulation in ten DP steel microstructural variants tested to failure under near plane-strain deformation was qualified and quantified in three dimensions using an X-ray micro-computed tomography technique. These results were correlated to the microstructural parameters of the variants, which clearly indicated the detrimental effects of NFP banding in DP steels.&#xd;
&#xd;
It was observed that DP microstructures with increased severity of NFP banding (generally aligned in the sheet rolling direction) incurred a reduced strain to failure. Often, microstructural variants with NFP bands aligned transverse to the major loading direction incurred a reduced strain to failure, accumulated a greater number of voids, and exhibited a larger void volume percent than a specimen with oppositely oriented NFP bands. Void damage spatial distribution was generally reflective of the spatial distribution of the most coarse NFP bands through the sheet thickness. In microstructural variants with NFP bands aligned transverse to the major loading direction, accumulated void damage was often observed to be highly elongated in the direction of NFP banding.</description>

   <description>Service composition integrates existing services to fulfill specific tasks using a set of standards and tools. Existing service composition techniques and tools are mainly designed for SOA professionals. The business processes used in the service composition systems are primarily designed by experienced business analysts who have extensive process knowledge. Process knowledge is the information about a process, including the tasks in a process, the control flow and data flow among tasks. It is challenging for end-users without sufficient service composition skills and process knowledge to find desired services then compose services to perform their daily activities, such as planning a trip. Context-aware techniques provide a promising way to help end-users find services using the context of end-users. However, existing context-aware techniques have limited support for dynamic adapting to new context types (e.g., location, time and activity) and context values (e.g., “New York City”).&#xd;
To shelter end-users from the complexity of service composition, we present our techniques that assist non-IT professional end-users in service composition by dynamically composing and recommending services to meet their requirements. To acquire the desired process knowledge for service composition, we propose an approach to automatically extract process knowledge from existing commercial applications on the Web. By analyzing the context of end-users, our techniques can dynamically adapt to new context types or values and provide personalized service recommendation for end-users. Instead of requiring end-users to specify detailed steps for service composition, the end-users only need to describe their goals using a few keywords. Our approach expands the meaning of an end-user's goal using process knowledge then derives a group of tasks to help the end-user fulfill the goal. The effectiveness of our proposed techniques is demonstrated through a set of case studies.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this report is to define Bishop’s University’s heritage significance by identifying its cultural heritage resources that are significant and should be protected in the upcoming campus master plan. Founded in 1843 in the heart of Quebec’s Eastern Townships, Bishop’s built form and student life are highly influenced by both internal and external factors, especially through social and political events. The findings have demonstrated that there is a considerable amount of heritage resources on campus which should be protected so that members of the Bishop’s community can appreciate them for the years to come.</description>

   <description>As the expression of the genetic blueprint, proteins are at the heart of all biological systems.  The ever increasing set of available protein structures has taught us that diversity is the hallmark of their architecture, a fundamental characteristic that enables them to perform the vast array of functionality upon which all of life depends.  This diversity, however, is central to one of the most challenging problems in molecular biology: how does a folding polypeptide chain navigate its way through all of the myriad of possible conformations to find its own particular biologically active form?  With few overarching structural principles to draw upon that can be applied to all protein architecture, the search for a solution to the protein folding problem has yet to produce an algorithm that can explain and duplicate this fundamental biological process.&#xd;
In this thesis, we take a two-pronged approach for investigating the protein folding process.  Our initial statistical studies of the distributions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues within α-helices and β-sheets suggest (i) that hydrophobicity plays a critical role in helix and sheet formation; and (ii) that the nucleation of these motifs may result in largely unidirectional growth.  Most tellingly, from an examination of the amino acids found in the smallest β-sheets, we do not find any evidence of a β-nucleating code in the primary protein sequence.&#xd;
Complementing these statistical analyses, we have analyzed the structural environments of several ever-widening aspects of protein topology.  Our examination of the gaps between strands in the smallest β-sheets reveals a common organizational principle underlying β-formation involving strands separated by large sequential gaps: with very few exceptions, these large gaps fold into single, compact structural modules, bringing the β-strands that are otherwise far apart in the sequence close together in space.  We conclude, therefore, that β-nucleation in the smallest sheets results from the co-location of two strands that are either local in sequence, or local in space following prior folding events.  A second study of larger β-sheets both corroborates and extends these findings: virtually all large sequential gaps between pairs of β-strands organize themselves into an hierarchical arrangement, creating a bread-crumb model of go-and-come-back structural organization that ultimately juxtaposes two strands of a parental β-structure that are far apart in the sequence in close spatial proximity.  In a final study, we have formalized this go-and-come-back notion into the concept of anti-parallel double-strandedness (DS), and measure this property across protein architecture in general.  With over 90% of all residues in a large, non-redundant set of protein structures classified as DS, we conclude that DS is a unifying structural principle that underpins all globular proteins.  We postulate, moreover, that this one simple principle, anti-parallel double-strandedness, unites protein structure, protein folding and protein evolution.</description>

   <description>Halogenation of poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) (IIR) increases its reactivity towards sulphur and other nucleophiles. Currently brominated (BIIR) and chlorinated (CIIR) derivatives are commercially available; however, an iodinated derivative has been briefly investigated. The effects of leaving group ability and microstructure on the reactivity of halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) were studied to put iodobutyl rubber reactivity into context and to compare existing commercial products to their isomeric derivatives.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Polymers containing halomethyl (r-CIIR, r-BIIR, r-IIIR) isomers of butyl rubber were prepared from as-received BIIR to compare the effect of leaving group on thermal stability and reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution. The polymer containing (E,Z)-endo-iodomethyl isomers (r-IIIR) readily underwent nucleophilic substitution at low temperatures; however, it was sensitive towards dehydrohalogenation at temperatures above 65⁰C. At temperatures between 100⁰C and 135⁰C, the bromomethyl derivative (r-BIIR) demonstrated the best balance between reactivity toward nucleophilic substitution and dehydrohalogenation. Exceptional thermal stability at temperatures up to 190⁰C was displayed by the chloromethyl derivative (r-CIIR); however, it was unreactive at low temperatures towards certain nucleophiles. This lack of reactivity shown by r-CIIR was not consistent with all nucleophiles, as reaction dynamics with TBAAc display its variable reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution with results parallel to those of r-BIIR.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Exo-methylene allylic halides (Exo-Br, Exo-Cl) and (E,Z)-endo-halomethyl (r-BIIR, r-CIIR) isomers were vulcanized with sulphur to determine the effect of microstructure on reactivity. Results showed a clear effect of microstructure on the ability to cure with sulphur. While the Exo-Cl isomer has no ability to cure, when rearranged to its (E,Z)-endo-chloromethyl isomer curing occurs readily. Both the Exo-Cl and (E,Z)-endo-bromomethyl isomers readily vulcanize in the presence of sulphur, however Exo-Br cures to a greater extent.</description>

   <description>Goldfish subjected to an intermittent short-term aerobic exercise training regime prior to acute hypoxic exposure demonstrated a shift in hypoxia response.  Intermittent aerobic training enhanced the aerobic potential of goldfish in the red muscle by increasing maximal activity of citrate synthase by 72% and reduced pyruvate kinase activity by 21% in white muscle.  Across red and white muscle tissue, aerobic training caused a decrease in glycogen storage by 19% and 32%, respectively.  Liver glycogen stores remained unchanged by training during normoxia. Subsequent hypoxic exposure demonstrated a significant training effect with a77% glycogen depletion in the liver of trained fish compared to a 53% depletion in untrained fish.  Hypoxia caused glycogen depletion, glucose mobilization, and ATP depletion in trained and untrained fish muscle tissue.  Meanwhile, the liver of trained recovered ATP slower than untrained fish and both liver and plasma had greater lactate accumulation by 1 h hypoxic recovery in trained fish.  Alcohol dehydrogenase maximal activity of trained fish responded to hypoxia with a 50% reduction and trained white muscle significantly reduced alcohol dehydrogenase activity during hypoxic recovery.  Ethanol was produced with and without training preconditioning in response to hypoxia in red muscle; however, trained fish white muscle showed an ethanol accumulation trend following training and 12 h hypoxia that was significantly cleared during recovery.  Ethanol accumulation in white muscle of trained fish may reveal greater perturbation caused by training and hypoxia and/or some developed mechanism for ethanol retention.  In effect, this training regime created a very different metabolic profile in goldfish such that during environmental oxygen limitation, trained fish may experience an enhanced metabolic perturbation and greater glycogen depletion which may compromise hypoxic tolerance.</description>

   <title>Development of Enzymatic Microreactors for the Analysis of Proteins via Mass Spectrometry</title>

   <description>Many techniques exist for protein analysis including gel electrophoresis, immunoassays and mass spectrometry to name a few. Although each of these techniques offers different advantages there are challenges associated with protein analysis that present limitations and drawbacks for each technique. These include limited sample volumes, incompatible matrices, complex mixtures, limit of detection, and complicated and time consuming analysis techniques. The research described in this thesis deals with methods which address the above mentioned challenges. The fabrication of enzymatic microreactors and the development of an extraction technique to remove proteins from incompatible matrices are presented.&#xd;
A low temperature solvent bonding technique was developed that can easily be modified to accommodate pH and temperature sensitive enzymes such as pepsin. Microfluidic chips fabricated with poly(methyl methacrylate) were constructed using this bonding method. The low temperature bonding method allows enzymes to be patterned on microfluidic devices prior to bonding with no negative impact on enzyme activity. Both peptic and tryptic reactors were fabricated using this technique. These devices have a lifetime of one month and can perform protein digestions in as little as 2.4 seconds.&#xd;
Alternatively, enzymatic microreactors were developed using a novel enzyme immobilization method on porous polymer monolith columns. These columns have the advantage of having the dual functionality of an enzymatic microreactor and an electrospray emitter permitting on-line digestions to be performed. Furthermore, the new immobilization method allows columns to have a longer lifetime as this method permitted the regeneration of the columns with fresh enzyme once enzyme activity was lost.&#xd;
To overcome the issues associated with incompatible matrices, an extraction technique using acetonitrile and octyl-β-D-glycopyranoside was developed to remove proteins from organic matrices. This was developed to detect the presence of prion proteins in biodiesel. Afterwards, the prion proteins were enzymatically digested and detected by mass spectrometry.&#xd;
Finally both types of enzyme microreactors were applied to proteins that are difficult to digest with traditional in-solution digestions. The digestion of prion proteins and α-1-protease inhibitor were found to be more efficient and conducted in significantly less time demonstrating the potential use of these devices in clinical research.</description>

   <description>Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to improving performance, spatial attention alters the perceptual experience of visual stimuli. We investigated whether two other forms of attention – feature-based attention, and memory-driven attention – also produce an increase in the perceived contrast of stimuli. Perceived contrast was measured by requiring participants to report which of two Gabor stimuli appeared higher in contrast, under different attentional or memory conditions. In Experiment 1, our results indicated that participants indeed allocated attention in a feature-based manner, but no increase in perceived contrast when attending to a given colour was found. Instead, feature-based attention appears to have produced a response bias, such that a stimulus was selected more often when it was attended. In Experiment 2, no change in perceived contrast due to the memory task was observed. A subsequent experiment indicated that our memory task may not have succeeded in causing an attentional shift, which limits the scope of our conclusions on the relationship of memory to perception, but is informative for the development of effective memory manipulations. Overall, our results have provided evidence that the mechanisms of feature-based attention may not be identical to those of spatial attention, but have left the effects of memory-driven attention to be determined.</description>

   <description>Considerable research has been done on measuring dependence between random variables. The correlation coefficient is the most widely studied linear measure of dependence. However, the limitation of linearity limits its application. The informational coefficient of correlation is defined in terms of mutual information. It also has some deficiencies, such as it is only normalized to continuous random variables.&#xd;
&#xd;
Based on the concept of the informational coefficient of correlation, a new dependence measure, which we call the L-measure, is proposed in this work which generalizes Linfoot's measure for both continuous and discrete random variables. To further elucidate its properties, simulated models are used, and estimation algorithms are also discussed. Furthermore, another measure based on the L-measure, which we call the intrinsic L-measure, is studied for the purpose of studying nonlinear dependence. Based on criteria for a dependence measure presented by Renyi and simulation results in this thesis, we believe that the L-measure is satisfactory as a dependence measure.</description>
