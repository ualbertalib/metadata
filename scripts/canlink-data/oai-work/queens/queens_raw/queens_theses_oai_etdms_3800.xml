   <description>The foundation for a triggered photon source was realized by convolving the energy bandgap of a quantum dot with a surface acoustic wave. The devices consisted of an InP substrate on which InAs/InP quantum dots were grown. It was then coated with a layer of piezoelectric ZnO by radio-frequency magnetic sputtering. Modulation of the device was enabled through aluminum interdigitated transducers that were deposited on the sample, which excited surface acoustic waves. The expected resonance of the interdigitated transducers was around 200MHz. However, resonances at 200MHz and 300MHz were recorded, due a Sezawa mode excitation. The preferential excitation of modes was likely due to variations in the ZnO film thickness. The target quantum dot emission was around 1550nm, matching with the C-band used in fibre optic communication channels. The largest wavelength measured for the ground state energy emissions from these dots was 1580nm, though typical lowest energy emission peaks were in the range of 1300-1400nm. Unidirectional Stark shifts in the photoluminescence emission of the quantum dots were observed as surface acoustic waves were applied. This quantum confined Stark effect is thought to be due the polarization of the InP/InAs due to the electric field in the ZnO layer, providing a second order effect. The electrical field from the ZnO layer potentially contributes a linear effect. The modulation of the quantum dot energy is due to the strain field but due to the electrical coupling form the ZnO layer, exact determination of the strain field's contribution is not possible. The emission modulation effect is quadratically dependent on both applied SAW power and inital emission energy. Convolution of the quantum dot emission with the surface acoustic wave-induced bandgap modulation was also observed, resulting in a split emission peak. A splitting of 4.97meV was observed using a linear surface acoustic wave power density of at least 1.69W/m and a laser excitation density of 3.17uW/um^2.</description>

   <description>Cast-iron water mains are still in use in water distribution systems across North America. These pipes are now reaching the end of their expected service lives and are becoming a concern to water utilities. Large-diameter water mains (defined as water mains with a diameter greater than 500 mm (20”)) are particularly important because of they can entail severe consequences when they fail.&#xd;
A physical model is presented to estimate the time-dependent factor of safety and probability of failure of large-diameter cast-iron water mains. Failure is assumed to occur by longitudinal cracking caused by tensile hoop stress and a reduction in the strength of the pipe due to corrosion pitting. Six sources of loading are considered in the model, including: earth load, live load, frost load, internal water pressure, and the curvature caused by the live load.&#xd;
The model is used in a two-part sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of each input of the model outputs. The first part of the analysis is a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis of all 28 input variables. This identified six variables as having a high impact: the pipe wall thickness, the pitting depth scaling constant, the corrosion rate inhibition factor, the fracture toughness, the constant S in the residual tensile strength calculation, and the pipe diameter.&#xd;
The second part is a stochastic sensitivity analysis to further investigate the sensitivity of the model to those variables identified in the deterministic analysis. The mean factor of safety and probability of failure were determined to be sensitive to the pipe wall thickness, corrosion rate, and the constants used to calculate the residual tensile strength, but were relatively insensitive to the diameter of the pipe.&#xd;
A case study of the City of Hamilton water distribution system was performed to characterize the failure of 20 large-diameter cast-iron water mains. Due to the uncertainty in the accuracy of the model, the pipes were assigned ranks relative to each other rather than an absolute probability of failure. The diameter, burial depth and soil type were all determined to have an effect on the ranking of each pipe.</description>

   <description>Pairing environmental stimuli with pro-dopaminergic drugs can produce conditioned effects on locomotor behaviour in rodents, an effect that is used to model incentive learning and drug craving in laboratory animals. One of the targets of dopamine signaling is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a nearly constitutively active enzyme involved in a variety of cellular activities and signaling pathways. Recently, GSK-3 has been shown to be modulated by activity at the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, both of which have been implicated in the acquisition and expression of conditioned activity. Here, it was hypothesized that the selective GSK-3 inhibitor, A-1070722 (Abbott Laboratories, Ludwigshafen, Germany), would block the acquisition and expression of cocaine-cue conditioned activity in Wistar rats.&#xd;
	Results indicated a block of the expression, but not acquisition, of conditioned activity at 10 and 20 mg/kg doses of A-1070722, but not 0, 1, or 5 mg/kg doses. The 10 mg/kg dose also appeared to decrease spontaneous locomotion, suggesting that the effect of A-1070722 on the expression of conditioned activity may be due an effect on locomotor behaviour more generally, rather than being due to a selective attenuation of the expression of incentive learning produced by cocaine-associated environmental stimuli.</description>

   <description>The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a medullary autonomic center with essential roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Understanding how the NTS contributes to the coordination of ingestive behaviors and autonomic processes is therefore critical to provide insight into the control of feeding in physiological and pathological states. Thus, here we have investigated the integration of metabolically relevant factors in individual NTS neurons.&#xd;
We uncovered direct depolarizing (42% of responses, mean 7.83±0.84 mV, n=39) and hyperpolarizing (21% of responses, mean -8.23±1.00 mV, n=20) effects of the anorexigenic peptide nesfatin-1 on NTS neurons. Our reverse transcription PCR studies demonstrated exclusively depolarizing effects of nesfatin-1 on neurons expressing NUCB2, the gene which encodes nesfatin-1, and the orexigenic neuropeptide Y. Furthermore, in vivo microinjections of nesfatin-1 into the NTS elicited tachycardic and pressor effects.&#xd;
We also delineated an NTS circuit engaged by the anorexigenic peptide α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). We established the depolarizing effects (39% of responses, mean 6.14±0.54 mV, n=16) of α-MSH are due to postsynaptic actions on the membrane potential of NTS cells, while hyperpolarizations (22% of responses, mean -6.79±1.02 mV, n=9) are indirect and caused by enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. Indeed, 50% of NTS neurons showed an increase in inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) frequency in response to α-MSH. Another subset of NTS neurons was non-responsive to α-MSH due to simultaneous direct depolarizing and indirect hyperpolarizing effects of the peptide.&#xd;
Finally, we established 57% of NTS neurons exhibit physiologically relevant glucose sensing properties (n=81, 35% glucose excited, 22% glucose inhibited). Moreover, the effects of nesfatin-1 on the excitability of NTS neurons were consistent across glycemic conditions and  categories of glucose sensing cells. α-MSH, however showed preferential effects on glucose responsive NTS neurons, and depolarized all NTS cells in hypoglycemic conditions, in contrast to the heterogeneous effects elicited in normo- and hyperglycemic states.&#xd;
Taken together, our studies highlight the integration of metabolic signals in individual NTS neurons. We have also revealed critical effects of glucose concentrations on brain slice studies, findings which have important implications for electrophysiological investigations in the NTS and in other neuronal centers.</description>

   <description>RATIONALE:  Early detection and effective treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is reported to halt or slow progression (pCKD) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in many patients.  Current guidelines recommend an eGFR upper reporting limit of > 60 mL/min/1.73m2.  However, this severely limits the detection of pCKD as the first time a patient is diagnosed with CKD, they are already in Stage 3.  &#xd;
OBJECTIVE:  To determine if the rate of change in eGFR during early stages of CKD (i.e. 1 - 3) is different in those who progress to ESRD compared to those who are currently not anticipated to progress.&#xd;
METHODS:  This retrospective case-control (1:2) study used 5 years of hospital laboratory data (2008 – 2013).   All subjects had a maximum eGFR-EPI > 90 mL/min/1.73m2.  Cases had a minimum eGFR-EPI &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m2, while age- and sex-matched controls (± 5 years) had a minimum eGFR-EPI > 45 mL/min/1.73m2.    JOINPOINT (JP) regression software was used to identify and estimate the declining “linear” slope for eGFR most reflective of early pCKD.  Multi-level modelling (MLM) was used for statistical analysis.&#xd;
RESULTS:   There were 30 cases (13 women, 17 men), and 60 controls (26 women, 34 men), for a total of 3,217 observations in 90 subjects.  The mean eGFR-EPI slope by MLM was -2.9 mL/min/1.73m2/year (95%CI: -3.3 to -2.4) for controls, and -13.0 mL/min/1.73m2/year (95%CI: -16.6 to -9.4) for cases.  The median intra-individual variation for eGFR-EPI was 9.5% (95%CI: 4 - 17%) for controls and 24% (95%CI: 6 - 45%) for cases.  The average “reference change value” (RCV) needed between two serial values to detect a significant decrease was -25%.  &#xd;
CONCLUSIONS:  Although eGFR declined in a linear fashion in some subjects, it may be more accurate to describe pCKD as an event-to-event process overlying progressive deterioration.  Thus, analysis assuming linear decline should be undertaken cautiously in CKD.  In order to detect pCKD earlier, regression with visual review of eGFR time profiles is optimal.  Individuals at high risk need to be monitored at a useful frequency to take full advantage of the testing performed and the potential to significantly modify patient outcomes.</description>

   <description>This study describes the experiences reported by at-risk youth in a four-day, equine assisted learning (EAL) program and evaluates the impact of the program on the youths’ social skills and resiliency. A multi-strategy single group pre-test/post-test design was implemented at an EAL facility in Ontario. Two self-report instruments, the Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) and the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA), were completed on two occasions: baseline and immediately following participation in EAL. Multiple paired-samples t-tests were computed to determine if there were any changes over time. Two participants were selected for exit interviews on the last day of the program.&#xd;
The results of this work indicated that participation in EAL may positively influence social skills and resiliency development. The self-report scales achieved statistically significant improvement (p &lt; .05) in perceived levels of: empathy, self-control, mastery, optimism, self-efficacy, support, sense of relatedness, social skills, and internalizing symptoms. Additionally, interviews with two participants in the EAL program revealed that participants enjoyed working with the horses, experienced increased self-awareness and self-confidence, felt safe and calm at the farm, and developed trusting bonds with the horses. Further investigation is recommended to determine the underlying mechanisms at work, in addition to whether the perceived gains are maintained and transferable to other areas of the participants’ lives. The overarching goal of this research was to provide a foundation for empirical research on EAL within the Canadian context. It is hoped that the literature, methodologies, results, and recommendations compiled in this study will be used as a stepping stone for more research on employing EAL as a tool for social cognitive development.</description>

Military pilots must not only be able to fly the aircraft but they also must be able to seamlessly integrate the aircraft into a wide range of operational situations, working to complete complex missions in hostile terrain and under difficult circumstances. The overall goal of this thesis is to examine the specific cognitive abilities and/or demographic characteristics of Canadian Forces pilot candidates in aircrew selection using three aptitude test batteries. There were three purposes of this study: to investigate relationships amongst the three aptitude test batteries completed by the pilot candidates, to determine if there were specific indicators that defined successful pilot candidates, and to examine the patterns of performance in flight simulator testing. Analysis of the relationships identified three factors, which were significant in a number of analyses and confirmed that candidates who were successful at aircrew selection possessed a number of common abilities. Specific groups of candidates were also identified based on their performance in the simulator. Candidates who scored well on Psychomotor Ability and Spatial Reasoning subtests were successful at pilot selection and Gender was consistently a significant factor in aptitude testing, with female candidates experiencing greater difficulty passing selection. The development of systemically complex aircraft may have reduced the need for strong psychomotor abilities and instead generated an increased requirement for improved problem solving abilities and situational awareness. The current study demonstrated some movement towards this new dynamic by showing the importance of a Reasoning factor based on problem solving and critical thinking abilities, and an ability to work quickly and accurately under time constraints. Successful completion of pilot selection required candidates to be competent in a number of ability domains. More diverse abilities testing may select military pilot candidates whose performance during flight training is of a higher calibre as a result of their expanded skill set and who are better equipped to meet the challenges of today’s complex and ever-changing air environment.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2014-10-14 15:20:52.972</description>
   <description>Background: Hospitals vary in the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients they treat on an annual basis.  Institutional experience with this type of complex patient may be associated with the quality of post-arrest care delivered by a hospital, specifically targeted temperature management (TTM). &#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: 1) To quantify the variability in post-cardiac arrest patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes across a network of 37 hospitals in Southern Ontario, 2) To evaluate the association between average annual hospital volume of patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and several care process and clinical outcomes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study of consecutive non-traumatic OHCA cases presenting to the 37 hospitals in the Strategies for Post-Arrest Care Network of Southern Ontario from 2007-2013. The study included adult patients who achieved return of spontaneous circulation, survived at least 6 hours post-hospital arrival and were comatose.  The study excluded patients with a pre-existing Do-Not-Resuscitate order, who had life sustaining therapy withdrawn within 6 hours of hospital arrival, and who had intracranial or severe bleeding within 6 hours of hospital arrival. The patient population was described and the proportion of patients who achieved specific care-process and clinical outcomes were reported by hospital volume.  Several multi-level logistic regression models were constructed with patients (level 1) nested within hospitals (level 2).&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: The cohort included 2,723 eligible patients at 37 hospitals. Overall, 33% had successful TTM. Successful TTM varied significantly between 3 hospital volume groups (26% (184/721) for &lt;15 patients/year, 33% (342/1024) for 15-25 patients/year, and 38% (369/978) for >25 patients/year; p&lt;0.05). The volume groups were comparable on patient factors.  The intraclass correlation coefficient demonstrated 11% of the variability in successful TTM was attributable to hospital-level factors. Multilevel analysis revealed for each 10 unit increase in annual volume of patients eligible for TTM, the adjusted odds for successful TTM were almost 30% higher (OR 1.29, CI95 1.03-1.62).&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Successful TTM varied markedly between hospitals on the basis of experience with post-OHCA patients. Patients who received successful TTM were more likely to have arrived at hospitals with more experience in post-OHCA patients.</description>

   <title>Applications of Multitaper Spectral Analysis to Nonstationary Data</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2014-10-15 00:52:05.842</description>
   <description>This thesis is concerned with changes in the spectrum over time observed in Holocene climate data as recorded in the Burgundy grape harvest date series. These changes represent nonstationarities, and while spectral estimation techniques are relatively robust in the presence of nonstationarity--that is, they are able to detect significant contributions to power at a given frequency in cases where the contribution to power at that given frequency is not constant over time--estimation and prediction can be improved by considering nonstationarity. We propose improving spectral estimation by considering such changes. Specifically, we propose estimating the level of change in frequency over time, detecting change-point(s) and sectioning the time series into stationary segments. We focus on locating a change in frequency domain in time, and propose a graphical technique to detect spectral changes over time. We test the estimation technique in simulation, and then apply it to the Burgundy grape harvest date series. The Burgundy grape harvest date series was selected to demonstrate the introduced estimator and methodology because the time series is equally spaced, has few missing values, and a multitaper spectral analysis, which the methodology proposed in this thesis is based on, of the grape harvest date series was recently published. In addition, we propose a method using a test for goodness-of-fit of autoregressive estimators to aid in assessment of change in spectral properties over time.&#xd;
                  &#xd;
        This thesis has four components: (1) introduction and study of a level-of-change estimator for use in the frequency domain change-point detection, (2) spectral analysis of the Burgundy grape harvest date series, (3) goodness-of-fit estimates for autoregressive processes, and (4) introduction of a statistical software package for multitaper spectral analysis.  We present four results. (1) We introduce and demonstrate the feasibility of a level-of-change estimator.  (2) We present a spectral analysis and coherence study of the Burgundy grape harvest date series that includes locating a change-point. (3) We present a study showing an advantage using multitaper spectral estimates when calculating autocorrelation coefficients. And (4) we introduce an R software package, available on the CRAN, to perform multitaper spectral estimation.</description>

   <description>The ammonia released from wastewater is a key factor in detrimental environment concerns such as eutrophication. Nitrogenous waste is most commonly removed from wastewater through biological means, typically involving the use of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB), and denitrifying bacteria (DEN). This study looked at alternative nitrification processes, including anaerobic ammonia oxidiation (anammox) reactions that may be innately present in an integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFFAS). Due to the unique characteristics of IFFAS configuration, the biofilm component allowed for anoxic zones, as well as higher biomass retention, both factors favouring the growth of anammox bacteria. One of the main goals of this thesis project was to look for the presence of anammox bacteria, which could be a group of microorganism that is involved in removal of ammonia and nitrite, in addition to the conventional nitrifiers found in the IFFAS system. &#xd;
&#xd;
Through the use of batch experiments, the different forms of nitrogen in the microbial nitrogen cycle (ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) were measured over the course of the IFFAS reaction period, under aerated and non-aerated conditions. Subsequently, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques were utilized to confirm anammox presence. Although, initial data from the batch experiment was strongly suggestive of anaerobic ammonia oxidation in the IFFAS system, the FISH experiments did not detect anammox bacteria. Incorporating data from a parallel experiment, it was possible that a different group of bacteria, known as Rhodanobacter, may be responsible for the AOB to NOB imbalance rather than anammox bacteria. Certain species of Rhodanobacter are able to utilize nitrite and nitrate as oxidizers in the denitrification process under anoxic conditions, which may be present in the biofilms of the IFFAS system. Therefore, it is possible that Rhodanobacter is involved in the removal of any excess nitrite produced by the higher levels of AOB in the IFFAS reactors.</description>

   <description>Despite being an area of constitutionally concurrent responsibility, immigration policy was almost completely dominated by the federal government for much of Canada's history. This changed initially in Quebec, where after the Quiet Revolution a series of bilateral agreements granted the provincial government incrementally increasing responsibility over immigration, culminating in almost full devolution in 1991. However, soon after Quebec's journey toward devolution concluded, the journey of other provinces began. By the turn of the 21st century, every province was active — though to drastically varying degrees — in selection policy, many provinces were active in settlement policy, and two additional provinces had negotiated agreements giving them predominate control over the planning and funding of settlement policies, subject only to quite general federal guidelines. However, in an unusual move, the federal government announces in 2012 that it would terminate the devolution of settlement programming to the two provinces, and hinted at recentralization in selection policy as well.&#xd;
This dissertation investigates this unusual episode in Canada's federal history. The chapters are guided by attempts to answer three principal analytical questions. First, why, after a century-long period of federal dominance in all areas of immigration policy did Canada move towards a system of asymmetrical devolution? Second, did this devolution have a substantive impact on the nature of selection and settlement policies; have the provincial approaches proved significantly different than the federal? Finally, third, why did this system change, leading to a recentralization of settlement policy, and potential for similar changes in selection policy? On top of these three questions, the dissertation also addresses, in the concluding chapter, a normative question which draws on answers to the other three questions. Namely, what level of centralization or decentralization will lead to the best immigrant selection and settlement policies in the Canadian context?</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: Physical fighting is a concerning behaviour among adolescents and can lead to injury. Family affluence can influence adolescent injury, but its impact on injury has not been extensively explored in a fighting context.&#xd;
OBJECTIVES:1) To describe the prevalence and trends of physical fighting and fighting-related injury in Canadian adolescents over time, 2) to examine the association between family affluence and the outcomes of physical fighting and fighting-related injury.&#xd;
METHODS: Manuscript 1. Canadian data from cycles 2-6 of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study were used (N=61,465 grade 6-10 students). Cross-tabulations were used to calculate proportions and risk estimates by sex, grade, and self-perceived affluence. A trend analysis was conducted across time cycles. &#xd;
Manuscript 2.  HBSC data from 2009/2010 were used (N=26,078). Poisson regression was performed to compare the risk of physical fighting and fighting-related injury at different affluence levels. Three affluence indicators were used: self-perceived affluence, family affluence scale (FAS), and area-level average household income. &#xd;
RESULTS: Manuscript 1. A significant change was observed over time for physical fighting (Ptrend=0.015) and fighting-related injury overall (Ptrend&lt;0.001). Although for fighting especially, more time-points are necessary to confidently determine the extent and direction of trend. Males were twice as likely to report both outcomes compared to females (p=0.001-0.044). There was a decreased risk of fight involvement from lower to higher grades (ptrend&lt;0.001), but an increased risk for fighting-related injury with increasing grades (ptrend=0.001-0.261). Decreased affluence was associated with a higher risk of both outcomes (ptrend=0.001-0.913).&#xd;
Manuscript 2. Patterns were generally similar in all three measurements, although the gradient strength varied for each measure. Self-perceived affluence showed a stronger inverse gradient in girls than boys. FAS showed a similar inverse gradient within females, and low FAS greatly influenced both outcomes in males. Area-level income only presented a significantly higher likelihood for fighting in females (low RR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), and insignificant associations with fighting-related injury.&#xd;
CONCLUSION: Physical fighting and fighting-related injury have changed over time. Specific subgroups, especially those of lower affluence, are at higher risk for both outcomes. The strength of the association varied depending on which affluence measurement was used.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study is to explore how Training Development Officers (TDOs) solve novel problems. Unlike other organizations, the military grows its talent. After enrolment in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), individuals are promoted to fill more senior positions. Senior positions are not filled by individuals outside of the CAF. Central to the education and training within the military is facilitating the development of expertise. Investigating qualitatively how officers solve novel problem can provide valuable insight into the development of expertise generally and also specifically within individual occupations within the military. The position of TDO was selected because TDOs serve as change agents and educational consultants for individual and collective operational performance. A hallmark of the TDO occupation is systematic thinking when providing advice, guidance, or facilitation. The purpose of this study was to explore: (a) how do TDOs characterize and identify novel problems within their occupation? and (b) how do TDOs respond to novel problems (i.e. transfer from automatic to effortful decision making)? Using Transfer and Adaptive Expertise paradigms, this study sought to understand how individuals are able to solve novel problems. This study identified that individuals are able to determine a problem is novel once forced to create a new approach to solve the solution. This goes beyond adapting or exporting a solution.  Individuals become effortful in order to plan their actions. Participants develop a plan that is flexible and involves an ongoing integrated and iterative process allowing a plan to be reexamined and reoriented as required.</description>

   <description>Introduction: Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of physical activity (PA) for First Nations youth (Critchley et al., 2006; Tighe &amp; McKay, 2012). It is also well-known that environmental factors like land-use mix and residential density play a critical role in the quality of PA opportunities available to youth (Ding, Sallis, Kerr, Lee, &amp; Rosenberg, 2011). While the PA-environment link in urban centres is well understood, there has never been an exploration of the unique relationship First Nations youth have with their environment and how it might influence PA levels. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the PA-environment relationship with First Nations youth to inform the development of a culturally relevant PA environment assessment tool for First Nations communities. Methods: Using the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) and Two-Eyed Seeing, First Nations youth (n=14) were trained in the art of Photovoice to take photos that illustrate ways in which the environment influences their PA. Youth also completed the Rural Active Living Assessment (RALA) tool. Next, the youth were asked to join a talking circle to share their experience of PA opportunities in their community as well as to discuss the RALA tool. Talking circles were analyzed for themes using NVivo software for Windows. Results: Youth co-researchers indicated that the First Nations community environment influences their PA through multiple ecological levels. The organization of themes using the socio-ecological model demonstrates that youth PA is influenced by the environment from the interpersonal to the policy level. This conceptual model will be used in addition to RALA tool commentary provided by youth co-researchers to develop a PA environment assessment tool. Discussion: This study was the first to explore the PA-environment link in First Nations communities from a First Nations youth perspective in order to develop a culturally relevant PA environment assessment tool. The new tool, once validated, will be used to help community members strengthen current PA efforts and create culturally relevant opportunities to address ongoing challenges with youth PA participation. Future research is needed to refine, test, and validate items on the PA environment assessment tool.</description>

   <description>Trunk water main failures pose a large risk to users as they often carry severe hydraulic, economic, and social consequences. The consequences can be increased when a fire event in the water distribution system coincides with a trunk water main failure event. Currently, municipalities have limited knowledge on the consequences associated with the failure of trunk water mains, as it has only recently emerged as an area of concern as water main assets reach or exceed their expected service life. Consequence modelling can provide municipalities with information to help with emergency planning and rehabilitation/replacement planning. &#xd;
The aim of this thesis is to present a new methodology to characterize the consequences of trunk water main failures in water distribution systems. A new consequence index equation is used to calculate the severity of a failure event. A number of metrics were developed to characterize a range of consequences to the system and water users. A focus is placed on the hydraulic changes during water main failures and the ensuing consequences. The model examines failure during normal, peak and fire flow conditions in the network. &#xd;
Two case studies were completed by applying the consequence model to the D-Town and City of Kingston water distribution systems. The purpose of these studies is to demonstrate the effectiveness of consequence modelling and provide the City of Kingston with information regarding trunk water main failures in their system, and thus help prevent high consequence events. An investigation of the relationship between pipe properties (location, pipe diameter, pipe length, proximity to large components) and consequence severity provided insight into trunk water main failure events. The results of these studies suggest that the location of the trunk water main failure is the largest contributing factors to the severity of consequence.</description>

   <description>Both Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the dorsal hippocampus have consistently been found to regulate anxiety-related behaviours in both humans and animals. However, although the dorsal hippocampus contains a high concentration of NPY receptors very little research has examined the effect of NPY infusions into the dorsal hippocampus on anxiety-like behaviours. The current study tested the hypothesis that acute injection of NPY into the dorsal hippocampus decreases anxiety-like behaviours. To test this hypothesis, bilateral infusion of 1.5 ug/side of NPY (n = 7) or sterile water vehicle (n = 8) into the rat dorsal hippocampus was followed by behavioural testing in three animal models of anxiety: i.e., the elevated plus-maze, novelty-induced suppression of feeding and shock-probe burying test.  NPY-treated rats displayed no significant differences in behaviour in all three animal models of anxiety. Although the results of the current study did not support the hypothesis that NPY injection will reduce anxiety-like behaviours, a thorough review of the literature provides ample support for further investigation in this area.</description>

   <title>Risk Assessment of Arsenic in Arabic Area Rice Using On-Line Leaching and Speciation Analysis by Ion Exchange Chromatography Coupled to Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2014-10-23 12:09:46.012</description>
   <description>For the first time, a simple on-line continuous leaching method, where artificial gastrointestinal fluids are sequentially pumped through a mini-column of food while As is continuously monitored by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), is used to assess the bio-accessibility of As in Arabic area rice. This on-line leaching method offers several advantages over batch methods; most notably, it provides real-time leaching data and involves a shorter and simpler sample preparation, which reduces the risk of contamination. There was no significant difference between the bio-accessible As concentrations measured by on-line and batch methods, although, with the on-line method, the concentration sum of As leached and As left in the residue was closer to the total As concentration according to a Student’s t-test at the 95 % confidence level, which is commensurate with the batch method being more subject to contamination.  Leaching with artificial saliva released As the most, followed by artificial gastric juice and intestinal fluid. Both the on-line and batch methods showed that 20%-95% of As in rice samples is bio-accessible. The results of As bio-accessibility in unwashed raw rice and in washed cooked rice after simply washing the rice with water prior to cooking were similar, indicating that cooking had no significant effect on As bio-accessibility.&#xd;
&#xd;
A method based on anion-exchange chromatography with on-line detection by ICP-MS was also used for the speciation analysis of As. For better risk assessment, speciation analysis was performed on washed and cooked samples. Because saliva leached the most As, the determination of As species was only conducted in saliva leachates. The results revealed that the concentration of inorganic As species in rice varies to some extent according to the samples' location. In general, As(V) predominated over As(III), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA).  Although As(V) is considered to be more toxic than MMA and DMA, this investigation indicates that the concentration of As(V) can be reduced significantly by washing rice several times, thereby decreasing the risk of arsenic poisoning.</description>

   <description>Mobile app stores contain millions of apps which users can download and install on their smart phones. Each app has a page in the mobile app store that includes app's description, a download link for the app, and a space for users to review the app. Each review has a 1-5 star rating and a review-comment. Unlike desktop and server side-software where direct user feedback about software quality was difficult to acquire, app developers now have access to the user's perspective of their apps via the reviews. Since apps with high-rating reviews are downloaded statistically significantly more than apps with low-rating reviews, the insights from studying these reviews are very important. Thus in this thesis, we analyze hundreds of thousands of reviews of Android and iOS apps to help developers understand the relationship between app quality, and the feedback in reviews.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we find that low-rated reviews of apps contain 12 different complaint types which have varying impact and frequencies. The most frequent complaints are about functional errors, feature requests, and app crashes; complaints about privacy, ethical and hidden cost issues receive the worst star ratings. For Android developers struggling with device fragmentation, we find that different Android devices give varying star ratings. However, we show that device info from reviews can also be used to identify a subset of Android devices that should be prioritized for testing. Finally, we show that warnings from FindBugs, a static analysis tool, are related to lower average app ratings and the complaints that users leave in the reviews. This thesis shows how studying the reviews of mobile apps can help developers prioritize their testing efforts to address the concerns of their users.</description>

   <title>FRAP Measurements of Solute Diffusion Through Hydrogels</title>

   <description>The distribution of therapeutic agents such as proteins or drug-loaded nanoparticles within a hydrogel following release influences their rate of absorption at the desired site of action. For formulation design purposes, it is, therefore, important to be able to predict their diffusivity within vehicles like the hydrogel. For this purpose, the diffusivity of solute probes within a hydrogel can be estimated using a mathematical expression based on describing the diffusion of spheres within a macromolecular matrix.&#xd;
The assumptions of the obstruction-scaling model were assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The obstruction model demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities for solute diffusion in polymer solutions using different molecular agents as shown through the work of Zhang and Amsden. To extend its applicability to hydrogels, the assumption must be valid that the correlation length of a hydrogel is the same as that of a polymer solution at equivalent concentrations. The results in this study confirm the validity of this assumption by comparing the predictions of the obstruction model to diffusion measurements of FITC-dextran (4, 10, 20, 40 kDa) in alginate-methacrylate gels. The model provided good predictions for small diffusing agents (4, 10 kDa) and underestimated the diffusion coefficients of dextrans exceeding 20 kDa. This difference was attributed to reptation effects that become more influential as the solute radius approaches the correlation length of a network.</description>

   <description>In the twenty-first century, there is a global rush for agricultural land. This rush is extremely profitable and extremely destabilizing, nowhere more so than in low-income countries with large reserves of arable agricultural land. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of global governance initiatives aimed at ameliorating the negative effects of large-scale commercial agricultural acquisitions. But low-income countries seeking to reform land governance have encountered serious obstacles. &#xd;
Tanzania is just such a case. For years, rural populations and feminist groups have been crying foul over forced displacement, corrupt land dealing, and the marginalization of women. Yet Tanzania has long been praised for its progressive efforts to recognize customary land tenure and promote gender equality in both land rights and participation in land governance. From the outside, one might think that Tanzania has successfully balanced global agricultural investment with local practices. But this is not necessarily the case. Why haven’t these Tanzanian measures been able to prevent unjust outcomes?&#xd;
This dissertation assesses global land governance initiatives with reference to Tanzania’s struggles to implement land governance reform. It argues that the road to land reform is complicated by oversimplified assumptions about gender in the governance of land. To develop this argument, this dissertation analyzes two prominent global land initiatives: the Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment (PRAI) and the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Land Tenure. By employing a gender-sensitive global governance framework, this dissertation expands the scholarly definition of governance by considering practices ordinarily excluded from traditional analysis. These include family and community forms of governance, which have a profound effect on the way global- and national-level policies are enacted. In doing so, this analysis illustrates obstacles to land reform, the limits of liberal rights-based frameworks, and the folly of considering land deals as a strictly global-level and gender-neutral process. Indeed, the global land deal is revealed to be at once local and global, embedded in a complex of socio-political gendered relationships.</description>

   <description>Understanding the environmental, demographic, and evolutionary processes underlying species’ range limits (RLs) is a primary goal of ecology, and increasingly important for conservation in a world of changing species distributions. This thesis addresses three of the most pressing questions: whether RLs typically reflect niche or dispersal constraints; whether generalizations regarding the limiting niche constraints are possible; and how the processes underlying current RLs might affect future RLs. First, I conducted a meta-analysis of transplant experiments beyond species’ ranges, which can directly test the first questions. Performance declined beyond the range for 75% of 111 tests, confirming the broad importance of underlying niche constraints. Results supported the long-proposed but seldom-tested hypothesis that biotic interactions are especially important at low-elevation/equatorial RLs. However, dispersal caused frequent (ca. 50%) mismatches between range and niche limits, often constraining geographic distributions, while extending elevational RLs. Second, I construct a theoretical framework exploring how selection on dispersal varies across species ranges, and how this affects current and future RLs. Whereas dispersal should always increase along invasion fronts, its evolution is likely constrained during expansion of native species, and may play a decisive role in maintaining genetic diversity at RLs contracting due to climate change. Local adaptation to a shifting environmental gradient could select for increased dispersal throughout the range, including contracting limits. Third, I test the importance of niche vs. dispersal constraints and the demographic, environmental and evolutionary patterns underlying the elevational RLs of the annual herb Rhinanthus minor L. Multi-generation demographic surveys of natural populations spanning four range-wide transects reveal that population productivity (net reproductive rate NRR and seed production/m2) declined toward both limits, reflecting low reproductive success at high elevations, but early life-stage failure at low elevations. Surveys suggested an increasing role of competition, but not herbivory, toward the lower RL. A 3-yr reciprocal transplant experiment confirmed that strong niche constraints underlie R. minor’s RLs, as all sources failed beyond both limits (NRR&lt;1). Seed quality declined at upper RLs, but local adaptation in phenology enabled early-flowering high-elevation sources to reproduce in short growing seasons, making them the best poised to expand the upper RL.</description>

   <description>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an evolutionarily conserved developmental process characterized by the loss of intercellular contacts, changes in cell polarity and increased migration and invasion. EMT has recently been shown to have a significant impact on chemotherapy response and metastatic progression in cancer cells. We hypothesized that because EMT contributes to aggressive cancer phenotypes, expression profiles of key EMT modulators could be profiled in ovarian and prostate tumours to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive disease.&#xd;
	Our results demonstrated that increased EMT gene expression was correlated with chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer, and with higher Gleason pattern in prostate cancer, confirming an association between EMT and increased risk for cancer progression.  This underscores the potential for EMT gene signatures to be used as clinically relevant predictive and prognostic biomarkers.&#xd;
	Functional studies using in vitro models of Cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer and invasive prostate cancer demonstrated that inhibition of EMT signaling, both through the dysregulation of key transcription factors (SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1), and repressed expression of phenotypically important genes such as VIM, SPARC, CLTC and HIF1A resulted in loss of aggressive attributes in these cell lines.  This included re-sensitization of our ovarian cancer cells to the effects of Cisplatin, while significantly reducing cell migration and invasion in our prostate cancer cells, both in 2- and 3-dimensional culture models.&#xd;
	Furthermore, using our prostate cancer knockdown cell lines, we were able to assess gene expression changes in response to single gene repression. As a result, those genes that appear to have the highest degree of connectivity within the context of our EMT network were identified, thus contributing to the overall understanding of EMT regulation. &#xd;
	Ultimately, we have been able to assess the role of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in aggressive tumour behaviours, such as resistance to chemotherapy and progression towards metastatic events. The results of this work indicate that gene expression signatures associated with EMT may be useful as predictive and prognostic biomarkers in various cancer types. Furthermore, gene knockdown studies have provided insight into EMT signaling network regulation, as well as the functional contribution of a number of genes to alterations in migratory and invasive cancer cell programs.</description>

   <description>In broad terms, STSE is an umbrella term that explores the interplay between science and society (Pedretti, 2005). One of the goals of STSE education is to enable students to formulate a critical understanding of the interface between science, technology, society and environment.&#xd;
The literature on writing to learn in science sheds some light on the advantages of using writing strategies within science – whether students learn by mimicking professional scientists, or by writing in diverse forms. By extension, these writing strategies can serve to meet the goals of STSE education by enabling students to formulate a critical understanding of the interface between science, technology, society and environment. Through this paper, I wish to report on which writing strategies science teachers are currently using, and what opportunities and challenges these strategies are creating for STSE education. The purpose of this project, therefore, was to analyze and describe how science teachers might meet the goals of STSE education through the use of writing strategies.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-10-29 16:55:13.301</description>
   <description>This work is a study of the size, dynamics and morphological consequences of large-scale horizontal coherent structures (HCS's) in a deep open-channel flow. The study has the following three objectives: 1- to assert the existence of HCS's in a deep open-channel flow and establish their characteristic times and lengths; 2- to penetrate the dynamics of the life cycle of HCS's in such a flow; and 3- to gain insight into why the bed forms known as alternate bars disappear in such flows, even though meandering can still occur. The study is intended as an extension of previous work carried out at Queen's University and focusing on a shallow, alternate bar inducing flow.&#xd;
For the present purposes, six series of flow velocity measurements were carried out in a 21 m long, 1 m wide straight channel, conveying a 0.14 m deep flow. The bed surface consisted of a silica sand having an average grain size of 2 mm; its surface was flat. The bed slope was such that the bed shear stress was substantially below the threshold for the initiation of motion. The measurements were carried out with the aid of 16 MHz 2D Son Tek Micro-ADV's.&#xd;
The presence of HCS's affecting (or occupying) the entire body of fluid was unambiguously revealed by the present measurements. The average horizontal burst length and period of the measured flow were found to be equal to 5.5 m. The results of a quadrant analysis of the joint behaviour of the longitudinal and transversal components of fluctuating velocity, and the analysis of the plan distribution of planar Reynolds shear stress show that these structures originate at the upper layers of the flow.&#xd;
This study further demonstrates that some form of upstream discontinuity is able to regularize the plan configuration of the HCS's, so as induce the internal meandering of the flow. The HCS's were found to be of a rather diffuse nature towards the lower layers of flow, which likely explains why they are not able to produce alternate bars.</description>

   <description>A drastic increase in environmental awareness has increased demand for renewable materials, energy efficient design and low embodied energy. Two technologies that purport to address this demand are Compressed Earth Blocks (CEB) and Structural Insulated Panels (SIP). &#xd;
CEBs, a form of earthen masonry, can be a cost-effective, locally produced material that provides high thermal capacity with low environmental impact. There is increasing interest in using the blocks in cold climates. However, CEBs are limited by manufacturing controls and susceptibility to water damage. In this study, various combinations of cement and lime stabilizers were tested with metakaolin, a pozzolan, and Plasticure, a water repellent, to determine the compressive strength when CEBs are dry and fully saturated at unconditioned and freeze-thaw conditioned states. Results showed that the most beneficial additive for improving wet-state capacity was Plasticure. Blocks manufactured with 10% cement and Plasticure yielded the best performance, with a dry unconfined strength of 10.23±0.81 MPa and an 11.6% reduction in strength when wet. When exposed to freeze-thaw cycling, Plasticure reduced variability in strength reduction from 90.9% to 23.5%, and increased strength retention by up to 74.7%. &#xd;
SIPs are becoming increasingly popular because of their light weight, ease and speed of installation, and high thermal insulation capabilities; however, conventional systems are unsustainable due to their reliance on synthetic fibres and petroleum-based resins. This study focused on the short- and long-term performances of Flax Fibre Reinforced Polymer (Flax-FRP) and compared it to Glass-FRP. Then it assessed the replacement of conventional Glass-FRP skins with skins made of Flax-FRP and a resin blend containing epoxidized pine oil. Results showed that Flax-FRP had a tensile strength and modulus of one third the values of Glass-FRP. Using the Arrhenius relationship, it was estimated that Flax-FRP would retain 60% of its tensile strength after 100 years of saltwater exposure at an annual mean temperature of 10°C. Sandwich panels with three layers of flax fibres provided equivalent strength and stiffness, but better deformability, than panels with one layer of glass fibres. Epoxidized pine oil-based skins decreased strength by up to 23% compared to epoxy-based skins.</description>

   <description>Most Web users are unaware of being identified or followed by web agents which leverage techniques such as browser fingerprinting (or fingerprinting). Data obtained through such fingerprinting techniques can be utilized for various purposes ranging from understanding the types and properties of the user's browser to learning the user Web experience (e.g., through the browsing history). For enterprises, this can be a useful means to personalize services for their end-users or prevent online fraudulent activities. Similarly, a good fingerprinting technique can provide a rich set of data for various adversary purposes such as for compromising the security and privacy of Web users.&#xd;
Careful or attentive Web users might configure privacy enhancing tools (e.g., pop-up and cookie blockers) or operate in the private mode of the browser in order to block or prevent fingerprinters. However, recently we have observed that new fingerprinting methods can easily bypass the existing fingerprinting detection and prevention mechanisms. Moreover, while the topic of browser fingerprinting has been well studied, little attention was given to their detection and prevention.&#xd;
To address this challenge, we first analyze and reverse engineer the most widely used fingerprinting methods on the Web and unify these methods for developing a hybrid fingerprinting tool, called Fybrid. Furthermore, we integrate Fybrid with a social networking service and develop an integrated Web application, called iFybrid. Using iFybrid, we show the possibility of performing individual identification on top of browser identification using fingerprinting. We also identify metrics related to each method which are the indicators for performing fingerprinting attempts. Then, we use the identified metrics and propose a novel runtime fingerprinting detection and prevention approach, called FPGuard. FPGuard monitors activities of the running websites on the user's browser. While the detection capability of FPGuard is evaluated using the top 10,000 Alexa websites, its prevention mechanism is evaluated against four fingerprinting providers. Our evaluation results show that FPGuard can effectively detect and mitigate fingerprinting at runtime without interfering the user's browsing experience.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-10-31 11:54:55.406</description>
   <description>Network coding is known to be able to improve a network's throughput and resilience to packet losses. However, in practice high decoding complexity has been a major obstacle that prevents network coding from being widely employed. This thesis considers efficient network coding methods that have low complexity for different types of scenarios. Simple network topologies are first considered. We propose a systematic network coding approach for networks that consist of one or two two-hop lossy paths. It is proved that, compared to the random linear network coding approach, the proposed scheme requires much less computation in encoding and decoding and also achieves a higher end-to-end rate. It is demonstrated that a judicious use of uncoded packets in these networks may provide considerable gain over random coding.&#xd;
&#xd;
For networks with complex or changing topologies, we investigate the generation-based strategy to design network codes, in which source packets are grouped into subsets called generations and coding is only performed among packets belonging to the same generation. We design generation-based network codes for two different decoders that may be used in different scenarios to meet specific performance/complexity constraints. The first approach, which is generation-by-generation decoding, decodes within generations and therefore its complexity can be made linear by properly choosing the generation size. We analyze the decoding process and propose 1) a method to estimate the optimal amount of overlap among generations, which is a key parameter of generation-based network codes and 2) a new code based on unequal-size generations. The proposed code is shown to outperform existing codes in terms of both computational cost and reception overhead. The second approach considers overhead-optimized decoding, which decodes generations jointly and has lower overhead than the generation-by-generation decoder but requires more computation. We provide an overhead-optimized decoder design with low computational cost and then design codes that are sparser than existing codes. The proposed code is shown to have lower overhead and decoding cost.</description>

   <description>This dissertation tells a research story about Canadian educators and the journey of international teaching. In reading this work you will become familiar with dimensions of experience at what some international teachers call “education’s best kept secret”—international schools. Although international schools do not feature significantly in educational research, their impact on the lives of teachers who inhabit their classrooms is significant. In this dissertation you will discover how the Canadian teachers in this study narrate their reasons for considering international teaching, their experiences in obtaining overseas positions, their professional and personal perceptions of teaching abroad, their reasons for staying overseas, and what it means to come back to Canada. This metaphorical journey of international teaching encompasses three embedded narrative phases: leaving home, teaching abroad, and coming home. Along this journey of international teaching, Canadians share what it means to be a Canadian at global international institutions. &#xd;
This study addresses a gap in the literature on international education: the perspectives of 110 Canadian teachers at three different stages of the journey of international teaching: (a) those considering positions at international schools, (b) those currently working abroad, and (c) those who have returned to Canada after overseas appointments. The stages and the borderlands along the journey provide the opportunity to find home in places both imagined and unanticipated. Interpreting this metaphorical journey through the tensions and possibilities that occur in the borderlands offers insight for both teacher education and teacher identity in local and global contexts.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2014-10-31 16:15:00.291</description>
   <description>Background: Previous research has shown that there is an association between prior contact with a person with emotional or mental health problems and an expectation of negative public attitudes toward people with a mental illness. Expectation of negative public attitudes is an extra burden that is associated with mental illnesses.&#xd;
Objectives: 1) Describe Canadians’ expectations of negative attitudes toward people with depression. 2) Examine the association between intimacy of prior contact with a person with emotional or mental health problems and the expectation of negative public attitudes towards those with depression.&#xd;
Methods: Data from the rapid response portion of the 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey were used. There were 10,389 respondents. Exposure was divided into any prior contact and no prior contact and for further analyses any contact was sub-divided into most intimate contact (self, family member, friend, co-worker) or total number of types of contact (0, 1, 2, 3/4). Outcome was determined using a reduced version of Link’s Devaluation-Discrimination Measure. A stigma score was determined and the respondent was categorized into one of three groups based on score (low, moderate, or high expectations of negative public attitudes). Stratified analyses and ordinal regression were used to determine if Canadians were less likely to hold negative attitudes if they had prior personal contact with someone who had a mental illness and if negative attitudes were inversely associated with intimacy of contact. &#xd;
Results: There was only one statistically significant result. Compared to those who had personally experienced a mental illness, those who identified knowing a co-worker with a mental illness had higher odds of expecting negative public attitudes (OR= 10.61, 95% CI: 1.41, 79.70), however, this may have been a spurious association owing to the large number of comparisons made.&#xd;
Conclusion: In this study, with one possible exception, previous prior contact with a person with emotional or mental health problems was not associated with expectation of negative public attitudes toward people with depression.</description>

   <description>The Greece-Turkey borders have become one of the main points of undocumented entry into the European Union since 2009. The borders operate through complex elements: historical processes that shape their structure, ideologies that legitimize their violent existence, techniques and technologies that allow them to be practiced over migrants, and migrants complying with or resisting these structures, ideologies, techniques, and technologies. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis of these complex elements of the border, this dissertation critically engages with Althusser’s aleatory materialism, Foucault’s analytics of power and other complementary theories, and it analyzes the four aspects of the border in individual chapters. 1. Structural-decentred aspects of the border: The dissertation analyzes the historical material processes of colonialism and racism and the contemporary material processes of neoliberal globalization and post-politics that enable the EU borders to function as a decentred totality and to exclude certain peoples and not others. 2. Practical aspects of the border: The dissertation analyzes how the border operates in practice with specific surveillance technologies (such as radar systems and EUROSUR mechanisms at the borderzones) and techniques (such as everyday racist violence in urban contexts) that produce specific biopolitical effects on migrants. 3. Subjective aspects of the border: The dissertation analyzes how migrants develop diverse subjectivities when confronted by the border’s material violence, including stranger subjectivity, abject subjectivity, religious subjectivity, nomadic subjectivity, and dissident subjectivity. 4. Contested aspects of the border: Drawing on the case of 300 Migrant Hunger Strikers in Greece, the dissertation analyzes the material conditions of possibility for political contestation of the border. The dissertation draws on fieldwork data collected from border authorities, migrants, NGO workers and political activists in Greece and Turkey in May-September 2012 and from secondary data from publicly accessible resources. This dissertation provides a complex and nuanced understanding of surveillance, borders, and migrant subjectivities and politics through putting an emphasis on how the border is practiced, on the experiences of the affected migrants, as well as on the deeper and enduring material structures that frame the practices of the border and experiences of the migrants.</description>

   <description>To remain competitive in today’s highly dynamic environments, organizations often need to act rapidly. To deal with urgent issues, top managers have to rapidly assess and act upon opportunities and threats. Strategic improvisation, a dynamic capability defined as top managers’ ability to spontaneously and creatively integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external resources and capabilities to address unpredictable and rapidly changing strategic opportunities and threats, may positively impact organizational processes and overall performance. Additionally, information systems (IS) may facilitate strategic improvisation. For senior managers, the effective use of IS may enable the detection of new opportunities and threats, while facilitating the exploitation of existing knowledge to address them. &#xd;
Using the dynamic capabilities perspective, this research addresses three research questions: 1) To what extent do IS and technology enable effective strategic improvisation? 2) How do organizational, information and knowledge factors influence strategic improvisation? 3) What are the specific effects of strategic improvisation on organizational outcomes? &#xd;
The research proceeded in two main phases. First, case studies were conducted in two highly dynamic industries, software and consulting. Top managers from four medium-sized Canadian organizations were interviewed, and interview transcripts analyzed and coded. The second phase of the project was a survey, with data collected from 143 top managers in 100 medium-sized Canadian organizations. Results were analyzed using two methods, structural equation modeling and crisp set qualitative comparative analysis.&#xd;
This study benefits both research and practice. It contributes to the literature on IT impact by establishing the role played by two IT capabilities, IT infrastructure flexibility and information management/knowledge management (IM/KM) capability in enabling strategic improvisation, as well as the moderating role of IS/IT strategy, especially innovative IS/IT strategy.  This research benefits the improvisation research by studying improvisation at the top management level and demonstrating its impact on product/service flexibility, process flexibility and organizational learning. Findings also suggest that there are many ways to achieve strategic improvisation, through various configurations of organizational memory, IM/KM capability and IT infrastructure flexibility. Last, this research provides managers with practical recommendations on the most effective ways to develop a strategic improvisation capability.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to prepare thermoplastic/multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and to apply external alternating current (AC) electric fields to achieve enhanced conductivity and dielectric properties. &#xd;
The first part of the thesis focuses on preparing polyolefin-based composites containing well-dispersed MWCNTs. MWCNTs are functionalized with a hyperbranched polyethylene (HBPE) using a non-covalent, non-specific functionalization approach and melt compounded with an ethylene-octene copolymer (EOC) matrix. The improved filler dispersion in the functionalized EOC/MWCNT composite results in higher elongation at break compared to the non-functionalized composite. However, the electrical percolation threshold and the ultimate conductivity of the composites are not affected considerably, suggesting that this functionalization approach leaves the inherent properties of the nanotubes intact. &#xd;
EOC/HBPE-functionalized MWCNT composites are further subjected to external AC electric fields (35 – 212 kV/m), which induce the formation of aligned columnar structures, as evidenced by Scanning Electron Microscopy.  Experimentally acquired resistivity data are used to derive correlations between the characteristic insulator-to-conductor transition times of the composites and the electric field strength (E), polymer viscosity (η) and MWCNT volume fraction (ϕ).  A criterion for the selection of (η, E, ϕ) conditions that enable MWCNT assembly under an electric field controlled regime (minimal Brownian motion-driven aggregation effects) is developed.&#xd;
The dielectric properties of the solidified aligned EOC/MWCNT composites are further studied using dielectric spectroscopy. Annealing of the composites at 160 oC results in the formation of interconnected structures, whereas electrification, using AC field of 71 and 212 kV/m induces the formation of aligned columnar structures. The electrified and annealed composites have increased real and imaginary permittivity compared to the as-compounded composite, resulting in improved conductivity and storage capacity. An equivalent circuit model is fitted to the experimentally obtained impedance data in order to correlate the effects of electric field and processing time to the dielectric characteristics of the treated composites.&#xd;
Finally poly(ethylene succinate) (PESu) composites containing well-dispersed MWCNT were prepared by an in-situ polymerization method. Composite electrification results in improvements in the electrical conductivity by up to 12 orders of magnitude, and a retention of high conductivity in the solidified state.</description>

   <description>Understanding the effect of subject arousal on saccadic behavior can shed light on the mechanisms by which arousal influences executive and oculomotor systems. Increased vagal activity is a key component of the parasympathetic response, and is inversely associated with arousal. We designed two experiments to examine the relationship between saccadic reaction times (SRTs) and two cardiovascular correlates of vagal activity: heart rate (HR) and the normalized high-frequency (HFν) component of heart rate variability (HRV). In the first experiment, 11 normal human subjects performed a simple saccade task where they were asked to shift their gaze towards an eccentric target. In the second experiment, 19 subjects performed a counterbalanced and interleaved task where they were asked to look either towards (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a visual stimulus. Experiment #1 aimed to probe the role of arousal on automatic oculomotor mechanisms, while Experiment #2 added an executive component. On the basis of data from these experiments, we propose the existence of two discrete mechanisms: a parasympathetic pathway that modulates automatic functions on a 25-minute timescale and another that modulates both executive and automatic functions on a 2 min timescale. We also postulate a mechanistic hypothesis for the neurovisceral integration of arousal, oculomotor behavior and cardiovascular parameters. These findings may allow concurrent pulse oximetry to be used for improving the fidelity of future oculomotor and other neurophysiological experiments.</description>

   <description>Calpains are cysteine proteases that depend on Ca2+ for activation. They have many roles in the cell; hence modifications of calpains or changes in their levels of activity can lead to altered physiological states. Thus, it is of great interest and medical relevance to design inhibitors that can specifically target calpain without interfering with the other numerous cellular cysteine proteases. The cytosolic and ubiquitous calpains-1 and -2 have a naturally occurring and specific inhibitor, calpastatin, which binds with high affinity to the active site but in such a way that the calpastatin itself is not cleaved.  Crystal structures of the full-length calpain-2 in complex with calpastatin have aided the design of novel calpain-specific inhibitors. I have helped design cyclic peptides to mimic important conserved structural elements of calpastatin and have investigated their inhibition potency against calpain. Cyclic peptides and derivative peptidomimetics were able to inhibit cysteine proteases including calpain. Macrocycle and peptidomimetic products showed competitive, non-competitive, and mixed inhibition of calpain-2 with Ki values in the micromolar range while conferring some specificity. In a second strategy inhibitors mimicking the calpastatin subdomain B α-helical region were designed to be calpain-specific  by binding outside of the common cysteine protease active site cleft but extend into it. Indeed, stabilized α-helices synthesized from conserved calpastatin residues were found to inhibit calpain specifically and potently, with potential use as fluorescent activity-based probes. Previously reported allosteric inhibitors of calpain were investigated, and their ability to inhibit the calpain enzyme through binding to the PEF domain questioned. The compound PD150606 was able to inhibit the protease core of calpain, which lacks the PEF domain of the full enzyme, and the penta-peptide LSEAL was found to have no effect at all on calpain in vitro. Thus it is now clear that binding to hydrophobic grooves in the calpain PEF domains does not confer inhibition and the mechanism of non-competitive calpain inhibition is still unknown.</description>

   <description>My thesis exposes the ubiquity of white supremacy in the ostensibly queer practice of writing slash fanfiction.   Slash fandom is often characterized as a queer online space that foregrounds women’s pleasure and functions as resistance to hegemonic ideas about gender and sexuality.  Absent from this conceptualization is the presumption of whiteness that pervades fan imaginings.  I undertake a critical discourse analysis of slash fanfiction to reveal the homonationalist and white supremacist ideologies that underpin much creative fan work.  Utilizing the framework of affect theory, I then perform an intertextual analysis of comments from white fans that reveal the possessive investment in whiteness that is a powerful undercurrent in fan communities.  Finally, I examine critiques from fans of colour to theorize anger and creativity as strategies of resistance that have the potential to open up fan spaces so they may better realize their radical emancipatory potential.</description>

   <description>In recent years, philosopher Jeff McMahan has solidified an influential view that moral desert is irrelevant to the ethics of self-defense. This work aims to criticize this view by demonstrating that there are cases in which moral desert has a niche position in determining whether it may be permissible to kill a person in self- (or other-)defense. This is done by criticizing McMahan’s Responsibility Account of liability as being overly punitive against minimally responsible threateners (MRTs), and by demonstrating, through reference to Saba Bazargan’s Hybrid Account of liability to defensive harm, that further justification than mere liability is necessary in the justification of killing these kinds of threateners. It is also argued that other kinds of justifications like lesser-evil justifications are not necessarily strong enough to justify killing MRTs, even on top of established liability. This paper puts forward the view that, where a strong enough moral difference between threatener and innocent victim cannot be established, a justification on the basis of the implications of prior moral acts might, on some occasions, give us reasons to kill or not kill MRTs in self-defense.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-11-10 21:27:21.71</description>
   <description>A numerical model to capture the effect of H2S impurities on the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) performance with Ni-based porous anode is developed. H2S impurities can adversely affect the fuel cell performance, due to the sulfur poisoning of the Ni catalyst of the SOFC anode. The novelty of this work is the derivation of a Butler-Volmer type kinetic formulation that captures the effect of sulfur poisoning on the H2 electro-oxidation reaction in the Ni-YSZ anode of SOFC. The novel kinetic model is then incorporated into a 2-dimensional porous anode model with gas-phase species transport, charged species transport and anode electrochemistry. The result is a performance model that can predict the effect of H2S impurity on the polarization curves of the SOFC by taking into account the transport phenomena in addition to the electrochemistry formulations. Two types of kinetic models named as “coverage dependent kinetic model” and “coverage independent kinetic model”, differing in the coverage dependency of energy of H2 and H2S adsorption reactions are developed and incorporated in the 2D porous anode model. Loss in performance is predicted by both kinetic models and 2D performance models. Both kinetic models predictions show an increase in the current density loss with an increase in H2S concentration. 2D performance models predictions with both coverage dependent and coverage independent models show an increasing trend in both the loss in the cell voltage and increase in the cell resistance upon the increase of the inlet H2S content of the fuel. The 2D performance model with coverage-dependent kinetics predicts lower loss in the cell performance than the 2D performance model with coverage-independent kinetics. By comparing the performance model predictions with the experimental results, similar trends of increase in the sulfur poisoning effect by increase in H2S content and smaller increase in the relative cell resistance at higher current densities can be recognized in both experimental results and the 2D model predictions. Coverage-dependent 2D performance model predictions are closer to the experimental results than the coverage-independent 2D performance model predictions.</description>

   <title>Adaptive Critic-based Control of Voltage Source Converters in Microgrid Systems</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-11-11 11:32:10.637</description>
   <description>Control of microgrids, as the main building blocks of the future smart power grid, is an important problem which has initiated many research activities in recent years. The microgrid should appear to the power grid as a single united entity, in which the majority of distributed energy resources are interfaced through voltage source converters (VSCs). In dynamic situations, specific structure, natural nonlinearity, and low physical inertia of VSCs may lead to higher sensitivity to network disturbances and power oscillations and in occasions result in violation of overall stability; hence the need for fast and flexible control techniques in the microgrid is evident.&#xd;
The design simplicity and easy implementation of PI controllers have resulted in their popularity in controlling VSCs; however their application is associated with a number of drawbacks such as poor harmonics attenuation and unsatisfactory operation in case of load changes and high penetration of distributed generators.&#xd;
In this Ph.D. thesis, three different control algorithms are proposed for VSCs in microgrid systems. The control systems are based on the adaptive critic-based control concept and employ an element called critic whose task is to evaluate the credibility of the performance and compare it with the desired goals. The critic’s evaluations are then used in an on-line procedure to update the controller parameters during dynamic transients. The critic-based control idea is used in conjunction with PI and neuro-fuzzy controllers.&#xd;
With the proposed approach, the need for precise design of the controller is removed, and because of the supervisory role of the critic, no complicated mathematical calculations are required for its design. This fact increases the degree of intelligence and adaptivity against changes such as high penetration of distributed generators and dynamically demanding situations like presence of motor loads and results in a self-tuning and non-model-based control system with high computational speed.&#xd;
The simulation results verify that the application of the proposed approach significantly improves the dynamic performance by reducing the convergence time, output oscillations, tracking error, and unwanted current harmonics and confirm the effective control in case of high penetration of distributed generators.</description>

   <description>In the first part of this work I explore the possibility of using linear alkylbenzene, the buffer liquid for the future PICO-250L detector, configured as a liquid scintillator that could provide information on the background radioactivity levels of the inner vessel. I investigate what interactions could produce scintillation light and determine their intensity and likelihood. I design different devices that help light collection and assess quantitatively their advantages and disadvantages.&#xd;
 &#xd;
In the second part of this work, I develop a 2D acoustical model of the inner vessel of the detector that reproduces the discrimination between alpha and neutron events characteristic of backgrounds in superheated liquid experiments. Such a model is crucial for understanding the propagation and reception of the acoustic signals in the chamber. Subsequently, I exploit this model to show that piezoelectric devices located in different part of the vessel yield different discrimination capability between single and multiple bubble events.</description>

   <description>In the ubiquity era, each user has multiple devices; hence an attractive model is to have applications that execute in a client’s web browser instead of developing a native application for each device. JavaScript is the language of the browser and the power available in these devices has motivated developers to move functionality to the client side. This raises the question of securing JavaScript applications since code executed on the browser is visible in plain text to potential adversaries.&#xd;
To identify the context in which JavaScript attacks take place, we discuss different styles of software architecture and conclude that the architecture relevant to our study is client/server with a monolithic, event driven client where a significant amount of the application’s logic sits on the client side.&#xd;
We discuss threat modeling methodologies and explain how this thesis fits into the attack extraction phase of threat modeling and we define a taxonomy for JavaScript attacks.&#xd;
We have collected a set of man in the middle attacks for JavaScript where the attacker actively eavesdrops on the connection. We have also included man at the end, or White Box, attacks where the attacker has control over both the execution platform and the software implementation. These attacks have been used in conventional programming languages and we have adapted them to JavaScript. White Box attacks have become significant in web applications due to the move of sensitive functionality to the client side and have especially been the concern of digital rights management.</description>

   <description>Isobutylene-rich elastomers provide the oxidative stability and impermeability required by many industrial applications.  Halogenated derivatives support a wide range of chemical modification processes that can overcome most performance limitations. This research involves the modification of brominated butyl rubber (BIIR) to introduce peroxide-curable functionality in addition to aminotrialkoxysilyl groups that improve interactions with siliceous fillers, and anthraquinone functionality that serves as a polymer-bound chromophore. The thesis also describes detailed studies of the influence of counter anions on imidazolium ionomer derivatives of brominated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) (BIMS).  Exchanging bromide with dodecyl sulfate, styrene sulfonate and montmorillonite clay platelets provided new ionomer thermosets whose rheological, tensile and adhesive properties varied considerably from their parent material.</description>

   <title>Ultrasound-guided Intervention for Prostate Cancer Detection</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2014-11-19 16:48:05.591</description>
   <description>Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed in North American&#xd;
men. It can be managed with a survival rate of over 90% if diagnosed early. Although diagnosis of prostate cancer is important, however not all the diagnosed cancers are life-threatening. Hence, accurate prognosis of prostate cancer is crucial to avoid over-treatment of patients with indolent disease. Recently, a novel ultrasound tissue typing&#xd;
technique was proposed that utilizes ultrasound RF data acquired from a stationary&#xd;
location of the tissue over time. The goal in this thesis is to present the feasibility&#xd;
of characterizing aggressive prostate cancer using ultrasound RF time series. We&#xd;
pursue this goal by analyzing data from two ex vivo and one in vivo studies involving&#xd;
prostatectomy patients.In almost all of the ultrasound-based interventions, calibration of the ultrasound&#xd;
probes is of crucial importance to determine the location of image plane in a global&#xd;
coordinate system. Calibration is routinely performed by imaging a geometrically&#xd;
known object. The calibration problem is then solved by relating the feature locations&#xd;
in this object in the ultrasound images and their true locations. Recently a calibration&#xd;
technique was proposed that eliminated the need for fabricating complex phantoms.&#xd;
This technique is based on imaging a flat plate that is immersed into a water tank. In&#xd;
this thesis, we also evaluate the robustness of this calibration by performing extensive experimental evaluations.&#xd;
In the ex vivo studies, in a cross-validation framework, areas under the accumulated&#xd;
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8 and 0.85 were obtained&#xd;
from 15 and 6 patients, respectively. The results are confirmed by performing a&#xd;
gold-standard pathology to ultrasound registration. We also provide likelihood maps&#xd;
showing the probability and extent of higher grade cancer in the entire cancerous&#xd;

   <description>Isobutylene-rich elastomers provide the oxidative stability and impermeability required by many industrial applications.  Halogenated derivatives support a wide range of chemical modification processes that can overcome most performance limitations. This research involves the modification of brominated butyl rubber (BIIR) to introduce peroxide-curable functionality in addition to aminotrialkoxysilyl groups that improve interactions with siliceous fillers, and anthraquinone functionality that serves as a polymer-bound chromophore. The thesis also describes detailed studies of the influence of counter anions on imidazolium ionomer derivatives of brominated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) (BIMS).  Exchanging bromide with dodecyl sulfate, styrene sulfonate and montmorillonite clay platelets provided new ionomer thermosets whose rheological, tensile and adhesive properties varied considerably from their parent material.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-11-26 14:18:08.825</description>
   <description>Due to its high energy generation capability and minimal environmental impact, wind energy is an elegant solution to the growing global energy demand.  Though wind energy systems can yield large amounts of energy, frequent atmospheric changes make it difficult to effectively harness the energy in the wind because maximum power extraction occurs at a different operating point for each wind condition.  Therefore, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control algorithms are used in wind energy systems to increase its power extraction efficiency.  &#xd;
Basic MPPT algorithms use pre-determined mathematical relationships that represent a specific wind system’s power/torque characteristics for maximum power capture. Due to system aging, the efficiency of these basic algorithms deteriorates over time since it cannot adapt to any system changes.  As a result, perturb and observe (P&amp;O) parameter-independent algorithms were developed to actively search for the system’s optimal operating points by perturbing the system and observing the resultant behavior.   However, P&amp;O algorithms are susceptible to logical errors when subjected to frequent atmospheric variations and ignore the effects of air density. &#xd;
This thesis proposes a parameter independent intelligent power management controller that consists of a slope-assisted MPPT and a power limit search (PLS) algorithm for small wind energy systems.   The proposed MPPT actively searches for MPPs and establishes a maximum power curve (MPC) relationship that characterizes the behavior of the given wind turbine to assist in future MPP searches. The algorithm is robust to changes in wind speed and/or air density conditions by monitoring internal system behavior.  The slope assist MPPT uses an internally derived slope parameter to ‘remember and revert’ to the system’s last operating state before the atmospheric change to increase MPP search efficiency.  &#xd;
The controller’s PLS is able to minimize the production of surplus energy to minimize the heat dissipation requirements of the energy release mechanism.  The PLS seeks the operating points that result in the desired power rather than the maximum power.  &#xd;
Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of the conventional P&amp;O algorithms and the results have shown that the proposed MPPT can extract at least 10% more power.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the cultural influence of the seventeenth-century Flemish merchant Gaspare Roomer, who lived in Naples from 1616 until 1674.  Specifically, it explores his art dealing, collecting and patronage activities, which exerted a notable influence on Neapolitan society.  Using bank documents, letters, artist biographies and guidebooks, Roomer’s practices as an art dealer are studied and his importance as a major figure in the artistic exchange between Northern and Sourthern Europe is elucidated.  His collection is primarily reconstructed using inventories, wills and artist biographies.  Through this examination, Roomer emerges as one of Naples’ most prominent collectors of landscapes, still lifes and battle scenes, in addition to being a sophisticated collector of history paintings.  The merchant’s relationship to the Spanish viceregal government of Naples is also discussed, as are his contributions to charity.  Giving paintings to notable individuals and large donations to religious institutions were another way in which Roomer exacted influence.  This study of Roomer’s cultural importance is comprehensive, exploring both Northern and Southern European sources.  Through extensive use of primary source material, the full extent of Roomer’s art dealing, collecting and patronage practices are thoroughly examined.</description>

   <description>Arthroscopic procedures require a difficult mental coordinate transform between the instrument in the surgeon's hand and the image shown on a display mounted near the patient. Significant training and experience is required to become proficient.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis describes an augmented reality (AR) system designed to assist a surgeon performing a knee cartilage repair procedure by superimposing the virtual surgical plan over the live camera feed. The overlay displays an outline of the patient's anatomy along with information to correctly align surgical tools.&#xd;
&#xd;
A user study was conducted to evaluate the performance of residents and surgeons using the AR system. The study showed a significant worsening in performance across all metrics. The study indicated that the worsening was in large part due to the transition from a classical multiple display setup showing orthogonal views of the tools and anatomy to a single view setup with our augmented reality overlay.</description>

   <description>Calcarenites are common throughout geologic history, but the range of depositional settings and conditions under which they form is poorly constrained. This study compares physically structured calcarenites in the Mississippian of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, and the Ordovician of the northern Appalachian Basin. Calcarenites in these successions are used to reconstruct paleo-environments and postulate sequence-stratigraphic subdivisions. Mississippian sediments in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin were deposited on a sub-thermocline mid to outer ramp where wave action predominated, producing oscillatory and combined-flow sedimentary structures. It is interpreted that occasional storm-generated currents produced offshore-migrating dunes. Cyclonic storms appear to have been rare due to the low latitude and west-coast location of the study area. Swell waves were instead more common, reworking sediment across the mid ramp. Comparatively, carbonate sands in the Ordovician Chazy Group are interpreted to have been deposited as a tropical transgressive system with contemporaneous siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentation. A mixed-lithology barrier-island system is interpreted to have migrated landward as relative sea level rose. Low-energy siliciclastic and carbonate sediments accumulated in the back-barrier lagoon and carbonate dune fields formed seaward of the barrier islands, covering lagoonal deposits along a wave ravinement surface. It is interpreted that the subaqueous dunes developed between storm and fair-weather wave bases due to residual tidal currents that were likely amplified by a regional funnel-shaped embayment and local bathymetric constrictions. As flooding continued, mixed wave and tidal, open-marine carbonates buried the subaqueous dune fields. Broader-scale implications can be drawn from both successions. Mississippian calcarenites suggest that swaley cross-stratification can form down to storm (or swell) wave base on carbonate platforms, and is not restricted to the shoreface as it is in siliciclastics. Furthermore, the deposits suggest that swell-wave deposits are also more likely to be produced in carbonate deposits because of in situ grain production. The Ordovician calcarenites are strikingly similar to those along transgressive, wave-dominated, siliciclastic shorelines, suggesting that barrier-island complexes and associated transgressive sand sheets could be an under-appreciated origin for other carbonate sands.</description>

   <description>Volumetric ultrasound imaging can present numerous advantages to medical diagnostics, such as increased spatial context, better long-term patient tracking, and reduced imaging times. Creating three-dimensional ultrasound systems is complicated by the attendant increase in system complexity that is required to capture the additional data, and by pulse discrimination imposing repetition frequency limits from the fixed speed of sound in tissue. If the same principles utilized in two-dimensional cross-sectional imaging are applied directly to capture a volumetric data set, the electrical interface, system complexity, and acquisition times grow exponentially. An alternative volumetric imaging method that enables real-time three-dimensional ultrasound imaging using a crossed-array structure is presented in this thesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
The crossed-array transducer developed in this thesis makes use of careful material design and optimization to increase sensitivity and eliminate artifacts. A fine-pitch 1-3 piezocomposite has been optimized for performance in this application. This is combined with a novel method for creating intrinsic apodization within the piezoceramic material. Direct manipulation of the material sensitivity was found to be necessary to eliminate an artifact  unique to the large defocused aperture being used: range secondary lobes.&#xd;
&#xd;
An acoustic stack has been designed for the transducer that optimizes sensitivity and reduces manufacturing complexity. Traces on a flexible circuit are used to define the array elements and the polyimide substrate is acoustically integrated as a matching layer. A defocusing rubber lens is used to keep the unfocused axis from experiencing near-field effects.&#xd;
&#xd;
Custom electronics are developed that incorporate a pulser and transmit beamforming system. The pulser uses a new circuit topology to create Ohmic grounding of the array elements when inactive. This is necessary in order to use the same substrate for both send and receive. A transmit beamformer and an advanced control interface have been developed that permit flexible testing using computer control, as well as stand-alone operation using focal data loaded through interchangeable cards.&#xd;
&#xd;
The system is characterized by its C-scan radiation patterns, showing confinement along the beamformed axis of 0.42mm at 75mm imaging depth. The defocused axis exhibits a smooth defocused profile with a 6dB angular spread of 45 degrees.</description>

   <description>Baculovirus gene expression is temporally divided into early and late stages. Viral late expression factors (LEFs) are essential for the transition between the early and late transcriptional stages, as well as for late gene expression. A virus-encoded RNA polymerase (RNApol) transcribes late and very late genes. Four LEFs comprise the core viral RNApol sufficient for in vitro transcription: LEF-4, LEF-8, LEF-9, and P47. LEF-4 has triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and ATPase activities. LEF-8 and LEF-9 contain catalytic motifs that are conserved in the active sites of other multisubunit RNApols. These motifs are required for in vitro baculovirus RNApol transcription. P47 has no demonstrated enzymatic activity. How these four subunits associate in vivo within the viral RNApol complex and initiate transcription is undetermined, as is whether its transcription mechanism requires the host TATA binding protein (TBP). Viral DNA replication coincides with the transition between early and late transcription and it is closely associated with the regulation of late gene expression. Two LEFs essential for viral DNA synthesis, LEF-3 and P143, have also been implicated in the regulation of baculovirus RNApol transcription. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays were adapted to characterize the in vivo interactions of the viral RNApol subunits LEF-4, LEF-8, LEF-9, and P47, in the context of viral infection, as well as to investigate their potential interactions with viral DNA replication proteins LEF-3 and P143, and host Spodoptera frugiperda TBP. The proteins of interest were modified by N-terminal fusions of the Venus1 (aa1-158) or Venus2 (aa159-239) fragments of the Venus fluorescent protein. Recombinant plasmids and baculoviruses were constructed. Nuclear fluorescence was detected from all BiFC assays investigating the self-association and inter-subunit interactions of the viral RNApol. BiFC assays also suggested that the viral RNApol proteins interact with LEF-3, P143, and TBP. The potential effects of endogenous viral proteins and viral DNA on the detected protein-protein interactions are discussed. The results highlight extensive interactions between the core baculovirus RNApol subunits, possible roles of viral DNA replication proteins in the nuclear localization and transcription mechanism of the viral RNApol, as well as the involvement of host TBP in in vivo late stage transcription.</description>

   <description>Smart vehicles are considered key enablers for intelligent transport systems. They are equipped with components to enable services for vehicle occupants, other vehicles on roads, and third parties. In-vehicle sensors, diversified communication modules, and an on-board unit with high computing and storage capabilities enable the smart vehicle to work as a mobile resource of diverse scopes of services.&#xd;
With the high benefits the public sensing paradigm brought to the application domain, there is interest nowadays to widen the scope of applications by engaging more resources in the sensing loop. Although smartphones have been the main players in this domain, their use suffers from limitations due to the scarcity of their on-board resources and their unpredictable mobility patterns. Concurrently, the plethora of on-board resources in smart vehicles along with their ubiquitous mobility are pushing towards utilizing them for providing remarkable public sensing services.&#xd;
In this thesis, we unveil the different resources a smart vehicle can provide on roads or at parking lots highlighting diversified information services that can come into action through utilizing such resources. Motivated by the high rise of the public sensing paradigm, we propose a vehicular public sensing platform that aims at exploiting the sensing, storage, processing and relaying resources of smart vehicles for provisioning ubiquitous, sensing-based information services. As parts of the proposed platform, we present a collection of solutions to handle some challenges facing such use of vehicles for public sensing. Our proposed solutions involve a framework to handle reputation-aware recruitment and selection of smart vehicles for achieving desired coverage of an area of interest within a budget limit. In addition, the presented solutions involve a data delivery scheme that considers on-road caching and forwarding assistance in accessing the sensing-based vehicular resources targeting improving the incurred access cost and delay. Extensive performance evaluation is conducted showing the improvements achieved by the proposed solutions in their targeted objectives compared to other popular systems and schemes.</description>

   <title>Rockmass Behavioural Uncertainty: Implications for Hard Rock Geotechnical Baseline Reports</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-11-30 23:45:46.953</description>
   <description>Geotechnical Baseline Reports (GBRs) have become a prevalent risk sharing mechanism on North American tunneling projects as they are based on the following risk allocation concept: the subsurface ground conditions described within the GBR are the financial responsibility of the Contractor, whereas encountered conditions which exceed those described belong to the Owner.  This interpretation is intended to reduce project bid prices due to subsurface ground conditions uncertainty and the geotechnical rationale for a differing site conditions claim.  However, recent tunnel project case studies have used the GBR as a risk transfer mechanism by presenting a conservative and/or limited interpretation of the expected ground conditions.  In particular, the expected ground conditions are described with a summary of the intact and rockmass properties and empirical rockmass classification systems.  &#xd;
This research has shown that the application of intact rock properties and rockmass classification systems to describe the various rockmasses along the tunnel alignment leads to rockmass behavioural uncertainty.  Empirical rockmass classification systems are not able to adequately capture the effects of geologic uncertainty and the collective impact of the individual controls on rockmass behaviour. &#xd;
A new rock engineering design tool was developed which utilized geologic uncertainty and the capabilities of numerical modelling methods to predict and quantify rockmass behaviours.  The 3D Rockmass Behaviour Map reduces subsurface ground conditions uncertainty as the range of possible rockmass behaviours is presented as a function of the three critical geomechanics parameters.  Quantifying rockmass behaviours per tunnel domain demonstrates the effects of geologic uncertainty with rockmass behaviour mode switching.&#xd;
GBRs should include this 3D Rockmass Behaviour Map and quantified rockmass behaviours as these tools reduce uncertainty in the expected ground conditions and provide a greater understanding of the anticipated rockmass behaviours.  Rather than using a conservative GBR which shifts subsurface ground conditions risk to a Contractor, this improved prediction of the expected ground conditions may result in better subsurface risk allocation, reduced construction contingencies, aid excavation means and methods selection, reduced geotechnical basis for a differing site condition claim, and provide greater certainty in the final project price and schedule.</description>

   <description>ABSTRACT&#xd;
Background: Stage I Seminoma is treated with surgery followed with either adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) or a period of surveillance. Surveillance has emerged as a preferred management method, however there have been no randomized controlled trials comparing RT and surveillance.&#xd;
Aim: To describe the incidence, management, and outcome in early stage seminoma patients in Ontario over time. To examine the relationship between patient characteristics and post-operative management methods (adjuvant RT versus surveillance). To examine the relationship between post-operative management methods (adjuvant RT versus surveillance) and patient outcome.&#xd;
Hypothesis: The adoption of surveillance as a management option post-orchidectomy has increased over time with no resulting decrease in overall survival in an Ontario population.&#xd;
Material and Methods: We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with surgically resected seminoma in the Canadian province of Ontario between 1982-2004 using data from the Ontario Cancer Registry. The population was enriched for stage I by excluding patients with evidence of metastasis. Patients were divided into time cohorts of 4 -5 years in length. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify patient and system factors associated with the use of RT. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess overall, cancer specific, and relapse free survival. Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of patient and system factors on patient survival.&#xd;
Results: Age-adjusted seminoma increased from 2.25 per 100,000 males in 1980-1981 to 2.94 per 100,000 males in 2004-2005. Adjuvant RT use in early stage seminoma patients has declined from 88.9% in 1983 to 32.2% in 2004. There has been no significant&#xd;
ii&#xd;
worsening of overall, cancer specific or relapse free survival between patients diagnosed in 1982-1986 and those in later years. Controlling for other factors in a Cox proportional hazards model, no significant change in overall survival was found over time.&#xd;
Conclusion: The incidence of seminoma has increased over time. Over the course of the study period, use of adjuvant RT has decreased. While controlling for other factors, there has been no significant decrease in overall survival. The decreasing use of adjuvant RT has not adversely affected these patient outcomes.</description>

   <description>Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H) is the smallest fluorinated sulfonic acid and serves as a model imitating the Nafion® ionomer of catalyst layers of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).  The difference in the electrochemical behavior of Pt in CF3SO3H, as compared to H2SO4 or HClO4, originates from the different anion nature.  Because PEMFCs operate in the potential range in which electrochemical reactions involving O and H occur, the thesis focuses on: (i) Pt electro-oxidation; (ii) H electro-adsorption; and (iii) electrochemical and chemical Pt dissolution.  &#xd;
Platinum electro-oxidation in 0.1 M CF3SO3H is studied at various polarization potentials (Ep), polarization times (tp) and temperatures (T).  The reaction mechanism is revised and expanded by taking into account possible interactions of cations, anions and water molecules with Pt.  A modified kinetic equation for the interfacial place exchange is proposed.  The application of the interfacial place exchange and the metal cation escape mechanisms results in the determination of the Pt–O surface dipole moment, as well as the potential drop (Vox) and electric field (Eox) within the oxide.  The platinum-anion interactions indirectly affect the surface electro-oxidation kinetics.  &#xd;
The under-potential deposition of H (UPD H) on Pt in CF3SO3H is investigated over a broad T range using cyclic voltammetry.  The general electrochemical adsorption isotherm is used to determine standard Gibbs energy, entropy, and enthalpy of electro-adsorption, and energy of the Pt‒HUPD surface bond.  The lateral interactions between HUPD adatoms are repulsive.  &#xd;
Platinum electro-dissolution in 0.1 and 0.5 M CF3SO3H, H2SO4, and HClO4 solutions is studied using potential cycling and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  The results demonstrate that the anion nature has no or negligible impact on Pt electro-dissolution; however, pH significantly affects the process and the higher the pH value the greater the electro-dissolution of Pt.  An analysis of potential versus pH diagrams (Pourbaix diagrams) for acid solutions of different concentrations demonstrates that dissolved Pt (present as Pt2+ and Pt4+) can form through anodic dissolution of metallic Pt, as well as through anodic electrochemical and chemical dissolution of PtO.</description>

   <description>Arc gate skips can carry larger payloads compared to other designs due to the superior safety of the arc gate design, however these skips experience large amplitude vertical oscillations during unloading.  Data were collected from a salt mine with arc gate skips in operation to observe and gather information on the system.  Full scale computational simulations were developed to theoretically characterise and analyse the full scale system.  A small scale experimental apparatus was designed and fabricated to perform experiments, and complementary small scale computational simulations were also developed.&#xd;
The analysis of every unloading cycle in the mine site data revealed the peak amplitude of the oscillations and damping constant varied considerably between unloading cycles, while the primary oscillation frequency remained relatively constant between cycles.  Each unloading cycle was categorised according to the six characteristic shapes observed in the oscillations.  Two cycles from each category were selected for further analysis.&#xd;
The small scale experiments investigated the level of influence of the angle of the exit chute walls and floor, the number of internal stiffener bands, grain size distributions, and moisture content of the ore.  The experiments showed that an increase in ambient humidity and possible increase in moisture content of the ore caused the greatest increase in the oscillation amplitude, followed by the angle of the exit chute walls and floor with the optimum angle being 5° to 10° steeper than the current angles.  The stiffener band experiments revealed that removing all the stiffener bands gave the largest reduction in the oscillation amplitude.  Finer grain ore was found to reduce the oscillation amplitude, although it had the least significant effect in comparison to the other variables.&#xd;
The full and small scale simulations confirmed that, when compared to the raw data from the mine and the control experiments, the system was best modelled as a single degree of freedom mass-spring-damper system with a linearly decreasing mass.&#xd;
The high speed camera experiments revealed the stiffener bands created a plug effect with the ore close to the walls, causing ore-on-ore friction, whereas without stiffener bands the ore flowed together, resulting in ore-on-aluminium friction.</description>

   <description>When one body slips on another, heat is generated at the slipping interface. We call this phenomenon slip heating and apply slip heating theory to cohesive and adhesive slip in extrusion dies. Adhesive slip, which is linked to melt fracture, is a breakdown of the no slip boundary condition at the die wall, where the fluid moves with respect to the wall. Die drool, the accumulation of plastic on the open die face, has been attributed to cohesive melt failure, which results in the formation of a bulk layer that slips on a drool layer. The corresponding isothermal analysis of cohesive slip led to an analytical solution for the drool rate [Schmalzer and Giacomin, J. Pol. Eng., 33, 1 (2013)]. We account for slip heating during adhesive and cohesive slip and develop analytical solutions for temperature rise with and without viscous dissipation. We focus on slit flow, used in film casting, sheet extrusion and curtain coating, and when curvature can be neglected, slit flow is easily extended to pipe extrusion and film blowing. In slit flow, the heat flux from the slipping interface is the product of the shear stress and the slip speed. We present the solutions for the temperature rise in pressure-driven and simple shearing flows, each subject to constant heat generation at the slipping interface. We find expressions for drool rate by modeling viscosity as an Arrhenius function of temperature, and we show how to correct wall slip data for the slip heating temperature rise. We conclude with worked examples showing the importance of slip heating in die drool and wall slip, and we find that slip heating suppresses drool. We also arrive at a necessary dimensionless condition for the accurate use of our results: Pé&lt;&lt;1.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2014-12-04 14:55:10.417</description>
   <description>Database management systems (DBMSs) are the essential tools to monitor and manage data and transactions in databases. Normally a database receives hundreds of requests, called workloads so dynamic workload management is an important component of an autonomic DBMS solution. Controlling concurrently running queries in DBMSs is one form of workload management which is called execution control and it aims to guarantee desired performance levels for queries with varying priorities.  One of the challenges in making such control-decisions is determining how much more processing time the query requires prior to completion. Query progress indicators attempt to estimate the progress of running queries.  This offers a means to identify the long-running queries at early stages, potentially before other important workloads are negatively impacted, and thereby, assists in making a better decision to select the appropriate execution control mechanism for handling long-running queries.&#xd;

Our work illustrates a strategy and defines policies for making decisions based on a simple progress indicator that we implement in PostgreSQL, to select the time and type of execution control action to apply to recover from a declining workload performance in a DBMS. Based on the progress of the long running OLAP queries, they are either throttled or killed at different progress points to maximize system efficiency. We define a utility measure to indicate throughput recovery of the important workloads with respect to the increase in the total workload execution time. Our experiments show that throttling combined with a progress indicator results in faster and better system recovery.</description>

   <description>The lack of long-term data on the response of boreal lakes to climate change has been seen as an impediment to the assessment of the vulnerability and risks that northwest Ontario faces in light of future climate change. The overall objective of this thesis was to provide a centennial-to-multi-millennial perspective on the impacts of past climate change on boreal lakes in northwest Ontario. Second chapter has resulted in the development and application of a paleoecological model, based on the modern-day distributions of chironomid assemblages to lake depth, in a small boreal lake. Changes in the chironomid assemblages provided significant and strong support for the diatom-based inference techniques that estimated lower water levels, and consequently drought-like conditions, throughout northwest Ontario during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Third chapter provides evidence that supports an early-to-mid-Holocene period of aridity, with reduced water levels across the boreal region in northwest Ontario. This conclusion was based on changes in diatom assemblages in well-dated sediment cores from three lakes spanning a distance of ~200 km across the boreal forest region. During the early-to-mid-Holocene, benthic diatom taxa predominate in all cores, suggesting lower lake levels by ~2-5 m, when compared to modern-day diatom assemblages from these lakes. Increases in planktonic diatom taxa to greater than 50% of the entire assemblage, occurs beginning ~4500 to 4000 cal yr BP, suggesting positive water balance over the last 4000 years in comparison to the mid-Holocene period. Fourth chapter provides evidence of enhanced primary production and higher abundances of cyanobacteria in three northwest Ontario lakes during the warmer early-to-mid-Holocene in northwest Ontario. This later study was based on changes in lake-water primary production from fossil pigments, spectrally-inferred chlorophyll a, and diatom assemblages in well dated cores, taken from the main central basin of the three study lakes. The majority of indicators show a coherent pattern of enhanced primary production during the early-to-mid-Holocene period, with elevated concentrations of cyanobacterial pigments in two of the three lakes. If conditions become warmer and drier in the future in northwest Ontario, challenges associated to water quantity and quality should be expected.</description>

   <description>Mental illness is prevalent in our population and has been studied for decades but is still poorly understood. Understanding the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying these disorders can lead to significant improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life for patients suffering from mental disorders.&#xd;
Goα47A is a candidate gene in a putative haloperidol-affected pathway that is highly expressed in the nervous system. The gene encodes nine transcripts and two isoforms, which are 98% identical and differ only in the N-terminal region. However, the individual roles for each of the two different proteins have not yet been discerned. Transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster were generated using cDNA constructs corresponding to each of the two open reading frames (ORFs) under the control of UAS promoters. Expression of these transgenes was driven by a GAL4 driver with a similar spatial expression pattern to that of Goα47A. These constructs were intended to be used in a genetic rescue in order to test the hypothesis that a mutant allele of Goα47A causes resistance to the antipsychotic haloperidol.&#xd;
In the course of generating strains needed for the rescue, it was found that the expression of either ORF causes a crumpled wing phenotype and lethality, both with variable penetrance. This variability is likely due to expression level, since GAL80 can reduce the frequency of these phenotypes. Additionally, there is an interaction between the ORFs and the TM3 balancer, which could indicate an interaction between Goα and a gene that is affected by the chromosomal rearrangements associated with the TM3 balancer. The majority of VD1 strains display crumpled wings and the expression of ORF1 can cause lethality. In contrast, two copies of the ORF2 transgene are required to cause crumpled wings. The difference in activities between the two ORFs is likely due to the few changes in the N-terminal region of the protein, which is presumably involved in the interaction with the β and γ subunits.  This finding suggests that small differences in a G-protein are sufficient to alter protein-protein interactions and subsequent signalling.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2014-12-09 14:55:25.369</description>
   <description>Pain is an extremely subjective and complex sensory and emotional experience. It is affected by a range of factors including attention, suggestion, attitude, expectation, and affective state. The influence of emotion on pain perception and neural processing is the central focus of this thesis. Previous research has demonstrated that individuals exposed to a painful stimulus will rate that stimulus as more painful when accompanied by or associated with a negative emotional influence. Conversely, pain ratings decrease when the painful stimulus is coupled with a positive emotional influence. Although many studies have confirmed that emotional manipulations affect pain perception at a group level, there has been little exploration of the range in the effect size across individuals or the psychological characteristics that may act to mediate emotional modulation of pain. Furthermore, although there is a growing body of research exploring the neural response in the brain, no other study, to date, has used functional MRI to examine the neural response across the brainstem and spinal cord involved in emotional modulation of pain. As such, this thesis used a combination of behavioural measures and functional MRI to explore differences in the effect of emotional modulation on pain perception across individuals, along with the neural response in the brainstem and spinal cord. We observed a substantial degree of inter-subject variability for the emotional modulation of pain perception, along with significant correlations for scores on anxiety and depression questionnaires with the distinct effects for Positive and Negative emotional modulation of pain. Functional MRI results revealed an effect for emotional modulation of the neural response involved in pain processing in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord, along with several regions in the brainstem known to be involved in descending pain modulation. Functional connectivity of these areas was observed to vary based on the valence and arousal of the emotional stimuli. Therefore, the findings of this thesis provide novel insight into the subcortical neural network involved in emotional modulation of pain processing and the factors that influence the effect of emotions on pain perception.</description>

   <description>The objectives of this thesis were to; 1) identify established risk factors and gaps in the current peer reviewed literature relating to factors associated with patient related diagnostic delay in head and neck cancer, 2) describe and document patients’ personal responses to symptoms of head and neck cancer, the characteristics of the patients’ lay-consultants and the responses that the patients received from their lay-consultants and 3) assess the association between patient/network-related diagnostic delay and a) whether the patient felt any urgency to investigate their symptoms, b) whether the patient told someone in their social network about their symptoms (lay-consultancy) and c) lay-consultant influence.    &#xd;
The first manuscript is a scoping review that demonstrates that there is a lack of studies that address; the personal symptom experiences of patients, the psycho-social processes of help-seeking and the independent effects of suspected risk factors for head and neck cancer.  The results of the first manuscript also provided me with guidance on what the important confounders of our primary relationship of interest were most likely to be.    &#xd;
The second manuscript suggests that patient related delay may be influenced by the patients’ mistaken belief that their symptoms were non-urgent with or without the influence of their lay-consultant.   &#xd;
The third manuscript provides evidence that the primary barrier to seeking help from an HCP is whether or not those individuals experiencing symptoms think they are urgent enough to warrant further investigation. The study found no evidence to support the assertion that increased risk of delay is associated with decreased lay-consultancy.&#xd;
The results of this thesis indicate that most of the patient related delay occurs during the individuals’ symptom appraisal process with or without input from their social network.  I think that individuals at risk of late stage presentation of head and neck cancer should be provided with targeted information encouraging them to seek help from a health care provider if the key signs or symptoms of head and neck cancer have not resolved within three weeks.</description>

   <description>Illegal tax practices such as tax evasion cost governments billions of dollars of lost revenues.  Such practices interfere with tax policy objectives that many nations have adopted to promote equity in the administration of their tax systems.  Countries like Canada and the United States which tax their residents (and citizens in the U.S.) on income they earn throughout the world rely on the ability to exchange information with tax havens and other countries in order to administer their tax systems, and combat tax evasion.    Tax evasion received new attention with the coming to light of a string of massive tax evasion scandals involving UBS Bank in Switzerland in 2008, and more recently through the leakage of millions of offshore records in 2013.  During the past five years, countries have signed hundreds of single purpose treaties to exchange information known as Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs).  Canada has signed 22 of these TIEAs.&#xd;
The primary objective of this thesis is to evaluate the capacity of TIEAs to be an effective tool against offshore tax evasion.  It does so firstly by reviewing the policy objectives of TIEAs in order to later determine their performance against these stated objectives.  Second, it reviews domestic and international alternative legal mechanisms to obtain foreign based taxpayer information in order to later evaluate the effectiveness of TIEAs to combat offshore tax evasion as compared with these measures, particularly those used by the United States.  The research identifies deficiencies in the TIEA and exchange of information regimes and prescribes more effective arrangements to deal with these problems.  The central argument of this thesis is that in their current form TIEAs offer fiscal authorities like the CRA a very limited capability to uncover existing tax evasion by residents of Canada.  It reviews the TIEA network in Canada, the development and implementation of TIEAs by the OECD and Global Forum from 1998 through 2013, and recent experiences in the field of exchange of information by the United States with Switzerland.</description>

   <description>Spencer Gulf is a large, shallow, metahaline embayment along the southern Australian continental margin (~22,000 km2, > 60 m water depth).  The gulf experiences inverse estuarine circulation and seasonally fluctuating water temperatures, salinities, and nutrient levels.  The gulf floor is covered with temperate carbonate sediments (sands, gravels, and muds) that are skeletal remains of heterozoans; bivalves, coralline algae (rhodoliths), bryozoans, benthic foraminifera, and echinoids are common constituents throughout.  These carbonates are interpreted to be accumulating in five depositional environments: dense seagrass meadows, sand flats with sparse seagrass growth, rhodolith pavements, open gravel/sand barrens, and muddy seafloors.  Detailed seasonal oceanographic data and hydrodynamic model outputs were used to delimit oceanographic influences on sedimentation patterns.  The depth of the euphotic zone is interpreted as the most important control on benthic environment distributions within the gulf.  Salinities, hydrodynamics, and nutrient concentrations also affect biological assemblages and facies patterns.  Seagrasses and rhodoliths require sufficient light for growth and, thus, compete for space on euphotic seafloors.  Seagrasses colonize the shallowest, best-illuminated areas.  Rhodolith pavements occur in regions of the gulf where seagrasses are excluded: seafloors where surface-water nutrients promote growth of phytoplankton that decrease light penetration, and energetic channels with high bottom-water currents.  Calm, subphotic seafloors are characterized by soft sediment environments (open gravels, sands, and muds).  Benthic calcareous organisms are surprisingly diverse throughout the gulf, despite elevated seawater salinities (up to 47‰).  Abundant carbonate muds set Spencer Gulf apart from other shallow temperate provinces.  The origin of this mud is primarily from the breakdown of skeletal particles via maceration.  Mineralogical composition is, therefore, a mixture of aragonite, intermediate-Mg calcite, and low-Mg calcite.  Rhodolith pavement deposits were investigated in detail to determine how oceanographic conditions influence sedimentation in these environments.  Rhodolith pavements provide habitats for diverse calcareous invertebrates, which can be used as environmental indicators.  The rhodoliths themselves within Spencer Gulf, however, do not show morphological differences that can be used as indicators of water energy levels, as some authors have suggested.  This study demonstrates that integration of detailed oceanographic data and facies analysis aids interpretations of benthic environments and sediment distribution patterns.</description>

   <description>To process one m3 of oil sands, four m3 of oil sands process wastewater (OSPW) is produced. OSPW is a mixture of compounds including hundreds of different naphthenic acids (NAs) which are considered to the major toxicity contributor of OSPW. Effect-directed analysis was used to establish the link between toxicity/estrogenicity and components in OSPW. OSPW and biologically treated OSPW were separated by solid phase extraction and reverse phase HPLC into “toxic and nontoxic” or “estrogenic and nonestrogenic” fractions as detected by the Microtox® and a yeast estrogenic screening assay respectively. The composition of fractions was determined by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical methods were used to analyze the relationship between composition and toxicity/estrogenicity. C15-C18 O2-NAs (CnH2n+zO2) with a double bond equivalent (DBE) of 4, as well as C14-C17 with DBE=3 were found to be the most likely contributors to toxicity, while O2 (CnH2n+zO2), O3 (CnH2n+zO3) and O4 (CnH2n+zO4) C17 to C20 compounds with a DBE 6-10 likely cause estrogenicity. From these studies, the exact formulae and masses of possible estrogenic/toxic compounds in OSPW were identified. These findings will help to focus study on the most environmentally significant components in OSPW.&#xd;
In an earlier published study, OSPW was treated with an immobilized soil bioreactor (ISBR) at a 7 day residence time, which achieved NA reduction by 30-40%. The present study compared untreated and ISBR-treated OSPW, which showed that while DBE=3, 4 were the most recalcitrant NAs and DBE=5 were biodegradable NAs. The presence of aromatic and diamondoid NA structures was confirmed by tandem MS. These results may help to better understand NA biodegradation, the recalcitrant components and improve ISBR performance. Bacteria belonging to the Ochrobactrum, Brevundimonas and Bacillus genera were isolated from the ISBR and tested for their biodegradation of aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic NA surrogates in 96-well plates by tetrazolium redox dyes as the metabolic activity indicator. Ochrobactrum grew best on the most surrogates and both Ochrobactrum and Bacillus were found to degrade recalcitrant tricyclic NAs. This approach can be used to understand the role of individual&#xd;
microorganisms in the mixed microbial population that are involved in the NAs biodegradation in the ISBR.</description>

   <description>“The happy life is the pleasant life” is a statement that both many ancient and contemporary philosophers would agree to. However how they understand it to be true can differ greatly. In this thesis, I am interested in investigating the role of pleasure in the good life from both an ancient and contemporary perspective. I will first examine how Aristotle characterizes pleasure as a necessarily morally appropriate and objective feature of a good life. I will then contrast Aristotle’s understanding with contemporary philosopher Fred Feldman’s subjective hedonistic eudaimonic thesis. Where Aristotle’s description integrates various goods such as pleasure and virtue to come to a complete description of the good life, Feldman’s thesis focuses on only the one good of subjective pleasure as what accounts for human well-being. In this way, Feldman avoids problems of elitism and perfectionism found in Aristotle’s writings, but fails to account for how various goods should integrate and relate within a good life and thereby fails to satisfy a demand for a complete description of living well. Whether or not we should make this demand upon a eudaimonic thesis may be where ancient and contemporary thinkers differ most greatly and is where I will leave this thesis.</description>

   <description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both the general and at-risk populations [e.g., end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients]. Arterial stiffness is a major contributor to the occurrence and progression of CVD. The ability to measure arterial stiffness accurately and easily could be important in the detection and prevention of CVD. Applanation tonometry (AT) is considered the reference method for determining pulse wave velocity (PWV), an index of arterial stiffness; however, AT has been reported to have several limitations and practical problems. Photopleysmography (PPG) may be a potential alternative to AT in the determination of PWV, but its validity and reliability need to be more definitively established. Second, there is conflicting evidence as to whether peripheral measurements of arterial stiffness can be used as a surrogate for central measures. Accordingly, the primary objectives of this dissertation were: a) to aid in establishing the validity and/or reliability of PWV assessed using the new PPG method compared to the reference (AT) method (Study 2 and Study 3), and b) to provide further insight regarding whether peripheral PWV by PPG is in fact a valid surrogate measure of central PWV by PPG (Study 2). &#xd;
There are also many factors that can affect the interpretation of arterial stiffness measurements that are poorly understood in terms of their mechanisms and magnitude of impact. As such, this dissertation also addresses: c) the influence of hemodialysis (HD) on arterial stiffness (Study 1) and d) the influence of maximal aerobic exercise on arterial stiffness (Study 3). &#xd;
The findings of the studies in this dissertation established the validity and/or reliability of the PPG method (Study 2 and Study 3), refuted the use of peripheral PWV measurements as surrogates for central ones (Study 2), clarified the influence of HD on arterial stiffness (Study 1), and confirmed the acute impact of aerobic exercise on arterial stiffness (Study 3). Ultimately, these findings may help healthcare practitioners to interpret arterial stiffness measurements more accurately and facilitate  the assessment of arterial stiffness in becoming a standard part of CVD screening in healthy and at-risk populations alike.</description>

   <description>Speed of information processing deficits are hallmark symptoms of, and a primary consideration, in the differential diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Chronic pain is a common comorbid symptom following trauma-induced brain injury and can impact information processing speed thereby creating a potential confound in a differential diagnosis. Examining Chronic Pain, MTBI, Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (STBI), and a Healthy Control group, the Computerized Tests of Information Processing (CTIP) were used to assess processing speed. CTIP results were contrasted with traditional paper and pencil neuropsychological (NP) tests (Digit Span, Digit Symbol, Trails A &amp; B) across groups. The Chronic Pain group performed significantly worse than the MTBI and Control groups on the CTIP with no significant differences between the Chronic Pain and Control group on any traditional NP test. Notably, there were no significant differences in scores on the CTIP or traditional NP tests between the Chronic Pain and the STBI groups. Discriminant analyses indicated the Semantic test was the strongest predictor of group membership among CTIP tasks, correctly predicting 41% of the present sample and estimating 34% correct prediction in a new sample. Digit Span was the strongest predictor when the CTIP and traditional NP tests were examined together with the model correctly predicting 47.5% in the present sample and estimating 35% correct prediction in a new sample. In regression analyses, depressive symptoms predicted Semantic CTIP scores; fatigue, and a measure of the current affective quality of pain, predicted Digit Span scores; and cumulative effects of multiple symptoms predicted most CTIP and traditional NP scores. These results provide additional evidence that individuals with Chronic Pain experience notable impairments in information processing speed with the potential to confound NP test results for potentially brain injured patients. Implications, limitations and future recommendations are discussed.</description>

   <description>Sustainable road construction and maintenance could be supported when excellent warm-mix additives are employed in the modification of asphalt. These warm-mix additives provide remedies for today’s requirements such as fatigue cracking resistance, durability, thermal cracking resistance, rutting resistance and resistance to moisture damage. Warm-mix additives are based on waxes and surfactants which reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions significantly during the construction phase of the pavement. In this study, the effects of two warm mix additives, siloxane and oxidised polyethylene wax, on roofing asphalt flux (RAF) and asphalt modified with waste engine oil (655-7) were investigated to evaluate the rheological, aging and failure properties of the asphalt binders. In terms of the properties of these two different asphalts, RAF has proved to be superior quality asphalt whereas 655-7 is poor quality asphalt. The properties of the modified asphalt samples were measured by Superpave™ tests such as Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) test as well as modified protocols such as the extended BBR (eBBR) test (LS-308) and the Double-Edge-Notched Tension  (DENT) test (LS-299) after laboratory aging. In addition, the Avrami theory was used to gain an insight on the crystallization of asphalt or the waxes within the asphalt binder. This study has however shown that the eBBR and DENT tests are better tools for providing accurate specification tests to curb thermal and fatigue cracking in contemporary asphalt pavements.</description>

   <description>Utilisation of scrap tire has been achieved through the production of crumb rubber modified binders and rubberised asphalt concrete. Terminal and field blended asphalt rubbers have been developed through the wet process to incorporate crumb rubber into the asphalt binder. Warm mix asphalt technologies have been developed to curb the problem associated with the processing and production of such crumb rubber modified binders.  Also the lowered production and compaction temperatures associated with warm mix additives suggests the possibility of moisture retention in the mix, which can lead to moisture damage. Conventional moisture sensitivity tests have not effectively discriminated good and poor mixes, due to the difficulty of simulating field moisture damage mechanisms. This study was carried out to investigate performance properties of crumb rubber modified asphalt concrete, using commercial warm mix asphalt technology. Commonly utilised asphalt mixtures in North America such as dense graded and stone mastic asphalt were used in this study. Uniaxial Cyclic Compression Testing (UCCT) was used to measure permanent deformation at high temperatures. Indirect Tensile Testing (IDT) was used to investigate low temperature performance. Moisture Induced Sensitivity Testing (MiST) was proposed to be an effective method for detecting the susceptibility of asphalt mixtures to moisture damage, as it incorporates major field stripping mechanisms.&#xd;
Sonnewarm™, Sasobit™ and Evotherm™ additives improved the resistance to permanent deformation of dense graded mixes at a loading rate of 0.5 percent by weight of the binder. Polymer modified mixtures showed superior resistance to permanent deformation compared to asphalt rubber in all mix types. Rediset™ WMX improves low temperature properties of dense graded mixes at 0.5 percent loading on the asphalt cement. Rediset LQ  and Rediset WMX showed good anti stripping properties at 0.5 percent loading on the asphalt cement. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Official’s Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (AASHTO MEPDG) software was used to predict long term low temperature performance of the mixtures in various areas of Ontario. Sasobit, Rediset LQ and Rediset WMX gave good 15 years prediction with stone mastic asphalt mixtures but the performance of dense graded mixtures was less satisfactory.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-12-16 15:49:01.601</description>
   <description>In recent decades, the field of rock engineering has seen an increased use of numerical modelling tools to aid in the analysis and design of underground excavations. Although complex numerical methods have been developed to explicitly capture the discontinuum mechanical processes which dominate rock and rockmass deformation, continuum methods represent a viable alternative due to their relative advantages in model runtimes and parametric simplicity. This thesis aims to advance the state-of-art and state-practice techniques for continuum models and to demonstrate their ability to replicate behaviours observed in-situ.&#xd;
	With recent advances in the understanding of rockmass strength, it is the post-yield phenomenon of rock dilatancy which has remained the domain of greatest uncertainty in constitutive models. Particularly in the case of brittle rockmasses, where deformation is dominated by crack extension and dilation, the post-yield evolution of dilatancy in parallel with strength parameters can have a very significant impact on progressive failure processes. By improving our understanding of this evolution, continuum models for brittle rock can be improved.&#xd;
	In the case of weaker rockmasses which can be adequately represented using a conventional strain-softening approach, an existing model for dilatancy can be applied. As is shown in this thesis, the use of a constant dilation angle to approximate the dilatant behaviour of the rockmass in this case is appropriate; accordingly, parameter selection guidelines are presented. In the case of brittle rockmasses, a mobilized dilation angle model which incorporates the strain and confinement dependencies of dilatancy is required.&#xd;
	Through an analysis of laboratory testing data, a new model for the dilation angle is developed. Then, using five case studies (both from the literature and novel to this thesis), the applicability of the model to in-situ rockmass behaviour is demonstrated. Finally, the implications of these model results for understanding support-rockmass interaction and strainbursting phenomena are discussed.</description>

   <description>Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted a great deal of attention in academic, civilian and military communities as prospective solutions to a wide variety of applications.  The use of cooperative UAVs  has received growing interest in the last decade and this provides an opportunity for new operational paradigms. &#xd;
As applications of UAVs continue to grow in complexity, the trend of using multiple cooperative UAVs to perform these applications rises in order to increase the overall effectiveness and robustness.&#xd;
There is a need for generating suitable control techniques that allow for the real-time implementation of control algorithms for different missions and tactics executed by a group of cooperative UAVs. In this thesis,  we investigate possible control patterns and associated algorithms for controlling a group of autonomous UAVs in real-time to perform various tactics.&#xd;
This research proposes new control approaches to solve the dynamic encirclement, tactic switching and formation problems for a group of cooperative UAVs in simulation and real-time.  Firstly, a combination of  Feedback Linearization (FL) and  decentralized Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) is used to solve the dynamic encirclement problem. Secondly, a combination of decentralized LMPC and fuzzy logic control is used to solve the problem of tactic switching for a group of cooperative UAVs. Finally, a decentralized  Learning Based Model Predictive Control (LBMPC) is used to solve the problem of formation for a group of cooperative UAVs in simulation.&#xd;
We show through simulations and validate through experiments that the proposed control policies succeed to control a group of cooperative UAVs to achieve the desired requirements and control objectives for different tactics. These proposed control policies  provide reliable and effective control techniques for multiple cooperative UAV systems.</description>

   <description>According to a 2008 Statistics Canada report, 76% of children under the age of 17 participate in organized sports. Considering this fact, sport is increasingly recognized as a context in which to study Positive Youth Development. Notably, coaches play an extremely influential role in shaping athletes’ experiences and development through sport. However, behavioural research in coaching has focused heavily on the content or instructional nature of coach behaviours – neglecting the contextual qualities that may contribute to effective coaching practices. Despite an extensive focus on the emotional experiences of athletes, the role of emotions in coaching has yet to be examined. Thus, this program of research sought to explore the emotions associated with coach behaviours, particularly concerning the developmental experiences of young athletes.&#xd;
	To achieve this objective, two studies were conducted. The first study served to develop a valid and reliable systematic observation instrument specifically designed to assess the emotions of coaches in the team sport environment. This instrument represents a unique and novel approach to the study of emotions in the sport context, and the first of its kind to focus exclusively on coaches. The second study applied this instrument to examine the relationship between coaches’ emotional profiles and athletes’ developmental outcomes in the adolescent female competitive soccer context. Results revealed that emotional qualities associated with coach behaviours have a significant influence on the Character development of young soccer players. Together, these studies offer new and valuable insight into the emotional context of coach behaviours, informing effective coaching practices with practical implications for positive athlete development.</description>

   <title>Intractable Difficulties for the Doctrine of Double Effect: The Problem of Closeness and the Proper Focus of Concern</title>

   <description>A more recent development within moral philosophy has been authors of a nonconsequentialist stripe forwarding arguments against principles once thought foundational to nonconsequentialist ethics as features that distinguished such an ethics from a consequentialist one. The Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE) is one such principle. It holds that it is impermissible to act with the intention to harm either as a means (even to some good end) or as an end, but it is sometimes permissible to perform the same act when the harm is not intended but merely foreseen as a side-effect. The primary aim of this project is to examine two difficulties facing the DDE, and to see whether these difficulties give us reason to reject the DDE. I argue the first problem, the Problem of Closeness, is intractable if the DDE maintains the intend/foresee distinction. The second problem is a concern that by focusing inward on the agent’s intentions the DDE misses the proper focus of concern in permissibility. Of two possible readings of the concern: i) that a judgment of inferiority is insufficiently strong to support to support the DDE, and ii) that the DDE is inconsistent with certain facts about deliberation, I find that while the defenders of the DDE may provide the resources necessary to respond to the second proper focus concern, they do not offer a satisfactory response to the first.</description>

   <description>In this dissertation, I apply optimization methods and game theory to address three problems in technology and revenue management. In the first essay, I analyze how brand commitment and product failure impact a firm's upgrade strategy in the presence of a stochastically evolving technological frontier. The essay explores the optimal timing of upgrades across a variety of market parameters and establishes the market conditions in which firms should invest in brand commitment to lengthen the product upgrade cycle. The model also demonstrates that firms with high brand commitment must balance the benefits of pent-up demand with potential loss due to product failure. The second and third essay focus on the allocation of resources and products in the presence of demand uncertainty and consumer behavior, respectively. In the second essay, I develop a methodology to approximate the value of capacity in the network airline revenue management problem. The value of capacity is used to control the sale of products to consumers requesting products over a finite time horizon. The advantage of this methodology is the scalability, which we demonstrate by solving for capacity values on an industrial sized network. In the third essay, I study a consumer-to-consumer exchange market. I prove that there exists market conditions where the equilibrium prices allow a unique opitmal allocation of products amongst  participants.</description>

   <description>Coupled hydrodynamic and wave models were used to simulate water levels, currents, waves and salinity transport in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES), a large shallow back-barrier basin in eastern North Carolina, over a one-month long period. Simulations were run for four different bathymetric grids pertaining to distinct time slices during the evolution of the APES corresponding to the present day, and 500, 1000, and 4000 calibrated years before present to determine responses to long-term changes in geomorphology. &#xd;
The present day simulation was used to evaluate a spatially varying wind field developed from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset in comparison to spatially uniform winds from observations at different sites across the region. Simulations using winds observed offshore result in statistically better hydrodynamic simulations of water levels (R=0.88) in the estuaries than the NARR dataset (R=0.48). The removal of a long shoal from present day bathymetry resulted in a decrease in water level setup by 3% at the estuarine shoreline, a decrease in current magnitude up to 40% and an increase in significant wave height up to 25%, indicating the importance of this shallow feature as a major control on the present day hydrodynamic response of Pamlico Sound.&#xd;
Paleobathymetric grids for three time slices over the late Holocene were developed from sediment core and seismic observations described by Zaremba (2014). Model results were compared to assess the impacts of: 1) varying degrees of barrier island segmentation; 2) long-term changes in basin geomorphology; and 3) sea-level rise on the hydrodynamic response in Pamlico Sound. All three of these influenced the hydrodynamics (e.g., up to 3 times higher tidal range and current velocity) when compared to present day observations and model results.  Salinity in the present day simulation was validated using observations, and salinity distributions predicted for each time slice were compared to salinity ranges from foraminiferal assemblages at sediment cores. The results indicate that salinity in Pamlico Sound is strongly influenced by wind and wave-driven mixing and transport, the hydraulic connectivity between Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, and the quantity and size of tidal inlets through the barrier island system.</description>

   <description>A major challenge in designing an integrated optical transceiver is minimizing the crosstalk between the high power laser driver and the sensitive receiver. Offset sideband modulation (OSBM) is used for the downstream signal to mitigate the crosstalk between the transmitter and the receiver. When detected with a photodiode, the OSBM signal produces a bandpass signal that can be reliably detected in the presence of baseband crosstalk. OSBM also enables the use of more complex modulation formats that include phase modulation such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK).&#xd;
&#xd;
An architecture for an integrated offset sideband receiver is developed using a system level analysis. The offset sideband modulated signal is generated using an arbitrary optical waveform generator (AOWG). The signal parameters, including the pulse shaping function and offset frequency have been optimized to ease the requirements of the integrated reciever. The receiver consists of a bandpass transimpedance amplifier (TIA) followed by a four phase Costas loop to provide carrier synchronization and demodulate an OSBM signal with either BPSK or QPSK modulation.&#xd;
&#xd;
A number of components of the integrated OSBM receiver have been designed and fabricated in a 0.13 um CMOS process. A  novel bandpass TIA is created using a stagger tuned topology to produce a second order bandpass response. The TIA achieves a transimpedance gain of 56 dBOhms and a bandwidth of 5 GHz centred at 7.5 GHz. The average input referred noise current of the bandpass TIA is 26.5 pA/sqrt(Hz).&#xd;
&#xd;
A four phase Costas loop has been designed to demodulate a 2.5 GSym/s BPSK signal or a 2.5 Gbit/s QPSK signal with a carrier frequency of 7.5 GHz. The Costas loop has a loop bandwidth of approximately 100 MHz. Measured results are presented showing that the Costas loop is capable of demodulating a BPSK signal at 2.5 Gbit/s with a 2^31-1 pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS). Measured results show the Costas loop is also able to demodulate a 2.5 GSym/s QPSK signal with a 2^7-1 PRBS pattern.</description>

   <title>Diatoms as Indicators of Environmental and Climatic Change in Peatlands and Lakes Located Across the Boreal Shield and Hudson Bay Lowlands of Canada</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2014-12-19 11:00:44.507</description>
   <description>Long-term monitoring data and paleoecological records are lacking in the Far North of Ontario (~50-&#xd;
57oN, 79-94oW), a region of ecological and economic significance to Canada. As a landscape covered by&#xd;
extensive peatland complexes, accumulating vegetation (and carbon) since de-glaciation, and tens of thousands&#xd;
of lakes, there is an opportunity to interpret past environmental changes from paleoecological records, and&#xd;
place current climatic and other environmental changes within a longer-term perspective. This thesis addresses&#xd;
this knowledge gap by using archives from peatlands and lakes in the Far North of Ontario to understand&#xd;
environmental changes over the past ~100 to 2000 years.&#xd;
Given that peatlands act as an interface between terrestrial and aquatic environments, finding reliable&#xd;
biotic proxies with well-defined ecological optima is challenging. I use diatoms primarily to track changes in&#xd;
macro-vegetation type, pH and water table position across northern peatlands. Diatom assemblage composition&#xd;
was influenced by both the broader peatland type (i.e., bog, rich and poor fens) and microhabitats within&#xd;
peatland formations (e.g., hummock, hollows). The responsiveness of diatoms to chemical and moisture&#xd;
gradients was used to infer past environmental information archived in peat deposits. Changes in diatom&#xd;
composition from three peat cores reflect hydrosere succession, including past fluctuations in connectivity to&#xd;
the water table and pH. Approximately 600 years ago, synchronous changes in diatoms and testate amoebae&#xd;
infer drying conditions and subsequent microhabitat variations.&#xd;
To understand the response of aquatic biota to climate change over the past ~150 years, and provide&#xd;
detailed baseline ecological information prior to impacts from future mineral extraction and infrastructure&#xd;
development, sedimentary chlorophyll-a, diatom and cladoceran assemblage composition were examined in&#xd;
four lakes across the “Ring of Fire”. Over the past ~150 years, the most notable change was a shift from&#xd;
littoral/benthic dominated assemblages to greater abundances of pelagic Cladocera and planktonic diatom taxa.&#xd;
An increase in planktonic taxa is consistent with warming-induced changes in lake properties including longer&#xd;
ice-free periods and changes in aquatic habitat availability. Collectively, these results help distinguish the&#xd;
ecological response to anthropogenic warming from both natural variation and future resource extraction.</description>

   <description>In chapter 2, the synthesis and NMR characterization of [Cp2TiCH3(H2O)]+ (I) is presented. In the presence of excess water, there is evidence of rapid H-exchange and H-bonding between coordinated and free water. At higher temperatures, I undergoes hydrolysis to produce methane.&#xd;
In chapter 3, formation of [Cp2TiCH2CHMeCMe3]+ (II) via a controlled single 1,2-migratory insertion reaction of [Cp2TiMe]+ and 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (3,3-DMB) at 205 K is presented. II exchanges between its two α-agostic isomers, with a preference for one agostic isomer over the other and also remains α-agostic under coordination of Et2O.&#xd;
In chapter 4, [Cp2TiCH2CHMeSiMe3]+ (III), a complex that is exchanging between γ- (ground state) and β- agostic isomers, is prepared by reaction of [Cp2TiMe]+ with 1 equivalent of trimethylvinylsilane at 205 K. There is exchange between β-H and γ-H from 215 K to 260 K but 1H NMR data suggests no or very little increase in rate. [Cp2TiCH2CHCD3SiMe3]+ undergoes a reversible and exclusive isotopomeric rearrangement to form specifically [Cp2TiCD2CDCH3SiMe3]+ through a series of reversible β-H elimination, 2,1- and 1,2- migratory-insertion reactions (process 1). Deuteration of III at β- or γ- positions essentially shuts down the β-H/γ-H exchange, with a kH/kD of at least 13000 at 225 K. These results indicate that this latter exchange process is driven by H quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT).&#xd;
Finally, chapter 5 presents is a re-investigation of II that unravels some exchange processes that were not detected in previous studies of II. EXSY and D-labeling (of β-Me in II) experiments suggest that II also undergoes process 1. Olefin dissociation from [Cp2TiH(CH2=CMeCMe3)]+ is faster than process 1 and EXSY correlations are seen intermolecularly between II and 2,3,3-TMB, as well as intramolecularly in 2,3,3-TMB (fastest exchange). In II-d3, this rapid reversible olefin dissociation from the olefin-hydride complex coupled to process 1 leads to multiple isotopologuous rearrangements in 2,3,3-TMB before it can be re-incorporated in II, with similar overall rates of deuterium incorporation at all α- and β- sites in II-dx (x = 0-6, statistical distribution with an average value of 3).</description>

   <description>The Prairie Creek Deposit is an unmined high grade Zn-Pb-Ag deposit located in the southern Mackenzie Mountains of the Northwest Territories. The site is confined within the boundaries of the Nahanni National Park Reserve and is upstream of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The upper portion of the primary quartz-carbonate-sulphide vein mineralization has undergone extensive oxidation, forming zones rich in smithsonite (ZnCO3) and cerussite (PbCO3). This weathered zone represents a significant resource and a potential component of mine waste material. This research is focused on the characterization of the geochemical and mineralogical controls on metal mobility at Prairie Creek, with particular attention to the metal carbonates as a host for trace elements and their role in sequestering those elements in mine waste conditions. Detailed mineralogical analyses were conducted using a combination of SEM, EMP, MLA, LA-ICP-MS, and synchrotron-based µXRD, µXRF and µXANES techniques.&#xd;
Smithsonite was found to contain concentrations of Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, Sb, Hg, As, Mn, Ag and Se in approximately decreasing order, whereas cerussite (expected to be removed as Pb concentrate) hosts Zn, Cu, Sb, Ag, Hg, Fe, Ca, Cd, As, Mn and Se. A significant proportion of the trace metals may also be attenuated by other secondary minerals. This study has identified previously unreported minor phases, including cinnabar (HgS), acanthite (Ag2S), bindheimite (Pb2Sb2O6(O,OH)), and multiple metal arsenates. Anglesite (PbSO4) may be present in greater proportions than is indicated by previous work. Ore processing will remove most Pb and Zn sulphides as well as cerussite; however, smithsonite will remain in tailings as a major source for most metals. Mobilized Pb may be released primarily from anglesite, with As coming from arsenates, Ag from acanthite and anglesite, Sb from bindheimite, Fe from smithsonite and goethite, Cu from smithsonite, anglesite, malachite, azurite and covellite, and Hg and Se from a combination of smithsonite, anglesite, cinnabar and arsenates.&#xd;
In a mine waste setting, near-neutral pH will favour precipitation and attenuation of trace metals. Regardless, oxidation, dissolution and mobilization is expected to continue at a slow rate, and changes to more acidic or reducing environmental conditions could significantly increase metal release.</description>

   <description>A magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN) testing system was developed for Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) to perform MBN measurements on the Royal Canadian Navy’s Victoria class submarine hulls that can be correlated with material properties, including residual stress. The DRDC system was based on the design of a MBN system developed by Steven White at Queen’s University, which was capable of performing rapid angular dependent measurements through the implementation of a flux controlled tetrapole probe. In tetrapole probe designs, the magnetic excitation field is rotated in the surface plane of the sample under the assumption of linear superposition of two orthogonal magnetic fields. During the course of this work, however, the validity of flux superposition in ferromagnetic materials, for the purpose of measuring MBN, was brought into question. Consequently, a study of MBN anisotropy using tetrapole probes was performed. Results indicate that MBN anisotropy measured under flux superposition does not simulate MBN anisotropy data obtained through manual rotation of a single dipole excitation field. It is inferred that MBN anisotropy data obtained with tetrapole probes is the result of the magnetic domain structure’s response to an orthogonal magnetization condition and not necessarily to any bulk superposition magnetization in the sample. A qualitative model for the domain configuration under two orthogonal magnetic fields is proposed to describe the results. An empirically derived fitting equation, that describes tetrapole MBN anisotropy data, is presented. The equation describes results in terms of two largely independent orthogonal fields, and includes interaction terms arising due to competing orthogonally magnetized domain structures and interactions with the sample’s magnetic easy axis.  The equation is used to fit results obtained from a number of samples and tetrapole orientations and in each case correctly identifies the samples’ magnetic easy axis.</description>

   <description>The past decade and a half of technological innovation and explosion of historical multiplicities have reignited the debates on appropriation. This dissertation contributes to the discussion for the purposes of understanding appropriation’s significance to our fluctuating conceptions of authenticity and originality, and to our long-standing cultural institutions (specifically, copyright). &#xd;
	Critics of certain kinds of appropriation (like pastiche) have argued it is nothing more than a vague, empty form of mimicry, more closely related to theft than to creative production. On the other hand, advocates for certain kinds of appropriation (like parody, satire, or collage) have regarded it as a useful form of criticism and as a catalyst for inventing new modes of expression in a postmodern moment. Some of the most conspicuous and effecting conversations about appropriation and creative production have lately occurred in relation to intellectual property legislation. Although it is often taken for granted that copyright laws protect creative producers, this dissertation follows recent revelations in literary, and communications studies which have revealed the complex tension between these producers and the economically directed industries that are both driven by, and support those producers.&#xd;
	This thesis updates arguments about appropriation for a contemporary context by critically examining these claims from a postcolonial, Marxist perspective considered largely through contemporary Western visual art, film, fashion, and music. This thesis argues that it cannot be predetermined as to whether acts of appropriation are wholly laudatory, or wholly critical. Instead, I argue that appropriation has always carried the ability to oscillate between both poles in an intertextual exchange that remains dependent on the variables of the viewer’s context and the artist’s production. However, this intertextuality is often impeded by our fetishization of artists and creative works, and by the institutions that benefit from those fetishes.</description>

   <title>The Effects of Atypical Antipsychotics on Implicit Reward Learning in Schizophrenia</title>

   <description>Implicit (or non-conscious) reward learning, which is necessary for healthy cognitive, emotional, and social functioning, is often impaired in schizophrenia. However, few studies have examined this type of learning in first-episode patients, and almost none have used unmedicated samples. Therefore, it remains unclear if implicit reward learning is spared or impaired in schizophrenia, and whether the first-line medications used to treat the disorder (i.e., atypical antipsychotics) enhance, depress, or have no appreciable effect on this ability.&#xd;
	Implicit reward learning performance was measured in three groups (controls [N = 19]; unmedicated [N = 26] and medicated [N = 21] first-episode schizophrenia patients) using the Weather Prediction Task (WPT) and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). These tasks were administered at two different testing sessions (i.e., time 1 and time 2), at least one month apart. All medicated patients who entered the study were being treated with the following atypicals: olanzapine (N = 11), quetiapine (N = 3), risperidone (N = 3), or a combination (N = 4). After the initial assessment, unmedicated patients were randomly prescribed one of these three medications and re-tested after therapeutic doses had been established.&#xd;
	At time 1, unmedicated patients performed as well as controls on the WPT and IGT, whereas the atypicals medication group showed impairment. Controls demonstrated improvement on both tasks from time 1 to time 2. In contrast, unmedicated patients failed to improve on either test after being treated with atypicals (olanzapine [N = 9]; quetiapine [N = 2], risperidone [N = 1]). In addition, a significant inverse correlation was found between WPT performance and severity of negative symptoms among medicated patients.&#xd;
	Results suggest that implicit reward learning is preserved in schizophrenia and impaired by treatment with olanzapine and other atypicals. These findings have important clinical implications. The benefits of atypical antipsychotic treatment, such as possible relief from delusions and hallucinations and  improvement in mood and select cognitive abilities, must be balanced against potentially adverse effects, such as life-threatening cardiometabolic syndromes and reward learning deficits. The latter are associated with the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, which cause greater functional impairment than positive symptoms. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the effects of various antipsychotics on implicit reward learning when designing a treatment plan for schizophrenia.</description>

   <description>This thesis focuses on understanding the relationship between the microstructure and the different work hardening mechanisms of DP steels. Through the application of various thermo-mechanical processing schedules prior to inter-critical (IC) annealing, five distinctly different microstructural variants were produced. The work hardening behaviour of the five microstructural variants was examined in terms of the true work hardening rate, θ, the instantaneous work hardening exponent, n, and the dislocation annihilation factor, h. Additionally, back stresses were measured in selected microstructural variants having similar martensite volume fraction of ~15%, using a custom-made in-plane forward-reverse shear testing fixture.&#xd;
&#xd;
At small strains (&lt;2%), the work hardening behaviour was found to be dominated by the introduction of back stresses and the generation of GNDs in the ferrite matrix. The work hardening response at this stage was characterized by θεp=0.5% and a minimum value in the instantaneous work hardening exponent, nmin. Both of these parameters were determined to be functions of  (f/d)^1/2 (f is the volume fraction and d is the size of martensite particles), the mean ferrite grain size as well as the morphology and spatial distribution of martensite particles.&#xd;
&#xd;
At higher strains (2-3%), a maximum value in the instantaneous work hardening exponent is reached (nmax). This parameter, which can be considered as the work hardening capacity of the material, was found to be a function of mean ferrite grain size but is independent of (f/d)^1/2. The relative contribution of back stresses was also found to reach a constant value at a similar von Mises equivalent strain. This observation suggests that at strains above those associated with nmax, other work hardening mechanisms become more important.&#xd;
&#xd;
At strains over 4%, dislocation annihilation by dynamic recovery becomes the controlling factor for the rate of work hardening. This phenomenon is described by the dislocation annihilation factor, h, and is a function of (f/d)^1/2, the mean ferrite grain size as well as the morphology and spatial distribution of martensite particles.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, it was concluded that the ideal DP microstructure will contain a uniform distribution of fine, equiaxed martensite particles in a fine, equiaxed ferrite matrix.</description>

   <description>The manipulation of objects is a hallmark skill in the repertoire of human motor behaviour that involves the grasping, lifting and transporting of objects as well as movement decisions about what objects to interact with. These components of manipulation are often the focus of experiments as they offer a window into the sensorimotor mechanisms that support complex and adaptable manipulatory skill. This thesis was designed to extend the scope of object manipulation studies by focusing on functional, object oriented tasks. Three of the four studies in this thesis focus on object transport, involving reaching movements while grasping novel objects. In the first study we examined the role of haptic feedback while participants transported a non-rigid object. We showed first, the importance of haptic feedback during learning, and second, that training without haptic feedback lead to persistent deficits when subsequently performing the task after the re-introduction of haptic feedback. In a second learning study we demonstrated that kinetic errors alone are insufficient to drive the adaption of movement trajectory during learning, even in highly contextualized scenarios where the mapping of load force to motion was made apparent. In the third study, we showed that people incorporate the dynamics of the arm and object to generate grip force responses that are tuned to the change in load force during rapid, automatic arm movement responses to visuomotor perturbations. Object-oriented behaviour may also involve the linking of actions to produce an overall goal, i.e., unloading a bag of groceries is composed of numerous movements linked together. Implicit in this global task are decisions about what objects to move to and in what order. As such, in the final study, we designed a laboratory foraging task and showed that decisions about what targets to reach to were highly driven by motor factors, such as object position and size as well as cognitive factors such as value. Taken together, these studies extend the current understanding of object manipulation and offer insights into how movement factors are incorporated into decisions about what objects to move to.</description>

   <description>This is a study that traces the development of the present-day City of Kingston from its historical beginnings to its last Boundary Expansion in 1998. The growth of the City of Kingston is documented in terms of eleven significant Boundary Expansions, and the implications of each are examined from a legal and planning perspective. The goal of the study was also to examine the role that the Government played in the development of the land from the earliest times to the present. This was achieved by the identification of the Government of the day that had the authority to deal with the land, and the extent to which the land had been developed by the Government. The thesis documents the eleven Boundary Expansions of the original town-site, and all are confirmed by Statute. Six additional properties were also examined and recorded that joined the City of Kingston in the 1952 Annexation or the 1998 Amalgamation. The significant events are set out on an historical basis. The methodology, followed by an examination of the relevant literature and statutory primary sources, sets the stage for the French and British background that follows, and the thesis then proceeds to examine each of the eleven Boundary Expansions of the City of Kingston from its development as a Town and then a City, culminating with the 1998 final Boundary Expansion through Amalgamation with its neighbouring townships. Over the Centuries the present-day City of Kingston grew from a tiny military settlement to a large City. Each of the eleven Boundary Expansions were fully examined from a legal perspective and the role of Government identified in each instance. References for each of the eleven Boundary Expansions are fully recorded in the study. Particular emphasis is placed upon the 1998 Amalgamation, and a detailed analysis made of the events surrounding this significant change to the City of Kingston. The study concludes with an assessment of this final Boundary Expansion and its possible affect on the City of Kingston in the future.</description>

   <description>This research develops mathematical models to simulate PO3G productions using super-acid catalyst in a batch reactor, to predict super-acid catalyst effects on the polymerization rates and product qualities.  The models describe dynamic changes in concentrations of monomer, water, propanal, linear and cyclic oligomers, hydroxyl ends and unsaturated ends.  The models also predict degree of polymerization and the rates of mass-transfer of linear and cyclic oligomers from the liquid to the nitrogen gas bubbles.  The PO3G model¬s¬¬ will be useful to understand the kinetics of acid-induced condensation polymerization, the designs of advanced batch reactors, and optimization of operating conditions in large-scale industrial reactors.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this qualitative, narrative study was to explore long-term, meaningful memories associated with participating in Ontario high school music programs. I sought to understand how and why music experiences identified by participants were meaningful to their lasting memories of high school music. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with six adults over the age of 30 who had taken music during their time in Ontario public high schools. In most cases, two interviews were conducted in hopes of exploring participants’ memories in detail in order to develop a deeper understanding of their experiences. This study found there are several key factors that influence people’s memories of high school music. Participants who had positive memories of high school music recalled supportive, enjoyable class environments, the role that their teacher played, the development of relationships with their peers, selecting their instrument, unique opportunities, the specialness of music class, comfort in music class, increased confidence, and overall enjoyment. Participants who had adverse memories of their high school music experiences associated these memories with their teacher, being assigned an instrument they were not interested in learning, and the pace of class.   &#xd;
It is my hope that this study contributes to current teaching practices by providing educators with knowledge about the long-term impact that their music programs have, or might have, on students, giving teachers the opportunity to re-evaluate their programs and consider the experiences they bring to their students.</description>

   <title>Problematizing Solutions: A Case Study of Claims about Campus Safety in an Era of ‘School Violence’</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2014-12-30 13:56:29.996</description>
   <description>This dissertation traces networks of power and of resistance. Specifically, it explores how diffuse claims about school violence as a growing social problem are picked up and used by administrators and students at one Canadian university in ways that coalesce around understandings of a safe campus environment as necessarily technologically-mediated. The primary data used to facilitate this exploratory comparative analysis are publically available documents produced following public knowledge of an act of sexualized violence that occurred at that university in the summer of 2007.  Together, I read these sets of documented claims as a security project that simultaneously represents changes made to campus environments in the name of safety as (1) preventative means to ensure student, faculty and staff safety, (2) reactions to socially meditated individual and institutional fears, and (3) constitutive of intertwining processes associated with corporatization and militarization. Two main claims that emerge from this comparative analysis are (1) that techno-securitized campuses are both responses to, and constitutive of, acts of violence, socially mediated fears and uneven distributions of power and (2) that university administrators and students co-narrate campus safety through an ongoing process of discursive negotiation and re-negotiation. Indeed, following the analyses presented in this dissertation, just as students are subject to administrative security-related consumption choices, so too are administrators subject to student-led claims about how best to achieve a safe campus environment. I suggest that these claims-making convergences and divergences oblige analyses that neither deny that techno-security measures are promoted in good faith by people hoping to make people safer nor ignore the importance of contextualizing these efforts in relation to processes which help constitute campuses as unsafe spaces, administrators and students as moral regulatory objects and subjects, and some solutions as more or less reasonable. When situated in relation to the sociological scholarship about moral panics, social problems, and moral regulation this case study draws to the fore the volatile, co-constructed and constitutive aspects of claims-making, with a notable focus on some of the economic forces that inform these discourses.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-12-30 18:48:20.476</description>
   <description>In this thesis, a new mean-squared-error (MSE)-based criterion, rCCW, is proposed to select the optimal number of parameters to estimate from the ranked list of parameters considering the operating region where accurate model predictions are desired. This new approach accounts for the trade-off between bias and variance as additional parameters from this ranked list are estimated. Next, a new forward-selection methodology based on rCCW MSE-based criterion is devised to simultaneously rank and select the parameters while considering the conditions in the desired operating region. The information about the desired operating conditions is considered during both ranking and selection step in this parameter subset selection technique. This approach is valuable to modelers who want to make predictions about new products or grades or at new operating conditions, using models that are fitted only by utilizing data which were obtained at prior operating conditions. The forward selection MSE-based rCCW criterion is then extended to the cases in which the Fisher information matrix (FIM) is not invertible. A singular FIM has been reported in many industrial chemical engineering models, many high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, and over-parameterized models. A singular FIM leads to a significant complication in the analysis of parameter estimation problems. In this thesis, two different approaches for parameter ranking and selection are undertaken and compared when the FIM is not invertible. The method that uses a reduced invertible FIM is shown to be superior to the alternative method that uses a pseudo inverse, using a linear regression case study. The methodology is extended for use in fundamental nonlinear dynamic models and illustrated using a film casting example.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines Ontario elementary teachers perceptions of their teaching of the performing arts (i.e., music, drama, and dance), through responses to an online survey. Participants (N = 138) described multiple aspects of their training and experiences in the performing arts, their comfort in teaching the performing arts, and the degree to which they thought they were teaching the expectations in the curriculum document. The document “The Arts, Grades 1-8, 2009” clearly describes (a) many benefits of performing arts practice, (b) elements of practice and instruction in each performing arts area, (c) how the creative process is a part of and enhanced by participation in these activities, and (d) guidelines for assessment of and through the arts, in addition to (e) describing the many mandated specific expectations for each subject and Grade level. However, few studies have addressed the training and experience of the teachers of the performing arts, and there is a pressing need for baseline data about performing arts instruction to inform hiring, certification, and professional development policies. Descriptive statistics are presented which detail many varied elements of performing arts instruction in Ontario schools, and ANOVAs are used to compare the differences between training groups on teachers perceptions of their comfort, the frequency and duration of their instruction, and their adherence to the curricular expectations. Analyses revealed that participant teachers with high levels of training and experience reported significantly higher levels of comfort and effectiveness in their performing arts instruction than teachers with low or no training in the performing arts. Analyses also showed that participants with low amounts of formal training and limited experiences in the art form can perceive themselves as comfortable and effective at teaching the performing arts. These participants rated themselves significantly higher than participants with no training or experience. Structural conditions and broad baseline data are also presented.</description>

   <description>This study focuses on the experimental testing and numerical modeling of a 4.5 kW transcritical CO2 heat pump water heater at Queen’s University in the Solar Calorimetry Laboratory. Due to the predicted high heat rejection temperatures in a transcritical vapour-compression cycle, buoyancy driven thermosyphon flow through a brazed-plate gas-cooler was proposed to promote tank stratification and to improve system performance. The performance was evaluated through a series of experimental sensitivity and static tank charge tests. A TRNSYS model was also created and verified to simulate the performance of the system under a detailed user demand schedule for a week of operation. The TRNSYS model used a parametric table created with a steady-state model of the vapour-compression system in EES that was validated against experimental data to a standard error of the Y-estimate of ±0.073 kW for heating capacity, ±1.01°C for gas-cooler exit temperature, and ±0.086 for COP.&#xd;
A series of tank charge tests were conducted under thermosyphon flow and forced flow rates at 1 L/min, 2 L/min, and 4 L/min. The thermosyphon charge test produced the highest level of stratification and a total COP of 3 at an average flow rate of 0.73 L/min. All of the forced convection cases operated with a higher degree of mixing. &#xd;
TRNSYS model simulations with hot water draws found that the thermosyphon flow configuration performed with a higher degree of stratification under regular user demand while simulations with high flow rates resulted in a mixed tank at a high temperature. Results predicted an 11% reduction in required heat energy input to the storage, a 30% reduction in electrical energy consumption, a 35% reduction in heat loss, and a 29% improvement in COP for the thermosyphon test as compared to the operation with a mixed tank at 4 L/min.  The thermosyphon draw test also performed with the lowest average tank temperature, yet produced the highest draw temperatures. Through these results, it was concluded that natural convection operation with brazed-plate gas-coolers can contribute to a better performing system and this flow configuration should be considered in future applications of this technology.</description>

   <description>Death due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the result of cardiac arrhythmias and loss of cardiac pump function.  One of the putative underlying mechanisms is impaired inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), resulting in small persistent sodium currents.  Nine VGSC (NaV1.1-NaV1.9) have been cloned and functionally expressed.  Electrophysiological/pharmacological evidence suggests that “neuronal” isoform(s) exist in cardiomyocytes along with the cardiac-dominant NaV1.5.  Given that persistent currents have been shown to be fundamental to the function of neuronal isoforms and that pharmacological evidence suggests that neuronal VGSC underlie increases in persistent currents during ischemic events, we hypothesized that neuronal VGSC are present in cardiomyocytes.  Specifically, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the neuronal VGSC NaV1.1 exists in rat right ventricular myocytes.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The full-length NaV1.1 coding sequence was cloned in overlapping segments. Through sequencing, we identified one amino acid difference from a published brain sequence (c.2935A>G) and four deletion variants (c.[del266_473], c.[del2012_2044], c.[del4004_4258], and c.[del4003_4284]). The deletion variants were not present in all sequenced amplicons.  Deletions at the first and the third deletion sites were of particular interest as these involved regions of conserved sequence, likely essential to channel function.  To explore this further, PCR primers were designed to amplify a partial transcript spanning both of these regions.  Three RT-PCR bands were produced: 1) an ~4500 bp band that is likely a composite of two amplicons, one with a deletion at the first deletion site (c.[del266_473]) and one with a deletion at the third deletion site (either c.[del4004_4258] or c.[del4003_4284]);  2) an ~4200 bp band confirmed to contain an amplicon with a deletion at both the first and the third deletion sites (either c.[del266_473] and c.[del4004_4258], or c.[del266_473] and c.[del4003_4284]); and 3) an ~4075 bp band suggesting further unidentified deletion variants. We were unable to identify any amplicons that did not contain at least one deletion involving conserved sequence.&#xd;
&#xd;
Overall, these results demonstrate that multiple sequence variances of NaV1.1 exist in adult rat cardiomyocytes.  Moreover it appears that under normal cellular conditions, at least one deletion that is likely to be devastating to channel function is always present.</description>

   <description>As immigration transforms the electorates of contemporary democracies, the political activity of newcomers will have increasingly powerful effects on political life. This thesis examines one important dimension of this process: the role of ethnic affinity in electoral politics. Affinity effects lead to voters being more likely to support members of the same ethnocultural group - which, as well as vote choice effects, might form the basis of support for leadership contests, counterbalance  discrimination, and underpin more general issue coalitions. However, data from the United States, and some from Europe, suggests that inter-minority conflict, rather than cooperation, is the norm. This severely limits the breadth - and hence influence - of potential “rainbow coalitions”. To test for the existence and dimensions of ethnic affinity effects in Canada, this dissertation uses data from a web-based survey experiment with a large panel of racialized respondents (~1500). Respondents evaluated candidates in a hypothetical election, with candidate ethnicity experimentally manipulated. The analysis shows that respondents have strong affinity for their own ethnocultural group, some affinity for other minority candidates, and certainly no inter-ethnic discrimination. Ethnic affinity effects not only apply to Canada, broader “rainbow coalitions” seem much more likely than previously suggested. Moreover, a contextual analysis suggests that Canada is not an outlier – these effects should apply to many countries. The second part of the dissertation explores the causes and motivations for affinity effects. Two categories of explanations are explored – interest-based explanations, and identity-based explanations. For this, the dissertation uses a novel application of the Identification with a Psychological Group Scale, drawn from social psychology, a manipulation that primes self-interest, and other measures. In a sharp contrast to previous research, these results show strong evidence for identity effects and a significant amount of evidence against interest-based explanations. Finally, a new data set on the ethnicity of several thousand candidates over four federal elections, combined with riding level census data, demonstrates that the context for ethnic affinity effects is widespread.</description>

   <description>Bracing is a treatment option for medial knee osteoarthritis that reduces compressive forces in the medial knee through the application of an external brace moment. In theory, this moment reduces the external knee adduction moment, whose magnitude has been related to the severity of osteoarthritis (Miyazaki et al., 2002). Studies have quantified the brace moment to determine whether it could significantly reduce joint loads (Pollo et al., 2002; Self et al., 2000; Schmalz et al., 2010), however none have considered the pressure distributions between the brace and the user, which can be used to evaluate the impact of specific design components on the brace moment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide a novel method of analyzing brace mechanics using pressure measurements between the brace and the user. The experimental setup consisted of a motion capture system, an instrumented treadmill, two pressure mats, and two load cells. This setup was used to quantify important aspects of brace mechanics, specifically, the thigh lever arm, the force applied to the lateral knee, the brace deflection, the brace moment, and the brace stiffness. Two braces were tested, being a single-hinged brace and a dual-hinged brace, on five subjects, who performed two thirty second walking trials on the instrumented treadmill. The results showed that there was some variability as a percentage of stance phase, however, brace mechanics were consistent through mid-stance. Therefore the braces were compared at mid-stance using a paired t-test. This showed a larger lateral load (p &lt; 0.01), brace deflection (p = 0.02) and brace moment (p &lt; 0.01) for the dual-hinged brace, while the stiffness of the single-hinged brace was larger (p = 0.03). Furthermore, there were no observed differences in the thigh lever arm between the braces (p > 0.05). These differences were attributed to design features of the braces, the most important being the tightening mechanism, which we believe contributed to both the higher lateral load and the lower stiffness for the dual-hinged brace. Using these results and the pressure distributions, a new brace design was proposed, modifying brace features to increase brace effectiveness. Overall, the proposed method proved useful when comparing braces, and allowed for brace improvement, making it a reasonable non-invasive means of analyzing brace mechanics.</description>

   <description>The central questions proposed for investigation in this project are (a) What might be the relationship between emergent, intersubjective ethical processes, such as might be claimed to exist in interpersonal relationships among prisoners, and moral systems, such as the rehabilitationist philosophy of the criminal justice system? and (b) In what ways might these ethical and moral systems and processes find expression in the lived experiences of prisoners? To explore these questions a working group was formed with myself and four research collaborators who had spent some time in prison. &#xd;
We worked collaboratively following a radical pedagogy approach to research, responding to these questions and testing this philosophical model against our lived experiences of prison and beyond. While we did not pretend to reach any specific conclusions on these highly philosophical questions, we were not at a loss to locate examples of our deliberations within our experiences of prison, as well as within the project itself building meaning across philosophy and practice. Thus at the very least we may advance that a framework of emergent, intersubjective ethics can have bearing on experiences of prison and may through further development present critiques and alternatives to the demoralizing spectrum of carceral control and rehabilitation. Further, we may hold that those with experience of incarceration are best prepared and most capable of offering this analysis. &#xd;
We contributed to the fields of intersubjective, deconstructivist ethics and convict criminology and affirmed ourselves as ethical subjects.</description>

   <description>Existing scholarship on LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer/questioning) rights, regulation, “homonationalism,” and citizenship fails to consider lesbian and gay inclusion as a hegemonic state ideology. This dissertation addresses this lacuna, with particular attention to Canada and Jamaica. It considers the political implications of near legal equality for gays and lesbians in Canada, not merely in terms of the entrenchment of a regime of sexual citizenship rights culminating in same-sex marriage, but, relatedly, in terms of significant popular consent to the notion of gays and lesbians as equal and included citizens. It theorizes and critically demonstrates “homohegemony,” an ideology of relative inclusion of gay and lesbian citizenship in the national imaginary, in which the state extends selective citizenship rights to the gay and lesbian minority in a benevolent liberal fashion. However, these rights are premised on moments of illiberalism both within and outside the Canadian nation-state. Drawing on a neo-Gramscian understanding of hegemony, these illiberal exclusions may also be seen to characterize homohegemony, ideologically and materially. Once homosexual inclusion in the national imaginary becomes hegemonic, symbolized by the granting of near legal equality through same-sex marriage, longstanding and novel “others” are (re)imagined as exterior to the ideal-typical national community. One illiberal “other” is “homophobic Jamaica,” which functions as a significant constructed counterpoint, or foil, to a newly homohegemonic “national self.” A historical preoccupation with the “homosexual other” within Canada has significantly turned to a fixation on homophobic other nation-states. The ideological construction of Jamaica in particular is persuasive, not least because it bases itself in a degree of truth grounded in real heterosexism. The construction is, however, replete with generalizations, distortions, exaggerations, and omissions, and occurs in the context of historic colonial and other stereotypes. This image of Jamaica invisibilizes a much queerer reality. Homohegemony, both in its veritable benevolent liberal inclusions, and its less commonly appreciated significant illiberal exclusions, is thus set out in a broadly understood Canadian context. That such a context includes the imagination of Jamaica and Jamaicans, within a broader neocolonial relationship, represents a queer development in the history of hegemonic Canadian sexual ideology.&#xd;

   <description>Impulsive action, the inability to withhold responding, is a primary symptom of many psychiatric disorders, including drug addiction. Impulsive action is mediated through a complex interplay of many different neurotransmitters. The purpose of the experiments presented in this thesis was to further elucidate the role of opioid activity and environmental influences (e.g., stress) on impulsive action. Chapters 2 – 4 extend previous findings showing mu and delta opioid receptor (M/DOR) involvement in impulsive action. In all experiments, animals were trained to withhold responding for sucrose until a discriminative stimulus (cue light) was presented. In Chapter 2, rats were tested in a Variable delay response inhibition (RI) task in which the pre-response (i.e., premature) phase ranged from 1-60 s; thus, animals could not predict the length of the premature phase. Following training, rats were tested for impulsive action following injections of the DOR agonist, SNC80, or the MOR agonist, morphine. SNC80 dose-dependently increased premature responding in the Variable delay task, whereas none of the morphine doses had any effect. SNC80-induced increases in premature responding were blocked by a highly specific DOR antagonist (naltrindole). Morphine had no effect on responding in the Variable delay task, so in Chapter 3 we tested the effects of morphine in two Fixed delay tasks (4- and 60-s). Morphine dose-dependently increased premature responding in both the Fixed 4s and 60s versions of the RI task, an effect blocked by MOR antagonism. In Chapter 4, we assessed impulsive action in mice conditionally lacking MORs or DORs located on GABAergic forebrain neurons (cKO), and in constitutive MOR or DOR knockout mice (KO). Surprisingly, neither cKO nor KO mice differed in impulsive responding compared to control mice. Finally, in Chapter 5, we examined whether the pharmacological stressor, yohimbine, increases impulsive action. Yohimbine dose-dependently increased impulsive action; however antagonism of stress (CRF and glucocorticoid receptors), noradrenergic, dopaminergic, or opioidergic systems did not alter this response. Collectively, these studies demonstrate an important role for both opioid systems and stress in impulsive action, but highlight the importance of methodological differences when interpreting pharmacological and genetic behavioural studies.</description>

   <description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 3 million Canadians and these patients have a markedly increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.  CKD patients have abnormal mineral metabolism and vitamin K status; dysfunctions that can accelerate the rate of vascular calcification.  Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a key tissue based inhibitor of calcification and is dependent on vitamin K for activity. In this thesis, an adenine-induced rat model of CKD was used to characterize quantitatively and temporally the impact of changing vitamin K status on the susceptibility of vessels to calcification.  Treatment with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, at therapeutic levels, significantly increased vessel calcification and the attendant circulatory consequences (higher pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity) whereas treatment with dietary vitamin K attenuated the pathogenesis.  Vitamin K (K1) treatment increased the tissue levels of both forms of vitamin K (K1 and MK-4) in all the tissues studied.  Vitamin K metabolism was clearly altered by CKD, in that there was a shift to lower K1 and higher MK-4 tissue content, resulting in an increased MK-4:K1 ratio.  Although somewhat paradoxical, a decrease in the expression level of the MK-4 synthesizing enzyme UBIAD1 and the vitamin K recycling enzyme VKOR was found.  This latter finding suggests that increased MK-4 was not due to an increase in production but rather to a decrease in utilization of MK-4.  Patients with CKD are also known to be deficient in calcitriol.  In this thesis the impact of two doses of calcitriol (20 ng/kg and 80 ng/kg), in the presence of low or high vitamin K status, on CKD-induced vascular calcification was assessed.  Both calcitriol doses increased the severity of calcification regardless of vitamin K status.  That is, contrary to the hypothesis, high dietary vitamin K1 was unable to attenuate the pro-calcification stimulus of calcitriol, and furthermore, warfarin treatment did not worsen it. The basis for these unanticipated findings points to the obese phenotype of the animals used potentially masking the potential benefits of calcitriol treatments, although this concept requires further study.  Although several unexpected findings occurred, this thesis still fills some key gaps in knowledge pertaining to the role of vitamin K status in the development of vascular calcification during CKD and as a therapeutic intervention.</description>

   <description>Minas Basin in the Bay of Fundy has the world’s largest tidal range and exchanges approximately 110 billion tonnes of water twice a day with tidal currents up to 5 ms-1 through Minas Passage, making it an ideal site for tidal power extraction. In this thesis a multi-domain high-resolution hydrodynamic model of Minas Basin is implemented and used to investigate: a) the relative influence of vegetation on flow routing in a macrotidal estuary to develop an understanding of the intertidal hydrodynamics in the natural system; and b) the implications of tidal energy extraction on basin-scale suspended sediment concentrations by simulating in-stream turbines.</description>

   <description>The insulin signaling antagonist daf-18/PTEN is known to play various roles in the response of C. elegans to starvation. While daf-18’s roles in promoting dauer formation are well understood, the extent of its roles in L1 arrest remains unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of germline expression of daf-18 in coordinating proper L1 arrest. It had been previously hypothesized that germline expressed daf-18 might be sufficient to properly arrest germline proliferation and achieve wildtype levels of L1 arrest longevity. In this study, I show that germline expression alone is neither sufficient in restoring full L1 arrest longevity nor germ cell quiescence. Instead, L1 arrest longevity is dependent on systemic daf-18 expression. I also explore the effects of maternal contributions to offspring on L1 arrest longevity. I show here that maternally rescued daf-18 mutants survive two days longer than controls. I demonstrate that worms that progressed to adulthood through the dauer life stage do not produce offspring that are better suited to survive L1 arrest. Conversely, I observed adult worms that experience crowding produce offspring with mildly increased L1 arrest longevity. Lastly, I explore the post- translational regulation of DAF-18 by demonstrating that the proteasomal subunits pas-3 and pbs-4 are involved in DAF-18 degradation.</description>

   <description>Marsilio Ficino’s Latin writings contain within them a program of clerical, social, and political reform. The agent of such reform was a disciplinary apparatus called know thyself. Through know thyself, an ideal philosopher would emerge. This philosopher had the potential to become, in time, a prophet. Ficino built his apparatus out of parts borrowed from the writings of the Platonists, early Christian monastics, and Ciceronians. It amounted to a process of daemonic combat, fasting and prayer. Citizens, under the Ficinian prophet, would be made to practice these arts in order to convert themselves to the truth contained in God’s light. The prophet would reform society and the church in order to eliminate heresy and ward off the influence of evil daemons. Ficino, looking at an Italian intellectual culture that denied the immortality of the soul and encouraged children to seek the praise of glory, wished to return society to its humble, devoted roots. There had once been a Golden Age of man, a reign of Saturn prior to the Flood. Know thyself would return man to that age and that kingdom.</description>
