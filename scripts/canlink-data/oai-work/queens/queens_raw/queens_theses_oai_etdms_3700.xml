   <description>Background: Head and Neck cancers (H&amp;NCa) are typically associated with risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use. The human papilloma virus (HPV) has begun to play a role in the pathogenesis of these cancers, decreasing the age of diagnosis and increasing survival. Curative H&amp;NCa treatments can include surgery (SX) and radiotherapy (RT) and one of the suggested late effects of RT is damage to blood vessels. The current literature identifies vascular injury and stroke as possible outcomes following RT among patients with H&amp;NCa. &#xd;
Objectives: 1) To determine the risk of ischemic stroke among patients that received any curative RT compared to patients that were treated with SX alone, and quantify this risk with respect to time following treatment, 2) to determine how modifications of RT regimens affect the risk of ischemic stroke, specifically the addition of chemotherapy, preceding the RT with surgical neck dissection and different doses of radiation, and 3) to determine the risk of stroke-related events, including transient ischemic attacks and carotid endarterectomies/stents, among patients that were treated curatively with any RT compared to patients treated with SX alone. &#xd;
Methods: A retrospective cohort design using incident cases of H&amp;NCa identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry was used to address these objectives. The risk of stroke following RT was assessed using databases from the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences. The risk of – and time to stroke was be examined using a survival analytic approach, accounting for the competing risk of death. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for stroke risk factors and cumulative incidence functions were estimated for each objective.&#xd;
Results: The study cohort included 14,069 patients with H&amp;NCa. RT was found to contribute considerably to the risk of stroke compared to SX - both alone (HR=1.70, 95%CI: 1.41,2.05) and after combining all treatment modalities that included any radiation exposure (HR=1.46, 95%CI: 1.23,1.73). &#xd;
Conclusion: This study’s results show that RT contributes a risk of stroke in terms of a late effect of treatment. These findings were consistent with biological hypothesis and contribute a significant and important addition to the body of literature.</description>

   <description>The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds glucocorticoids and transcriptionally regulates genes involved in immune response, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Previous work in our lab using MeDIP followed by qPCR found that 15% of assayed breast tumours were methylated at the GR (NR3C1) proximal promoter, and samples with methylation near exon 1B had decreased GR expression compared to unmethylated samples. In this study, a quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) assay was developed in an attempt to detect NR3C1 promoter methylation in breast cancer patient blood samples. Although circulating NR3C1 promoter methylation was not detectable in our patient cohort, the assay was still used to detect and quantify NR3C1 promoter methylation in the breast tumour samples. &#xd;
     Patients with ERα-positive breast tumours with low NR3C1 expression have shown a poorer outcome when treated with tamoxifen compared to tumours with higher NR3C1 expression. Using a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral TRIPZ-shRNAmir in MCF-7 cells directed against endogenous GR, we were able to explore whether low NR3C1 expression modulates cellular response to tamoxifen. When treated with tamoxifen, GR knockdown cells showed increased proliferation compared to normal GR levels, suggesting a decreased sensitivity to tamoxifen. GR knockdown only stimulates proliferation when ERα action is blocked by tamoxifen. Based on these results we propose that NR3C1 promoter methylation detected through qMSP in breast tumours, which leads to low GR expression, may be used as a predictive biomarker for poor outcome in ERα-positive breast tumours treated with tamoxifen.</description>

   <description>The Early Cretaceous Bluesky Formation (Mannville Group) in the Peace River area of west-central Alberta, Canada, is a complexly stratified tide-dominated sediment body composed of monolithic and heterolithic sandstone. The Bluesky Formation is tide-dominated and was deposited during the latter part of a third-order transgressive systems tract. &#xd;
The Bluesky Formation is divisible into two valley-bounded sequences, informally referred to in this study as the “lower Bluesky unit” and the “upper Bluesky unit”. The lower Bluesky unit is composed of tide-dominated deltaic deposits. The upper Bluesky unit is composed of tide-dominated estuarine deposits. The lower Bluesky unit has abundant dynamically deposited mudstone layers (comprising 5-40% of most facies), many of which are interpreted to have been deposited under conditions of moderate to high suspended-sediment concentration (1-1000 g L-1) and appreciable current speeds (> 0.2 ms-1). The upper Bluesky unit, by contrast, has more sparsely distributed mudstone layers (comprising 0-15% of most facies) deposited primarily during slackwater and under conditions of relatively low suspended-sediment concentrations (&lt; 1 g L-1). Both units are composed predominantly of subtidal and lower intertidal channel-bar and tidal-flat deposits. However, the most seaward deposits of the deltaic lower Bluesky unit contain sandstone-dominated heterolithic delta-front and mouth-bar deposits, whereas the most seaward environments of the estuarine upper Bluesky unit contain monolithic tidal sand-ridge deposits.&#xd;
The Bluesky represents deposition in slightly more seaward locations than the underlying Gething Formation, which is composed of lower-energy mudstone-rich facies of a fluvially dominated depositional system. Both the lower and upper Bluesky units are broadly aggradational with several autogenic internal erosional discontinuities, suggesting that high-energy tidal sedimentation generally kept pace with accommodation created by relative sea-level rise.&#xd;
A new and robust method for interpreting tidal facies is presented in this study. The approach uses a broadly applicable process-driven facies classification scheme that ensures a manageable number of facies. Recent improvements in the understanding of tidal systems and their facies models are incorporated into the method, most significantly highlighting the importance of mud and the realization that the set of geomorphic elements that comprise tidal systems is relatively small despite their complex lithofacies.</description>

   <description>Many argue that moral blame is unfair when poor formative circumstances negatively influence an individual’s ability to appreciate moral reasons. For example, Susan Wolf refers to the pre-conditions for being blamed as being “connected to the world in a certain sort of way” and R. Jay Wallace emphasizes the importance of an agent’s being able to exercise what he refers to as “powers of reflective self-control” if blame is to be fair. Wallace in particular contends that to blame an individual who is unable to adequately respond to reasons is to participate in an unfair practice of burdening those who are often better described as victims.&#xd;
I argue that we should reject this claim about blame, and the conception of moral responsibility that underlies it, while remaining sympathetic to some of the concerns raised by its proponents.  What I call the Unfair Victim argument makes claims that seem prima facie, quite plausible. I contend that rejecting it does not require that one overlook the fact that poor formative circumstances can make it more difficult to recognize moral reasons or that this may cause particular individuals to suffer hardship.  I argue that a more defensible, Scanlonian view of blame still allows one to recognize the hardship suffered by those described by the Unfair Victim argument without having to accept  that this hardship diminishes moral responsibility or renders blame unfair.</description>

   <description>The transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding domain (TAZ) is a transcriptional co-activator and downstream component of the tumor suppressor Hippo pathway that plays critical roles in organ size control, stem cell self-renewal, tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Recently, TAZ has been identified as a novel oncogene that is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and mediates their proliferation, transformation and tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TAZ-induced tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we first established an in vivo xenograft mouse model by overexpressing the constitutively active TAZ-S89A in E10 (mouse) and HBE135 (human) immortalized lung epithelial cells. Next, the gene expression profile of this model was analyzed by performing next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) which led to identifying several novel genes transcriptionally upregulated by TAZ such as INHBA, KLF5, BMPs, FGFs, etc. Interestingly, we identified PI3K and TGF-ß signaling pathways as mediators of TAZ-induced cell proliferation and transformation, which were inhibited by using small molecule inhibitors specifically targeting these two signaling pathways. In addition, TAZ-induced cell proliferation and transformation were suppressed by disrupting the interaction between TAZ and its major binding transcription factor TEAD. Together, our study shows for the first time a new mechanism linking PI3K and TGF-ß pathways to TAZ-induced cell transformation, suggesting TAZ as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.</description>

   <description>Shift work has been suggested to be associated with early adverse atherosclerotic changes. Endothelial function, intima-media thickness (IMT), and arterial stiffness are preclinical predictors of atherosclerotic changes, which may suggest a specific pathway through which shift work exposure contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aims of this exploratory study were: 1) to describe and compare early atherosclerotic indicators between current shift workers [SW] with at least 6 years of shift working experience and current non-shift workers [NSW] with at least 6 years of work experience; 2) to describe the potential for a dose-response relationship between length of shift work exposure and early atherosclerotic indicators; and 3) to explore and compare the associations between psychological stress and vascular changes in SW and NSW. Female current shift (n = 20) and non-shift work employees (n = 19) visited a lab on one occasion to complete vascular function testing. These included reactive hyperemia flow mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and structural examination of intima-media thickness (IMT). Self-report validated measures of psychological job stress, life stress and other personal and demographic information were collected. Within this sample, there was no significant difference between groups regarding atherosclerotic indicators. The SW participants reported a higher effort-reward imbalance (p = 0.003) and greater physical job demands (p &lt; 0.001). Skill discretion, decision authority, and decision latitude were negatively correlated with peripheral PWV (r = -0.623, p &lt; 0.001; r = -0.338, p = 0.044; r = -0.346, p = 0.039, respectively). IMT was positively correlated with psychological job demands (r = 0.413, p = 0.029). There was no dose-response relationship between years of shift work experience and atherosclerotic indicators after controlling for age. Women working in a shift work position did not significantly differ in their atherosclerotic development when compared to non-shift working women. However, women employed in a shift work position did report greater psychological work stress and physical demands, which may play a role in CVD. Individuals exposed to shift work may be prompted to engage in healthy behaviours and employers may benefit from implementing practices to reduce workplace-related stress.</description>

   <description>The cause of varying galaxy interaction outcomes in different environments is investigated using a sample of over 505,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 galaxies at $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.20$. The aim is to distinguish the large-scale environmental effects on galaxies from the small-scale interaction effects in order to identify whether interaction mechanisms vary in different environments, or whether different galaxy populations produce the various outcomes in different environments. To study the properties of paired galaxies, the enhancements in star formation rates (SFRs) and asymmetries are investigated as functions of projected pair separations in different environments. The paired galaxies and control samples were selected using a new technique to distinguish between the influence of nearby neighbours and larger scale environment, and we define four different environmental classes using their dark matter halo masses (the field, poor groups, rich groups, and clusters).&#xd;
&#xd;
We find the strongest SFR enhancements at projected separations ($r_p$) $&lt;40$ \hkpc~in field paired galaxies and the weakest (but statistically significant) in cluster paired galaxies, while the largest asymmetry enhancements are found in cluster paired galaxies, and the least in field paired galaxies. Using the asymmetry offset rather than enhancements reveals no dependence on environmental membership. Mean SFR suppression is found at separations $100&lt;r_p&lt;400$ \hkpc~for paired galaxies with mass ratio $&lt;1$ in all environments, but is absent for paired galaxies with mass ratio $>1$. For paired galaxies with mass ratio $&lt;1$, this suppression is accompanied by a lack of mean asymmetry offset or enhancement at similar separations. Possible explanations of this result include suppression due to an earlier encounter whereby star bursts consume the star forming gas, and given sufficient time the galaxy settles into a symmetric shape. At close separations ($r_p&lt;40$ \hkpc), reduced mean SFR enhancements in all environments are found together with increased asymmetry enhancement in comparison with paired galaxies with mass ratio $>1$. We hypothesize that the suppression in lower-mass paired galaxies is due to the depletion of their gas reservoirs prior to the interaction, and conclude that interactions in different environments produce various results due to assembly bias rather than differing interaction mechanisms in various environments.</description>

   <description>Guided by a developmental framework, this thesis investigated the prevalence, continuity, and consequences of different forms of victimization across adolescence. From Grade 5 through Grade 12, over 3,000 youth completed self-report measures of physical, social, bullying, and sexual harassment victimization, as well as of internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and friendship quality. Developmental trajectory analyses identified three distinct pathways for each form of victimization, with most youth experiencing consistently low levels of victimization. Physical victimization affected a small proportion of youth in Grade 5 and became decreasingly prevalent with development, while social victimization was relatively common and persistent. Bullying victimization was common in preadolescence but declined through to mid-adolescence. Sexual harassment emerged as a new form of victimization as early as Grade 6, with most youth beginning to experience a low level of sexual harassment later in adolescence. There was evidence for heterotypic continuity in victimization: youth who experienced one form of victimization were likely to experience other forms of victimization. Furthermore, the form and frequency of victimization predicted increased risk for negative psychosocial outcomes. Findings from the study highlight the importance of early prevention and intervention, to protect youth from following trajectories of persistent victimization and of negative psychosocial outcomes. Moreover, interventions should focus on different forms of victimization as they become developmentally relevant. The social, biological, and psychological transitions that occur during this developmental period provide a framework for understanding the changing nature of peer victimization.</description>

   <description>Chronic wounds are common among diabetic patients and they are a leading cause of foot amputations. The standard of care has not been successful in healing these wounds so alternative cell-based approaches are being investigated. Each cell-based approach necessitates a delivery strategy that minimizes cell death and maximizes cell retention. To this end, an adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) delivery system was developed, using an extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived bioscaffold as the platform. Porous decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) foams were fabricated over a range of concentrations, and with different tissue processing methods (mincing vs. milling). These foams were characterized by quantitative assessment of equilibrium water content, porosity, protein loss, and swelling ratio (n = 3), with the aim of elucidating how protein concentration and tissue processing affect foam properties. DAT foams were hydrophilic, porous, and maintained their form in culture despite the gradual loss of protein. Also, increasing DAT foam concentrations resulted in reduced porosity and equilibrium water content. Immunofluorescence was then used to detect extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents including collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin in DAT foam cross-sections. DAT foams were positive for all three ECM proteins, suggesting that they could allow cell attachment, migration, and proliferation. In a previous study, it was identified that ASC do not infiltrate DAT foams using traditional static cell-seeding techniques. Therefore, cell-seeding studies were performed in an attempt to enhance cell infiltration into the central regions of the foams. dsDNA content and cell density were quantified in response to various seeding methods, scaffold concentrations, and orbital shaker speeds until an improved set of seeding conditions was identified. Proliferation of ASCs in foams was then determined by semi-quantitatively evaluating Ki67 expression and dsDNA content over 14 days. Finally, to determine the effects of cell-scaffold interactions on ASC gene expression, cells were seeded onto various substrates and cultured in normoxic (21%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions. mRNA levels of VEGF-A and FGF-2 were quantified using qRT- PCR, and it was found that there were no noticeable trends in terms of the effects of oxygen tension or cell-scaffold interactions. However, protein analysis should be performed to confirm these trends.</description>

   <description>This project considers portable affective objects as sites that hold and emit narratives of colonial displacement, generational ties and ruptures, and loss of identity for South Asian diasporas. I propose that the affective objects provide memories, geographies, and emotion. I look to previous scholarship on affect and trauma that suggests that the question of survival can be understood through what is unsaid. My project will add to this discussion by showing how objects and artefacts—material things—can be linked to trauma and displacement; it is specifically the emotions surrounding the affective object—the meanings attached to things—that will uncover some of the unspoken and unsaid complexities of displacement. The very characteristic of portability of objects creates an ability to carry a history, narrative and even home. This project is an analysis of three separate objects; these objects chronicle and are read alongside the narratives of my own familial history with colonial displacement. Through tracing personal narratives that attach themselves to these objects, I uncover that what is lost in upheaval and violence can be found, once again, in the memories the objects hold.</description>

   <description>Insulin resistance (IR) is implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, both of which are leading causes of mortality worldwide. Three modifiable risk factors that are associated with IR include physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SED), and diet. Consensus guidelines state that to obtain health benefit, PA should be performed at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity in bouts of at least 10 consecutive minutes for a minimum of 150 minutes per week. Whether PA that is accumulated below guideline recommendations- such as light PA or sporadic PA (bouts &lt; 10 minutes) - is associated with improvements in IR is uncertain. Irrespective of PA, a growing body of literature suggests that SED may elicit health consequences independent of PA. Furthermore, a dietary pattern in accordance with guidelines may attenuate IR, although the optimal dietary pattern for the prevention of IR remains unclear.&#xd;
Although the separate associations between IR and objectively measured PA and SED as well as self-reported diet quantity and quality have been reported in the literature, few studies have considered the interaction between these modifiable risk factors and IR. We sought to assess the associations of PA, SED, diet quantity, and diet quality with IR in a sample of inactive, abdominally obese men (n=33) and women (n=69).&#xd;
SED and light PA displayed a strong inverse relationship with each other. SED was positively associated with IR, whereas light PA was negatively associated with IR. Sporadic, moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA was not associated with IR. Neither diet quantity nor diet quality were directly associated with IR. Together, these findings suggest that the substitution of SED for modest amounts of PA accumulated below guideline recommendations may attenuate IR among inactive, abdominally obese adults.</description>

   <description>This thesis analyzes selective land use and resource management policies in the province of Ontario, Canada and their relative capacity at recognizing and supporting First Nations. Written in a manuscript format, this thesis addresses the three following questions:&#xd;
&#xd;
1. How have land use and resource management legislation and policies in Ontario recognized and supported First Nations’ rights and notions of honouring past Crown-First Nation relationships? &#xd;
&#xd;
2. How are First Nations recognized and supported in the current and past versions of the Provincial Policy Statement in the province of Ontario?&#xd;
&#xd;
3. How can top-down territorial planning policies in Ontario take a fundamental shift towards promoting new types of relationships and mutual understanding between municipalities and Indigenous peoples by learning from the Aotearoa New Zealand planning context?&#xd;
&#xd;
The common approach to address these research questions is content analysis of policy documents through two separate analytical frameworks. The first manuscript addresses questions one and provides a baseline review of 337 provincial texts and their relative capacity at recognizing First Nations and Aboriginal and treaty rights, and embodying past Crown-First Nations relationships. The second manuscript then addresses the remaining questions by engaging in a comparative between the Ontario Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) (2014) and the Auckland Council Regional Policy Statement (ACRPS) (1999) from the Aotearoa New Zealand planning context. &#xd;
&#xd;
The results highlight the relative limits of Ontario’s current approach and practical areas of improvement. From a theoretical standpoint, this thesis proposes a return to and the development of spaces of common ground to ensure that equitable and constructive planning relations between communities become the standard. In contrast to previous works that narrowly focus on collaborative approaches and on-the-ground relations, this thesis concludes that  provincial land use and resource management policies that shape the everyday deserve greater attention and that strategic-level amendments can enhance recognition and support of First Nations in planning processes. Other changes, including cultural changes will be required to move towards common ground, but we must remain optimistic that the process and a sustained commitment to fundamental change will leave planning in Ontario with First Nations in a better state than where it is today.</description>

   <description>Mode coupler is an important category of device in the  eld of optical sensing and&#xd;
communication. Non-adiabatic  ber taper has attracted much attention in recent&#xd;
years as mode coupling device due to its simple fabrication process, compactness and&#xd;
robust performance. While models exist for mode coupling in conventional adiabatic&#xd;
 ber taper, there are only commercial numerical softwares for simulations of  ber&#xd;
tapers, with little appreciation of the underlying coupling mechanism.&#xd;
In this thesis, a model based on coupled mode theory in non-adiabatic optical  ber&#xd;
taper is proposed for the analysis and calculation of the mode coupling phenomena.&#xd;
This method is applicable for a wide range of non-adiabatic  ber tapers. The result&#xd;
of the model matches well with the result from numerical simulation, and illustrates&#xd;
the mechanism of mode coupling.&#xd;
Two experiments based on non-adiabatic  ber taper are implemented and dis-&#xd;
cussed in this thesis. One is laser beam shaping using abrupt  ber taper and the&#xd;
other is mode interference in non-adiabatic  ber taper with long uniform region. A&#xd;
&#xd;
at-top beam is observed in the beam shaping experiment. The relation between&#xd;
mode phase and &#xd;
at-top beam is investigated with the model.&#xd;
In the experiment of long taper, we got clear interference spectrum in the range&#xd;
of 1530 1560 nm with bandwidth about 10 nm and atteuation peak over 10 dB. We applied the model in the long  ber taper and got good match between modeling and&#xd;
experiment. All this results validate the model and show the potential application of&#xd;
 ber taper.</description>

   <description>Cartilaginous load bearing soft tissues such as the nucleus pulposus in the intervertebral disc are affected by degenerative diseases and physical injury, which if not treated early can initiate a progressive decline in joint function and result in lower back pain. Early treatment options to repair the nucleus pulposus, regain immediate joint function, and aid in the regeneration of de novo tissue are necessary to restore the health and function of symptomatic joints. To satisfy the regenerative design criteria, a cellular hydrogel based approach was chosen and methods were examined to improve mechanical properties while maintaining an injectable and in situ formable scaffold. To improve the stiffness and fatigue resistance of the hydrogels, low molecular weight acrylated star-copolymers composed of D,L-lactide or trimethylene carbonate with caprolactone were mixed with an aqueous solution of methacrylated glycol chitosan to form a hydrogel-elastomer co-continuous morphology. After photo-cross-linking, the elastomer phase contributed the majority of the initial stiffness to the co-continuous scaffolds. Hydrolysis of the elastomer phase, controlled the decrease in the co-continuous scaffold modulus from fast (2 – 3 weeks) to slow (> 2 months) by changing D,L-lactide to trimethylene carbonate in the -caprolactone based elastomers. The slower degrading trimethylene carbonate based elastomer phase was able to maintain an approximate 1200 kPa equilibrium modulus in the co-continuous scaffolds during a 2 month in vitro static culture. Methacrylated prepolymers of glycol chitosan, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and their blends were examined to improve the initial mechanical properties of the hydrogels and maintain the phenotype of the encapsulated chondrocytes during culture. A co-cross-linked mixture of methacrylated prepolymers, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, had an initial equilibrium modulus of 260 kPa, which was maintained along with the highest number of the originally seeded cells (60 %) and cartilaginous matrix accumulation compared to the other hydrogels during a 1 month in vitro static culture. Overall, the development of the co-continuous hydrogel-elastomer morphology was able to produce an injectable cell encapsulating scaffold with an initial modulus greater than 1 MPa and demonstrated regenerative potential that would be suitable for the repair of cartilaginous load bearing soft tissues.</description>

   <description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter found in the central nervous system (CNS). While difficult to measure, the endogenous concentrations of H2S lie between 10nM and 160μM, and recent work has discovered that H2S exerts beneficial actions in the control of cardiovascular function. In the following thesis, I report data examining the cellular and physiological actions of H2S in the subfornical organ (SFO), a CNS site important in the control of blood pressure. &#xd;
We used male Sprague-Dawley rats for both in vivo and in vitro experiments. In the first manuscript, our RT-PCR experiments confirmed previous microarray analyses showing that mRNAs for H2S-producing enzymes were expressed in the SFO. We then used microinjection techniques to investigate the physiological effects of NaHS in SFO, and found that NaHS microinjection (5nmol) into SFO significantly increased blood pressure (mean area under the curve = 853.5 ± 105.7 mmHg*s, n=5). Furthermore, we used patch clamp electrophysiology and found that 97.8% (88 of 90) of neurons depolarized in response to NaHS in a concentration dependent manner (EC50 of 35.6µM). We also observed an increase in neuronal excitability by analysing the rheobase and action potential firing patterns. &#xd;
In our second manuscript, we used in vitro voltage clamp electrophysiology to study the effects of NaHS on the gating properties of voltage-gated ion channels in the membrane of SFO neurons. We found that NaHS (1mM) depolarized the activation curves of N-type calcium currents, persistent sodium currents, and transient sodium currents by average 50% activation voltage (V50) changes of 5.9mV, 10.8mV, and 7.6mV, respectively. Peak induced currents were also enhanced by NaHS application. Interestingly, we observed no effect on voltage-gated potassium currents.&#xd;
This study has correlated in vivo physiological actions of H2S with in vitro membrane depolarizations and increases in excitability in the SFO, a brain area important to the regulation of cardiovascular function. We have provided evidence of effects of H2S on voltage-gated ion channels contributing to neuronal excitability. This study is the first to identify specific actions of H2S in SFO, and has contributed to the growing literature of H2S actions in the CNS.</description>

   <description>This research is based on the premise that creative application of narrative elements requires organization and problem solving skills, hypothesizing that skills taught to support organization will improve creative development. Creativity was defined as “aesthetic appeal” pertaining to the dimensions of novelty, interest, clarity and the ability to understand. In this experimental design, undergraduate education students (n= 28) were randomly assigned to either concept map planning or text planning for the production of digital photo stories. The highest scoring photo stories were novel, interesting, clear, and able to be understood. The older participants scored higher for each of the dimensions, yet the concept map group was younger than the comparison group. Using age and concept map experience as covariates, a multivariate effect was found, and the concept map group produced photo stories with significantly higher clarity. These results suggest that the use of concept maps for planning aids aspects of creative development, and results in clearer creative communication. In terms of participants’ experience, feedback was positive for the use of concept map planning. These results suggest there is support for further investigation of using concept mapping for creative development. It is recommended that this study be replicated with a larger sample size.</description>

   <title>Mathematical model for ethane pyrolysis in an industrial furnace</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-19 14:15:50.596</description>
   <description>Ethane pyrolysis is an important industrial process that occurs by passing ethane and steam through radiant coils (tubes) in gas-fired furnaces to produce ethylene and other light olefins. Undesirable side reactions that occur during the pyrolysis of ethane lead to the formation of coke (solid carbon) on the tube walls, which has to be periodically burnt off in decoking cycles. NOVA Chemicals is interested in developing a model that can accurately predict dynamic coke formation and associated decoking times that would help to optimize run lengths, and decrease costs. &#xd;
A steady-state ethane pyrolysis model of the radiant section of a floor-fired furnace was developed as a first step towards development of a dynamic coke formation model. The model includes 56 pyrolysis reactions involving 28 species, and accounts for radiant heat transfer from the furnace gas to the process gas using the Roesler flux method. The process-side model includes 29 material balances (28 reacting species plus inert steam), 1 energy balance and 1 momentum balance to track the concentration of the 29 species, the process gas temperature and the process gas pressure along the length of the reactor. These model equations are implemented in PREDICI® as an initial value problem. &#xd;
The furnace-side model, which includes 2 radiant flux balances and 1 energy balance, resulted in numerical problems when solved as an initial value problem in PREDICI®. Instead, the model was discretized using finite differences and simplifying assumptions. The resulting system of algebraic equations was solved in PREDICI® and then radiant fluxes were imposed on the process-side model. Preliminary studies of model responses to changes in key model inputs indicate that the model performs as physically expected, rendering this model a strong starting point for future model development.</description>

   <title>Advancing our understanding of how pet ownership impacts health and well-being among community dwelling people living with serious mental illness</title>

   <subject>pet ownership</subject>
   <subject>health and well-being</subject>
   <subject>serious mental illness</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-21 16:02:27.135</description>
   <description>Objectives&#xd;
It is estimated that about 1 million (3%) Canadians will experience serious mental illness  characterized by symptoms and impairments that are severe enough and of long enough duration to interfere with daily life (Canadian Mental Health Association, n.d; Kelly, 2002) including meaningful work and social engagement (Mental Health Commission of Canada, n.d.).&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods &#xd;
The purpose of this thesis was to develop the concept of pet ownership as an everyday North American occupation and to develop a theory of how pet ownership impacts on health and well-being. The first study used Rodgers’ (2000) evolutionary concept analysis approach to analyze North American newspapers and bestselling books. The second study used a grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2006) to explore how pet ownership impacts (positively or negatively) on health and well-being among community dwelling people with serious mental illnesses. Data collection consisted  primarily of individual interviews with 23 stakeholders with knowledge and experience related to pet ownership and serious mental illness.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results&#xd;
In study one, the findings demonstrate that pet ownership is a complex concept consisting of the attributes of: responsibility, investment, occupational engagement, entrepreneurship, relationships, morality, and attitude. Occupational engagement appeared as the central attribute. The Rubik’s Cube was used as  a mental image representing the complexity of pet ownership. In study two, a theoretical model was developed that identified “transformation” through pet ownership as the overarching theme organizing the model of health and well-being through pet ownership. Transformation occurs through distinct processes at three levels: personal (psychosocial benefits), occupation (occupational engagement) and context (thinking outside the box of service delivery). Each main process consists of five subprocesses (e.g. unconditional love and acceptance is a subprocess of psychosocial benefits).&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion&#xd;
The two phases of this research highlight that pet ownership has a range of associated tasks, and that the performance and experience of these tasks is enabled by a range of competencies, meanings, and motivations. These are personal elements that could potentially be supported if service providers themselves developed foundational knowledge and skills, and if this knowledge and skill base was given legitimacy as a valid community support option.</description>

   <description>This dissertation focuses on microfinance in the Canadian context. While heavily documented in regions of the global South, information on microfinance within Canada is limited. Two interconnected research objectives are pursued within this dissertation. Given the scarcity of information on the basic characteristics of the sector, an on-line survey was first administered to microfinance organizations throughout Canada (N=35). Information collected through the on-line survey includes details regarding the structure, size, scope and target borrowers of Canadian organizations. The second research objective investigated within this dissertation critically examines microfinance and its connections to the principles and theories of neoliberalism. Semi-structured interviews with three microfinance stake-holder groups (employees, volunteers and borrowers) (N=33) were conducted in an effort to obtain information relating to the reproduction of neoliberalism within microfinance organizations.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this dissertation, particular attention is paid to the outcomes associated with neoliberalism, where gendered individuals (i.e. women) are rendered invisible and therefore deemed “unworthy” of support while simultaneously, certain racialized bodies are positioned as providing economic utility to the state and as such are deemed “worthy” of support (Jenson 2009; Dobrowolsky 2009; Bauder 2008 and Duggan 2003; Abu-Laban and Gabriel 2008). Research for this dissertation indicates that the theories of “roll-back” and “roll-out” neoliberalism are manifested within Canadian microfinance organizations (Peck and Tickell 2003 and Peck 2010). Deviating from the norm within microfinance organizations in the global South, Canadian organizations focus on women as borrowers only in an extreme minority of cases. Instead, research suggests that a new focus on Canadian immigrants is emerging among Canadian microfinance programs. It is this shift in focus in conjunction with the strategic usage of neoliberalized language and conceptions of the individual which lead to the conclusion that Canadian microfinance organizations are not only entrenched within the doctrine of neoliberalism but active agents in its reproduction.</description>

   <description>Identifying the contributions to, and consequences of, impaired cardiovascular health and function is critical to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies.  Mental stress and a high-fat diet are independent predictors of cardiovascular disease, and impaired vascular endothelial function (assessed via flow-mediated dilation; FMD) may be a common mechanistic link.  Exercise can mitigate cardiovascular risk, but cardiovascular dysfunction (i.e. impaired oxygen delivery) can reduce exercise tolerance and decrease adherence.  This may be characteristic of persons with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), but this has never been investigated within the typical constellation of co-morbidities and associated medications in this population.  PURPOSE: 1) To evaluate whether the combined experience of mental stress and fat consumption (versus either stimulus alone) exacerbates: postprandial lipemia, stress responsiveness, and endothelial dysfunction.  2) To determine whether T2D (within the typical cluster of co-morbidities and medications) results in impaired exercising muscle oxygen delivery and associated reduced small muscle mass exercise tolerance.  &#xd;
METHODS: In healthy persons, FMD was assessed before and hourly for 4-hours post-consumption of a high-fat or low-fat meal, with hourly mental stress (mental arithmetic, speech) or control (counting) tasks.  In persons with T2D and matched Controls, forearm critical force (fCFimpulse) was used as an indicator of exercise tolerance; exercising muscle blood flow was measured during fCFimpulse and during the adjustment and steady state of submaximal rest-to-exercise and exercise-to-exercise transitions.  Ultrasound was used to measure FMD and exercising muscle blood flow.  &#xd;
RESULTS: 1) Repeated mental stress tasks did not impact postprandial lipemia following either meal; 2) Meal fat content did not influence hemodynamic stress responsiveness; 3) Meal fat content did not affect FMD, but endothelial function was modestly greater when the postprandial state was accompanied by mental stress; 4) Relative to matched Controls, representative persons with T2D did not have impaired small muscle mass exercise tolerance (fCFimpulse) or muscle blood flow (rate of adjustment, or amount during submaximal/maximal steady state).  &#xd;
CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the assertions that mental stress and fat consumption are universally detrimental, and that T2D, on top of the typical constellation of co-morbidities and medications, has an impact on exercising muscle blood flow and exercise tolerance.</description>

   <description>Networking has become a key technology within digital games, as multiplayer interaction has become an almost ubiquitous feature. The time required to transmit data over a network can lead to usability problems in networked games, such as inconsistency between players’ views of a virtual world and potentially jarring corrections when inconsistencies are detected. Implementing a good consistency maintenance scheme is therefore critical to game play. Sadly, problems with consistency remain a regular occurrence in multiplayer games, and these problems can have a huge impact on player experience.&#xd;
This research provides guidance for implementing consistency maintenance through a series of user studies and through the establishment of a design space for consistency maintenance. The design space takes a multi-dimensional approach to consistency maintenance and, in addition to the conventional techniques used for reducing inconsistency, includes two additional design concepts – techniques for resolving game-critical decisions in the presence of inconsistency, and techniques for repairing inconsistencies when they occur. We validate the design space through a series of user studies demonstrating the trade-offs among the various techniques and confirming that it is not sufficient to focus on consistency alone. We also develop a set of metrics that provide an empirical comparison among the different techniques for consistency maintenance. We show that consistency algorithms that provide the best consistency do not necessarily lead to the best user experience. Players prefer smooth animation and prefer the results of game-critical decisions to be consistent with their view of the game, even when this results in lower overall consistency. We also show that the three most important factors affecting the detection of corrections are the player’s locus of attention, the smoothness of the correction and the duration of the correction.</description>

   <description>This thesis evaluates the application of actigraphy to the measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of agitation in older adults with dementia. There are increasing numbers of older adults with dementia and management of NPS is an important aspect of providing care for this population. This thesis examined the correlation between actigraphic measures and questionnaire-based measures of NPS, including the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and other measures of NPS. The actigraphic characteristics of individuals with high and low levels of agitation were described along with an assessment of the feasibility of actigraphy for measuring NPS of agitation. A total of 15 individuals with dementia residing in geriatric psychiatry inpatient units in hospital and in long-term care (LTC) facilities were included in the study. Participants wore an actigraph device on their non-dominant wrist for seven consecutive days. Informant-rated NPS measures were completed through interviews with nursing staff familiar with participants. Participants were dichotomized into groups according to agitation status as measured by a cutoff score of ≥50 on the CMAI indicating high agitation. The mean actigraph wear time for the total sample was 6.2 days (SD=1.5). Significant positive correlations were found between overall motor activity as measured by actigraphy mean motor activity (MMA) counts and the CMAI total scores for 24-hour (r=0.70, P=0.004), daytime (r=0.75, P=0.001), and evening (r=0.72, P=0.003) time periods, while nighttime MMA counts were not correlated with CMAI scores (r=-0.03, P=0.917). Significant positive correlations were found between MMA counts and CMAI verbal and non-aggressive physical agitation subscores. Additionally, patients with high CMAI scores had higher levels of 24-hour activity (mean MMA = 169.6, SD=89.4) than patients with low CMAI scores (mean MMA=78.6, SD=35.4, P=0.016). In conclusion, actigraphy appears to be feasible method of measuring some NPS. Actigraphic measures are strongly correlated with questionnaire-based measures of agitation and higher levels of agitation are associated with higher daytime and evening motor activity as measured by actigraphy. Individuals with high levels of agitation can be distinguished from individuals with low agitation using actigraphy. However additional studies are required to further understand the application of actigraphy to the measurement of these important symptoms.</description>

   <description>The C. elegans nervous system offers a rewarding model in which many pathways can be studied with. There are many genes conserved in both invertebrates and vertebrates that are necessary for proper nervous system development. Of the pathways that affect axon guidance, I focus on the VAB-1/Eph RTK signaling pathway as well as the DAF-2/insulin receptor’s pathway. I show that PTP-3/LAR RPTP can negatively regulate VAB-1/Eph RTK through dephosphorylation in vitro and in vivo and may have VAB-1 independent roles. Additionally, I investigate ptp-3’s relationships with genes involved in both vab-1 and daf-2’s pathways including daf-18/PTEN, unc-34/Enabled, and sax-3/Robo as observed in the C. elegans mechanosensory axons. With loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants, I demonstrate daf-2’s role for proper axon guidance and the possibility of daf-2 and vab-1 working together as co-receptors in this process. Finally, I replicate results in the AIY interneurons thus suggesting the AIY interneurons to be a potential model in which to study genetic interactions.</description>

   <description>The gray matter of the higher brain undergoes spreading depolarization in response to ischemia, which increases metabolic demand and so promotes acute neuronal injury. The molecular mechanism linking ischemic failure of the Na+/K+ pump to the subsequent onset of a large inward current in neurons has remained a mystery because blockade of any conventional voltage- or ligand- gated channel does not prevent ischemic or “anoxic” depolarization (AD) propagating across grey matter. Recently our laboratory became aware of a marine poison whose molecular action is well characterized but has escaped scrutiny by neuroscientists.  We hypothesized that this toxin could provide insight as to how ischemia acutely damages neurons at the molecular level.&#xd;
Palytoxin (PTX) specifically binds the Na+/K+ ATPase molecule at nanomolar concentrations, converting it from an ATP-requiring transporter to an open cationic channel. The result is sudden neuronal Na+ influx and K+ efflux. The double jeopardy of pump failure with the induction of a strong inward current should induce dramatic AD-like activity. Using light transmittance (LT) imaging, we show that bath application of 10 nM PTX to live coronal brain slices induces a propagating depolarization at 246±14 s in the neocortex, similar to AD induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) at 289±10 s. In the neocortex, a distinct negative DC shift was recorded as the elevated LT front induced by OGD (4.2±1.0 mV) or PTX (4.1±0.8 mV) passed by an extracellular recording pipette, indicating strong depolarization of cells at the electrode. Both treatments induced strong spreading depolarization in the same higher brain regions and weaker events in lower brain gray matter. We also tested the drugs dibucaine and carbetapentane, which potently delay AD onset induced by OGD. One µM dibucaine pretreatment increased depolarization latency induced by OGD by 44±11 % and PTX by 61±20 % while 30 µM carbetapentane pretreatment increased depolarization latency induced by OGD by 51±16 % and PTX by 129±29 %. All of the above findings support our proposal that, like most biological poisons, palytoxin mimics (and takes advantage of) a natural process. In this case the process is ischemia itself where low ATP conditions might open the Na+/K+ pump to evoke AD and the brain damage that ensues.</description>

   <description>South Africa (SA) is considered to be water scarce under current climatic conditions.  As such, the conservation of water quality is emerging as an increasingly urgent challenge as water resources face a growing number of natural and anthropogenic stressors.  This thesis investigates how citizen science – the involvement of, and action by, everyday citizens in the collection of data and improvement of water resources- might contribute to the conservation of water quality in SA. The thesis used qualitative research methods, including interviews and participant observation.  Mpophomeni Township (within the uMngeni catchment area), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), SA is used as a case study to better understand the role of citizen science in addressing water quality challenges.  Theory U is used as an analytical lens to understand the impact of citizen science as well as the extent to which citizen scientists engage with aspects of social learning and systemic change.  Findings indicate that citizen science promotes empowerment and social learning amongst participants, in addition to fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration (on water quality issues), encouraging the establishment of new environmental connections, and enabling a shift in existing government-citizen power relations.  Additionally, lack of education and awareness along with minimal or non-existent governmental support as key barriers to citizen science, are examined in further detail.</description>

   <description>The developed world now recognizes the long-term implications of climate change on the health of global populations. In 2008, the Canadian Nurses Association and the International Council of Nurses clearly defined the role of the nurse in building community resilience to climate change. The purpose of this study was to explore Ontario public health nurses’ (PHN) knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and actions towards climate change. Data for this cross-sectional study was collected with an online questionnaire. Using the concepts underpinning the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the questionnaire adapted a series of previously developed questions. Descriptive statistics along with comparisons using Kruskal-Wallis H tests and Chi-square statistics were calculated using SPSS®. Logistic Regression was used to explore predictive models for intention to act. The majority of participants agreed that climate change is happening and will have local impacts. Most participants believed that PHNs and local public health agencies (LPHAs) had a responsibility to address climate change but had less agreement about ability and the level of priority given to the issue. Geographic comparisons showed that northern region participants were in less agreement than the central region regarding LPHAs responsibility to address climate change. Liberal leaning participants were more likely to agree that climate change posed a local risk than Conservative leaning participants. However, Conservative leaning participants reported more current action or intention to act on several specific actions related to climate change. Two predictive models examining the effect of TPB components on intention to act demonstrated the best fit: making personal choices that impact climate change, and reducing social inequities that increase vulnerability to climate change. The models, however, did not add a lot of predictive power to the constant.&#xd;
Implications for nursing practice include the need for education about climate change in the nursing curriculum as well training for PHNs in LPHAs on local impacts and health risks related to climate change. The study also informs policy makers and public health leaders about potential roles for PHNs on this emerging issue, their interest in the area and the need for integration of climate change into the Ontario Public Health Standards.</description>

   <title>The Ethics, Feasibility, Opportunities and Challenges of Adopting a Facility Accessibility Design Standard (FADS) for Queen’s University</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Urban &amp; Regional Planning) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-23 09:01:09.963</description>
   <description>This research project seeks out the underlying structural and institutionalized barriers that threaten the development of a Facility Accessibility Design Standard (FADS) for Queen’s University, and focuses on processes as the unit of analysis rather than the content of a FADS itself. In essence, it is the cultural components of campus planning that are examined in depth; why it is that a FADS has been adopted and implemented at only one university in Ontario, Brock University, and what barriers have prevented other institutions and Queen’s from developing one.&#xd;
Because culture is the focus of this research, two literature reviews were conducted to demonstrate how Foucauldian planning theory and the theories of disablement overlap in planning practices that contradict professional planning ethics, but are so entrenched in campus institutions that it becomes difficult to reverse. Furthermore, the research reflects findings from six key informant interviews (four with individuals in decision-making positions at Queen’s and two with individuals who led the FADS development process at Brock), a walking tour of Brock’s campus, a visioning workshop with members of the Queen’s community, and a review of key policy documents. Ultimately, this research concludes that path dependency, a theory of historical sociology, can accurately capture why decision-makers at Queen’s can say inclusivity is important but also possess a reluctance to go above and beyond provincial legislation to become more accessible than is required.&#xd;
A path dependent analysis shows that the process of establishing new, more inclusive culture of accessibility may be emerging at Queen’s, with individuals in leadership positions taking charge. To make this cultural shift more than a possibility and a reality, the following are recommended courses of action: centralizing accessibility into one office for clear leadership, bettering inter-departmental communications with a knowledge transfer guide, and continuing spreading awareness and creating interest in accessibility initiatives on campus. In following these steps, the hope is that Queen’s evolves from a state of individual to institutional readiness to adopt a FADS.</description>

   <description>Signalling mediated by the ubiquitous cellular messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays a central role in numerous cellular processes. Within vascular endothelial cells (VECs), cAMP signalling influences adhesion to extracellular matrix and formation of VE-cadherin cell-junctions, both part of the VECs angiogenic potential. The angiogenic signalling mechanism within VECs is not completely understood. Here we explored how the components of the cAMP signalling cascade, adenylyl cyclase (AC), protein kinase A (PKA), exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), and phosphodiesterase enzymes (PDEs), influence VEC angiogenic potential.&#xd;
&#xd;
Plating human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs; model VECs) on the pro-angiogenic Matrigel in vitro tubule forming assay, we show that treatment of VECs with adenylate cyclase activator forskolin leads to formation of a distinct phenotype. The structures formed are reminiscent of a monolayer and display some features of early tubule formation. This phenotype was not elicited by activating the two effector proteins (PKA and EPAC) individually. Inhibition of EPAC activity hindered VECs’ response to forskolin and resulted in formation of poor structures, occupying significantly less area and showing significantly less branching than controls.&#xd;
&#xd;
Since the selectivity of cAMP-mediated responses is coordinated in part by actions of cAMP at individual VEC cAMP signalling complexes, we investigated the impact of PDEs on tubule formation. We recently showed that EPAC1-integration into a PDE3B-based VEC cAMP signalling complex allows PDE3 inhibitors to activate PI3Kγ and promote VEC adhesion to Matrigel, an early event in tubule formation. EPAC1 integrates into a PDE4D-containing, VEcadherin-based, cAMP signalling complex that allows EPAC1 to control VEC intercellular contacts, but not adhesions. We investigated how PDE4 inhibitors impacted VEC tubule formation and identified distinct roles for each PDE4B and PDE4D in the control of EPAC1-mediated effects in tubule formation and identify potential novel therapeutic strategies to control these angiogenesis-related events.</description>

   <description>School-aged children with diabetes face the need to develop self-care skills while at school and in relation to other educational, parental, and health care agents. This thesis offers a qualitative picture of how eight elementary teachers perceived their caregiving role and corresponding experiences relating to the development of self-care in students with diabetes mellitus (DM) in two provinces: Ontario and New Brunswick. &#xd;
Participants were purposefully recruited from a School District in a mid-sized city in New Brunswick (N = 4) and two Boards of Education in a mid-sized Ontario city (N = 4). Eight teachers who had at least previous experience in caring for a student with diabetes at school participated in a 90-minute, one-on-one, in-depth interview. Employing a Husserlian phenomenological research design and using an iteration of inductive, thematic analysis, the main themes arising from the interviews encompassed: roles and responsibilities, communication, inclusionary practices, and coping with care. &#xd;
Educational, parental, and health care agents in relation with students with diabetes encompass a range of roles and responsibilities at school. With the adoption of official duties of care, these care agents must communicate with each other to circulate health information quickly and effectively and to develop health literacy. However, the movements of health information reflect the implicit motivations of care agents to navigate the school environment according to medical, social, and biopsychosocial notions of disability and forms of inclusive education. As a result, care agents of students with diabetes must choose approaches, steps, and strategies in their practice to help students and themselves cope with diabetes care.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-23 20:08:03.971</description>
   <description>Bullying is a relationship problem defined by a power imbalance between individuals (Mahady-Wilton, Craig, &amp; Pepler, 2000) and intent to inflict harm on another repeatedly and over time (Olweus, 2003). In the context of any relationship, the ability to quickly and accurately recognize others’ emotional states through their facial expressions enables adaptive responding (Izard et al., 2001). While emotions are at the crux of social interaction, the emotional components of the relationship between youth who bully and youth who are victimized have received little attention. No research to date has examined the emotion processes of youth who are repeatedly, or chronically, victimized by their peers. Literature suggests two contrasting explanations for emotion processing in victimized youth: 1) children who are targeted by peer bullying have emotion recognition deficits, and 2) youth who are recurrently victimized by parents show enhancements in identifying specific emotions. The current study assessed which explanation would hold for youth who were chronically victimized by peers by evaluating the emotion recognition abilities of chronically victimized youth as compared to their non-victimized peers. &#xd;
Fifty-two youth (10-14 years, 63.5% female, 23 victimized participants) completed an emotion recognition task. The task was comprised of two segments of 12 expressions each, consisting of happy, sad, scared, angry, disgusted, and surprised faces increasing incrementally from neutral to extreme (Gao &amp; Maurer, 2009). Participants’ speed and accuracy at detecting these emotions were measured.&#xd;
	Results did not support an overall deficit or enhancement for chronically victimized youth. However, despite no overall mean differences in detecting scared and surprised facial expressions, chronically victimized participants showed an improvement across segments as compared to non-victimized participants, whose scores remained consistent across trials. Findings suggest that chronically victimized youth may have a specific enhancement for identifying fear and surprise. The present study contributes to an understanding of emotion processes in youth who experience frequent peer aggression. Studying this initial stage in emotion processing may help to detect early problem behaviours in the bullying dynamic, thus making it possible to provide support to victimized youth before the roles of “victimized child” and “bullying child” become entrenched.</description>

   <title>A short path to a long road: Adult English Language Learners-An exploration of explicit instruction and cognitive vocabulary learning strategies</title>

   <subject>adult ELLs vocabulary explicit instruction</subject>
   <subject>cognitive learning strategies</subject>
   <description>Vocabulary is the backbone of language. According to Nation (2006), an estimated 6000 to 7000 word families are needed to learn to function orally; and roughly 8000 to 9000 word families are needed to comprehend written texts in English. How are English language teachers able to help their learners with overcoming such a burden? Explicit instruction of vocabulary and cognitive vocabulary learning strategies combined is an effective approach explored. Issues surrounding vocabulary learning and effective teaching practices are provided in a literature review and builds upon favourable practices in pursuit of learning and retaining vocabulary through a workshop geared towards adult language instructors as a form of professional development.</description>

   <description>The study of the systematic oscillations of the Sun has led to better understanding&#xd;
of the Sun’s inner structure and dynamics, and may help to resolve inconsistencies&#xd;
between observations and the standard solar model. Recent studies have concluded&#xd;
that solar modal structure remains coherent past turbulence in the convection zone&#xd;
and imprints its signatures on the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field&#xd;
fluctuations, and these structures are coherent with atmospheric pressure variations,&#xd;
terrestrial seismic oscillations, and data from communications systems. Time series&#xd;
containing modal structure can be expected to contain several thousands of resolved&#xd;
and unresolved line components in very short bands in frequency, and the measure-&#xd;
ment of these modes pushes spectrum estimation methods for time series to its limit.&#xd;
This thesis presents two theoretical contributions for modeling solar oscillations in&#xd;
power spectra (i) expressions for the expected number and shape of significant spuri-&#xd;
ous peaks in spectrum estimates are given, in the absence of modal structure, and a&#xd;
permutation test for the identification of spectra containing pathological numbers of&#xd;
modal components. (ii) A model for maximum likelihood estimation of the solar os-&#xd;
cillation parameters in composite spectra is given. The scientific contributions of this&#xd;
thesis are (a) identification of highly significant modal artifacts in solar wind mea-&#xd;
surements as seen by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) on the 2 − 3mHz&#xd;
band and (b) quantification of the presence of modal structure in secondary cosmic&#xd;
rays (specifically neutrons) on Earth.</description>

   <description>In an era of greater accountability and fiscal responsibility in higher education, there has been an urgent need for student affairs divisions to evaluate programs and to use findings to inform policy and practice. The purpose of this study was to understand how student affairs professionals conceptualize both the role and practice of evaluation in their work, and the extent to which internal evaluation might be useful as a method of systematic inquiry for program and organizational improvement. This study used the emergent design principles of grounded theory to elucidate how staff and administrators at Queen’s University have applied evaluation practices to understand the programs that support the co-curricular learning and development of post-secondary students. The findings revealed the experiences and perceptions of eight participants from stakeholder groups at various levels of the organizational structure, including those who had direct responsibility for a program and those who had decision-making authority. Participants were under increasing pressure to demonstrate program effectiveness and outcomes. This new requirement for evidence-informed decision-making and continuous improvement provided a strong basis for internal evaluation. Although the participants were starting to measure the quality and impact of programs using performance metrics, they alluded to a movement towards developing a systematic approach to inquiry; establishing the purposes of evaluative inquiry; utilizing, applying, and disseminating findings; and overcoming challenges. This study offers insight into how student affairs divisions can bring evaluative thinking from internal resources and have these resources strategically focused on organizational learning and development. Future research should investigate the ethical complexities of an embedded internal evaluation function.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-24 16:27:05.593</description>
   <description>Research has identified fluency as a central component of skilled reading and as a skill that should be a driving force in the literacy curricula (Kuhn, Schwanenflugel &amp; Meisinger, 2010). Learning to read, teaching children how to read and researching the best way to teach children to be fluent readers is a multifaceted, elaborate process. The purpose of this study was to explore the ways in which teachers conceptualize reading fluency through interviews. Exploration through a qualitative study provided insights into how seven grade four and grade five Eastern Ontario teachers understand reading fluency. All teachers were found to characterize fluency as primarily reading speed and were found to share the belief that improvement in reading fluency was attributed to the amount of time a reader spent reading a variety of texts. The most prominent finding that emerged from the data was teachers' perception that comprehension should be the instructional focus for junior readers. &#xd;
Discussions with teachers provided insights into reading fluency that enabled the construction of a more detailed picture of classroom reading fluency and instruction in Ontario. The complex task of teaching reading fluency has not been a central topic in pre- and in-service teacher training in Ontario. This study provides an enhanced picture of classroom reading fluency instruction that may lead to opportunities for future professional development specifically designed around reading fluency instruction and best practice.</description>

   <description>Two poly[3-(triisopropyloxysilyl)propyl methacrylate]-block-poly[2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl methacrylate] (PIPSMA-b-PFOEMA or P1-1/P1-2) samples and one poly(perfluoropropylene oxide)-block-poly-[3-triisopropyloxysilyl)propyl methacrylate] (PFPO-b-PIPSMA, or P2) sample were synthesized, characterized, and used to coat glass plates. The coatings were formed by evaporating a dilute copolymer solution containing an HCl catalyst to facilitate the sol-gel chemistry of the PIPSMA blocks. To minimize polymer consumption, we targeted diblock copolymer unimolecular (brush) layers that consisted of a sol-gelled PIPSMA sub-layer that was anchored onto the glass plates, and a fluorinated surface layer that provided the desired water and oil repellency. A systematic study was performed examining the effect of varying the catalyst amount, the polymer amount, and the block copolymer composition on the structure, morphology, and water- and oil- repellency of the coatings. The amphiphobicity of the coatings improved initially with the amount of grafted polymer, but plateaued once a saturated brush layer was formed. Furthermore, the static contact angles (SCAs) increased as the relative length between the PFOEMA and PIPSMA blocks increased. All of the coatings were optically clear and repelled ink from a permanent Sharpie® marker. The markings that were left behind were the faintest on the P2 coatings as the ink would instantaneously shrink into patches. In addition, the P2 coatings exhibited far better wear-resistance than the P1-1/P1-2 coatings.

   <description>We consider the joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem where the real valued outputs of two correlated memoryless Gaussian sources are scalar quantized, bit assigned, and transmitted, without applying any error correcting code, over a multiple access channel (MAC) which consists of two orthogonal point-to-point time-correlated Rayleigh fading sub-channels with soft-decision demodulation. At the receiver side, a joint sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector is used to exploit the correlation between the two sources as well as the redundancy left in the quantizers' indices, the channel's soft-decision outputs, and noise memory. The MAC's sub-channels are modeled via non-binary Markov noise discrete channels recently shown to effectively represent point-to-point fading channels. Two scenarios are studied. In the first scenario, the sources are memoryless and generated according to a bivariate Gaussian distribution with a given correlation parameter. In the second scenario, the sources have memory captured by a changing correlation parameter governed by a two state first order Markov process.&#xd;
&#xd;
In each scenario, for the simple case of quantizing the sources with two levels, we establish a necessary and a sufficient condition under which the joint sequence MAP decoder can be reduced to a simple instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder. Then, using numerical results obtained by system simulation, the theorems are illustrated and it is also verified that JSCC can harness the correlation between sources, redundancies in the source symbols, and statistics of the channel noise to achieve improved signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance. For example, when the memoryless sources are highly correlated and soft-decision quantization is used, JSCC can profit from high correlation in the channel noise process and provide significant SDR gains of up to 6.3 dB over a fully interleaved channel.</description>

   <description>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is one of the most common musculoskeletal conditions resulting in disability. The incidence of knee OA increases with age and will likely increase further as the population becomes more obese and less physically active. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were 1) to observe whether self-reported disability should be obtained before or after performance-based tests, 2) to assess changes in knee pain and observe whether symptoms of depression predict worsening of knee pain, quality of life (QoL) and increased need for surgery and, 3) to examine changes in quadriceps muscle strength and knee pain after isokinetic muscle testing. &#xd;
In the first study, disability was measured using the WOMAC scores. Results indicated that all WOMAC scores were significantly higher after as compared to before the completion of performance-based tests and a physiologic test (VO2Peak). Obese individuals with knee OA were significantly worse compared to non-obese individuals with knee OA on all WOMAC scores. &#xd;
In the second study, the WOMAC pain subscale and VAS pain were significantly higher after as compared to before the completion of performance-based tests. The VAS ratings captured a significant increase in pain in both groups, but the WOMAC pain subscale only captured a significant change in the obese OA group. Depressive symptoms and BMI explained a significant proportion of variance in knee pain, quality of life and perceived need for surgery.&#xd;
The third study indicated that isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength was significantly different between obese and non-obese individuals with knee OA and compared to a healthy control group at all angular velocities of 60°/s, 90°/s and 120°/s, with the obese OA group demonstrating the lowest peak torque at all angular velocities. However, it was only at 60°/s that the isokinetic peak torque showed a statistically significant difference between the obese and the non-obese groups with knee OA. Likewise, knee pain increased from before to after isokinetic muscle strength testing, but only at the angular velocity of 60°/s. &#xd;
This thesis provides new information regarding the effect of obesity on self-reported disability, knee pain, depressive symptoms and quadriceps muscle strength in knee OA.</description>

   <description>Excess accumulation of intrahepatic fat (IHF) is directly involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To our knowledge, no prior groups have examined the inter-relationship between diet quantity, macronutrient composition, physical activity (PA), and IHF. The objective of the enclosed thesis is to investigate the associations of simultaneously measured objective PA and dietary intake in relation to IHF.&#xd;
The Liver Fat Study was conducted on middle-aged, abdominally obese, inactive men (n=4) and women (n=20) between the ages of 40 and 70 years old. Participants were instructed to record their food intake and wear an accelerometer for objective measurement of PA for 7 days. Thereafter, insulin resistance was assessed by HOMA-IR using fasting insulin and glucose, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was measured by a graded exercise treadmill test, abdominal adiposity was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), anthropometrics were measured by waist circumference (WC) and BMI, and IHF was measured by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS).&#xd;
While none of the dietary intake (quantity or macronutrient composition) or PA variables were significantly associated with IHF (p>0.05), CRF, WC, visceral adipose tissue (AT), and HOMA-IR were associated with IHF (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, sedentary time, light PA and total PA approached statistical significance with visceral AT, while both light PA and total PA were significantly associated with WC (p&lt;0.05).&#xd;
The findings from this study suggest that all components of PA, while not directly associated with IHF, are indirectly associated with IHF through its influence on abdominal obesity. This finding emphasizes the importance of PA, separate from the national guidelines, as a treatment target for clinicians.</description>

   <title>An Examination into Bullying in the Adolescent Sport Context</title>

   <description>Bullying is a prominent issue facing youth, as approximately one-fifth of students report being victimized.  The majority of bullying research has been conducted in the academic setting; however, roughly one-third of bullying episodes occur outside of this context, for instance in sport.  Sport is one of the most common activities with which youth participate, and initial evidence suggests that bullying occurs in physical-activity settings.  Literature investigating bullying in the sport context has mainly focused on examining subsets of athletes within sport, for instance, female athletes, without examining differences across genders and other demographic contrasts.  Thus, the present study aimed to identify the frequency of bullying, the demographic differences that exist in sport, and examine the impact that bullying has on an athlete’s development.  Questionnaires were used to examine athletes’ frequency of bully-perpetration and –victimization encounters, athletic competence, global self-worth, connection to coach, and connection to teammates.  The results from the present study suggest that bullying occurred more frequently in male athletes, and for team sport athletes.  In addition, victimization predicts a reduction in global self-worth, connection to coach, and connection to teammates.  These results provide a foundation to further explore demographic differences in sport, and presents initial findings regarding the impact of the bullying experience on adolescent athlete development.</description>

   <title>The Role of Stat3 in Adipocytic Differentiation</title>

   <description>Cellular proliferation is often regulated in conjunction with differentiation.  It is important to investigate the mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation and proliferation, because defects in their control can promote neoplastic transformation.  3T3L1 preadipocytes provide a good cell culture model to study differentiation, since they differentiate into fat pads when injected into nude mice.  Previous data have suggested that Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (Stat3) is activated during 3T3L1 differentiation, and may be directly promoting adipogenesis.  However, our lab recently demonstrated that engagement of cadherins, as occurs during confluence of cultured cells, triggers a dramatic surge in Stat3 activity, constituting a potent survival signal.  Since confluence-mediated, growth arrest is a prerequisite for adipocytic differentiation, the question arises as to the role of Stat3 in adipocytic differentiation of 3T3L1 cells.  This work has shown that levels of Stat3 activity increase in 3T3L1 cells, with or without the induction of differentiation.  Nevertheless, Stat3 activation was, in fact, higher in differentiating cells compared to control preadipocytes at the same density, and correlated with expression of adipocyte binding protein 2 (aP2), indicating that Stat3 may play a role in differentiation.  3T3L1 cells expressing the constitutively active Stat3C protein displayed moderate increases in differentiation compared to parental 3T3L1 cells.  Inhibition of Stat3 with CPA7 at confluence blocked the onset of differentiation, and caused both control and differentiating cells to undergo apoptosis, while inhibition of Stat3 after differentiation was induced had no distinct effect. These results point to the possibility that besides its potential role in differentiation, Stat3 plays an important role in survival of differentiating 3T3L1 preadipocytes.</description>

   <description>Listening for sound and noise in Montréal during the late 1960s and early 1970s, this dissertation adds a sonic perspective to historical understanding of the later years of Québec’s “Quiet Revolution.” Guided by aurality rather than visuality, and arguing implicitly for the inclusion of sound in historical methodology, this project puts noise and silence – both literal and figurative – at the centre of the question: What does it mean to call the great transformation of Québec from 1965 to 1975 a “Quiet Revolution”?&#xd;
Exploring the auditory atmosphere of what was a cacophonous and dissonant decade, this thesis analyses Montréal’s urban soundscape, music, language, and acts of silencing. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the work is informed by theories culled from existing works on sense history, sound studies, and Québec and Canadian historiography. Via the practice of “agile listening,” the dissertation seeks to re-create a sense of Montréal’s sonic environment between 1965 and 1975.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I examine the nature of egalitarian theories of distributive justice and their applicability to the global realm. I begin by laying out why it is that equality matters and how it is that we ought to understand egalitarianism as a doctrine. In response to a series of objections to the aim of distributive equality, I maintain that we have strong reasons to value equality above and beyond simply ensuring that people have enough, and that the egalitarian aim properly conceived does not involve perverse consequences. I subsequently extend this understanding of the value of economic equality to the global context, and argue that the objectionable relations of power and domination that exist internationally point to the need to limit global inequalities. Finally, I conclude my discussion by forwarding a more in-depth account of the grounds of egalitarian justice, and by examining two internally egalitarian objections to global egalitarianism. Both of these objections, I argue, are most plausibly understood as entailing an expansion of egalitarian concern to the global realm. Given that the global economic order generates the conditions under which duties of egalitarian justice are triggered, I conclude that the proper scope of egalitarian justice is global.</description>

   <description>The work presented herein focused on the preparation of CO2 switchable poly(methyl methacrylate) latexes by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. N,N-Dimethylaminoethyl Methacrylate (DMAEMA) was chosen as the functional comonomer to act as an in-situ generated surface active agent as well as the CO2 responsive agent. The azo initiator 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride (VA-044) also partially contributed to both the stabilization and the CO2 switchability. DMAEMA was first protonated by HCl during the emulsion polymerization to prevent hydrolysis and enhance DMAEMA partitioning into the water phase. Two switching on/off cycles were conducted to the latex obtained from the surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. The first switching-off cycle was carried out by NaOH neutralization, followed by simple CO2 purging for redispersion. Full recovery of particle size and distribution, solids content and latex stability was achieved within 5 min of applying the triggers. The second switching cycle was carried out by alternating N2/CO2 purging. Sonication was not needed in each switching-on process (a significant and important improvement over previous work in the Cunningham and Jessop groups).  A ratio of VA-044:DMAEMA within the range of 1:8~1:2, a minimum overall N% (NDMAEMA+NVA-044) at 1% and a maximum solids content at 20% were the required conditions in order to make latex successfully recover from two switching cycles. Systematic particle size manipulation was carried out by varying temperature, VA-044:DMAEMA ratio and solids content. A wide size range 170~500 nm was achieved, allowing for multiple potential applications.</description>

   <description>This study investigated processes underlying the relation between executive functioning and false belief knowledge in preschool-aged children. The primary goal was to test the theory that executive functioning skills equip children with the cognitive tools necessary for experience-driven social conceptual change. To explore this possibility, 3.5-year-old children were recruited to participate in a longitudinal study that involved two study phases. During the initial phase, children were assessed on their false belief understanding and executive functioning skills, as well as abilities that served as relevant control variables (e.g., vocabulary skills). Two types of naturalistic experiences that relate to false belief development were also measured: parent mental state talk and having child-aged siblings. Six months later, families returned to the lab for the second phase of testing, and all measures were re-administered. Analyses examining concurrent relations among measures showed that at both study phases, there was an interactive effect of executive functioning skills and relevant experience on concurrent false belief task performance. This general pattern of results persisted—albeit in a weaker form—when controlling for consistency in executive functioning skills over time, age, vocabulary skills, and initial theory-of-mind knowledge. Longitudinal analyses revealed that there was an interactive effect of early executive functioning skills and experience on false belief understanding 6 months later, and these effects remained strong and significant when controlling for the relevant variables listed above. Moreover, the reverse longitudinal interactive effect—of later executive functioning and experience on early false belief knowledge—was not significant. Overall, effect sizes associated with the predicted longitudinal interaction were substantially larger than those associated with concurrent interactions. This study’s longitudinal findings offer support for the hypothesis that executive functioning skills influence children’s ability to use relevant experience in the service of false belief concept development. Further, the concurrent pattern of findings suggests that executive functioning skills are also recruited for actively reasoning about other minds in the moment, when children are faced with false-belief-reasoning situations. Alternative theories are discussed, with emphasis placed on taking an integrated theoretical approach to effectively characterize the effects of executive functioning on false-belief reasoning.</description>

   <description>Copper wire mediated controlled living radical polymerization (CLRP) is a powerful tool that provides numerous opportunities for the development of new materials. It requires low catalyst loading and mild reaction conditions, but does involve use of organic solvents. There is a need for greener solvent systems to replace traditional volatile organic solvents without detrimentally affecting polymerization. The effects of greener solvents on control over polymerization and polymer characteristics were investigated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) for copper wire mediated CLRP. Polymerization of low molecular weight poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) with bromine chain-end functionality was initiated by ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (EBiB). Two effective green solvent systems were established, 75-25 PEG-Ethanol and 75-25 PPG-Ethanol. Both provide good control over polymerization, livingness, narrow dispersity (~1.1), high retention of chain-end functionality (>90%), and can be recycled, which should be considered for an industrial scale implementation. &#xd;
Furthermore, utilization of a bromine chain-end functionality of synthetic homopolymer (PMA) synthesized via copper wire mediated CLRP with EBiB was evaluated for grafting to cellulose substrates, microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose acetate. Cellulose was functionalized with thiol groups using ring opening reaction with ethylene sulfide. The grafting via thio-bromo click reaction was investigated, where grafting of EBiB was performed first to evaluate the reaction and then repeated with PMA. One-pot and two-pot reactions were performed. In one-pot reaction, functionalization of cellulose and grafting were performed in the same reaction solution to avoid exposure of thiols to oxygen. In a two-pot reaction, functionalized cellulose was purified before grafting. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis showed that grafting of EBiB had low degree of substitution (DS) of 0.026 (1 unit per 39 AGU units), whereas grafting of polymer chains to cellulose substrate was not successful.</description>

   <title>Genetic Analysis and Post Translational Modifications of Type IV pili in Methanococcus Maripaludis</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-25 23:28:47.124</description>
   <description>Methanococcus maripaludis has two different surface appendages that are considered to be type IV pili-like structures: the well-studied archaella as well as type IV pili. Though prevalent among various archaea, studies on type IV pili in any archaeon are extremely limited. In this thesis, many novel essential components necessary for type IV pili formation in M. maripaludis have been identified by gene deletion analysis coupled with electron microscopy. Several of these essential components were found in a previously identified eleven gene locus (mmp0231-mmp0241) containing three previously identified pilin-like genes and a prepilin peptidase. The genes in this locus were shown in this work, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments, to be arranged in a single operon. The remaining unstudied genes, except for mmp0231, were deleted and, with the exception of mmp0235 and mmp0238, found to be essential for piliation. Outside this locus, the conserved assembly ATPase (mmp0040; epdL) and, unusually, two tandem versions of the conserved type IV pilus platform protein (mmp0038 and mmp0039; epdJ and epdK) were identified. All three were shown to be essential for piliation. Furthermore, the gene encoding the major pilin structural protein (mmp1685; epdE) was identified at a separate locus. In addition, six other pilin-like genes (mmp0528, mmp0600, mmp0601, mmp0709, mmp0903, mmp1283) scattered around the genome were targeted for deletion, with electron microscopy of the individual deletion strains revealing that normal piliation was only affected when mmp1283 (epdD) was missing, suggesting it was a fourth minor pilin. Lastly, studies were conducted to examine the order of the two posttranslational modifications of pilins and archaellins. While it was determined that signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation of archaellins could occur independently of each other, this was not the case for pilins. Detection of epitope-tagged pilins expressed in various mutant backgrounds unable to carry out one, the other, or both posttranslational modifications, strongly suggested that pilins cannot be N-glycosylated unless the signal peptide is first removed. These studies reveal that the type IV pili of M. maripaludis are more complex than those of other studied archaea and also raise questions about how the cell is able to distinguish between the two types of type IV-pilin-like proteins, archaellins and pilins.</description>

   <description>Participatory artworks, despite the efforts of artists and theorists alike, remain commodifiable, highly profitable, and ultimately support the conception of the artist as a singular genius. These works must negotiate the paradoxes and contradictions that are inherent to their production, exhibition and dissemination. I believe that artists, participants, critics, curators and historians will be in a better position to negotiate the contradiction of participatory art once a critical intervention in the discourse has occurred—an intervention that would illuminate the fact of paradoxes, analyze the content of these paradoxes, and recognize the conditions from which such paradoxes necessarily emerge. &#xd;
       The aim of this thesis is to provide evidence of specific paradoxes that exist within the conception, display, marketing, and dissemination of participatory art with the hope of shedding light on the ways that participatory art is mythologized and typically represented within a narrow set of art historical paradigms. Ultimately this thesis suggests tactics for the presentation and discussion of participatory art that will acknowledge these paradoxes and provide an accurate presentation of participatory art’s processes. &#xd;
       My analysis rests on two case studies: Marina Abramović’s The Artist is Present, 2010, and Hélio Oiticica’s Parangolés, 1965. Abramović’s The Artist is Present consisted of Abramović sitting at a table for 8 hours a day at the New York Museum of Modern Art, from March 14 until May 31, 2010. Hélio Oiticica’s Parangolés, is a series of colourful capes and costumes that were inspired and worn by the samba dancers of the Rio de Janeiro shantytown of Mangueira, as a means of freeing colour from the plane of the canvas. &#xd;
	This thesis articulates the ways in which art historians and theorists construct Abramović’s biography to support the notion of a singular artistic genius, while maintaining Abramović’s connection to collaborative art practices. It addresses the meaning of objects that are the byproduct of participatory works; the profitability of participatory art; the ways in which participatory art is historicized and subsumed by art institutions; and the apparent incongruity of Parangolés being attributed to a single author, despite the many types of labour required in its creation.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
	Currently 7 billion humans rely on the Earth’s depleting natural resources, and the Earth’s population is projected to increase to 9 billion by 2045 (UN Population predictions, 2010). We are now a human race that is predominately urban. Our human-centric behaviours and patterns of living are having a major impact on the natural world; in response, educational and environmental researchers have called for a reorganization in education to better reflect our urban age and the changing cultural and environmental mosaic. Educating for sustainability is of increasing importance as we become more aware that we are facing an urgent need to repair our fractured relationship with the earth and with one another. Sustainable models of education are related to place and how our way of life can support human activity. In a sustainable school, the campus and community are extensions of the classroom. &#xd;
	This study is guided by three questions: (a) How does a public school curriculum that extends beyond the classroom foster a deep love and knowledge of place in children’s education and prepare students to meet contemporary challenges? (b) How do teachers enact sustainability education in public education, amid a standards-based curriculum? (c) What enduring and systemic structures enable publicly funded schools to participate in a curricular process that engages students and the community? Data were collected from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with five teachers and two administrators, from three successful, publicly funded schools. Other forms of data included onsite and virtual observations, via website webcams, artifact analysis using schools blogs, Facebook posts, school newsletters, student work and teaching materials; as well, photographs were used to support observations and field notes. This study describes how sustainability education and place-based programs can be successfully developed in the standards-based era. The findings highlight important themes related to curriculum as process, real-world learning, student agency, community partnerships, and collaborative leadership.</description>

   <description>Cardiorespiratory Fitness (CRF) classically measured by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality. However, there is substantial inter-individual variation in CRF response with exercise training. Several lines of evidence suggest that the measurement of CRF using VO2peak alone may be masking some of the submaximal cardiorespiratory adaptations, such as exercise tolerance, that occur as a result of regular physical activity. Our goal is to assess the relationship between changes in CRF and exercise tolerance in inactive men of varying age.&#xd;
We studied 25 inactive men between the ages of 30 and 60 years ([mean (SD)] age = 44.3 (9.1)) from Kingston, Canada. Participants completed 4 weeks of moderate intensity exercise in accordance with the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines. All measurements were obtained at baseline and post exercise. CRF was assessed using a maximal, graded treadmill test.  Exercise tolerance was assessed using a 12 minute time trial on a treadmill, where participants were instructed to cover as much distance as possible through self-selection of speed.  Twenty four hour physical activity data was obtained at baseline and during the final week of exercise using accelerometry. In a secondary analysis, we compared the changes in exercise tolerance between responders and non-responders of CRF.&#xd;
Both CRF and exercise tolerance improved significantly over the intervention. There was no association between absolute CRF values and exercise tolerance at baseline or post exercise. Relative CRF showed a strong association with exercise tolerance at baseline and post exercise, r = 0.85 and r = 0.75, respectively (p&lt;0.05).  However, there was no association between changes in CRF and exercise tolerance (p >0.05).  Furthermore, there was no difference in change in exercise tolerance when comparing responders to non-responders of CRF (p > 0.05). &#xd;
Alternative measures of fitness such as exercise tolerance may capture cardiovascular and muscle metabolic adaptations not seen when CRF alone is measured. As such, these alternative measures may be of clinical relevance in assessing changes in fitness in conjunction with CRF, which has been well-established as a key risk factor of all-cause morbidity and mortality.</description>

   <description>Thin film Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 has been deposited onto printed circuit boards at low temperatures for low and high frequency applications. The fabrication method involves spin coating sol-gel composites (a mixture of BST powder suspended in an amorphous BST sol), and treating the resultant films at 175°C. The treatment is done in an autoclave in an aqueous environment comprised of barium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide, and water, and is carried out at elevated temperature and pressure. This causes the amorphous BST sol to recrystallize, forming bridges that link the BST powders together, creating a dense network, leading to a higher dielectric constant. Three different types of powders have been explored for the composite. They are low-temperature derived, ceramic derived, and sol-gel derived powder. Low-temperature derived powders are the smallest in size, in the nanometer range. Due to such small sizes, the ferroelectric properties are lost, leading to no tunability and very low dielectric constant. The permittivity ranges from 30 to 55. Sol-gel derived powders are very reactive to the hydrothermal process. The resultant film permittivity is the highest, ranging from 200 to 260, but with a limited tunability of 1%. Ceramic derived powders are compatible with the process. The permittivity is less than that of sol-gel derived, with values from 130 to 140, but the tunability ranges from 4 to 8% at low frequencies (500 kHz to 20 MHz). For high frequency characterization (45 MHz to 1.15 GHz), films containing ceramic derived powder are deposited onto grounded coplanar waveguide capacitors. The dielectric constant significantly reduced, reaching as low as 18, but tunability increased to 18%.</description>

   <description>Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic bacterium found ubiquitously in Nature, including as a member of the human gut microbiome, that under normal conditions asymptomatically colonizes the distal gut. However, it is also an opportunistic pathogen, and is the principal cause of gas gangrene and necrotic enteritis, and represents a leading cause of foodborne illnesses. C. perfringens produces a battery of secreted carbohydrate-active enzymes called glycoside hydrolases whose activities suggest that their substrates are complex eukaryotic glycans, such as those found in the mucosal layer of the gut. A striking feature of these enzymes is their large size and extensive modularity. The additional functions conferred by their non-catalytic ancillary modules, which include family 32 carbohydrate binding modules (CBM32), are thought to increase catalytic activity and as such are proposed to play a critical role in glycan degradation. Two of the largest and most architecturally complex of these enzymes in C. perfringens are GH31 and GH84A, which contain multiple CBM32s and several other ancillary modules. Very little structural or functional information is know regarding these enzymes, particularly with respect to glycan recognition, the role of ancillary modules, and overall structural topology. We have employed a multi-disciplinary “dissect-and-build” approach to characterize the molecular determinants of carbohydrate binding by CBM32s, and global glycan recognition by full-length C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases.&#xd;
Various X-ray and NMR structures of CpGH31 and CpGH84A CBM32s, both in apo form and in complex with galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, reveal several novel modes of recognition of common mucin O-glycan monosaccharides by these modules. These results highlight that the prediction of CBM32 binding partners based primarily on sequence is insufficient, as important residue conformations required for substrate specificity cannot be predicted based solely on amino acid sequence.&#xd;
The full-length solution structure of CpGH84A was determined using SAXS-based techniques. CpGH84A adopts an elongated conformation spanning 320 Å in length, and contains a single central hinge region that facilitates conformational heterogeneity of this enzyme in solution. These results&#xd;
iii&#xd;
provide unprecedented insights into the three-dimensional arrangement of the catalytic and ancillary modules, the latter of which contribute several functions, including carbohydrate recognition and glycan degradation.</description>

   <description>This qualitative study aimed to understand how new secondary school teachers (in years 0-5) approach the teaching of adolescent females in their physical education classes. As there is a significantly greater decline in the enrollment of adolescent females participating in physical education compared to males once the choice to participate becomes elective, Physical and Health Education (PHE) teachers are challenged in their teaching and assessment practice to motivate adolescent girls. Eight PHE teachers (four female, four male) were interviewed about their approaches in physical education classes with a particular emphasis on their interactions with adolescent girls. These teachers relied largely on their cumulative life experiences prior to entering teacher education to structure their classrooms. While these PHE teachers had some understanding about adolescent girl behaviour within their classrooms, they were not deliberate in their teaching and assessment practices for this population. They tended to view their practices through a gender-neutral lens (“gender blindness”), while holding gender stereotypes about motivations of girls and boys. The findings from the study highlight the complexity of addressing the needs of adolescent girls in PHE, and the importance of developing intervention strategies so that research may be disseminated to new PHE teachers and implemented in their classes to effect change.</description>

   <description>Mobile app stores are online stores where users can purchase and download mobile apps. The marketplace for apps has exploded over recent years with hundreds of thousands of apps, millions of dollars in revenue and millions of users. Mobile app stores offer unique distribution and feedback mechanisms. The distribution mechanism of app stores acts as a central repository for all apps with an option to automatically update apps on user's devices. The feedback mechanism of app stores is a central rating and review system for all apps in a store. Consequently, there is a need for research to explore such unique mechanisms. In this thesis, we analyze over 10,000 of the top free apps across all the app categories in the Google Play Store. We first examine the distribution mechanisms of app stores and its impact on the release speed of apps. We then study the feedback mechanism of app stores to observe how it allows for a large influx of reviews and the benefits of responding to reviews. Finally, we propose an approach to automatically label reviews to help cope with the large influx of reviews by summarizing them.&#xd;
&#xd;
In regards to the unique distribution mechanism, we observe that a subset of apps release very frequently - more than one release per week. Almost half of these apps do not provide users with a rationale for a new release. Developers are leveraging the distribution mechanism by choosing to rapidly release new versions of their app.&#xd;
&#xd;
In regards to the unique feedback mechanism, we find that most apps do not receive many reviews, however, approximately 1% of apps receive over 500 reviews per day. We find that responding to reviews can lead to a positive increase in the rating of the app. The feedback mechanism enables users to give rapid and rich feedback.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, we propose an approach to label user reviews automatically using 14 different labels that capture the user's perceived quality of an app. We demonstrate the usefulness of our labelling approach through three different analytics use case scenarios: competitive analysis, app store overview and anomaly detection.</description>

   <title>Forensic Outlier Detection and Penalty Analysis To Regulate Cognitive Radio Network</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-26 21:39:14.262</description>
   <description>Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) has emerged as a promising solution to the pseudo scarcity of the spectral congestion problem. In a CRN, the new/Secondary Users (SUs), are allowed to access the spectrum in such a way that the existing/Primary Users (PUs) experience limited interference. As such, SUs cooperatively sense the PU signal and share the spectrum only when the PU is absent. However, such cooperation raises new concerns for security and reliability. This is because abuser SUs may report unreliable/falsified sensing data to influence the cooperative decision for personal gain (e.g., gaining unfair access to the spectrum or inflicting interference). To date, most of the CRN research has mainly focused on developing efficient cooperative sensing algorithms. Much less attention has been paid to information security issues associated with the sensing. Sufficient scientific input is required to develop proper spectrum security policy, otherwise entirely new security threats will impact CRNs' ability to become a long-term commercially-viable concept.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we consider a CRN wherein SUs report their sensing decisions to a fusion center for cooperative spectrum sensing. We consider the presence of an abuser SU in the CRN and adopt forensic analysis of the reports for outlier identification. We first assume that the behavioral category of the outlier is known and propose optimal and suboptimal detectors specific to each category. The proposed detectors significantly outperform the state-of-the art detectors and are robust against system parameter variation. Then we consider a CRN where the presence as well as behavioral category of the outlier is unknown. We propose practical algorithms that identify outlier SU's behavioral category. In addition, to regulate the outlier SUs, we introduce the concept of penalizing the outliers proportionally to the crime. Then we propose an algorithm that calculates the punishment (upon identification of an outlier) according to its type and forces it to behave legitimately. The proposed algorithms are robust against variations in system parameters. The proposed detectors and algorithms can be used by government agencies for forensic testing in policy control methodology to regulate CRN abusers.</description>

   <description>Chile’s ill-fated attempt to build a democratic socialism (1970-1973) was a defining moment for the global New Left. Nowhere was this truer than in Québec. During the Allende years and after, Chile exercised a decisive influence on the political imagination of Québécois radicals, as they searched for a path to socialisme et indépendance. Prior to the 11 September 1973 coup d’état, countless activists travelled to the South American nation to witness – and to learn from – the “Chilean road to socialism.” Arguments about Allende’s socialist government and the subsequent U.S.-backed coup that overthrew him were woven into left political discourse in the province, influencing labour movement debates over the formation of a parti des travailleurs, colouring campaign rhetoric during the October 1973 provincial elections, and serving as a trump card in post-election struggles within the Parti québécois (PQ) over the strategy of étapisme. Allende’s fate even lingered on in the minds of René Lévesque and many other party leaders after the election of the first PQ government in 1976. The Québec left’s deep engagement with Chile was a major factor in the rise of the Marxist-Leninist movement, convincing many activists that attaining socialism by parliamentary means was impossible in a U.S.-dominated world. Allende’s rise and tragic fall was key to the process of polarization that occurred on the Québec left from 1968 to 1974. As this thesis demonstrates, our understanding of Québec’s politics in these years is enriched greatly through a combined transnational and imperial approach.</description>

   <title>Using Trait Self-Distancing to Predict Affective States</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-27 20:30:10.891</description>
   <description>Research has shown that prompting individuals to examine their experiences while assuming the perspective of a third-person, which is called self-distancing, buffers against negative emotional changes. Self-distancing and its conceptual opposite, self-immersion, have been previously studied as induced and spontaneously occurring states. I argue that the perspective that one takes when engaging in self-focus can be understood as a personality trait. Two studies are reported where I construct and evaluate the Self-Distancing Scale (SDS), which is a self-report measure of trait self-distancing. In Study 1 I found that evidence for construct validity of the SDS was poor. I further found that, contrary to expectations, exploratory factor analysis of the draft pool of SDS items revealed two unrelated factors corresponding to self-distancing and self-immersion, rather than a single bipolar factor. Study 2 examined if the SDS could be used to prospectively predict emotional change under standardized laboratory conditions, but contrary to what is suggested by prior research, the SDS was not found to be significantly related to emotional change. A post hoc confirmatory factor analysis identified methodological sources of variance as the cause of the SDS’s two factor structure. I offer suggestions for future research that could further investigate trait self-distancing without the limitations of the current studies.</description>

   <description>In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in Perceptual Intuitionism. A significant portion of the literature on the topic has focused on the ethical perception defense, the supposition seeming to be that one must defend Perceptual Intuitionism by showing that one can have ethical experiences which immediately and non-inferentially justify one’s beliefs about the rightness or wrongness of particular actions. This thesis rejects this thought by proposing an alternative defense of Perceptual Intuitionism which employs the Wittgensteinian concept of criteria and an understanding of principles of prima facie duties as “grammatical propositions”.</description>

   <description>Since the origin of the IT executive role in organizations, IS researchers have attempted to understand the barriers that Chief Information Officers (CIOs) face in their efforts to realize IT business value. One such challenge is the apparent disconnect between the growing importance of information technology to the success of organizations and the relegation of CIOs to tactical rather than strategic roles in their organizations, thereby hindering the transformative power of IT as a competitive advantage. This dissertation tackles this disconnect suggesting that CIOs are caught up within a widely-shared and entrenched stereotype of IT professionals that views them as lacking leadership competencies. Specifically, this dissertation puts forward the claim that CIOs may face a glass ceiling (similar to minority groups) and that stereotypical beliefs limit (if not deny) them the opportunity to drive the organization forward in the use of IT. &#xd;
Four studies examined the content of these beliefs held by perceivers outside the IT profession and identified the contexts within which these beliefs can cause biased decision-making concerning the role of CIOs. Taken as a whole, this dissertation empirically tests the long-held anecdotal assumption of a CIO stereotype and identifies biases that can cause inequality perceptions at strategic levels of the organization; specifically, the perception of CIOs as "the last among equals" or as unequal members of the C-suite appears to limit their strategic involvement in corporate decision-making. This research contributes to the study of IT leadership and advances our understanding of the persistent 'perception gap' that has intrigued (and plagued) IS researchers and practitioners for a long time.</description>

   <description>Pregnancy is characterized by a state of heightened coagulation, which is exacerbated in pathological conditions such as pre-eclampsia (PET). PET is further associated with abnormal maternal inflammation and increased circulating microparticles (MP); however, a mechanistic link between these pathological features has never been established. It is proposed in this thesis that abnormal maternal inflammation is causally linked to pro-coagulant trophoblast MP shedding via a mechanism mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF), thereby contributing to maternal coagulopathies associated with PET. Using thromboelastography (TEG) and standard laboratory tests, haemostatic function was evaluated in PET and normotensive subjects at delivery and post-partum. Furthermore, the effects of the menstrual cycle and oral contraceptive (OC) use on haemostatic function were assessed in non-pregnant subjects in order to understand their influence on post-partum haemostasis. Plasma TNF and pro-coagulant MP levels were evaluated in the pregnant subjects. Using chorionic villi explants from human term placentas, MPs were quantified after TNF administration. The pro-coagulant potential of placental MPs was evaluated by TEG by spiking whole-blood with medium containing MPs from chorionic villi. TEG identified increased whole-blood coagulability in PET subjects at delivery, demonstrating its increased sensitivity over standard laboratory tests at identifying haemostatic alterations associated with PET. Haemostatic alterations were normalized by six weeks post-partum. TEG also identified cyclic haemostatic variations associated with OC use. Chorionic villi treated with TNF (1 ng/ml) shed significantly more MPs than untreated placentas. MPs from chorionic villi increased the coagulability of whole-blood. Together, results provide evidence supporting the concept that abnormal maternal inflammation is causally linked to the development of maternal coagulopathies in pregnancy complications. Moreover, TEG may be superior to standard laboratory tests in evaluating haemostasis in pregnant and non-pregnant subjects.</description>

   <description>Sulfur (S) and reactive nitrogen (Nr = nitrate + ammonium) deposited at alpine sites in the Front Range of the Southern Canadian Rocky Mountains were evaluated by analyzing ion concentrations and stable isotope ratios in glacial snowpack and summer bulk precipitation samples. Deposition was 0.74 ± 0.18 kg S ha-1yr-1 (mean ± standard deviation among 3 sites) and 1.10 ± 0.18 kg Nr ha-1 yr-1. Seasonal contributions were disproportionate with summer rain, which represented 24 ± 8 % of annual precipitation, bringing 41- 46% of annual S and Nr loads. Conditions at the highest elevation site represented regional background S deposition (0.9 kg S ha-1 yr-1) and N deposition (1.3 kg Nr ha-1yr-1). The orographic influence on snow accumulation gave increasing snowpack S and Nr loads with rising elevation, with deposition mainly from distant sources. Summer S deposition was also dominantly from distant sources, while local to regional pollutants strongly enhanced Nr deposition. Distinct differences in deposition were seen between the NNW facing Robertson Valley and the opposing SE facing Haig Valley. Preferential transport and deposition to the Robertson Valley from local to regional pollution during NW-upslope synoptic conditions was probably the main factor for enhanced deposition in the Robertson Valley. The deposition rates measured here indicate that N-saturation is an ecologic concern for high alpine ecosystems in the region.&#xd;
δ34S-SO42- values in summer precipitation indicated three isotopically distinct sources: two regional to local anthropogenic sources having a similar isotope composition (A δ34S-SO42- ≥ +9 ‰, and C δ34S-SO42- ~ +8 ‰) that mixed with relatively clean air (B) with a δ34S-SO42- value ~ +4 ‰. Snowpack δ34S-SO42- values also indicated three isotopically distinct sources with the dominant source having a δ34S-SO42- value ~+2‰. Evidence suggests a seasonal difference in the relative magnitude of pathways of SO2 to SO42- oxidation is responsible for the rain vs. snowpack difference of ≥ 7 ‰. In the summer, homogeneous oxidation by OH and heterogeneous oxidation by H2O2 were most important, while oxidation by O2 catalysed by transition metal ions in a radical chain reaction pathway (TMI) was substantially more significant in the winter.</description>

   <title>Designing Switchable-Hydrophilicity Solvents and Modelling Their Behaviour</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-29 08:40:13.167</description>
   <description>Switchable-hydrophilicity solvents (SHSs) are solvents that in one state forms a biphasic mixture with water but can be reversibly switched to another state that is miscible with water.  In theory, this switch can be triggered in a number of ways, however we focus on dissolved CO2 as the switchable trigger.  The most practical use of an SHS is for extraction of a water-immiscible liquid product from a solvent in which it is dissolved (as demonstrated by the extraction of bitumen from the oil sands, bio-oil from algae, etc).  This technology provides a more environmentally-friendly means of extraction over current popular processes such as distillation.  Since their discovery in 2010, more than 25 nitrogen-based SHSs have been reported in the literature.  The SHS behaviour seems to be strongly correlated with hydrophilicity and basicity, not surprisingly.  Indeed, amine solvents which demonstrate SHS behaviour are contained within a specific hydrophilicity and basicity range.  This range can be predicted based on fundamental acid-dissociation and partitioning equations which, once developed, reveal other tuneable parameters.  These parameters are intrinsic (molecular weight and density) as well as extrinsic (CO2 pressure and water:SHS volume ratio).  The extrinsic parameters enable the switchable range to expand - enabling less basic and more hydrophobic solvents to act as SHSs.  This is of interest since one of the goals of SHS technology is to replace volatile, smog-forming and bio-accumulating solvents with environmentally benign ones.  Having a greater range to choose SHSs from increases the chances of finding more environmentally benign solvents.  The other goal of SHS technology is to be as effective, if not more, than conventional solvents for extractions.  Equipped with a mathematical description of the SHS process, it is a simple matter of optimizing the resulting equations in terms of the extrinsic parameters.  Increasing the pressure of CO2 as well as the water:SHS volume ratio increases the amount of SHS that is extracted from the liquid product.  This is true for the two-liquid system (composed of water and SHS) as well as the three-liquid system (composed of water, SHS, and a water-immisible organic liquid), though their mathematical descriptions are different.</description>

   <description>Developing new catalyst systems for cross-coupling reactions such as Buchwald-Hartwig aminations has been one of the remarkable topics in the palladium-catalyzed, cross-coupling reaction research area.&#xd;
In this thesis, the use of the easily synthesized and handled Pd(η3-1-Ph-C3H4)(η5-C5H5) (I) as a catalyst precursor for Buchwald-Hartwig amination of aryl halides was investigated utilizing various phosphines (PtBu3, Xphos and Mor-Dalphos), different phosphine (L) to Pd ratios (L:Pd = 2:1 and 1:1) and different procedures; in situ generation of PdLn prior to addition of other reactants (Method A) and in situ generation of PdLn in the presence of aryl halide but prior to the addition of other reactants (Method B). The reaction profiles are monitored by gas chromatography (GC) and the effect of each of the mentioned parameters on the reaction rate is determined. The reaction profiles of I with various phosphines are also compared with those of other precursors, Pd2(dba)3, Pd(OAc)2 and [Pd(η3-1-Ph-C3H4)Cl]2 (IV).&#xd;
In spite of a large number of studies involving modification of Buchwald-Hartwig amination reactions by developing new precursors and phosphines, fewer studies have been carried out on catalytic mechanisms and there is still ambiguity about the catalytically active species in these palladium-catalyzed reactions. This study on a representative Buchwald-Hartwig amination finds that, in Buchwald-Hartwig aminations, various species might be participating as the catalytically active species via various mechanisms, utilizing different catalyst systems. This finding is contrary to the observations for other cross-coupling reactions such as Suzuki-Miyaura and Mizoroki-Heck in which the efficient formation of putative PdL2 from Pd(η3-1-Ph-C3H4)(η5-C5H5) (I) resulted in higher initial rates and higher conversions under mild reaction conditions, than other common precatalysts (Pd(OAc)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd2dba3, etc.) containing a variety of phosphine ligands. Therefore, to further our studies, the solution chemistry of I and IV with PtBu3, XPhos and Mor-DalPhos has been studied by 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectroscopy. All intermediates observed were characterized by NMR spectroscopy.</description>

   <description>Background: Children who live on farms experience high rates of fatality, morbidity, and disability when compared to children from the general population. There is an existing body of research describing injury rates and common patterns of agricultural injuries in pediatric populations in Canada; however, these studies are dated. Few contemporary studies have focused on the etiology of pediatric agricultural injury, particularly in a Canadian context.&#xd;
Objectives: This study provides updated epidemiological information on agricultural injury in Canadian children and youth and investigates relationships between high-risk farm activities and the occurrence of agricultural injuries in youth and young adults on farms.&#xd;
Methods: Manuscript 1 describes the incidence and patterns of pediatric agricultural fatalities and hospitalizations in the provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan using surveillance data from the Canadian Agriculture Injury Reporting System. Manuscript 2 involved performance of cross-sectional analyses of written questionnaire data from 1135 youth and young adults from the Saskatchewan Farm Injury Cohort, an on-going study of active farm populations.&#xd;
Results: In manuscript 1, the overall age-adjusted annual rates of agricultural injuries per 100,000 persons were: 7.8 (95%CI: 6.2-10.0) for Saskatchewan fatalities, 6.9 (95%CI: 5.6-8.5) for Ontario fatalities, 80.2 (95%CI: 73.9-87.1) for Saskatchewan hospitalizations, and 74.5 (95%CI: 69.9-79.4) for Ontario hospitalizations. Leading mechanisms of injury in both provinces were: falls from heights, animal-related mechanisms, machine entanglements, machine runovers and rollovers, and drowning. In manuscript 2, the prevalence of farm injury was estimated at 4.9%/year (95%CI: 3.7-6.2). After adjustment for important covariates relative to baseline (&lt;10 hours/week), duration of farm work was strongly associated with the occurrence of injury [RR 8.0 (95%CI: 1.7-36.7) for 10-34 hours/week vs. baseline; RR 10.3 (95%CI: 2.2-47.5) for those working 35+ hours/week]. Tractor maintenance, tractor operation, chores with large animals, herd maintenance activities, and veterinary activities were identified as risk factors.&#xd;
Conclusions: Together, these manuscripts demonstrate that there is a considerable burden of agricultural injury among children, youth, and young adults on farms and that experiences of injury are related to the amounts and type of exposure to farm work and related occupational hazards.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-29 13:32:16.322</description>
   <description>Sustainable development initiatives necessitate actions at local and regional scales that can inform meaningful, context-specific, decision-making for mitigating global unsustainability. State of the Environment (SOE) Reporting is a method used in adaptive management strategies for sustainable development whereby a series of social, environmental, cultural and economic variables are selected and analyzed and act as indicators of the state of a particular region. The reports are utilized to educate stakeholders, organizations, and government about the various trends occurring in a region in order to inform decision-making processes and inspire action towards sustainability. SOE Reporting takes place on many different spatial and temporal scales, but an emphasis has been placed on the importance of multi-level approaches to sustainability as a means to achieve smaller successes that contribute to the global circumstance. This research employed a case study of the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve (FAB), located in eastern Ontario, to extend a practical application of SOE Reporting methodology in the context of Biosphere Reserves. This research took advantage of a University-Biosphere Reserve collaboration to develop a SOE Report for the FAB using an adaptive management lens, the pressure-state-response framework for classifying indicators, student-based indicator analysis, and community-based participatory approaches to assess, compile, and communicate a set of indicators for the region. The findings contribute to the current practical knowledge of SOE Reporting in the context of Biosphere Reserves, and discussions center on the use and limitations of the pressure-state-response framework, the importance of community-based consultative processes, the notions of scoring indicator results, the use of partnering with educational institutions, and the potential implications of the SOE Report in the region. We propose an extension of the theory of adaptive management to adaptive facilitation for application of indicator reporting initiatives in BRs, given the lack of jurisdiction that is held by BR practitioners, and the role of indicators as a tool for knowledge empowerment.</description>

   <description>In this thesis I study and provide insight into how national defence budgets are determined.  This is accomplished through the use of both theoretical modeling and empirical analysis.  A main theme running through the thesis is that a primary determinant of domestic levels of defence spending is the defence spending level of other nations.  By conditioning on these global interactions in a structured way, I am able to provide meaningful estimates of the impact of various factors on national defence spending.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter 2, I examine the costs and benefits of maintaining domestic arms manufacturers during peace time.  A model is developed that examines under which circumstances a country would wish to maintain domestic arms industries.  The predictions of this model are tested using the historical example of Canada's lack of advanced shipbuilding facilities during World War II.  By comparing the performance of corvettes and destroyers during convoy escort, I quantify the superiority of the latter over the former.  A counterfactual scenario then examines the savings in terms of ships and lives that could have resulted from having invested in domestic arms industries in peace time.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapter 3 examines more generally how national defence budgets interact with each other in a spatial econometric framework.  By creating a series of weighting matrices that qualitatively represent how countries are likely to interact militarily, I quantify the extent to which a country's relative location impacts its level of defence spending.  I find that relative location is a significant determinant of defence spending, and furthermore, I am able to identify regions of both high and low defence spending spillovers.&#xd;
&#xd;
Some countries have large domestic arms industries, whereas others largely import their military hardward.  In Chapter 4, I examine, both theoretically and empirically, how this distinction and the resulting arms trade influences defence spending behaviour.  I also examine the impact that a base level of security, measured by geographic and socioeconomic factors has on the choice of defence budget.  Consistent with the theory, I find that there are significant differences between arms producers and importers in the way they respond to exogenous factors.</description>

   <title>The Methodology of Modelling the Milky Way with Stellar Streams</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2014-10-01 10:37:30.203</description>
   <description>In this thesis we examine the methodology of modelling the Milky Way using stellar streams.  Using the orbit-fitting method we show that combining constraints from the Sagittarius stream with a suite of other photometric and kinematic observations of the Milky Way suggests a triaxial dark matter halo with axis ratios $3.3\pm 0.7$ and $2.7\pm 0.4$ where the short axis is pointed near the Sun-Galactic center &#xd;
line and the intermediate axis is perpendicular to the disk.  Additionally, this combination of constraints reduces the uncertainty in the spherically averaged mass profile by a factor of two. Through the use of mock data we show that the combination of stellar streams with suites of other, non-stream, observations is necessary to obtain the best constraints on Galactic parameters.  Suites of constraints that do not include streams lead to degeneracies in the inferred halo parameters, which the addition of a GD-1-like stream reduces.  Promisingly ,the combination of two streams provides similar improvements in the inferred halo parameters as a single long stream.  In addition to these studies we explore the orbit-fitting and the streakline &#xd;
methods of modelling stellar streams.  We find that the difference between streams and &#xd;
the orbit of the progenitor causes the orbit-fitting method to fail to recover the generative model in most test cases.&#xd;
The streakline method of citet{Varghese2011} and \citet{Kupper2012} is a great improvement on the orbit-fitting method, but it also fails to recover quantities like the local circular speed for streams generated from particularly massive progenitors.  Based on these results, we develop a modification of the streakline method &#xd;
called the distribution method.  This method accounts for the stripping of stream stars &#xd;
at the approximate location of the inner and outer Lagrange points with different Galactic velocities than the progenitor.  It provides a marginal improvement on the streakline method and consistently recovers the circular speed at the location of the observer.  The distribution method holds a great deal of promise for future studies of the Milky Way involving stellar streams.</description>

   <description>Pre-eclampsia (PE), fetal growth restriction (FGR) and fetal death are common complications associated with human pregnancy. A hallmark of these adverse pregnancy outcomes is reduced utero-placental perfusion, which is believed to arise as a consequence of deficient trophoblast-mediated spiral artery remodelling. Other common features of PE, FGR and fetal demise include reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, alterations in maternal hemostasis and an abnormal maternal inflammatory response. Despite all that is known, the causative factors leading to the development of these adverse pregnancy outcomes remain unidentified. The results of this thesis identify aberrant maternal inflammation as key to the pathogenesis of PE, FGR and fetal loss using a rat model in which pregnant rats are injected with low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In particular, our in vivo animal studies revealed a causal role for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the development of FGR, features of PE and the development of maternal coagulopathies associated with fetal death. Our work also revealed a pregnancy-specific effect whereby the deleterious effects of LPS administration to pregnant rats (i.e. cytokine release, glomerular pathology, elevated white blood cell counts) did not occur to the same magnitude when LPS was administered to non-pregnant animals. Gross examination of placentas from saline and LPS-treated animals revealed that inflammation altered placental morphometrics resulting in reduced placental weight and area. Importantly, we discovered that activation of NO signalling via the administration of the NO mimetic glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) attenuated features of LPS-induced inflammation (i.e. elevated white blood cell counts) and prevented inflammation-induced FGR, features of PE, maternal coagulopathies and fetal loss. Our in vitro studies revealed that low-dose GTN exerts immunomodulatory functions given that GTN treatment prevented TNF release from LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophage cells. Collectively, the data presented in this thesis reveal that abnormal maternal inflammation in pregnancy is casually linked to the development of FGR, features of PE and fetal loss in a rat model. Our data also provide a rationale to study the role of novel immunomodulators, including GTN, in the treatment and prevention of inflammation-induced complications of pregnancy.</description>

   <description>Daycare workers are a specific population that may experience elevated risk of injury due to the tasks performed during normal work. Within daycares, workers are exposed to bent postures, job specific lifting conditions and high exposure to stress. The objectives of the study were to collect up to date data on daycare workers, compare worker groups involving different child ages (Infant, Toddler and Pre School) and attempt to identify the most difficult tasks. Data were collected from 24 workers, in five daycares, using: questionnaire sampling, three dimensional postural tracking and video recording. Questionnaires showed that 81% of workers who completed the survey experience pain in the low back. Additionally, the average Oswestry Disability Index was found to be 17%, showing a minimal pain effect overall.  In terms of absolute posture, workers experienced deep flexion greater than 55º for 10% of the shift and flexion greater 70º for 5% of the shift. Compared to paper assessment tools, workers fell in a moderate to severe posture exposure range. Furthermore, on average, workers lifted at frequencies of 0.25 lifts/minute, lifted a total weight of 501 kg (over ~3.3 hours) and experienced compression and shear forces at L4/L5 of approximately 2064N and 199N, respectively. Group comparison showed significant differences for the relative forward flexion and the lifting frequency demonstrating higher exposure for the Infant and Toddler groups as well as a significantly higher total weight lifted for the Toddler group, compared to the Pre School group. Finally, the EVAs revealed the most difficult tasks, in terms of posture and duration, to be the Activity, Nap and Supervision tasks, whereas the questionnaire identified Outdoor Preparation, Diaper Changing, Cleaning and Playing as the most difficult tasks. Comparing to various tolerance limits (lifting, frequency, etc.) the results showed daycare workers experience elevated risk of injury and require more work guidelines, specific to the conditions within daycares. Future work should include larger scale studies, in lab testing (lifting) and more specific analyses on the individual tasks being performed within the daycare.</description>

   <description>The advantages and disadvantages of the two major categories of numerical methods, deterministic and stochastic approaches, in polymer reaction engineering are discussed. Combinations of methods are suggested in order to take advantage of both techniques. A hybrid deterministic/stochastic approach and a combined stochastic/stochastic method are developed to represent two polymerization systems of interest. &#xd;
The distribution of functional groups in polymer chains produced in radical copolymerization by starved-feed semibatch operation is simulated using three different methodologies.  A deterministic model is formulated to separately track the homopolymer chains that are produced without the desired functionality, a Monte Carlo (MC) model is written to represent the system, and a hybrid deterministic/MC approach is taken using new capabilities within the software package PREDICI.  &#xd;
Two Monte Carlo algorithms (dynamic and static) are combined in order to model and simulate the branch distribution and topology of polymer chains synthesized in hyper-branched polymerization of polyethylene with Pd-diimine catalysts. A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to investigate the impact of kinetic and stochastic parameters on the branch distribution as well as average chain length. Simulated results show excellent agreement with experimental observations.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-29 12:45:14.203</description>
   <description>Arthur Danto’s “end of art” thesis contends that art followed a progressive historical narrative from about 1300 until 1964 AD, when Danto realized that Andy Warhol’s Brillo Boxes demonstrates that an artwork can look like anything without thereby losing its status as art. I critique Danto’s revelation that an artwork can look like anything by showing how what Danto really and quite rightly means is that an art object can now look like anything. Making the art object/artwork distinction clear shows how Danto axiomatically excludes important perceptible qualities of artworks from his scope of perception which might provide outlets to the future changes to the definition of art, and thus the continuation of art history. I work up to this criticism by first addressing an apparent blind spot in Danto’s oeuvre: while Danto depicts the history of art as progressing and culminating within the realm of the visual arts, he is explicit that its implications apply to all artforms. It is a prima facie interesting question whether music can rightly be subsumed under Danto’s grand claims, since Danto’s history of art centers upon painting’s representational properties, which I argue that music lacks. Despite these differences however, music was, like painting, drawn into a Modernist search for its own essence that resulted in John Cage’s 4’33”, a piece which showed that music could sound like anything just as much as visual artworks could look like anything. However, 4’33” is unlike Brillo Boxes in that any two instances of the former can sound completely different from each other, while Brillo Boxes must always look like Brillo boxes. With reference and reverence to George Dickie, I explain how what I call “institutional cues”, which are devised, implemented, debated and changed within the “artworld”, are needed to perceive art as art in some cases, and especially in the case of 4’33”. These institutional cues are what allow art objects to be perceived as artworks, and present opportunities for innovation that Danto’s arbitrarily limited account of what is perceived when perceiving an artwork obscured from him.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions and behaviours of coaches within recreational and competitive youth sport programs.  Using a mixed-methods convergent parallel design (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011) this thesis examined the experiences of coaches who were working or had worked with both recreational- and competitive-level synchronized swimmers.  Eighteen female coaches participated in semi-structured interviews.  In addition, a sub-sample of five coaches from this group were observed six times over the course of the sport season (three sessions in the recreational setting and three sessions in the competitive setting).  Results from the coaches’ qualitative interview responses revealed key distinctions between competitive and recreational environments which were placed into themes across three dimensions: (1) coaches’ and athletes’ level of experience: novice vs expert, (2) training structure: experimentation vs commitment, and (3) program structure: participation vs performance.  Although systematic observations revealed differences on specific behaviours (e.g., levels of positive modeling, instruction, and questioning) related to these distinctions, coaching patterns as a whole were relatively consistent across the recreational and competitive environments.  These findings suggest that coaches may use certain behaviours more often during certain practice activities but that the overall structure of recreational and competitive practice activities may not be as different as coaches perceive them to be.  It may be that differences in coach behaviour are more nuanced than the literature would suggest, and that changes occur more so at the level of intonation rather than overt behaviour.</description>

   <description>The recent literature surrounding the realist/anti-realist debates in the philosophy of science has focused its attention towards the role that history plays in explaining why science is successful and thus approximately true. This has been caused, in large part, by the Pessimistic Meta-Induction (PMI), which has challenged attempted explanations by turning our attention towards the large amount of scientific theories that have been abandoned but were still empirically successful. There will be two primary goals of this paper. The first will be to explore the PMI more deeply than it traditionally has been. This will involve demonstrating how the PMI is more malleable than it is normally given credit for as well as how meta-inductions can and have been used in practice. The second goal will be to discuss the implications of this more robust form of the PMI for explanationist realism, or the thesis that scientific realism provides the best answer as to why science is successful. I will argue that explanationist realism, after being cornered by the malleability of the PMI, turns out to be either a trivial or false thesis. Given this demise of explanationist realism as a substantive thesis, I will argue that the strength of scientific realism truly lies in its critical abilities or its ability to normatively assess scientific theories and the way we ought to practice science.</description>

   <description>This essay will defend, in light of Kok-Chor Tan's critique, G. A. Cohen's position that justice should be conceived as an extensive project, whose purview includes personal choices as well as institutional structures, and that its content should be expressed not just in rules or laws, but in a culture or ethos which would guide society’s interpersonal interactions. This is primarily achieved by clarifying various aspects of Cohen's position, proving it more attractive than Tan characterizes it as being.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we explore 7.5 billion years of evolution in cluster galaxy star formation activity using a sample of 11 high-redshift (1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5) clusters from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey, and 25 low-redshift (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1) clusters from The Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble. We compare cluster galaxy star formation to that of the field over 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 using ~8000 galaxies from the UltraVISTA survey. Mid-infrared star formation rates are measured using Spitzer 24 μm data for isolated high-redshift galaxies. We calculate rest-frame ultraviolet star formation rates for low-redshift cluster members using Hubble Space Telescope observations. Using publically available mid-infrared and ultraviolet data for our field sample, we empirically derive scaling relations to adjust low-redshift cluster galaxy ultraviolet star formation rates to mid-infrared levels. We classify cluster galaxy morphology by visual inspection, and use quantitatively measured morphologies for field galaxies. Cluster late-type galaxies at z > 1 show enhanced star formation activity relative to the field, and account for nearly 90% of the overall star formation activity in high-redshift clusters. While high-redshift early-type galaxies are substantially quenched relative to cluster late-types, they still contribute ~13% of the total cluster star formation activity. With early-type fractions increasing from 34 to 56% from z ~ 1.5 → 1.16, we find that new cluster early-type galaxies are likely being formed around z ~ 1.4. The fraction of early-type galaxies that are star-forming drops from 29 to 11% over this period, yet their specific star formation rates are roughly constant. These factors suggest that the events that created these new galaxies, possibly mergers, were both recent and gas-rich. With typical coverages of 50% of z &lt; 1 cluster virial radii, we can only probe the cores of low-redshift clusters. We find that in this regime, the star formation activity of cluster galaxies is quenched relative to the field. We compare the mean star formation rate of cluster galaxies to the results of Alberts et al. (2014), who fit the mean star formation rate evolution over 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, and measured star formation rates by stacking 250 μm Herschel images. We find excellent agreement between the Herschel-based fit and both our Spitzer-derived and ultraviolet → infrared star formation rates.</description>

   <description>This study is an attempt to understand knowledge mobilization (KMb) efforts using a KMb intermediary, Connections (multidisciplinary transition teams to support students with Autism Spectrum Disorders), in real practice settings.  This study explores the experiences of six teachers, specifically, their awareness and implementation of a research-embedded education policy (Policy Program Memorandum No 140), their perceptions of three KMb strategies (networks, products, and events), and their perceptions of enablers and barriers to KMb efforts within Connections.  &#xd;
I conducted a qualitative multi-case study (n=6) that allowed me to organize the data by specific information-rich cases for an in-depth study of the interactions among policy, KMb efforts, and practice.  Because the KMb intermediaries occurred across multiple school sites, these cases allowed me to explore the similarities and differences in KMb efforts.  Each intermediary consisted of a multidisciplinary team (7-10 participants from different disciplines with a variety of expertise).  &#xd;
Teachers cited several factors influencing implementation of PPM 140 into practice: the role of parents, the availability of time and human resources to implement the policy, and the perception that this policy is implemented with a targeted group of students at the possible expense of other students.  Teachers identified three main enablers (leadership, the availability of multidisciplinary expertise, and the availability of resources) and three main barriers (relationships, misunderstanding of roles and contexts, and inequity of PPM 140) to KMb efforts.  The development of relationships was the most powerful enabler and the lack of relationships was the most powerful barrier to all other activities that occurred within the intermediary.  &#xd;
Despite the availability of knowledge mobilization frameworks, there are still very few empirical studies of how knowledge is actually mobilized in education practice settings.  This study adds to the KMb literature in three ways.  First, it adds to the limited research on KMb intermediary efforts to facilitate implementation of a research-embedded education policy.  Second, this study adds to the literature on how knowledge is mobilized in practice settings through the use of three specific KMb strategies (networks, products, and events).  Third, it establishes a more comprehensive understanding of enablers and barriers of research-policy-practice interactions by examining how the KMb process unfolded in real practice settings.  This study can provide an example of ways in which efforts can be intentionally planned at system, organizational, and individual levels for more effective KMb.</description>

   <description>The importance of palladium (Pd) as a catalyst in organic coupling reactions is undeniable. Mesoporous silica is widely used as the support of Pd catalysts. But the porous structure of the mesoporous silica limits complete characterization. As a result, heterogeneous Pd catalysts are not fully understood. &#xd;
Model Suzuki-Miyaura reaction catalysts have been made by immobilizing Pd on a mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) functionalized Si substrate. Two types of Pd species were found on the fresh catalysts that may be attributed to a S-bound Pd (II) species and Pd nanoparticles.  A sulfur species that has not been previously reported on this class of catalysts has also been observed. A systematic study of various palladium/sulfur complexes using XPS was carried out to identify this species, which may be assigned to high oxidation state sulfur formed by oxidation of thiol during the reduction of the Pd(OAc)2 used to load the catalyst with Pd.  Shifts in binding energy observed for both Pd and S spectra of the used catalysts were examined in order to probe the change of electronic environment of reactive palladium center and the thiol ligand during the reaction. Electron and atomic force microscopic imaging of the surfaces demonstrates the formation of Pd nanoparticles on fresh catalysts and subsequent size reduction of the Pd nano-particles following reaction. &#xd;
Nanoparticles have gained increased attention due to their unique properties different from the bulk materials. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and dodecyl sulfide stabilized palladium nanoparticles have been synthesized with a size range of 3 to 10 nm and 2 to 5 nm respectively. XPS confirmed the conversion of Pd (II) to Pd (0) and presence of stabilizing agent on nanoparticles surface by observing Pd 3d, N1s (for PVP stabilized) and S 2p (for dodecyl sulfide stabilized) high resolution spectra. Dispersion and size of the nanoparticles were measured by TEM. It was observed that the shift of binding energy of the nanoparticles is strongly size dependent. Finally, the ability of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to substitute the stabilizing agent of Pd nanoparticles was investigated. The XPS studies suggest the substitution of dodecyl sulfide from the Pd nanoparticles by NHCs.</description>

   <description>My task, when I set out to research and write my Master’s thesis, was to explore the ways in which theatre can contribute to engaging people on topics related to sustainability. I thus wrote a play about a young woman disillusioned by her life at home and at school. Her journey through her adoption story overlaps with her attempts to make an impact with her environmental activism. My methodology has come out of my feminist orientation which pervades my entire approach. This includes the choice of writing a play, the type and content of the play that I wrote, and the collaborative method by which I co-created and co-produced it. I have chronicled my collaborative creation process which includes devising, using Augusto Boal’s Image Theatre and techniques inspired by the UK theatre group Complicite. The text of the play is included as Chapter 6 and an archive video of the performance is linked as well. The accompanying analysis that looks at the role of culture within sustainability discourse and political theatre is a post-process reflection. The bulk of my work falls under the category of Performance as Research (PaR). As I hope my work demonstrated, performance offers particular insight into one’s culture and the values we live by, and thus our identities. This entire project is in line with the research method of autoenthnography, for the play reflects and chronicles my own struggles with sustainability and what action we can take to ameliorate the unsustainable society we currently live in.</description>

   <description>Stroke is an acute injury of the central nervous system and is caused by the disruption of blood flow or by the rupture of blood vessels. A stroke can impact many body functions, often causing motor, speech, memory, vision and other sensory impairments.&#xd;
It is highly prevalent and often requires long hospitalizations and post-stroke rehabilitation.&#xd;
The key to successful rehabilitation after stroke is an accurate assessment&#xd;
of the impairment. Current clinical assessments of stroke-related impairments involve physical assessment and visual observation by physicians. Existing clinical scores of upper limb function often use observer-based ordinal scales that are subjective and&#xd;
commonly have floor and ceiling effects. Therefore, these methods are not adequate&#xd;
to reliably discriminate different levels of performance.&#xd;
Robotics and integrated virtual reality systems have a tremendous potential to be&#xd;
used in computational systems that analyze, visualize and aid clinicians to identify&#xd;
and assess sensory-motor impairments. This thesis presents a framework for analysis&#xd;
and extraction of reliable and valid features from robotic data that can be used&#xd;
to accurately and objectively assess neurological impairments. The framework was&#xd;
applied on the Object Hit task that assesses the ability of participants to select and&#xd;
engage motor actions with both hands.&#xd;
In addition, the Object Hit Task was compared to the Object Hit and Avoid task, which is a slight modification of the original task. The comparison was done&#xd;
using a developed feature and task analysis framework. This framework encompasses&#xd;
similarities and differences between tasks in a given experiment in terms of feature&#xd;
information. The results showed that for the data used in the analysis, Object Hit&#xd;
task is able to identify impairments more effectively than the Object Hit and Avoid&#xd;
task. The overall results demonstrate that the Object Hit task provides an objective&#xd;
and easy approach to quantify upper limb motor function and visuospatial skills after&#xd;
stroke. The developed assessment tool can also be applied for diagnosis and prognosis&#xd;
of other neurological deficits, beyond stroke assessment.</description>

   <description>Solar thermal combi-systems use solar energy to provide thermal energy for space heating and domestic hot water.  These systems come in many different designs and configurations, and their performance is dependent on many different factors such as location, solar collector type and orientation, and thermal storage size.  In this study, two different combi-system configurations (a basic combi-system, and a single-tank combi-system) as well a stand-alone solar space heating system and a stand-alone solar domestic hot water system were investigated using TRNSYS models and simulations, and the thermal performances were compared using different combinations of solar collector and heat exchanger types, different locations, and a sensitivity analysis was performed using the basic solar combi-system.&#xd;
Using Toronto as the reference location, the performance of the solar stand-alone and combi-systems were compared using combinations of solar collector types (glazed vs. vacuum tube) and heat exchanger types (fixed effectiveness vs. natural convection).  Each system combination was optimized for collector flow rate and tilt angle, and all systems were given the same solar collector area, thermal storage volume, and load profiles.  This analysis revealed that the glazed type solar collector performed best when the heating load was continuous throughout the year, whereas the vacuum tube solar collector performed best with systems that had heating loads concentrated in the winter.  Further comparisons of these systems were done using reference locations: Boulder, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Toronto, Ontario.  Results showed that the single-tank solar combi-system with internal stratifiers in the thermal storage tank outperformed the other solar thermal system configurations, although if examined solely based on space heating performance, the basic combi-system with preferential charging of the space heating thermal store had the best performance.&#xd;
	Lastly, a sensitivity analysis of the basic combi-system was conducted, again using Toronto as the reference location.  Several parameters were considered, including: the solar collector tilt angle and azimuth, the solar collector size, flow rate through the collector loop, thermal storage tank size, heat exchanger effectiveness, number of tank nodes, hydronic-floor supply temperature, and hydronic-floor R-value.  Of these, the solar collector parameters and the hydronic-floor supply temperature had the greatest impact on the overall system performance.</description>

   <description>In the years between 1919 and 1923 Ireland experienced significant political and social upheavals, most notably the partitioning of the country and the end of British rule in the south following an armed struggle for independence. The division of Ireland resulted in the creation of political minorities on either side of the border; while unionist Northern Ireland found itself home to a sizable nationalist community, the independent Irish Free State inherited a smaller number of loyalists.  Although the nationalist population of Northern Ireland has received considerable attention from historians, until very recently, southern Irish loyalists were largely ignored in the historiography of the Irish Revolution and the Irish Free State. Historians are now demonstrating greater interest in the experiences of southern loyalists, but the loyalist community continues to be defined largely through its relationship with the nationalist majority.  This study will consider loyalists on their own terms, using sources originating from the loyalist community.</description>

   <description>Endothelial function is important for the maintenance of vascular health and it can be assessed by measuring endothelial dependent flow mediated dilation (FMD) in response to an imposed increase in shear stress (SS). While the 5 min reactive hyperemia FMD test (5 min RH-FMD) of the brachial artery (BA) remains the most commonly employed method of increasing shear stress, other methods, including handgrip exercise (HGEX), also exist. The purpose of this study was to determine whether obesity is associated with a uniform, or a SS profile specific impact on FMD. 19 healthy controls (21.42 +/- 2.46 years) and 9 obese subjects (27 +/- 5.43 years old) participated in this study. Each subject performed two 5 min RH-FMD tests, two HGEX-FMD tests, and one 15 min RH-FMD test. BA diameter and blood velocity (BV) were assessed using ultrasound. Data are means ± SD. No differences in mean SS experienced during HGEX were observed between groups (p>0.05). %HGEX-FMD was significantly higher in the controls (11.34 ± 4.72% vs. 5.19 ± 3.00%)(p&lt;0.001), while no differences in 5 min or 15 min RH-FMD were observed in the full study sample (p>0.05). To account for higher SS area under the curve (SS AUC) experienced by the obese group in both the 5 min RH- (p=0.055) and 15 min RH-FMD tests (p=0.004), a subset of the 9 controls with the highest SS AUC in each test was compared to the obese group. In this subset, the lower RH-FMD in the obese group approached significance (5 min RH- FMD: controls 8.52 ± 2.0 % vs. obese 6.22± 2.5%, p=0.052; 15 min RH-FMD: controls 17.75 ±5.03% vs. obese 13.28± 5.14%, p =0.08). The findings demonstrated for the first time, that HGEX-FMD was more than 50% lower in an obese group vs. a control group with a matched SS stimulus. It appears that the larger RH SS stimulus in the obese group played a role in masking impaired RH-FMD. When the SS magnitude was considered, the ability of the endothelium to respond to all stimulus profiles was more similarly attenuated in obese participants.</description>

   <title>Mobile Small cells in Cellular Heterogeneous Networks</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-30 21:08:24.559</description>
   <description>The unprecedented soaring demand for capacity and coverage on cellular networks is challenging and straining operators. The current improvements in cellular standards&#xd;
are significantly behind the exponential growth in requirements. Cellular operators&#xd;
are currently shifting towards Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) as the most promis-&#xd;
ing solution to meet user demands; by using a mix of Macro Base Stations (MBSs)&#xd;
and Small Base Stations (SBSs).&#xd;
Recently, several cellular operators have started outdoor deployments of small&#xd;
cells to enhance service in high-dense areas (e.g., downtown areas). In this the-&#xd;
sis we assess and propose HetNet solutions that capitalize on SBS deployments to&#xd;
boost capacity and coverage under varying scenarios. Initially we investigate the core&#xd;
challenge of SBS placement in high-demand outdoor zones. We propose dynamic&#xd;
placement strategies (DPS) for SBSs, and present two models that optimize placement while minimizing service delivery cost when feasibility is the core challenge, and&#xd;
minimizing macrocells utilization as their deployment, compared to small cells, pose&#xd;
a constant challenges. Both problems are formulated as Mixed Integer Linear Pro-&#xd;
grams (MILPs). These solutions are contrasted to two greedy schemes which we have&#xd;
presented and evaluated over extensive simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed DPS achieve significant reductions of service delivery cost and MBSs utilization.&#xd;
Realizing that a significant cant amount of cellular demand is generated on the go and&#xd;
suffers deteriorating quality, recent research efforts proposed deploying SBSs onboard&#xd;
public transit vehicles to enhance cellular coverage. We investigate the potential&#xd;
performance gains of using mobile SBSs (mobSBSs). We assess and quantify the impact of utilizing mobSBSs which are deployed in vehicles to aggregate  traffic and backhaul it to MBS. In our evaluation we study two important indicators to assess the Quality of Service (QoS) received by mobile users, and the ensuing network&#xd;
performance. Namely, we investigate Pairwise Error Probability (PEP) and Outage&#xd;
Probability (OP) for mobile users.&#xd;
Finally, we propose a novel mobile data offloading framework which capitalizes&#xd;
on mobile small cells and urban Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) zones to alleviate the data&#xd;
tra c load generated onboard on MBSs. We incorporate dedicated and adaptive offloading mechanisms that take into account mobile user service profiles (history)&#xd;
and WiFi coverage maps to improve the e efficiency of the offloading framework. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of the mobile&#xd;
offloading framework and contrast results to a benchmark.</description>

   <description>Cigar Lake is a high-grade uranium deposit, located in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. In order to extract the uranium ore remotely, thus ensuring minimal radiation dose to workers and also to access the ore from stable ground, the Jet Boring System (JBS) was developed by Cameco Corporation.  This system uses a high-powered water jet to remotely mine out cavities.  Survey data is required to determine the final shape, volume, and location of the cavity for mine planning and development.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis provides an overview of the challenges involved in remotely surveying a JBS-mined cavity.  In particular, it studies range finding sensors that are relevant to mining applications and their attributes.  As an alternative to sensors used for remote cavity surveying, it evaluates the potentially advantageous features of a time-of-flight (ToF) camera.&#xd;
&#xd;
Data was collected from inside a test cavity in a variety of experimental environments meant to simulate conditions in a real Cigar Lake cavity.  Field data was collected from the core shack at Cigar Lake and from an open stope at Rabbit Lake.  Advanced data analysis techniques such as registration and segmentation are also explored for application in cavity surveying.  The data from the ToF camera was evaluated with respect to the survey systems slated for use at Cigar Lake and the advantages for its use in the post cavity survey are shown.</description>

   <description>Public school systems tend to operate as a lens into general public discourse, a way to determine how successive generations are moulded from students into citizens. History and civics curriculums are sites of history making, where cultural and historical narratives, mythologies and ideas are created, transmitted and explored, often for the first time. It has become clear that successive generations of new Israeli citizens (and non-citizens) are exposed to a single historical and mythological narrative, intentionally designed to legitimate the occupation and erase the many systemic race and class-based problems in Israel from the general public discourse, particularly given that in Israel, citizenship is defined racially. The question that remains, however, is what does citizenship in Israel mean to the divergent communities that make up Israel’s population?&#xd;
This study of citizenship, Zionism and the creation of national narratives in the Israeli public education system, and Palestinian-Israeli reactions to it, demonstrate that Israeli society is too complex to have a single national historical narrative in its public schools. Through textbooks, curriculum design and education policy in government, the singular vision of history utilized by the Israeli Ministry of Education creates and reifies social inequalities and racial hierarchies and disintegrates community bonds across ethnic, religious and class lines. Such a system renders the populations of Israel divided, antagonistic and ultimately precarious, and helps to reinforce the problem of ethno-nationalism operating in an ostensibly liberal-democratic framework.</description>

   <description>In this work we present a driver and road monitoring system capable of scaling to the number of drivers in any region without incurring the high costs of implementation, thus allowing for safer driving conditions and shorter accident response times. We propose the Smartphone Road Monitoring (SRoM) system that is capable of sensing road artifacts such as potholes and slippery roads. It is also capable of detecting aberrant driver behavior such as speeding and drifting. This system uses both the driver’s smartphone and vehicle as the main source of information. The information is collected through crowdsourcing and processed by a base station giving faster and more accurate responses compared to current systems, to address road safety related events in a timely manner.  SRoM aims to accommodate various levels of reporting based on the nature of hardware available to each driver. It also allows pedestrians to share media pertaining to each event. The collected data is made available to the public through an interactive map updated with the authenticated events. Our system also incorporates the use of the vehicle’s On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) device that helps with sensing road safety and vehicle health status. The OBD system acts as a streaming black box which in case of an accident gives Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel a better idea of the victims’ condition and the location of the accident and allows police a more accurate rendition of the events for insurance and litigation purposes. We implemented a prototype of the system including OBD adaptation to perform the task of safety monitoring. System evaluation of the prototype shows that the system can be easily implemented in real-life using current technologies at little cost.</description>

   <description>Shift work is an increasingly popular work pattern and there is evidence that it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The causal pathways linking shift work and CVD risk are unclear, however, there is evidence that endothelial dysfunction and high reactivity to mental stress may play a role in disease progression. No studies in women have investigated the impact of a history of shift on 1) endothelial function assessed using two distinct tests (RH-FMD and HGEX-FMD) and 2) cardiovascular and cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor. The purpose of this thesis was to compare 1) RH-FMD and HGEX-FMD and 2) cardiovascular and cortisol stress reactivity in a group of female shift workers (SW) and non-shift workers (NSW). 20 healthy SW (41.1 ± 11.4 years) and 19 NSW (41.6 ± 11.4 years) participated. Each participant preformed two RH-FMD and two HGEX-FMD tests. Brachial artery diameter and blood velocity were assessed using Echo and Doppler ultrasound, respectively. For stress reactivity, serum cortisol, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured before, during, and after a speech and mental arithmetic stress task. All values are means ± SD. There was no difference between SW and NSW in terms of RH-FMD (SW: 7.34 ± 2.78%, NSW: 7.86 ± 3.47, p=0.610) or HGEX-FMD (SW: 5.46 ± 3.24%, NSW: 4.14 ± 2.10, p=0.15). HR, SBP, and DBP stress reactivity were not significantly different between groups (HR: SW: 22.35 ± 15.68 beats•min-1, NSW: 20.42 ± 10.53 beats•min-1, p=0.66; SBP: SW: 20.93 ± 10.72 mmHg, NSW: 19.57 ± 11.92 mmHg, p=0.72; DBP: SW: 14.27 ± 6.58 mmHg, NSW: 11.20 ± 6.28 mmHg, p=0.16), however the magnitude of difference in DBP reactivity between groups (3.07 mmHg) had a moderate effect size (d = 0.5). Cortisol stress reactivity was significantly higher in SW than NSW (8.53 ± 6.04 µg/dL vs. 1.41 ± 2.92 µg/dL). These preliminary data suggest that shift work experience did not have a negative impact on endothelial function, but did result in elevated HPA-axis reactivity and modest increases in cardiovascular reactivity to acute mental stress.</description>

   <description>There is growing evidence that cognitive changes associated with healthy aging occur much earlier than previously believed. Yet, the vast majority of healthy cognitive aging studies neglect to analyze the gradual neural and behavioural age-related changes that surreptitiously begin in mid-adulthood and continue into late-life. Attention serves as an example of one of these mid-life behavioural changes and, as such, offers an excellent opportunity for investigation into the early, behavioural changes that begin in mid-adulthood and their associated neural underpinnings. In this study, we attempted to unearth the neural correlates of these incremental changes by subjecting participants to a rapid event-related adaptation of the classic Stroop Task, concurrently with functional MRI scans. We recruited 60 cognitively normal participants from 40-90 years of age, with 12 participants within each decade group.&#xd;
We found that the bilateral Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG) was the only area to exhibit unanimous, linear age-associated declines in activity amongst all participants. Anticipating major differences in neural activity between participants who exhibited large and small Stroop interference, in comparison to their age-matched peers, we divided participants into three separate groups, based on performance. Interestingly, those who performed well on the Stroop task exhibited declines only in the MFG, while participants who performed relatively poorly demonstrated age-associated declines in every single examined region of the Frontoparietal Attention Network. Furthermore, in accordance with studies of effective age-associated functional compensation, we discovered that high performers of the Stroop task solely relied on bilateral prefrontal Attentional Network regions to maintain optimal cognitive performance. In contrast, the relatively poor performance of those who exhibited larger Stroop effects was attributable to activity in areas involved in intact distraction suppression mechanisms, like the Intraparietal Sulcus (Superior and Inferior Parietal Lobules) and the Supramarginal Gyrus of the Temporoparietal Junction. Taken together, this investigation provides corroborative evidence for the high sensitivity of the Stroop task in detecting early neural age effects, novel insights into the linear changes associated with aging from mid- to late-life, and conclusive testimony of the widening interindividual variability in the functional patterns of the brain, and subsequently behaviour, in the elderly.</description>

   <description>This thesis reports on the investigation of a cost effective method of diagnosing gear faults using non-contact magnetic rotational position sensors. Like all new methods, the proposed sensor needed to be compared directly to an industry standard technique for measuring shaft rotations. The sensor was tested for its ability to record shaft rotational speed under a variety of experimental conditions. The sensor provided optimal measurements when directly compared to an industry standard technique of completing the same task. Using the fully calibrated sensor, experiments were conducted, which involved measuring the presence of faults in a 1:1 gearbox comprised of steel spur gears. Measuring the dynamic transmission error over the course of one full gear rotation allowed for identification of various gear fault types and severity levels. A large dynamic transmission error is the result of the output shaft lagging the input shaft, which ultimately represents the presence of a gear fault.  The dynamic transmission error, over the course of one shaft rotation, was also investigated for the presence of a smooth engagement profile. A smooth engagement profile is the result of the sensor accurately detecting each individual tooth entering and exiting the gear mesh. The sensor demonstrated a great deal of promise for the application of a cost effective method for condition monitoring and fault diagnostics in a gearbox containing steel gears and loaded under realistic conditions.</description>

   <description>Attachment styles and the experiences of parenting that underpin attachment styles have important effects throughout the lifespan. Research on the neurobiology of human attachment has begun to identify neural correlates of attachment styles. The present study adds to that body of research and confirms previous findings on correlations between attachment style and memories of parenting.&#xd;
My main goal was to test the first time the hypothesis that baseline neural activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would be correlated adult attachment security. Previous research has identified: 1) a correlation between baseline neural activity in the left DLPFC and approach motivation; 2) a correlation between baseline neural activity in the left DLPFC and infant attachment style; and 3) a correlation between the willingness of toddlers to freely explore a new environment when in the presence of their attachment figures and attachment style. Based on these previous findings, I hypothesized that adult attachment security, as indicted by “confidence” scores on the Adult Attachment Questionnaire (ASQ), and parenting memories, as measured by the EMBU questionnaire, would be positively correlated with baseline neural activity in the left DLPFC. &#xd;
I also explored correlations between responses to the ASQ and to the EMBU, hypothesizing that attachment security, as measured by confidence scores on the ASQ, would be positively correlated with memories of parental emotional warmth and negatively correlated with memories of parental rejection.&#xd;
As hypothesized, I found a significant positive correlation between confidence, the ASQ factor reflecting a secure attachment orientation, and neural activity in the left DLPFC. Because the same correlation between attachment security and neural activity in the left DLPFC has been found in infants, my finding suggests that this may be one of the mechanisms by which attachment styles developed in infancy persist into adulthood. The left DLPFC has also been associated with approach motivation. Therefore my finding suggests that more confident, or securely attached, adults have higher approach motivation. &#xd;
I also found that adult attachment style as measured by the ASQ was correlated with memories of parenting as measured by the EMBU. “Memories of father emotional warmth” was the most significant EMBU factor relating to attachment style.</description>

   <description>The contemporary precarious condition, ‘precarity,’ in life, work and culture parallels transformations in national and global economies, in part through the rise of immaterial production. Precarity has led to destabilization and reconfiguration of a class /class system and the creation of a new majority precarious class including domestic and farm workers, academic workers, care givers, part-timers and more. The thesis identifies how a historical moment of the Canadian Farmworkers Union (1979-1999) experienced marginal social protection, racial discrimination, limited legal rights, short-term contracts, vulnerable working conditions and precarious life without health care. The transnational lessons of the CFU include a better understanding organizing precarious citizens today — including what has not worked; importance of visual cultural analysis and counter-visuality to inform resistance. Theories of immaterial labour; porousness of international borders; lack of social protections; shorter career cycles; challenges to traditional craft unions; shift in social values as citizens organize across sectors, geographies and borders; and, migrant experiences as central to the experience of precarity. Confronted with the difficult task of re-imagining old ‘modernist’ visions of ‘class,’ ‘people,’ ‘nation-states’ and many established perspectives of resistance that have been stalemated. The thesis also includes a short survey of visual cultural expressions from twenty-first century precarious citizen groups.&#xd;

   <title>My Nostalgia: the Cute, the Cozy, and the Happy in Diaspora</title>

   <description>My project calls for a (re)consideration of the centrality of nostalgia to diaspora and a renewed attention to the significance of similarly cozy/(self-)comforting behaviours within the novels of Kiran Desai, Anita Desai, and Chang-rae Lee. I wish to invest in nostalgia and related cloistering desires such as narcissism and politeness rather than divest them of that which makes them (academically) uncouth or (politically) regressive. I also strive to imagine what a non-progress-oriented approach to diaspora studies might look/feel like. In other words, what, in the current climate of diasporic studies, constitutes a desire to embrace regressive impulses without succumbing to (academic) discomfort with such non-edifying pursuits? &#xd;
Ultimately my interest here is not to establish the underlying contribution of diasporic affects such as cuteness, passivity or happiness to the momentum of diaspora studies but rather to dwell on their disobedience. In doing justice to such affective impertinence, I hope to speak to aspects of the lived and highly personal/ized experiences of minority that receive scant critical attention or are actively reviled while revitalizing both the imagination of home and the recovery of loss.</description>

   <description>Determining the inference bounds for parameter estimates in multi-response models is a challenge for research and industry since potential co-dependencies among responses add to the complexity of the problem. Statistical profiling is a valuable method in such situations that provides insight into model nonlinearity and co-dependencies among parameter estimates by studying the behavior of the likelihood function. &#xd;
This thesis focuses on extending the application of profiling for parameter inference and estimability analysis to nonlinear multi-response models with unknown noise covariance terms. Profiling is explored based on Generalized Least Squares (GLS) and Determinant Criterion (DC). One issue is finding the distribution and the corresponding degrees of freedom of the profile likelihood function, which depends on the process of estimation of the noise covariance matrix in multi-response models. A method for estimating this matrix and performing profiling is proposed. This research proves that for multi-response models with m responses, p parameters and n experimental runs, the GLS-based profile likelihood function has a χ_1^2 or an F_(1,nm-p) distribution for cases with known or unknown noise covariance matrices respectively. Similarly, the DC-based profile likelihood is shown to have an F_(1,nm-p) distribution. The GLS-based and DC-based profiling approaches are compared theoretically and in practice, suggesting that the GLS-based method is overall more advantageous for small datasets and a combination of DC for parameter estimation and GLS for profiling generally produces reliable results when certain issues are avoided. &#xd;
Furthermore, application of profiling for parameter estimability analysis is explored and a profile-based exploratory analysis is proposed which studies the GLS-based profile likelihood plots and profile traces to reveal inestimability issues. This method links parameter estimability analysis to parameter inference and brings the two objectives of this thesis together. All the proposed methods are examined by means of several examples, the results of which validate the defined approaches.</description>

   <description>The field of surveillance studies as a whole is sorely lacking empirical data. This thesis includes and analyzes data of public opinions of surveillance across the United States of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This thesis uses multiple statistical models at the univariate, bivariate and multivariate levels. Ultimately, a country-stratified complementary log-log regression is used analyze the 2012 Globalization of Personal Data (GPD) follow-up dataset. The findings of this thesis show that the majority of respondents in all three countries find surveillance to be highly intrusive. There is also a positive correlation between the knowledge of surveillance technologies and feelings of intrusion – that is, typically, the more knowledgeable one is about surveillance, the more intrusive they find surveillance. There also appear to be stronger feelings of intrusiveness of surveillance in the United Kingdom in comparison to the United States and Canada. Also, respondent’s form the United Kingdom who believe that community CCTV is not very, or not at all effective show the highest single-variable influence on the feelings of intrusiveness than those who believe it is ‘very effective’ while controlling for all variables. Therefore, the concluding results of this analysis show that the pre-Snowden era of public opinion in regards to surveillance is already highly negative – yet new and old technologies continue to spread ubiquitously. Thus, it is apparent that in Western liberal democracies public support for surveillance is desired, but not required. Public support of surveillance technologies greatly reduces barriers for the spread of technologies, but surveillance technologies can, and do spread without public knowledge or support through a myriad of ways. This thesis provides a strong snapshot of public opinion data that can be used as a ‘benchmark’ for future analyses that seek to measure the impacts of the Snowden revelations and other momentous surveillance events.</description>

   <description>Four mathematical models have been developed to describe copolymerization of inimer and isobutylene via living carbocationic polymerization in batch reactors. In this system, there are six different propagation rate constants that result from two kinds of vinyl groups and three different propagating end groups. The models are developed with the following goals: 1) to account for all six propagation rate constants without making equal-reactivity assumptions; 2) to predict concentration changes of inimer, isobutylene and polymer over time; 3) to predict values of average branching level, number and weight average molecular weight; 4) to predict molecular weight distribution; 5) to estimate model parameters. &#xd;
First, a simplified but lengthy PREDICI model is developed. Due to simplifying assumptions, this model can only be used for systems with low branching levels (i.e., less than 5 branches per molecule, on average), and only four of the six propagation rate constants are included.  This model achieves goals 2 to 5 above, with parameters being estimated using low-branching-level data. Next, a traditional Monte Carlo (MC) model is developed. This MC model achieves all of the goals, except parameter estimation, due to the excessive computational effort that would be required. Third, a more advanced MC model is developed using a combination of dynamic material balances and stochastic calculations. With much shorter computational times (by a factor of ~200), this MC model provides information similar to that provided by the traditional MC model, and also provides information about dangling and internal segments in the polymer molecules. However, this model is still not suitable for parameter estimation. Finally, a “parallel” model is developed in PREDICI, which contains three simulation systems that are solved simultaneously. This model achieves goals 1 to 3 and 5, but cannot predict the weight average molecular weight. For the first time, all six propagation rate constants are included in the parameter estimation, resulting in improved fit to the experimental data.  Three of the parameter estimates are not significantly different from zero at the 95% confidence level.  Additional data, with higher branching levels should be used, in future, to improve the precision of parameter estimates.</description>

   <description>The meaning and future of the new political jurisdiction created in 1867 called Canada were far from obvious or certain for those who witnessed Confederation and its first decades of development. This study looks at some of the ways in which the creation of a new Canadian state in 1867 influenced ways of thinking about the nature of political association and civic identity. Based on a thorough analysis of English-Canadian magazines published between 1867 and 1900, as well as major books and pamphlets written about the constitution in Canada, many by the same authors, it focuses on the English-Canadian intellectuals and public writers who tended to write most systemically about such issues. This study assesses changing ideas of political association in these sources through an analysis of the key political concepts of constitution, nationality, citizenship, and loyalty, each of which form the basis of separate chapters. It argues that ideas of “modern” political association developed by these concepts often led to concerted efforts to describe the Canadian state as a legitimate and natural container of civic affiliation. While many described these concepts as increasingly defined by the relationship between the individual and the territorial, constitutional state, they continued to be guided by assumptions about racial identity and lines of exclusion. This complexity is detailed in the final chapter, a case study of changes to naturalization law between 1867 and 1914 that saw many of the ideas examined in this dissertation take more concrete legal form.</description>

   <description>The following research presents a case study of potential approaches that could be applied when creating a community GHG inventory for a Canadian biosphere reserve – a geographic scale which has not been explored before for an inventory of this type. A partial carbon footprint that focusses on four key emission sources was created using the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve of Southeastern Ontario as a study area. Unique approaches that combine the use of GIS data with readily available surrogate data from statistical surveys were applied in order to surmount recognized challenges associated with boundary setting and data collection. In most cases, the results showed a typical trend where community size and dispersion were the main determinants for the significance of emissions generated by community members in different municipalities. Unique factors such as dwelling type, demographics, and rural-urban divide were also found to be important indicators that impacted emissions as well. Potential approaches for mitigating emissions were provided based on the findings, and a discussion regarding the potential financial benefits that quantifying emissions could have for a biosphere reserve in the long term were noted.</description>

   <description>This thesis focuses on 3 Ontario water bodies (Hamilton Harbour, the Bay of Quinte and Lake Simcoe), which are vital for economic and recreational activities, yet are threatened by eutrophication, which leads to low dissolved oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) and harmful algae blooms. Among them, Hamilton Harbour and Bay of Quinte are listed as Great Lakes Areas of Concerns (AOCs). To develop effective Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) the potential impacts of climate change on the water quality problems must be assessed. The main objective of this study is to predict the effects of future climate change on the water quality and the implications for lake restoration through computational modeling. A vertical one-dimensional (1D) computational model, Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM) coupled to Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM) was applied to Lake Simcoe and Hamilton Harbour. We forecasted the response of the Lake to two greenhouse gas GCM emissions scenarios (A2 and B1). There is a relatively small difference between A2 and B1 predictions. According to the simulations, Lake Simcoe will be stratified 4.5 days per decade longer until 2100 and the length of hypoxia will increase from 55 days to ~100 days. Hamilton Harbor, will be stratified approximately 6 days per decade longer by 2100 and the hypoxic period is projected to increase from 150 days to 200 days. In Lake Simcoe, the mean surface cyanobacteria biomass during the stratified season is simulated to increase from ~ 0.2 ugL-1 to ~1 ug L-1 by 2066 as a consequence of a warming climate.&#xd;
The three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM) combined with CAEDYM was applied to Bay of Quinte. The model results were comprehensively validated against the observed physical (temperature), chemical (nutrients) and biological (phytoplankton biomass) parameters. The model was then forced for the periods of 2000-2004 and 2066-2070, with North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) meteorological data. The simulations show an increase in surface temperature of 2-3.5C with minimal simulated effects on cyanobacteria. The average May-October TP concentrations in present and future simulations are higher than the RAP target (~0.1 mg L-1), from loads to the upper Bay, and biomass is consistently below the RAP target range (&lt;4 ug L-1) in the&#xd;
iii&#xd;
middle and lower sections of the Bay and above the target (10-15 ug L-1) in the upper reaches during 2000 to 2004. In future simulations, the average phytoplankton biomass will increase to (6-8 ug L-1), being mostly high in the upper Bay (14-15 ug l-1). If predicted changes in surface water temperatures are realized under climate change, the phosphorus concentrations of inputs to the Bay would need to be decreased by ~50%, compared to present values, to maintain recommended RAP phytoplankton concentrations</description>

   <description>Background: The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among farmers is greater than non-farming populations. The burden on Canadian farmers is unknown, however. Research is required to determine the occurrence of these conditions and the work-related tasks that contribute to musculoskeletal pain in prevalent anatomical sites.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The objectives of the two studies comprising this thesis were to 1) describe the sample population of Saskatchewan farmers and the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, and, 2) explore the strength of associations between biomechanical exposures and work-related musculoskeletal disorders.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Objective 1. Participants received a mail-out survey for the Saskatchewan Farm Injury Cohort. Study outcomes were self-reports of musculoskeletal disorders characterized by presence and severity of musculoskeletal pain in nine anatomical regions. Objective 2. A cross-sectional analysis of the experience of musculoskeletal pain in relation to four main biomechanical work exposures was performed. Relationships were determined by modeling the exposures separately using modified Poisson regression.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Objective 1. A strong majority of participants (82.2%) reported having musculoskeletal pain in at least one body part over the past year. The lower back was the anatomical site most frequently affected (57.7%), followed by the shoulders (44.0%). Objective 2. Results suggest that all biomechanical exposures had a dose-response effect on musculoskeletal outcomes. Shovel or pitchfork use was strongest for lower back pain, while working with arms above head was the greatest risk factor for shoulder pain.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Objective 1. Our study suggests that Canadian farmers also experience musculoskeletal pain most frequently in the lower back and shoulders, similar to those in other regions and commodity types. It also found that all farm people are at risk for musculoskeletal disorders, highlighting the need to target all subgroups and commodity types equally. Objective 2. Strong associations between increased biomechanical exposures and pain in the lower back and shoulders support the evidence that these regions are susceptible to the physical exposures of farm work.</description>

   <description>This thesis reports the preparation of several ABC and ABCx miktoarm star terpolymers using a novel “assembly-and-reaction” strategy.  Some of the prepared polymers were used to undergo another level of self-assembly to form vesicles.  After chemical derivations, the vesicles were converted to capsules bearing regularly packed nano-scale channels, which were pH-responsive.  This thesis is about the “double assembly” of linear block copolymer precursors and “double chemical processing” to yield functional nanostructures &#xd;
Triblock copolymers containing a short central carboxyl-bearing block and a diblock copolymer containing a short amine-bearing block were synthesized.  One triblock and one diblock copolymer precursor was subsequently associated via electrostatic interactions between their amine- and carboxyl-bearing blocks and were covalently linked via amidization to yield ABC miktoarm copolymers.  In particular, this “assembly-and-reaction” strategy was used to prepare µ-(PtBA100)(PSMA66/200)(PCEMA120) copolymers, where PtBA, PSMA, and PCEMA respectively denote poly(tert-butyl acrylate), poly(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl methacrylate (also called poly(solketal methacrylate)), and poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate).  These copolymers were ideal candidates for functional nanostructures, because all three of their arms could be derivatised.  PSMA was hydrophobic but could be hydrolyzed into PGMA (poly(glyceryl methacrylate)), which contained hydroxyl groups and was soluble in water, PtBA could be hydrolyzed into PAA (poly acrylic acid), and PCEMA was photocrosslinkable.&#xd;
ABCx miktoarm copolymers were synthesized through the same “assembly and reaction” strategy but using different precursor feed ratios.  These copolymers were pseudo-miktoarm structures because two short reactive blocks rather than a traditional trivalent functional group were used to link the long blocks.  Moreover, the average number x of diblock copolymer chains that were attached to each triblock copolymer chain was not 1, but 1.14 and 1.58 for the two µ-(PtBA)(PCEMA)(PEO)x copolymers that we have prepared.  Since only the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block was soluble in a tetrahydrofuran/water mixture containing 80 vol% water, the two µ-(PtBA)(PCEMA)(PEO)x samples formed vesicles with PtBA and PCEMA as the wall.  Using appropriate lengths for the PtBA and PCEMA blocks, we also ensured that PtBA formed cylinders that permeated across the PCEMA wall.  Photocrosslinking the PCEMA wall and hydrolyzing the PtBA chains in the cylindrical domains yielded permanent capsules permeated by regularly-packed poly(acrylic acid)-gated nanochannels.  These capsules were loaded with various cargoes and exhibited pH-responsive reagent release in water, releasing reagents faster and more completely at higher pH's.</description>

   <description>Heme oxygenase (HO) is the enzyme that breaks down heme to form carbon monoxide, free iron, and biliverdin. The two major isoforms, HO-1 (inducible) and HO-2 (constitutive), are involved in a number of physiological functions, including apoptosis, inflammation, and angiogenesis.  In cancerous cells these effects may promote growth, tumour cell survival, and metastasis. Many tumour types have demonstrated increased levels of HO, and research has shown that HO inhibition results in decreased tumour growth.&#xd;
Previous work using metalloporphyrin-based compounds identified HO inhibition as a potential therapy for some cancers, but these compounds are limited by their lack of selectivity. Novel azole-based HO inhibitors (QC-xx) have demonstrated increased in vitro selectivity for HO and were tested for their effects on AC2M2 mouse breast cancer growth and progression. QC-xx demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in AC2M2 cell viability and a decrease in endothelial cell tube-like sprouting in an in vitro model of angiogenesis. While there was some evidence that QC-xx treatment could delay primary AC2M2 tumour growth and the development of lung metastases in vivo, the results were inconclusive. The effects of QC-xx on HO activity were different between rats, from which the initial HO data was obtained, and mice, from which our AC2M2 cells were derived. Further examination indicates that HO activation may help elucidate the role of HO in AC2M2 mouse breast cancer growth and progression. The findings will help determine whether HO is an appropriate target in the treatment of breast cancer.</description>
