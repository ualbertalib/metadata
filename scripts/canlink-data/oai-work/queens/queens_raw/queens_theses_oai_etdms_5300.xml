   <description>Canadian and International experts agree that deep underground repositories are the single best solution regarding safe, long-term nuclear waste disposal (IAEA 2009). Numerous European and Asian countries have already begun extensive research and preliminary design analyses associated with site assessment for high-level fuel storage facilities known collectively as deep geological repositories (DGRs) (ANDRA 2005, Armand et al. 2003, NAGRA 2002, Martino and Chandler 2004). In Canada, Kincardine, ON, is currently the proposed site that will host the low- to medium-level nuclear waste generated from the Bruce, Pickering and Darlington nuclear power plants. The project conceptualization, as well as the specific sites, have undergone extensive public critique and analyses. The project is in the final licensing stage of the process.&#xd;
To ensure long term stability and safety of the DGRs, the prediction and understanding of the excavation damage zone (EDZ) around the associated shafts, placement room tunnels, storage voids and access tunnels is paramount. The general EDZ consists of component zones of damaged, fractured and influenced rock moving radially away from the center of the excavation. The outer “influenced” zone consists of rock that has been elastically strained, while the “damaged” zone undergoes small scale, discontinuous crack damage, subsequently increasing the permeability of the surrounding rockmass. The “fractured” zone is located nearest to the excavation wall/face, where continuous (connected) fractures dominate.&#xd;
Numerous details within a preliminary design of the tunnels and intersections within a DGR will influence the development and ultimate impact of the EDZ on ultra-long-term repository safety. For the various DGR tunnelling projects that include the placement room tunnels, access tunnels and vertical shafts, details of shape will dictate the ultimate support demands and safety requirements. Using case examples, as well as 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional continuum numerical modelling simulations, this thesis will illustrate key impacts of macro-geometry choices, such as shape and dimensions of placement room and access tunnels, as well as details, which include corner geometry, aspect ratio, excavation sequence and methodology, on EDZ and highly damaged zone (HDZ) development in underground infrastructure.</description>

   <description>A detailed understanding of strength and fracturing behaviour of the rockmass is essential for coherent design of underground structures such as deep geological repositories (DGRs) for long-term nuclear waste storage. The development of advanced numerical approaches, such as Synthetic Rock Mass (SRM), provides an effective tool to simulate the failure process of the rock at various scales from laboratory scale samples to excavation scale problems. As an alternative to empirical methods and physical testing, the SRM technique can also be employed to estimate the deformability and strength properties of jointed rockmasses under a wide range of scales and boundary conditions.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this study, a two-dimensional code based on the discrete element synthetic rock mass model is used to simulate the behaviour of low-porosity rocks under hydro-mechanical loading. A methodology is developed to calibrate the SRM models to the response of laboratory-scale intact rock. Using numerical simulation, the role of connectivity of induced micro-cracks on increasing the permeability of a laboratory-tested sample is investigated. The capability of the model to simulate the effect of pore fluid pressure on weakening the strength of the rock is examined. Next, the calibrated model is applied to simulate the formation of the excavation damage zone (EDZ) around unlined underground tunnels in crystalline granitic and laminated sedimentary rocks. The understanding gained from simulating damage development around case history tunnels leads to recommendations for calibrating the micro-parameters of the model for tunnel-scale applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
In addition, an SRM model coupling the discrete fracture network (DFN) model and discrete element grain-based model (GBM) is used to characterize the strength and deformability of highly interlocked jointed rockmasses under confined and unconfined conditions. The scale dependency and variability of the rockmass properties are investigated using the concept of Representative Element Volume (REV). The results of numerical modelling are then compared with the predicted values obtained from empirical methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is demonstrated that the SRM technique can be successfully applied to simulate the observed shape and extent of the damage zone around underground excavations. The estimated strength based on the SRM modelling results is in agreement with the unconfined strength predicted by the empirical Hoek-Brown criterion.</description>

   <title>Genetic Structure and Connectivity of the Endangered Butler's Gartersnake (Thamnophis butleri) Across the Fragmented Landscape of Southwestern Ontario</title>

   <description>Genetic patterns in many species are affected by environmental features that may enable or obstruct gene flow. Geographical isolation of conspecific individuals by uninhabitable expanses can lead to genetic separation. For species impacted by human activities, understanding how they interact with their environment can promote re-establishment of population connectivity and conservation. Thamnophis butleri (Butler’s gartersnake) is an Endangered species in Ontario, its range comprising three disjunct regional populations: Essex County, Lambton County, and Luther Marsh. Thamnophis butleri is a specialist of wetland-adjacent grassland-type habitat, thus its distribution is constrained by Southwestern Ontario’s largely agricultural landscape. Genetic differentiation among populations inhabiting these isolated regions was shown in a single previous study. I explored genetic structure more comprehensively, augmenting the geographic sampling and deploying landscape genetics approaches. &#xd;
In my first data chapter, I tested for population differentiation in both T. butleri and the generalist Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis (eastern gartersnake) where the congeners occur sympatrically in Ontario. Assignment analyses revealed clear genetic structure within T. butleri, with clusters corresponding to geographical regions: one each in Lambton and Luther Marsh, and two in Essex, one along the shoreline and another in LaSalle, ON and the Ojibway Prairie Complex. Dispersal by river, either aquatically or along riparian corridors, may facilitate connection in the Lambton and Essex shoreline clusters, while the Ojibway/LaSalle cluster may have no need to disperse (occurring in good-quality habitat) or be impeded from dispersing by intervening urban areas. In contrast, I found that T. s. sirtalis comprises a single genetic population, implying that its generalist ecology allows for dispersal through this heavily altered landscape.&#xd;
In my second data chapter, I explored the relationship between patterns of T. butleri genetic differentiation and landscape composition across its Canadian range, using Mantel-based methods to test the correlation along either uniform or habitat-delineated distance matrices. The relationship between landscape and genetics varied among regional populations, from resistance-based in Lambton to distance-based in Essex. Treating open water as a potential impediment or facilitator of dispersal did not alter my conclusions, raising the possibility of aquatic dispersal that may occur at a different spatial scale than terrestrial dispersal.</description>

   <description>A research project was carried out at Queen’s University to determine the effectiveness of an agarose gel-based treatment of iron gall ink corrosion halos using reducing agent sodium metabisulfite and chelating agent diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid. The ink fabricated for this experiment contained the metal ions of iron, copper, and zinc to increase the amount of visible corrosion, as well as replicate historic inks that have metals other than iron in them. The experimental treatment accounts for the chelation of the copper and zinc ions from the paper substrate along with iron, which cannot currently be done using the widely accepted calcium phytate treatment, as phytate is iron selective. &#xd;
The effectiveness of this experimental treatment was primarily determined using qualitative methods of analysis. Photographic documentation, ultraviolet fluorescence, and optical microscopy showed visual effects of the treatment from color change in the ink, to a reduction in corrosion-induced fluorescence, and ink bleeds where the cyclododecane fixative failed. Scanning election microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron probe microanalysis were the techniques that made clear the distribution of elements in the ink and from the treatment on the paper samples. However, the concentrations of metals in the substrate were too low to detect evidence of corrosion halos via these analytical methods. Color spectrophotometry and pH measurements of the sample swatches yielded results that support observations made with the aforementioned techniques and determined the treatment safe for the paper substrate, respectively. Unfortunately, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, the main technique that could have confirmed the success of the treatment, did not yield results because of unknown error. Though no definite conclusions could be drawn on the effectiveness of the treatment, suggestions for future research and potential treatment procedures can be considered based on the results from the qualitative analyses.</description>

   <description>Service-oriented computing (SOC) is a distributed computing paradigm that is revolutionizing the development of software systems. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) provides a framework  for realizing and implementing SOC.  A Web service is a key concept for developing SOA applications that allows interoperability among distributed software applications deployed on different platforms and architectures, which is important for many electronic business applications. Web services enable organizations to carry out certain business activities automatically and in a distributed fashion. &#xd;
	&#xd;
However, in some circumstances, a single service is not able to perform a certain task and it becomes necessary to compose two or more services in order to complete it. Thus, a key research challenge in SOA is the problem of automated service composition. Several approaches exist that tackle the problem of automatic service composition; however, the task of generating provably correct Web service compositions still remains a challenging and complex task. The goal of this dissertation is to leverage the existing work on supervisory control to solve the problem of automated service composition with a focus on control and correctness.&#xd;
&#xd;
Therefore, in this dissertation, we develop a novel formal framework for modeling Web service compositions based on Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) of discrete-event systems. We model services that exchange messages and exhibit nondeterministic (runtime-dependent) behaviours based on runtime input. The objective  is to synthesize a supervisor that interacts with a given set of Web services through messages to guarantee that a given specification is satisfied. The framework employs Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs) equipped with guards and data variables to model Web services and provides a technique to synthesize a controller. We model the interactions of services asynchronously and we use the guards and data variables to express certain preconditions which are then propagated from the system requirements through the overall composite service. &#xd;
The dissertation also provides a prototype implementation toolkit and an evaluation of the applicability of the approach using a number of case studies. &#xd;
&#xd;
A key novelty of this work is the application of control theory to service-oriented computing and the incorporation of runtime input into the supervisor generation process.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores the perceptions of front-line police officers surrounding synoptic and panoptic surveillance and the implications of police body-worn cameras on community relations, citizen’s recording devices and police practice. The study involves a qualitative approach that utilized one-on-one, semi-structured interviews, in which participants were those members of the Toronto Police Service who wore body-worn cameras during an earlier pilot study of the device conducted by the Toronto Police Service. Police as a sampling group are very exclusive and hard to gain access to, as such this study relied on a snowball sampling strategy which resulted in a sample size of 7. While sample size is a major limitation of this study, these 7 interviews provided rich data that were able to provide a valuable and humanizing dialogue of police officers. Transcriptions of interviews were collected and thematically analyzed, resulting in commonalities among participant responses. These commonalities suggest that officers involved in the piloting project that were interviewed share similar perceptions and concerns of this new technology, whether it be positive or negative. Themes that were established include: Context; Synoptic Surveillance; Accountability; Police and Community Relationship and Trust; Impact on Officer’s Job, Career and Routine; Officer Repercussions &amp; Protection from Accusations; Officer Change in Behaviour Due to Surveillance Devices; Officer Physical Safety; Citizens Behavioural Changes and Reactions Body-Worn Cameras; Social Media; Privacy Concerns; Officers Favourability toward Wearing Body-Worn Cameras; and the Overall Impact Body-Worn Cameras have on Policing. Participants reported while this surveillance tool is beneficial in theory, in practice the implications of this device are increasingly negative on police practice and community relations. Study results are framed using contemporary theories of surveillance and concepts central to police legitimacy, and for the purpose of this research the culmination of these notions has been termed the Surveillance Accountability Framework. The concerns surrounding police body-worn cameras raised by this research should be considered for further research and improvement, particularly due to the increasing amount of police services planning on adopting this new technology.</description>

   <description>Seeking flexible structures, many organizations today are abandoning the ceremonies of hierarchy. The idea is that removing traditional dress codes, segregated workspaces, and formality with superiors will de-emphasize status distinctions and encourage members of different rank to collaborate freely. On the other hand, researchers show that hierarchies of are often resilient because they are reinforced by external institutions, such as professional regulations and industry norms. This dissertation explores the conditions under which ceremonial change enables flexible use of authority in large, institutionalized organizations. I report on an inductive study of four Toronto hospitals in which scripted experiences of the medical hierarchy were undermined during efforts to contain a disruptive outbreak. I find that ceremonial changes weakened organizational members’ commitment to existing hierarchies, sometimes helping junior members bring their expertise to settings usually reserved for senior members, but at other times leading to tensions and difficulty coordinating expertise. Based on these findings, I propose that institutionalized organizations can encourage flexible use of authority in a two-step process in which ceremonies emphasizing status distinctions are first replaced then senior members build consensus around new rules, norms, and beliefs that coordinate expertise.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines Regent Park, a public housing community in Toronto, Ontario undergoing mixed-income revitalization through a public-private partnership (3P) since 2006. Much of the existing literature has studied the Regent Park revitalization from the perspective of public housing tenants, conceptualizing the project as a continuation of redevelopment efforts in the United States. However, this approach neglects the unique Canadian policy context and the point-of-view of industry professionals involved in the development process. Using Toronto as the primary lens of geographic analysis to study the revitalization, a qualitative, mixed-methods approach was employed in this thesis to focus on the local policy context and perspective of individuals involved in the Regent Park redevelopment process. Data was gathered, primarily, through interviews with 25 public and private sector professionals. Subsequent analysis generated several findings and recommendations for application at Regent Park and 3P redevelopment efforts in Toronto and other cities. Where many recent studies depict the Regent Park revitalization as having an overall negative outcome for public housing tenants and other public shareholders, this thesis, in contrast, found that the project is delivering notable social benefits to Regent Park and surrounding communities, while avoiding the displacement of low-income residents characteristic of public housing redevelopment in the US. Western governments have increasingly partnered with the private sector to deliver services and infrastructure over the last 30 years. It is therefore imperative to explore a diversity of perspectives to improve the outcomes of 3P social service delivery in the future, as this thesis does by understanding the viewpoints of development industry professionals in Toronto.</description>

   <title>Analysis of Clay Minerals in the Mudflats of Sulfate-Rich Saline Lakes</title>

   <description>Clay minerals are important targets for interpreting past environments due to their ubiquity on the surface of terrestrial planets, sensitivity to the prevailing geochemical conditions, and ability to preserve biosignatures. Modern saline lakes that develop sulfate-rich brines are less extensively analyzed due to their relative scarcity compared to those that develop bicarbonate-rich brines. Moreover, most modern sulfate-rich systems are small in area (&lt;100 km2), playa dominated, and rich in detritus making them difficult to sample and to study. Yet, the number and diversity of these lakes makes them important for understanding authigenic mineral formation. The goal of this study was to evaluate authigenic and detrital minerals in the mudflats of sulfate-rich saline lakes.&#xd;
This research focused on microscale (cm) investigations of the mudflats from 23 lakes from the Great Plains of southern Saskatchewan, Canada, and Andean Plateau, Bolivia for a total of 407 sediment samples. For detrital-rich sediments, authigenic illite was consistently found within sand lenses of the mudflats, was rich in Al, Mg, and Fe, and displayed lath-like morphologies. Uncommon minerals were also found containing elements usually in minor/trace quantities that concentrate in the closed-basins. In Laguna Chiar Khota, Bolivia for example, the arsenic-rich minerals realgar and hörnesite were found within the mudflats. Lastly, this thesis demonstrates that the biologically-mediated uptake of silica by diatoms can shift the geochemical parameters within the lakes, where Mg-smectite form instead of sepiolite in an otherwise silica-rich environment.  &#xd;
Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of authigenic clay formation recognizing similarities between these highly diverse environments. In detrital-rich environments where authigenic minerals are difficult to identify, such as the deltaic-lacustrine deposits in Gale crater, Mars, this study shows that authigenic illite can be found within the sand-lenses of the mudflats. Moreover, this study also shows that we need to consider the factors of diatom dissolution with respect to dissolved silica. The influence of diatoms on the phyllosilicates in brackish lakes suggests we may need to examine the modes of formation for sepiolite in ancient deposits, which may be forming from post depositional alteration of the lacustrine sediments.</description>

   <description>YAG:Ce phosphors have become widely used as blue/yellow light converters in camera projectors, white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) and general lighting applications. Many studies have been published on the production, characterization, and analysis of this optical ceramic but few have been done on determining optimal synthesis conditions. In this work, YAG:Ce phosphors were synthesized through solid state mixing and sintering. The synthesized powders and the highest quality commercially available powders were pressed and sintered to high densities and their photoluminescence (PL) intensity measured. The optimization process involved the sintering temperature, sintering time, annealing temperature and the level of Ce concentration. In addition to the PL intensity, samples were also characterized using particle size analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PL data was compared with data produced from a YAG:Ce phosphor sample provided by Christie Digital. The peak intensities of the samples were converted to a relative percentage of this industry product. The highest value for the intensity of the commercial powder was measured for a Ce concentration of 0.3 mole% with a sintering temperature of 1540°C and a sintering dwell time of 7 hours. The optimal processing parameters for the in-house synthesized powder were slightly different from those of commercial powders. The optimal Ce concentration was 0.4 mole% Ce, sintering temperature was 1560°C and sintering dwell time was 10 hours. These optimal conditions produced a relative intensity of 94.20% and 95.28% for the in-house and commercial powders respectively. Polishing of these samples resulted in an increase of ~5% in the PL intensity.</description>

   <description>In queer social histories, the city has been privileged as a normative space for queer identity and social progress to be actualized. Compared with urban spaces, rural spaces continue to be perceived as always dangerous and antagonistic for people who identify as queer. In cinema with queer images, this narrative of the rural as hostile is being challenged by films with queer images that contain positive narratives within a rural or non-urban milieu. In other words, these films are presenting counter-narratives to what scholar Jack Halberstam has called metronormativity. Under a metronormative optic, it is assumed that queer people in a rural space will adopt the spatial narrative of movement from that rural space to an urban space. In 2016, three Argentine films were released that challenged metronormative assumptions: Marco Berger and Martín Farina’s Taekwondo, Papu Curotto’s Esteros, and Lucas Santa Ana’s Como una novia sin sexo / Bromance. Through the representation of queer desire in rural spaces, these films offer a counter-narrative to the privileging of the urban in queer sociality. Through close readings of these three films that take into consideration sexual fluidity, bodily experience, and their intersections with natural elements and iconography, it is evident that there is a contemporary impulse to cinematically convey queer rurality, an understudied and overlooked phenomenon.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I primarily investigate the phenomenological implications of the television series Magnificent Century. Following phenomenology’s objective of assessing the essential meaning structures of our embodied experiences, I chart the major contours of the series’ socio-cultural resonances for our contemporaneous context of living. I first suggest that Magnificent Century’s worldwide popularity relies on its central character Hurrem’s alignment with postfeminist sensibilities of our age. Then, I set out to demonstrate that gendered power reversals as well as gender role reversals constitute the series’ main affective magnets. Third, I investigate the co-constructive relationship between masculinity and nationhood in the way it is built upon the combined denigration of femininity, foreignness, and peripheral masculinities. A major point of emphasis is to locate and reflect on the series’ performances of various forms of neoliberal imaginaries and affectivities. In the last two chapters of the thesis, my attention turns to Magnificent Century’s specific cultural work on Turkey’s memoryscape. I analyze the socio-cultural functioning of myths of innocence and originary identity for the Turkish populace. A central concern for me is to investigate the series’ simultaneous celebrations and denunciations of imperial nostalgia. I closely analyze the cultural politics of melancholia and nostalgia in Turkey through its imprints in the series. I conclude the thesis through an investigation of one of the greatest media events of recent years in Turkey, the execution of Prince Mustafa, with an objective to understand the socio-cultural reasons that lie beneath unparalleled degrees of public reaction to young prince’s televised murder.</description>

   <description>Peripheral pain signaling reflects a balance of pro and anti-nociceptive influences; the contribution by the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota to this balance has received little attention. GI disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with exaggerated visceral nociceptive actions that may involve altered microbial signaling, particularly given the evidence for bacterial dysbiosis in these conditions.  Despite ongoing research, the cellular mechanisms underpinning bacterial modulation of visceral pain remain incompletely understood.  Accordingly, we tested whether a community of commensal GI bacteria derived from a healthy human donor (microbial ecosystem therapeutics; MET-1) could alter the excitability of small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from mice. Additionally, we tested whether perturbation of the healthy GI microbiota in vivo by antibiotic administration could also alter neuronal excitability in mice.  Furthermore, we examined whether nociceptive signaling in a humanized IBS mouse model could be modulated by a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates, an intervention known to alter GI microbiota and improve overall symptoms of IBS patients. Exposure of DRG neurons to supernatant from MET-1 reduced their excitability by significantly increasing rheobase by 32% compared to controls (p=0.0003). The effect of MET-1 was mediated in part by serine proteases through activation of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-4. Perturbation of gut microbiota in vivo by administration of non-absorbable antibiotics increased thermal somatic pain responses by 16% (p=0.008) and increased the excitability of DRG neurons by decreasing rheobase by 22% (p=0.0039) compared to controls. The increase in excitability of DRG neurons was reversible, independent of immune activation and not restricted to DRG neurons that innervate the gut. Supernatant from the colonic mucosa of mice colonized with the microbiota of IBS patients and fed a diet high in fermentable carbohydrates increased the excitability of DRG neurons by decreasing rheobase up to 24% compared to mice fed a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates (p=0.0002). The increase in excitability of DRG neurons appeared to be due to histamine and proteases. Together, these results indicate that pain signaling can be modulated by microbiota-neuronal interactions. Therefore, therapies that induce or correct microbial dysbiosis may affect visceral pain.</description>

   <subject>Racialization of Immigrants</subject>
   <description>A common narrative of “successful” immigrants often depicts individuals who are hard working, resilient in adverse situations, and have a positive can-do attitude. Such characterization of newcomers attributes immigrant success to individualistic qualities and ultimately fails to acknowledge systemic barriers that immigrants encounter in their efforts to settle and integrate in Canada. Using immigrant success stories published by immigrant settlement service provider organizations (SPOs) in Ontario, this study is informed by Foucault’s concepts and other theories of race and racialization as a framework to examine the discourses and practices mobilized within immigrant settlement sector. Neo-liberalism is analyzed from the perspective of governmentality as a multitude of rationalities, practices, and techniques linked to governing mechanisms that (re)produce responsibilized citizen-subjects. I examine the ways in which the shift towards a more unstable and competitive funding regime since the 1990s have resulted in the marketization and de-politicization of settlement support for newcomers. Inscription devices are thus essential neo-liberal techniques through which the state funders can govern the settlement service agencies and their clients “at a distance.” Furthermore, I discuss a “triangulated” racial framework and various citizen and non-citizen subjects to consider the racializing effects of constructing a figure of an ideal immigrant. I argue that the stories suggest ideal immigrants are enterprising subjects who make “rational” and “reasonable” choices to think and behave in particular ways. Structural barriers that immigrants encounter in their efforts to settle in Canada are thus de-politicized as personal issues and immigrants are responsibilized for their own settlement and integration. I particularly problematize “Canadian experience” as a discourse to deconstruct the racializing effects for immigrants who are de-skilled and forced to participate in precarious and unpaid work. The findings of this study suggest that, within neo-liberal governmentality, particular practices, techniques, and discourses are mobilized by state funders and settlement service providers to reproduce certain subjectivities and realities for new immigrants in Canada that ultimately have racializing, responsibilizing, de-politicizing effects.</description>

   <title>Large-Eddy and Wall-Modeled Simulations of Turbulent Flow Over Two-dimensional River Dunes</title>

   <description>The Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) technique is only applicable to wall-bounded flows at moderate Reynolds numbers due to its computational cost. Wall-layer models are designed to extend the LES concept to engineering flows at high Reynolds numbers by bypassing the near-wall region and modeling its effects on the outer flow.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, large-eddy and hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)/LES calculations are performed for turbulent flow over a two-dimensional dune geometry. A Lagrangian dynamic eddy-viscosity model is applied for resolved LES computations. Also, Wall-Modeled LES (WMLES) calculations are performed using models of the Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) family based on Spalart &amp; Allmaras (1992) turbulence model, including DES, Delayed DES (DDES), and Improved DDES (IDDES). Simulations are carried out at two different Reynolds numbers, Re_b = 18 900 and 50 000, based on bulk velocity and average dune height. Wall-resolved LES calculations are used to investigate the accuracy of the present wall-layers.&#xd;
&#xd;
Compared to attached, equilibrium flows or flows with a mild separation, a higher accuracy was achieved in prediction of the mean and second order statistics using all the present hybrid methods. Large, three-dimensional eddies are generated due to the instability of the shear layer after flow separation at the dune crest. As they convect downstream with the mean flow, these eddies interact with the near-wall flow and act as a mechanism to increase the eddy-generation at the RANS/LES interface. As a result, the interface between the RANS and LES regions moves toward the bed and leads to a more realistic turbulence cycle in the RANS region.&#xd;
&#xd;
Considering both the first and second order statistics, as well as the flow physics included in the instantaneous turbulent field of the simulation, the IDDES model resulted in a higher level of accuracy compared to the DES and DDES methods at all the tested Reynolds numbers. However, the same grid density as the two other models might lead to noise propagations over the reattachment region. To resolve this issue it might be necessary to refine the mesh in wall-parallel directions (streamwise and spanwise directions) when using IDDES as the wall-layer model.</description>

   <title>Theorizing Mass Incarceration: Analyzing Aboriginal Over-Representation in Light of Section 718.2(e) of the Canadian Criminal Code</title>

   <subject>Over-representation</subject>
   <description>This study assesses the impact of changes in Bill C-41 on Aboriginal offenders in Canada. Passed in September 1996, Bill C-41 amended the Criminal Code seeking to clarify sentencing principles. Section 718.2(e) instructs judges to use incarceration only as a last resort when appropriate. Although it indicates that Aboriginal offenders must be given special consideration, it does not provide specific conditions or parameters for its use, leaving it to the judges’ discretion. In 1999 some clarification was provided in the Supreme Court of Canada decision of R. v. Gladue. Gladue clarified the application of section 718.2(e) and highlighted its role in alleviating Aboriginal overrepresentation in prisons. &#xd;
This thesis considers the disproportionate incarceration levels of Aboriginal offenders in Canada and the effectiveness of 718.2(e) in ameliorating the problem. It examines judiciary reasoning for the application of section 718.2(e) in 21 published Court of Appeal cases. The study employs a constructivist, grounded theory approach to discourse analysis of extant case documents. Quantitative data are also used to identify trends in offenders’ backgrounds. &#xd;
Findings reveal that most cases involved male offenders between the ages of 18 and 34 with varying educational backgrounds. In most cases the offender pleaded guilty during the sentencing trial, had a prior record, and had made rehabilitative efforts post-sentencing. The overwhelming majority of offenders had experienced unfavourable upbringings and circumstances in their lives and abused alcohol and/or drugs. Analysis of judges’ sentencing and decision making process revealed five predominant themes: Protection of public rhetoric, Denunciation and Deterrence, Rehabilitation, Special Cases, and Considerations of Gladue. The majority of appeal cases were dismissed or maintained carceral outcomes.</description>

   <description>Surface water classification using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an established practice for monitoring flood hazards due to the high temporal and spatial resolution it provides. Surface water change is a dynamic process that varies both spatially and temporally, and can occur on various scales resulting in significant impacts on affected areas. Small-scale flooding hazards, caused by beaver dam failure, is an example of surface water change, which can impact nearby infrastructure and ecosystems. Assessing these hazards is essential to transportation and infrastructure maintenance. With current satellite missions operating in multiple polarizations, spatio-temporal resolutions, and frequencies, a comprehensive comparison between SAR products for surface water monitoring is necessary. In this thesis, surface water extent models derived from high resolution single-polarization TerraSAR-X (TSX) data, medium resolution dual-polarization TSX data and low resolution quad-polarization RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) data are compared. There exists a compromise between acquiring SAR data with a high resolution or high information content. Multi-polarization data provides additional phase and intensity information, which makes it possible to better classify areas of flooded vegetation and wetlands. These locations are often where fluctuations in surface water occur and are essential for understanding dynamic underlying processes. However, often multi-polarized data is acquired at a low resolution, which cannot image these zones effectively. High spatial resolution, single-polarization TSX data provides the best model of open water. However, these single-polarization observations have limited information content and are affected by shadow and layover errors. This often hinders the classification of other land cover types. The dual-polarization TSX data allows for the classification of flooded vegetation, but classification is less accurate compared to the quad-polarization RS-2 data. The RS-2 data allows for the discrimination of open water, marshes/fields and forested areas. However, the RS-2 data is less applicable to small scale surface water monitoring (e.g. beaver dam failure), due to its low spatial resolution. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of available SAR technology, an appropriate product can be chosen for a specific target application involving surface water change. This research benefits the eventual development of a space-based monitoring strategy over longer periods.</description>

   <description>Digital microfluidics is useful in miniaturizing different types of biological tests due to an ability to perform multiple operations on a single chip with a single common geometry. However, one of the largest problems in using digital microfluidics has been biofouling during these processes, a phenomenon which is exacerbated when using electric fields for fluid manipulation. Magnetic microfluidics is an alternative actuation mechanism, which does not have this same limitation. However, until recently it has been impossible to create drops, which can also be subsequently moved to perform multiple step analyses. In this thesis, a method for creating drops on superhydrophobic surfaces using magnetic force as the primary actuation mechanism is outlined. Using numerical simulations in Comsol Multiphysics, the method was explored to determine several of the limitations of the system, including the minimum actuatable volume (5 μL). Additionally, the flow within the drops was explored to obtain a better understanding of the experimental results. Experimental validation of the results followed, and it was found that the system showed a 1-to-1 linear change in drop volume relative to expected dispensed volume, verifying the theoretical model. Experimental validation found that the error of the system is constant over any dispensed volume at ±0.5 μL. The method was applied to miniaturize a standard test for hard water determination, a complexometric EDTA titration. The results from a specially designed chip are compared to a titration of a 10 mL volume of the same sample and two were found to be equal within error (100-170 ppm for the chip, 124±2 ppm for the standard method). The water hardness estimate from the chip was further improved upon by image analysis, and the range narrowed to 120±15 ppm, again within the same error as the standard method. Together with the theoretical analysis, this result verifies the practicality of the method for analytical operations. Finally, preliminary work into making the magnetic droplet manipulation method more general was conducted, and it was found to be possible to create chips which utilize any combination of droplet mixing, merging, moving, and splitting.</description>

   <description>Dust from the tailings at Giant mine, an abandoned mine in northern Canada, has been a concern among local residents, particularly those from Ndilo, a community of Yellowknives Dene First Nations located approximately 2.5km southeast of the site. The arsenic-bearing tailings at Giant mine are left vulnerable to high velocity winds after snow melt in the late spring, when it is too cold to apply a dust suppressant to the tailings. The main objective of this research is to characterize the fine fraction of the tailings (particles &lt;63µm in diameter) and dust that could be inhaled or ingested from Giant mine to identify the As-hosting solid phases therein. Surface tailings material was sampled from three of the tailings impoundments on site, and sieved to &lt;63µm. From May to July of 2016, a total suspended particulate (TSP) high volume air sampler was set up to continuously sample airborne material coming from the tailings. Bulk chemical data was determined via inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and -mass spectrometry (ICP-MS); mineralogical data via scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based automated mineralogy, electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), and synchrotron-based micro X-ray diffraction (µXRD), micro X-ray fluorescence (µXRF); and oxidation state data for As via X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Bulk chemical data show elevated concentrations of As, Sb, Zn, Pb, Cu, and Ni. The As in the tailings is a mix of As(I-), As(V), and As(III), and is more concentrated in the &lt;63µm fraction (3000 – 9300 ppm As) than in the unsieved tailings. Roaster-generated Fe-oxides (maghemite), Ca-Fe arsenate, and arsenopyrite comprise the majority of As-bearing particles in the surface tailings; Ca-Fe arsenate poses the greatest risk to human health of these three as it is the most bioaccessible. Fe-oxides were the only As-host found in the dust. Very little arsenic trioxide was found in the tailings, and no arsenic trioxide was found in the dust samples. However, previous studies have shown that the soils near the Giant mine tailings do contain arsenic trioxide from historic stack emissions, indicating that these soils might actually present a higher risk than the tailings themselves.</description>

   <description>In the field of geomechanics, one of the most important considerations during design is the state of stress that exists at the location of a project. Despite this, stress is often the most poorly understood site characteristic, given the current challenges in accurately measuring it. This stems from the fact that stress can’t be directly measured, but must be inferred by disturbing the rockmass and recording its response. Although some methods do exist for the prediction of in situ stress, this only provides a point estimate and is often plagued with uncertain results and practical limitations in the field. This research proposes a methodology of continuously predicting stress along a borehole through the back analysis of borehole breakout and how this same approach could be employed to predict excavation overbreak.&#xd;
	KGHM’s Victoria Project in Sudbury, Canada, was the location of data collection, which firstly involved site characterization through common geotechnical core logging procedures and laboratory scale intact core testing. Testing comprised Brazilian tensile strength and unconfined compressive strength testing, which involved the characterization of crack accumulation in both cases. &#xd;
	From two pilot holes, acoustic televiewer surveys were completed to characterize the occurrence and geometry of breakout. This was done to predict the orientation of major principal stresses in the horizontal axis, with the results being further validated by the geometry of stress-induced core disking. From the lab material properties and breakout geometries, a continuum based, back analysis of breakout was done through the creation of a generic database of stress dependent numerical models. When compared with the in situ breakout profiles, this created an estimate of stress as a function of depth along each hole. The consideration of the presence of borehole fluid on the estimate of stress was also made. This provided the upper-bound estimate of stress from this methodology. Given the generic nature of the numerical models, potential shaft overbreak was also assessed using this technique and from the previously described estimate of stress.</description>

   <description>Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability throughout developed countries. A propagating wave of mass depolarization of neurons and glia, referred to as spreading depolarization (SD), occurs within minutes after insufficient blood supply expands brain territory with depleted ATP and tissue damage. By harvesting live brain slices from mice that underwent focal stroke via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), we were able to image the ignition site of post-ischemic SD, assess the precise spatiotemporal propagation of the accompanying wave and record brain tissue changes in response to further metabolic stress. Post-MCAo brain slices superfused with elevated [K+]ext, [glu]ext or oxygen-and-glucose deprivation (OGD) display a decreased propensity to generate SD and tissue swelling in response to these extracellular conditions evident following stroke in vivo. Although this observation is counterintuitive to the high incidence of spontaneous SD observed in vivo by others two hours following ischemia, it is concordant with an ensuing period of decreased SD incidence. Furthermore, carbetapentane or dibucaine pre-treatment significantly delay SD onset in post-ischemic cerebral slices, similar to their effects in non-stroke brain slices. The healthy tissue observed immediately post-MCAo in the future ischemic core rapidly deteriorates during the ensuing 12 hours of infarct maturation. Although dramatic evidence of infarction occurs 12 hours following ischemia, a small and diffuse subset of pyramidal neurons in neocortex survives within the core. How they are protected and if they continue to survive post-MCAo are two intriguing issues for future study.&#xd;
     Overall, this thesis specifically assesses the initiation, propagation and tissue changes in response to isolated mediators of swelling and SD in the post-ischemic brain. The observations of a delayed latency to SD onset and decreased susceptibility of swelling of the early post-ischemic brain support previous hypotheses of an adaptive mechanism of the post-ischemic brain to prevent or limit further depolarizations. The post-ischemic resistance to SD was over-ridden by chemical blockade of the Na+/K+ pump (and SD induction) by 100 µM ouabain. This finding resonates with an initial hypothesis of SD resistance by Na+/K+ pump hyperactivation postulated by early investigators of SD.</description>

   <description>The practice of destress blasting to reduce the risk of strainbursting in mines has been used since the early 1950's. Understanding both the variability in causes of strainbursting and the method by which destress blasting could reduce its risk, will allow future researchers to develop better guidelines for destress blasting. This research examines records of strainbursts at three mines near Sudbury, finding that the current method of recording these events yields little information with a large amount of variability dependent on many factors. Significantly, a large proportion of the events had workers at the face at the same time as the events occurred, continuing to highlight the safety risk presented by strainbursting. In-situ trials were also completed, with numerical modelling finding that destress blasting could both increase and decrease stresses in the rock mass depending on the placement and damage zones of the explosive charges.</description>

   <description>Participation in regular exercise is important for the maintenance and improvement of brain health across the life span.  These beneficial effects are realized almost immediately, as a single bout of exercise transiently improves cognitive function after cessation of exercise.  This post-exercise time period represents an opportunity to strategically prescribe cognitively stimulating activities for enhancing brain plasticity and function.  Mechanistically, acute exercise is proposed to upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and increase regional activation and arousal of brain areas involved in cognitive control; however, the specific mechanisms underlying this facilitation are poorly understood.&#xd;
Purpose: 1) To investigate BDNF responses to small muscle mass exercise in order to probe a potential mechanism of BDNF release during exercise. 2) To create and validate an equipment-free exercise protocol for use in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, with the eventual goal of investigating brain responses during exercise that may underlie improved cognition. 3) To determine the effect of a very brief bout of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on neuroelectric indices of reinforcement learning in young adults.&#xd;
Methods: 1) serum BDNF, platelet, and the amount of BDNF per platelet responses were measured following short-duration, maximal effort and long-duration submaximal effort forearm handgrip exercise.  2) We assessed the magnitude and reliability of metabolic responses to a novel whole-body isometric contraction (WBI) exercise protocol.  We also characterized the amount of head movement created by WBI.  3) The event-related potential component associated with reward-based learning was assessed before and after a bout of HIIE.&#xd;
Results: 1) Forearm handgrip exercise significantly increased serum BDNF, platelets, and BDNF per platelet, suggesting the possibility of splenic and cellular contribution of BDNF in response to handgrip exercise.  2) WBI reliably evokes metabolic responses that are similar in magnitude to previous in-MRI studies, and creates head movement suitable for MRI scanning.  3) HIIE abolishes neuroelectric indices of reward learning, likely due to incomplete recovery from exercise.&#xd;
Conclusions: These findings advance our understanding of neurochemical and neuroelectric responses to acute exercise and introduce a novel tool that stands to further elucidate the regional brain responses to exercise that may underlie enhanced cognition post-exercise.</description>

   <title>Parents and Special Educators' Perspectives on the Sexuality Educational Needs of Learners with Intellectual Developmental Disabilities in Ghanaian Special Schools</title>

   <description>Despite the global efforts towards the inclusion of persons with disabilities in societies, Ghana's Educational Strategic Program is yet to include sexuality education for learners with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDDs) in special schools. Current social structures also exist to limit formally recognised sexual and reproductive access to persons with IDDs in Ghana. That notwithstanding, persons with IDDs have sexual needs like their non-disabled counterparts. In order to promote the sexualities of persons with IDDs in Ghana, this study sought to explore how parents and special educators construct and address the sexuality educational needs of learners with IDD in special schools. Realist Social constructionism and Sankofa (an anticolonial framework) served as the foundations for the study. It therefore acknowledged the role of impairment as a material reality as interacting with social realities. Taking into account the historical social, cultural, political and economic fabrics, which frame Ghanaian societies, and that parents and educators who are the primary agents of socialisation and advocates for these persons are a part of these communities, the study realised that learner's sexuality educational needs do not exist in a vacuum. They are constructed through experiences and interactions, with social and economic forces as well as parents' expectations for the future. The study took place in 5 out of 10 regions of the country and involved mostly interviews with parents and special educators. It is expected that the lessons gathered will be useful for the designing and implementation of sexuality education programmes for learners with IDD in Ghanaian special schools -programmes that resonate with the value systems of Ghanaian societies and serve as a step towards promotion of the sexualities of persons with IDDs in Ghana.</description>

   <description>This project explores autonomy-oriented currents within permaculture and anarchism. Drawing on a minor current of Western thought influenced by Baruch Spinoza, autonomy is reconceptualized as a situational process that entails both connection and separation. Autonomy is thus an always-partial departure from the toxic patterns nurtured by capitalism, white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, settler colonialism, state domination, and other forms of subjection. This investigation focuses on the way autonomy-oriented currents transform their own relationships and situations, rather than seeking to ameliorate Empire’s institutions. As a project-based thesis undertaken through Cultural Studies, this investigation involved a number of components in addition to this text, including a blog, co-authoring a book, and propagating perennials and fruit trees. These activities are drawn into conversation with other autonomy-oriented texts and practices, and their potentials and pitfalls are analyzed in relation to liberalism, morality, counterhegemony, academia, oppression, industrialization, militancy, and settler colonialism.</description>

   <description>Background: Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) are a family of chemicals that include benzene, toluene, and xylene. These three chemicals are ubiquitous agents that are present in a number of occupational and environmental circumstances. Currently, there is limited and inconsistent evidence to suggest that exposure to MAHs is associated with lung cancer in humans.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The primary objective of this thesis is to explore the associations of lifetime occupational exposure to MAHs and lung cancer risk. Secondary objectives include 1) investigating these associations stratified by smoking status, and, 2) exploring the associations between MAH exposures and major histological types of lung cancer.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: The data used in this thesis is from a Montréal-based case-control study of lung cancer conducted by a team of researchers led by Dr. Jack Siemiatycki of l’Université de Montréal. The final study population was comprised of male Canadian citizens with a total of 733 cases of lung cancer and 894 controls frequency matched on age and sex. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression was performed to assess the associations between MAH exposures and lung cancer.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Exposure to MAHs is suggestive of a slightly increased risk of lung cancer. Exposure to toluene and xylene is associated with an increased risk for adenocarcinoma of the lung. Substantial exposure to benzene is suggestive of an increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. There is no evidence to suggest that the risk of lung cancer associated with exposure to MAHs differs according to smoking history. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: The findings of this thesis suggest that occupational exposure to MAHs may be associated with increased risk of lung cancer. These findings contribute to the literature, which currently lacks quality studies reporting on the carcinogenic effects of toluene and xylene. In addition, these findings build on the growing body of evidence that suggests benzene-exposed workers are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.</description>

   <description>This Master’s research paper aims to provide an analysis of the symbolic role of three unique and multi-faceted objects in children’s portraits and pedagogical theory in seventeenth- century Dutch painting: the dog, the apple, and the rinkelbel. This paper will examine a wide range of the visual material in children’s portraiture which is derived from prints and genre- paintings. Often the imagery and its associations may be traced back to classical and biblical sources which remained prevalent throughout the culture of the seventeenth-century in the Dutch Republic and its Flemish borders. The analysis seeks to provide a thorough discussion of seventeenth-century educational sources, such as manuals and treatises, as well as their relationship to prominent attributes like the dog, the apple, and the rinkelbel in Dutch and Flemish children’s portraits. As well, this paper seeks to provide a discussion concerning the value of the child’s civic education and role in the vitality of the Dutch Republic. The role of childhood educators, including parental figures, older siblings, and wet nurses, and their depiction in children’s portraiture is also examined.</description>

   <description>As the burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) continues to rise, increasing efforts are directed to innovate screening tools for the detection of vulnerable plaque and the vulnerable patient. Vulnerable plaque lesions are thought to be specific lesions responsible for the majority of cardiovascular events, and are generally characterized by a large lipid core and a thin fibrous cap. Recent advances in ultrasound offer novel techniques to characterize various aspects of plaque vulnerability.&#xd;
&#xd;
This study investigated two approaches for evaluating plaque vulnerability. Specifically, a density-based plaque phantom was developed for the evaluation of plaque echogenicity, a feature of plaque vulnerability that can be characterized by Grayscale Median (GSM) analysis. It was found that plaque density has a significant positive linear correlation with plaque echogenicity. Another phantom model of simulated heterogeneous plaque lesions was developed for the evaluation of plaque composition, a feature of plaque vulnerability that can be characterized by colourized Pixel Distribution Analysis (PDA), a novel tissue characterization technique. Two sets of GSM ranges associated with specific tissue types were established. Percentages of gray pixels identified in the correct tissue GSM range from colourized PDA were compared between the two sets of GSM ranges we established, and a previously reported set of tissue GSM ranges. Our tissue GSM ranges of: echolucent plastisol 0-4, muscle 68-86 (Neck muscle and leg muscle) and 104-108 (abdomen muscle), fat 87-100 (visceral fat) and bone 145-175, detected a greater percentage of pixels within the correct tissue type in comparison to the two other sets of ranges. &#xd;
&#xd;
It is anticipated that the phantoms developed will serve as an ex vivo platform for the optimization of vulnerable plaque imaging technologies, allowing for timely and cost-effective development of ultrasound probes, software, contrast agents, and drug delivery systems for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The research presented in this thesis has focused on developing ultrasound analysis techniques to better stratify patients by their risk of ACVD. Atherosclerotic plaque lesions, specifically vulnerable plaque lesions, may not be apparent by conventional diagnostic modalities. This research can improve diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

   <title>Two Hundred Wildflowers: Annora Brown’s Botanical Watercolours, Scientific Illustration, and Conservationism in Alberta</title>

   <description>Between 1958 and 1960, artist Annora Brown conceived and compiled over two hundred botanical watercolours for the Glenbow Museum. Brown created a body of work that was documentary in nature but also imbued with personal meaning and aesthetic appeal. Her distinctive approach to botanical illustration challenges how scientific information is categorized and communicated in Western culture, and reflects shifting perceptions of the Alberta environment in the twentieth century. The commission was inspired by the publication of Old Man’s Garden (1954), a book written by Brown to fill a gap in the understanding of plants indigenous to the prairie and foothill regions. The book was exceptional in its incorporation of the practical knowledge and lore of southern Alberta First Nation’s communities (specifically Treaty Seven Nations the Piikani and Kainai) with the accounts of early European explorers, Western folklore, literature, and scientific information. This thesis connects Brown’s approach to communicating botanical information in Old Man’s Garden with the artwork she produced for the commission, and analyzes how both projects subvert traditional models of scientific text and illustration. I contextualize Brown’s work within larger frameworks of botanical study in Canada and the early conservation movement in Alberta, and reflect upon how the commission speaks to the connection between landscape and identity.</description>

   <description>An emerging treatment for peripheral arterial disease is the transplantation of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) by intramuscular (IM) injection to improve limb perfusion by paracrine-mediated angiogenesis and immunomodulation. However, effective clinical translation has been limited due to poor cell retention and survival in ischemic muscle. This thesis focused on the design and in vitro/in vivo evaluation of an injectable hydrogel to improve ASC retention and function following IM delivery.&#xd;
Initial work developed an injectable, in situ-gelling hydrogel designed specifically to encapsulate ASCs and withstand the mechanical loading of the IM environment. The hydrogel consisted of two polymers: methacrylated glycol chitosan functionalized with a cell-adhesive RGD peptide, selected to support ASC retention and survival, and a triblock copolymer of poly(trimethylene carbonate)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(trimethylene carbonate) diacrylate, designed to improve mechanical resilience. Following in vitro injection and crosslinking within the hydrogel, encapsulated human ASCs demonstrated high viability (>90%) over two weeks under normoxic and hypoxic (2% O2) conditions. The release of angiogenic and chemotactic cytokines from encapsulated ASCs was enhanced under hypoxia, suggesting that the hydrogel can support ASC retention and paracrine function under ischemic conditions. &#xd;
Subsequent studies investigated the angiogenic and inflammatory responses to the IM injection of allogeneic rat ASCs in the hydrogel, the hydrogel alone, and ASCs in saline using a healthy, immunocompetent rat model. Immunohistochemical analysis over 4 weeks demonstrated that encapsulated ASCs were retained at a higher density and promoted CD68+ macrophage recruitment, as well as M1 (CD68+CCR7+) macrophage infiltration and M2c (CD163+) macrophage polarization at the hydrogel periphery. Coincident with enhanced macrophage infiltration, significantly more blood vessels were observed surrounding and within the hydrogels with ASCs compared to the hydrogels alone.&#xd;
The therapeutic effects of the IM injection of human ASCs in the hydrogel, the hydrogel alone, ASCs in saline, and saline alone were compared in an immunocompromised NOD/SCID mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. While there were no differences observed in limb perfusion or function at 28 days, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hydrogel-delivered ASCs were well retained and significantly improved the IM capillary density and enhanced cell proliferation, indicating that the cell delivery approach stimulated localized angiogenesis.</description>

   <description>This thesis discusses some of the critiques of modern moral theories (deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics) posed by Elizabeth Anscombe, Michael Stocker, Bernard Williams, and Susan Wolf. It focuses on Stocker’s challenge that when subjects try to act on such theories they become self-effacing in that they create a divide between one’s reasons and one’s motives. This study argues that in consequence such modern ethical theories have serious difficulties in dealing with the issues these philosophers raise.  Nevertheless, while valuing their contributions, I attempt to formulate a more plausible solution to the problems of morality systems. &#xd;
&#xd;
In particular, I argue that these approaches have not dealt adequately with the following questions: If morality systems are repressive and exclude the personal life, why are they still so influential? Why have not people rid themselves of systems that act to the detriment of ethical life? To address such issues, with the intention of understanding how morality systems operate, I turn to Michel Foucault’s concept of disciplinary power. After discussing the problem of the pervasiveness of modern ethical theories, I conclude by making a case for Foucault’s ethics of the care of the self as a way of addressing the problems raised by Stocker and others.</description>

   <description>Graft copolymers of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) were synthesized and used to coat cotton fabrics with the use of poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether as a crosslinker. The copolymer was applied to the fabrics via a CHCl3 solution, and secured on the surface by a network of epoxy-amine bonds between the PEI and crosslinker units. The coated fabrics were used to separate and recover oil from surfactant-stabilised, oil-in-water emulsions. The composition of the graft copolymer and obtained coating solutions was varied to determine the effects on separation performance and repeatability. Optimal oil flux and recovery was obtained from coatings composed of high molecular-weight PEI which contained a high percentage of grafted PDMS units. Highly-crosslinked coatings demonstrated repeatable and consistent separation performance, and were able to recover the vast majority of emulsified oil from hexadecane-in-water emulsions stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The de-emulsification properties of the optimized coatings may facilitate their use in wastewater remediation or oil recovery from contaminated environments.</description>

   <description>Software development guidelines are a set of rules which can help improve the quality of software. These rules are defined on the basis of experience gained by the software development community over time. This research focuses on finding a set of design guidelines for model-based development of complex real-time embedded software systems. To be precise, we propose nine design conventions, three design patterns and twenty antipatterns for developing UML-RT models. These guidelines have been identified based on our analysis of around 100 UML-RT models from industry and academia. Most of the guidelines are explained with the help of examples, and standard templates from the current state of the art are used for documenting the design rules.&#xd;
&#xd;
Tool support is provided for a subset of the proposed guidelines in the form an Eclipse plug-in. This allows UML-RT practitioners to detect any occurrences of the supported design flaws automatically. Evaluation is done involving practitioners from both industry and academia to determine the utility of the proposed guidelines to the UML-RT community and the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the provided tool support.</description>

   <description>This thesis contains three essays spanning the ﬁelds of ﬁnancial market microstructure and empirical ﬁnance. The ﬁrst essay focuses on reviewing the recent key innovations in trading technology–high frequency trading. I developed a theoretical model to shed light on the eﬀects of high frequency trading on market liquidity especially during stressed market conditions. Many investors and regulators are concerned that high frequency liquidity provision is selective and limited to periods of low stress. However, I ﬁnd that high frequency liquidity providers improve market liquidity especially during high volatility periods because speed can help to mitigate the market friction caused by asymmetric information. The second and third essays examine applications of a recently developed fractionally cointegrated vector autoregressive (FCVAR) model to commodity spot and futures price data. The second essay, co-authored with Sepideh Dolatabadi and Morten Ø. Nielsen, investigates the contribution of commodity spot and futures markets to price discovery using a FCVAR model. Compared to the results from the non-fractional model, we ﬁnd slightly more evidence of price discovery in the commodity spot market. The third essay, co-authored with Sepideh Dolatabadi, Paresh K. Narayan and Morten Ø. Nielsen, focuses on forecasting commodity spot and futures returns using FCVAR models and examining the proﬁtability of a dynamic (mean-variance) trading strategy based on the FCVAR forecasts. We generally ﬁnd that the fractional model generates higher proﬁts on average compared to the non-fractional CVAR model.</description>

   <description>Information-centric Networks (ICNs) offer a promising paradigm for the future Internet to cope with an ever increasing growth in data and shifts in access models. Different architectures of ICNs, including Named Data Networks (NDNs) are designed around content distribution, where data is the core entity in the network instead of hosts. Given the amount of forecast traffic by mobile users, supporting mobility in NDNs to maintain seamless operation is one of the main challenges yet to be resolved. Accordingly, attempts at handling mobility in NDNs in the literature are mostly studied under simplistic or special cases, and relied on content retransmission as a fallback. This is in addition to the lack of benchmarking tools to analyze and compare such schemes.&#xd;
In this thesis, we investigate how predicting the future state of the network can enable seamless support of mobility in NDN. We propose a set of proactive benchmark solutions which exploit location and data traffic prediction to deliver the content of mobile users (both Consumers and Producers) under application delay constraints. Particularly, the network detects roaming users and caches their prospective content ahead of handover events while considering the maximum tolerable delay and network overheads. Unlike existing literature that focused solely on Consumer mobility, we also handle Producer mobility that impacts the content availability and Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, we introduce a practical mobility management scheme that is resilient to prediction uncertainties using stochastic optimization. A guided heuristic search algorithm is also developed to provide real-time near-optimal caching decisions instead of commercial solvers that suffer from poor scalability. &#xd;
All benchmark and heuristic schemes proposed in this thesis are evaluated using a comprehensive assessment framework, which is also used to assess the state-of-the-art NDN mobility support. Simulation results show that our proposed solutions maintain user’s QoS during mobility events. We believe that such results drive incentives for deploying proactive mobility management in future NDN.</description>

   <title>Behavioural Evidence for the Existence of Gist and Detail Episodic Memory Representations: A Factor Analytic Approach</title>

   <description>Episodic memory refers to the conscious encoding and retrieval of previously experienced events. Episodic memory representations may either be detailed and precise, or may just capture the gist, or the essence, of an event. In this thesis, I conducted a preliminary test of the relationships between gist and detail memory domains within episodic memory. I assembled a small task battery incorporating twelve tasks that appeared to address memory for gist and detail. One hundred and four participants from a university community completed the entire task battery in a single two-hour session. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), potential latent factors that explained the variance in memory performance found in the dataset were evaluated. Two possible factor structures were predicted: 1) a two-factor model with separate gist and detail factors, or 2) a four-factor model that further categorized the gist/detail constructs into verbal and visual components (i.e., verbal gist, visual gist, verbal detail, and visual detail). One-factor, two-factor, and four-factor CFA models were tested, as well as two-factor and four-factor exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) models. According to the CFA analysis, a two-factor solution with separate Gist and Detail factors fit the data well on the absolute fit indices (RMSEA and SRMR), but fell short on the incremental fit indices (TLI and CFI). According to the ESEM analysis, a two-factor model fit the data well on three out of the four fit indices, and fit the data significantly better than the two-factor CFA solution. Both four-factor models were misspecified, likely due to the low sample size. In conclusion, the tasks in the battery do not seem to all be part of the same construct, but instead load on at least two separate factors that somewhat represent gist and detail constructs. Future research should firstly, replicate and extend the current findings using a larger sample size. Secondly, test if individual differences in the reliance on these two sub-domains can predict participants’ non-memory traits and abilities.</description>

   <description>Despite recent advances in clinical oncology, prostate cancer remains a major health concern in men, where current detection techniques still lead to both over- and underdiagnosis. More accurate prediction and detection of prostate cancer can improve disease management and treatment outcome.&#xd;
&#xd;
Temporal Enhanced Ultrasound (TeUS) is a promising imaging approach that can help identify tissue-specifi c patterns in time-series of ultrasound data and, in turn, differentiate between benign and malignant tissues. We introduce a probabilistic temporal framework, based on hidden Markov models, for modeling ultrasound time series data obtained from prostate cancer patients. The proposed models capture the temporal signatures of tissue-speci fic responses to prolonged sonication. Our results show improved prediction of malignancy compared to previously reported results,&#xd;
where we identify cancerous regions with over 85.6% accuracy.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, adopting this approach in diagnostic procedures requires understanding of the physical properties of TeUS and its interactions with tissues. We therefore utilize our probabilistic modeling approach to examine two properties of TeUS signals - temporal order and length - and present a new framework to assess their impact on tissue information. Our results strongly indicate that temporal order has signi ficant impact on TeUS performance, and it thus plays a important role in conveying tissue-specifi c information. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of reducing the duration of data collection to shorten the sequences while maintaining sufficient information for tissue typing.&#xd;
&#xd;
To investigate the tissue characteristics interrogated by TeUS, we compare the predictions of our models with malignancy markings on multi-parametric magnetic resonance images. Our fi ndings show that the proposed models have the highest&#xd;
agreement in detecting cancer with Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) sequences as compared to Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps and T2-Weighted (T2W) images. Hence, this agreement suggests that the effect of agiogenesis, visualized on DCE images, may also be detected using TeUS, and, in turn, paving the way for further investigation about tissue characteristics captured by TeUS.</description>

   <description>This thesis is primarily divided into two distinct experimental programs evaluating: 1) the&#xd;
thermal performance and, 2) the structural performance of straw bale construction.&#xd;
The thermal performance chapter describes hot-box testing (based on ASTM C1363-11)&#xd;
of seven straw bale wall panels to obtain their apparent thermal conductivity values. All&#xd;
panels were constructed with stacked bales and cement-lime plaster skins on each side of&#xd;
the bales. Four panels were made with traditional, 2-string field bales of densities ranging&#xd;
from 89.5 kg/m3 – 131 kg/m3 and with the bales on-edge (fibres perpendicular to the heat&#xd;
flow). Three panels were made with manufactured high-density bales (291 kg/m3 – 372&#xd;
kg/m3). The fibres of the manufactured bales were randomly oriented. The key&#xd;
conclusion of this work is that within the experimental error, there is no difference in the&#xd;
apparent thermal conductivity value for panels using normal density bales and&#xd;
manufactured high-density bales up to a density of 333 kg/m3.&#xd;
The structural performance chapter describes gravity and transverse load testing (based&#xd;
on ASTM E72-15) of non-plastered modular straw bale wall (DBW) panels to evaluate&#xd;
their strength capacity and failure modes. The out-of-plane flexural (OPF) tests exhibited&#xd;
a mean ultimate bending moment of 49.7 kNm. The axial compression (AC) tests&#xd;
exhibited a mean ultimate line load of 161.0 kN/m. The local flexural header beam (HP)&#xd;
tests exhibited an ultimate line load of 31.6 kN/m. The OPF and AC capacities of the&#xd;
DBW exceeded the capacities exhibited by a conventional 38 mm x 140 mm stud wall.&#xd;
However, the DBW’s header beam strength and stiffness was inferior to conventional&#xd;
stud wall.</description>

   <description>Inflammation is a common characteristic of many pathological conditions, but it can play different roles depending on the source and pathways involved. By measuring cytokines, the signaling molecules of the immune system, we aimed to identify and evaluate the relative contribution of certain pathways in the development of two reproductive disorders: endometriosis and cervical insufficiency. In endometriosis, the pathways leading to the growth of endometrium outside the uterine cavity have not been elucidated, and whether inflammation is a result or trigger of endometriotic lesion growth is not known. In Chapter 2, we showed that 18 out of 26 cytokines were higher in the plasma of women with endometriosis compared to normal women. Also, surgical removal of endometriotic lesions altered circulating cytokine levels, indicating that lesions actively contribute to inflammation in endometriosis. In Chapter 3, we targeted inflammation in endometriosis using flavocoxid, an inhibitor of the eicosanoid pathway, and beta-caryophyllene, a cannabinoid 2 receptor agonist. Our experiments in human cell lines and a mouse model of endometriosis revealed a complex role of inflammation in endometriotic lesion growth and a potential interplay between the eicosanoid and cannabinoid pathways. In Chapter 4, we applied our knowledge of cytokine signaling to evaluate the role inflammation in cervical insufficiency, a pregnancy complication that can lead to recurrent midtrimester pregnancy losses and preterm birth. We showed that women with cervical insufficiency have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than normal women, but only in cervicovaginal fluid, not in serum. Furthermore, cervical cerclage placement decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in cervicovaginal fluid only, indicating that inflammation is locally driven and can be decreased by intervention. In summary, this thesis provided important insights about the role of inflammation in these two conditions and the specific pathways that are involved and could be targeted for research and therapeutic purposes.</description>

   <description>During the past two decades, the civil engineering community has shown interest in applications of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement in concrete structures as an alternative to steel reinforcement because of enhanced durability. However, the performance of FRP in fire for applications in buildings demands more profound insights. The lack of adequate information on material characteristics at high temperatures for glass FRP (GFRP) bars creates uncertainty regarding the performance of GFRP reinforced concrete members in fire. This dissertation aims to characterize and understand the fundamental properties of GFRP reinforcing bars at high temperature and to evaluate the performance of GFRP reinforced concrete slabs in fire through full-scale fire testing and numerical modelling. This dissertation provides original and new insights to enhance the confidence of structural design engineers when considering fire resistance in design of GFRP reinforced concrete elements.&#xd;
The research is conducted in three separate but integrated streams: material testing, full-scale fire testing, and numerical modelling. Material tests are conducted on GFRP reinforcing bars to understand their behaviour including tensile strength and bond strength at high temperatures. Two sets of full-scale fire tests are studied to evaluate the performance of GFRP reinforced concrete slabs at the component level. The finite element (FE) numerical modelling includes both heat transfer analysis and structural analysis of GFRP reinforced concrete slabs, and incorporates the results of the material tests to estimate the fire resistance of GFRP reinforced concrete slabs. The FE model is validated against the results of the full-scale fire tests (Chapters 5 and 6).&#xd;
This thesis shows that existing prescriptive procedures, based on strength criteria alone, for evaluating the fire resistance of conventional structures are not applicable to GFRP reinforced concrete because such procedures fail to recognize that the design of GFRP reinforced concrete structures is governed by serviceability rather than by strength. Thus, more rational approaches for considering the fire resistance of GFRP reinforced concrete structures are developed which consider appropriate stresses in GFRP bars under service loads, the bond strength of the GFRP to concrete interface at high temperatures, and tensile strength at high temperatures.   &#xd;
The objectives of the research are attained by enhancing the understanding of GFRP reinforcing bars and the performance of GFRP reinforced concrete slabs under heat effects.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the role of sympathy in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s influential writings and lectures on Shakespeare. By the early nineteenth century, many Britons regarded Shakespeare as a literary genius and their national poet. But they also saw Shakespeare as a problematic figure because his plays did not conform to Enlightenment standards of morality and neoclassical aesthetics. Coleridge uses the idea of sympathy, a common topic in eighteenth-century moral philosophy and aesthetics, to put forward a new critical framework for understanding and appreciating Shakespeare. Sympathy informs how Coleridge understands Shakespeare’s artistic method. Like his eighteenth-century predecessors, Coleridge sees Shakespeare as emblematic of the “sympathetic imagination.” Shakespeare, Coleridge says, developed characters according to pre-existing principles of human psychology; he would then use sympathy to understand (and therefore represent) how a character might behave in certain dramatic situations given their psychology. As a result of this artistic process, Shakespeare’s characters possess what Coleridge calls “organic regularity.” For Coleridge, the organic regularity of Shakespeare’s characters contributes to their lifelikeness and serves as the organizing principle of Shakespeare’s drama. It also permits the reader to sympathize with Shakespeare’s characters to an unusual extent. Looking at Coleridge’s own sympathetic relationship with Shakespeare’s characters, I suggest that the reader’s sympathy provides both a mechanism for interpreting Shakespeare’s plays as well as a source of poetic inspiration.</description>

   <description>Background: People facing extended periods of homelessness, whose daily routines are often highly structured around securing basic necessities, exhibit a remarkable degree of agency and resilience procuring food. Within this geography if food acquisition, what happens in and along the way also becomes deeply embedded in complex social and spatial processes – or foodscapes. Purpose: By exploring people’s shifting foodscapes during the transition from homelessness into permanent housing, this study aims to shed light on how daily activities involving food can impact a person’s sense of health and wellbeing. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten people enrolled in scattered-site independent and congregate living arrangements in Kingston, Ontario between November 2016 and March 2017. Observational research was also executed at eleven local charitable food providers. Data was coded using low inference, line-by-line coding and analyzed using through a constant comparative method. Results: The findings of this exploratory study indicate that people are now able to store, prepare, and consume food at home. This increased ability to eat when, where, and to a certain extent what they want has had a positive impact on their overall sense of health and wellbeing. However, other effective makers of wellbeing that are enacted along people’s everyday routines and activities within an urban landscape, such as the social and spatial process underpinning the act of acquiring and consuming food, remain largely unaddressed within the intervention. Furthermore, re-investment in ending homelessness continues to rely on the status quo system of insufficient, inadequate, and undignified charitable stop gaps as a solution to hunger. Implications: Understanding this contested and contradictory geography of food is critical to support people during the transition from homelessness into housing. The process of housing participants without addressing food simply creates new circuits of dependence and marginalization that continue to inadequately meet people’s basic needs in a dignified way.</description>

   <title>Nonlinearity Compensation for Next Generation Coherent Optical Fiber Communication Systems</title>

   <description>In this thesis, we focus on digital signal processing (DSP) solutions that can help to combat various sources of nonlinearity in fiber-optic communication systems. Fiber Kerr nonlinearities are widely known to constitute a fundamental limit on the capacity of long-haul optical transmission as they restrict the maximum launch power into the fiber. This effectively limits the maximum optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) that can be achieved in the receiver which in-turn puts a cap on the transmission reach. However, cost-effective DSP-based fiber nonlinearity mitigation schemes for long-haul transmission are yet to be deployed. By employing Volterra analysis of an optical channel comprising multiple spans of single mode fiber (SMF), we develop two solutions to improve the complexity-performance trade-off of Volterra-based nonlinear&#xd;
equalization (VNLE). First, we demonstrate that a significant portion of the VNLE filter coefficients are canceled out in the presence of a symmetric dispersion map.&#xd;
Additionally, we propose novel cascade structures for VNLE that are shown to provide substantial complexity reductions compared to the conventional VNLE with linear and nonlinear filters in parallel. Note that other sources of nonlinear distortions can also significantly impair system performance. Recent experiments on transmission&#xd;
of high baud-rate optical signal revealed that the back-to-back performance of these systems are highly degraded by pattern-dependent distortion (PDD) which cannot be effectively compensated by linear filtering or static look-up-tables. In order to address these impairments, we developed a family of sequential detection strategies based on hidden Markov modeling of PDD. The proposed solutions are highly configurable to suit the target complexity constraints.</description>

   <description>The integration of healthcare data networks with personal health record (PHR) systems can reduce unnecessary duplication of lab tests and medical treatment errors, as well as empower patients with the ability to self-manage their own health. However, facilitating health data exchange between the healthcare data networks and the PHR systems is difficult due to the complexity of data sharing agreements, and the costly interfaces that have to be set up between those institutions. A hybrid PHR system architecture can combine the benefits of portable and online PHRs, providing more ubiquitous access to the PHR, while alleviating the need for establishing complex data sharing agreements and costly system interfaces. This architecture must, however, address issues such as PHR data integrity, data misinterpretation, security of the portable and online PHR, as well as privacy. Patients may tamper with their own records for reasons such as hiding a history of drug abuse or avoiding incarceration. We address the PHR data integrity issue by leveraging standardized encryption and digital signature schemes. Patients allowed access to their records may misinterpret intermediary notes by physicians. This can result in more unnecessary encounters with the physician. We resolve the data misinterpretation issue by providing physicians with the ability to store intermediary notes that are only accessible by other physicians. The threat of compromise of a patient's mobile device is tackled by using trusted platform hardware security features in order to launch the mobile application from which the patient can access and manage their PHR. Direct access to the mobile device allows for other attack vectors, such as malicious traffic interception hardware. Our mobile direct access control protocol, built on provably secure cryptographic primitives, aims to provide security from such attack vectors. Privacy issues are tackled with cryptographic access control that employ provably secure primitives, and the use of oblivious search and access, adapted for a multi-client setting and with support for access control. We present a preliminary security assessment of the system, that provides an overview of potential attack scenarios.</description>

   <description>We present the results of new, high sensitivity continuum imaging of NGC 2613, a massive edge-on galaxy 23.4 Mpc away. The high-resolution EVLA maps of NGC 2613 were observed at C-band (C-array and D-array) and L-band (B-array, C-array and D-array), as part of the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies (CHANG-ES) survey. Using new techniques during the imaging process, we successfully generate in-band combination maps for all arrays at each band. We also create a combined array and frequency map (C-band and L-band); with an intermediate frequency of 4.13 GHz, it is one of the few known images for a galaxy generated using multiple data sets at different frequency bands.&#xd;
High resolution maps of NGC 2613 reveal the presence of a compact nuclear source at the centre of the galaxy. We and evidence for the presence of an AGN, as predicted in Li et al. (2006), as the source of this feature. Gaussian fits to the&#xd;
radio core allow us to constrain the position of the galactic centre, with RA = 08h33m22.776s \pm 0.004s &amp; DEC = -22 58'24.86" \pm 016" and a core size of ~200pc. &#xd;
&#xd;
We detect the presence of several continuum features embedded in the disk of the galaxy, including the detection of a complex spiral feature in the eastern edge of the galaxy. We also uncover the existence of a broad continuum ring along which we and the presence of several continuum "hotspots", including the eastern spiral feature. The broad ring width suggests an older ring formed by the collision of the galaxy with its companion, ESO 495-G017, with the eastern spiral feature being an artifact of the collision. We also detect the presence of large extensions surrounding the disk of the galaxy, some of which reach heights of 12 kpc making them among the largest such extensions found. The extensions are believed to have formed through internal mechanisms, like supernovae, and appear to be connected to the continuum features detected in the galaxy. The presence of large loop-like extensions above and below the radio core hints at the existence of early AGN activity.</description>

   <description>Solvents are ubiquitous in chemistry. They can drastically impact the outcome of a process or reaction, and are usually the largest material component, greatly affecting environmental impact. Choosing the best solvent usually means optimizing for the best yields, but as safety standards and environmental regulations increase there is increasing need to optimize for these as well. There have been many advances in green chemistry, including the identification of alternative solvents. This thesis discusses the application of two CO2-switchable solvents. &#xd;
Switchable polarity solvents (SPS) were studied to control the lifetime of a photoswitchable dye. The dyes used are spiropyrans, a class of dyes that change from colourless to coloured upon irradiation by ultraviolet (UV) light, and spontaneously revert to their colourless form. The rate of this reversion is dependent on the solvent polarity, where the coloured form is stabilized by polar solvents. To control this reversion, solvents with switchable polarity have been investigated; amidine- (or guanidine-) alcohol mixture, where the introduction of CO2 causes an ionic liquid to form, raising its polarity. DBU/alcohol has been used in particular in this research. &#xd;
Switchable hydrophilicity solvents (SHS) were investigated for the extraction of bio-oils from microalgae. Microalgae have been identified as a potential source of biofuel. They have several benefits compared to terrestrial crops, including increased oil production. Current methods employ highly volatile solvents to ensure low energy solvent removal, however, this also leads to increased safety demands and risk of exposure. SHS have the unique ability to change their behaviour toward water with the addition of CO2 at atmospheric pressures. In the absence of CO2 the solvent is poorly miscible with water, and with the addition of CO2 becomes miscible with water in all proportions. This property allows for easy separation of extracted material. In the hydrophobic form the solvent is excellent for the extraction of non-polar materials, and can be easily separated from those materials with the addition of carbonated water.</description>

   <description>Academic and public discourse on Islam and Muslims in America continuously represses the deep (hi)stories of Blackamerican or Afro-American Muslims – (hi)stories rooted in the very inception of American nations – to focus almost exclusively on the twentieth and twenty-first century (hi)stories of immigrant, Middle-Eastern, and brown Muslims. The brand of racism known as Islamophobia manifests and thrives on the same prejudice, centering images of the “brown Arab-Middle Eastern Muslim” as the biological and cultural archetype of the Muslim-Islamic other. Put differently, both Islamophobic racism and official discourse on ‘Islam in America’ hinge on alienating Blackness from Islam, and hence Islam from America. &#xd;
&#xd;
As per its grasp of Islam and Muslims, American discourse on race, religion, culture, and politics remains captive to two fundamental and historically conditioned assumptions, namely that (1) the Islam of Blackamericans is not an authentic Islam, and that (2) true Islam is necessarily foreign, immigrant, and other to America. In tandem with debunking the myth of the demise of Islam among Afro-American slaves and their descendants, this essay argues that Islam has been indigenized to America by Afro-American Muslims, through centuries of their adaptive resilience to repression by America’s white-Protestant dominant order. As a tradition continuous with the history of American nations, American Islam demands that American Muslims, including foreign-born and immigrant American Muslims, bridge with the (hi)stories and living legacies of Afro-American Muslims, as well as with the perpetual struggle for liberation from human oppression that is central to the formation of American Islam. After sketching out the (hi)story of American Islam – principally via slave history and testimony, and the history of Black (both Christian and Muslim) religio-political discourse – this essay reads the Muslim life of Malcolm X as a significant moment in the ongoing tradition of American Islam. Where Malcolm’s biographers tend to separate his religious life from his politics, this essay reads his Autobiography, as well as his many speeches, interviews, correspondences, activist moments, and FBI records, in light of the tradition of American Islam, arguing fundamentally that Malcolm’s Muslim faith encompassed and guided his dedication to the politics of Black and human liberation.</description>

   <description>Integrated energy systems have the potential to reduce of the energy consumption of residential buildings in Canada. These systems incorporate components to meet the building heating, cooling and domestic hot water load into a single system in order to reduce energy losses. An integrated energy system, consisting of a variable speed heat pump, cold and hot thermal storage tanks, a photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector array and a battery bank, was designed for the Queen’s Solar Design Team’s (QSDT) test house. The system uses a radiant floor to provide space- heating and sensible cooling and a dedicated outdoor air system provides ventilation and dehumidifies the incoming fresh air. The test house, the Queen’s Solar Education Centre (QSEC), and the integrated energy system were both modelled in TRNSYS. Additionally, a new TRNSYS Type was developed to model the PV/T collectors, enabling the modeling of the collection of energy from the ambient air. A parametric study was carried out in TRNSYS to investigate the effect of various parameters on the overall energy performance of the system. These parameters included the PV/T array size and the slope of the collectors, the heat pump source and load-side inlet temperature setpoints, the compressor speed control and the size of the thermal storage tanks and the battery bank. The controls of the heat pump were found to have a large impact on the performance of the integrated energy system. For example, a low evaporator setpoint improved the overall free energy ratio (FER) of the system but the heat pump performance was lowered. Reducing the heat loss of the PV/T panels was not found to have a large effect on the system performance however, as the heat pump is able to lower the inlet collector fluid temperature, thus reducing thermal losses. From the results of the sensitivity study, a recommended system model was created and this system had a predicted FER of 77.9% in Kingston, Ontario, neglecting the energy consumption of circulation pumps and fans. Simulations of the recommended integrated energy system were also performed in several other Canadian cities and the predicted FER was above 60% in all except for the most northern city investigated, Yellowknife. Thus, the integrated energy system has the potential of reducing the energy consumption of residential buildings in Canada.</description>

   <description>This case study explored the use of a digital learning space portfolio by Grade 8 French as a Second Language (FSL) students.  The focus of this study was on the meaning students assigned to the use of the digital learning space portfolios and how their perceptions of themselves as FSL learners changed while using the system. The study addresses the existing gap in the literature. The digital learning space portfolio was created based on the needs of adolescent learners as identified in the literature. The literature also suggests that embedding assessment and learning in one place, that is accessible to all, improves student engagement.  The study took place at a rural school in Eastern Ontario and included fourteen students, six male and eight female. The results indicate that students had positive experiences using the digital learning space portfolio which supported student participation in the FSL classroom. In addition, the students reported positive perceptions of themselves as FSL learners while they were engaged in using the tool. The results also indicate that the teacher was integral in developing and modelling positive use of the digital learning space portfolio.  Further research regarding the use of the digital learning space portfolio in other disciplines and at other grade levels should focus on teacher support to ensure successful use of these types of tools in education.</description>

   <title>Heterogeneous Technological Changes and Their Impacts on Income Inequality and Productivity Growth</title>

   <subject>Technological Change</subject>
   <subject>Income Inequality</subject>
   <subject>Productivity Growth</subject>
   <description>I investigate different types of technological change and their impacts on wage&#xd;
inequality and economic growth.  In particular, I distinguish between&#xd;
skill-complementing and skill-replacing technological changes, with an emphasis&#xd;
on the latter.  Skill-replacing technological change can take the form of an&#xd;
organizational change, or the development of a certain type of machinery that&#xd;
works with lower skilled workers.  Essentially, skill-replacing technological&#xd;
change increases specialization in tasks, so that less labour skill is required.&#xd;
In contrast, skill-complementing technological change tends to increase the&#xd;
productivity of and demand for high-skilled workers.&#xd;
&#xd;
Combining two novel European data sets, I first document a previously unknown&#xd;
fact: industries with proportionally more product innovation relative to process&#xd;
innovation tend to pay higher skill premia, as measured by the wages of college&#xd;
educated workers relative to those of high school graduates.  To further&#xd;
understand this observation, I develop a dynamic general equilibrium model in&#xd;
which firms conduct both product innovation and process innovation endogenously.&#xd;
This model provides a stylized interpretation in which product innovation is&#xd;
skill-complementing, and process innovation is skill-replacing.  I show how each&#xd;
type of innovation affects the skill premium through the labour demand channel,&#xd;
and also how the skill premium affects the incentives to develop each type of&#xd;
innovation.  Using the European data, I estimate this two-way relationship&#xd;
derived from the model at the industry level.  I address the issue of&#xd;
simultaneity using an instrumental variables approach suggested by the model.  I&#xd;
also calibrate the model and conduct some quantitative exercises.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, I develop an endogenous growth framework featuring minimum skill&#xd;
requirements, two independent process innovations, and a heterogeneous labour&#xd;
force.  This model can simultaneously account for the hollowing out of the&#xd;
middle class and the slow down in labour productivity growth, both of which were&#xd;
observed in the United States and most European countries in the recent past.  I&#xd;
fully characterize the equilibrium of the model and derive conditions for both&#xd;
phenomena to emerge.  The relative intensity of different types of technological&#xd;
change plays a central role in the framework.</description>

   <description>Organic semiconductors (OSs) are gaining attention due to their processability, optical and electrical tunability, and cost-effectiveness. This class of materials is most suitable for flexible electronics and bioelectronics, especially when processed in a solution with inorganic or hybrid materials. However, the charge mobility within these materials is impeded by structural and energetic disorder caused by defects that ‘trap’ the charge carriers. The physical locations of the traps and their distribution of energies dictate the charge transport in a device. The present work probes both the interface and bulk defect-states in polymer-based diodes. Tests were performed on the polymers P3HT, MDMO:PPV and PCDTBT. Various techniques were used to record steady-state current-voltage (I-V), transients of CELIV (Charge Extraction by Linearly Increasing Voltage), DiTC (Dark-injection Transient Current) and the photoluminescence of encapsulated and unencapsulated polymer-based diodes, as well as electroluminescence from encapsulated polymer-based diodes. This study also observes the effects of ultra-violet light-soak on these devices. Charge transport dynamics were investigated over a wide time range, and at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. Results from the encapsulated and unencapsulated devices were compared in order to determine the impact of exposure to air. The cathode’s work function decreased during the light-soak, possibly due to UV-induced oxygen desorption from the polymer-cathode interface.</description>

   <title>The Acute Impact of Large and Small Muscle Mass Isometric Exercise and Post-Exercise Blood Pressure</title>

   <description>A single bout of aerobic or resistance exercise can lead to a temporary drop in blood pressure (BP) following exercise; a phenomenon referred to as post-exercise hypotension (PEH). PEH has been well-documented in individuals with normal and high BP. Like aerobic and resistance exercise, isometric exercise (IEX) training chronically reduces resting BP in both populations; however, considerably less attention has been given regarding the ability of this type of exercise to elicit PEH. IEX involves static contractions against an immovable load where no or minimal change in length occurs within the engaged muscle group; it is often performed in the arm and leg, with protocols being completed in as little as 11-min. While PEH has been reported in older subjects with normal resting BP following a single session of isometric handgrip exercise (IHGX), it has yet to be examined beyond 5-min following an acute bout of isometric leg exercise (ILX). There is some evidence to suggest that the magnitude and/or duration of PEH is proportional to the exercising muscle mass; therefore, ILX (i.e. large muscle mass IEX) may have greater potential than IHGX (i.e. small muscle mass IEX) to evoke PEH. The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to determine whether an acute bout of IHGX would elicit PEH in a sample of young, normotensive males and 2) if the magnitude of PEH, following IEX, was influenced by muscle mass. A total of 21 healthy males (24.1 ± 3.5yrs) completed 2 experimental visits (1 IHGX, 1 control), wherein cardiovascular reactivity and recovery responses (heart rate and BP) were assessed. In a subset of 12, an additional ILX visit was conducted, for a total of 3 experimental visits. PEH did not occur following a single session of either IHGX or ILX. The absence of PEH following either IEX protocol suggests that this type of exercise may be a less potent stimulus for PEH in this population. The findings from this study extend current knowledge with respect to PEH in healthy, young individuals and provide novel insight into the dependence, or lack thereof, of muscle mass on PEH.</description>

   <description>Over the preschool years, children’s core beliefs about the world go through significant changes in a number of content domains. Although the characteristics and timetables of these changes are well mapped out, little is known about why the later preschool years are such a fertile period for belief change. Here, we examined developmental changes in 3- and 5-year-olds’ capacity for belief change in a highly circumscribed context: changing beliefs about object weights. Because lifting objects is associated with stereotyped kinematics, kinematic analyses can provide insight into children’s beliefs about the objects they are lifting. Sixty-five children were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, the same object condition and the different object condition. Initially, all children were presented with a 1N object that they lifted 8 times. Then, children in the same object condition lifted an identical, heavier object, whereas, those in the different object condition lifted a heavier object that was different in shape and colour 8 times. We predicted that those in the same object condition children would transfer their beliefs about the load force requirements from the first object to the second and that this would result in a more gradual change in applied load force. Alternatively, those in the different object condition would adapt quicker to the new load force requirement as they would not have to change the previous belief. Children were also given a false belief battery and executive functioning battery. Results showed that five-year-olds in the different object condition were initially incorrect about the object’s weight, but quickly adapted and continued to use accurate load force for the remaining trials. In contrast, 5-year-olds in the same object condition were also initially incorrect and quickly corrected, but then reverted back to an underestimation pattern.  Three-year-olds showed no evidence of condition effects. Exploratory analyses showed some evidence that high false belief performance was associated with quicker load force adaptation. Although preliminary, we speculate that the variability in 5-year-olds lifting behaviour reflects processes that are associated with keeping old and new ideas about the object weight in mind, and may be important for true belief change.</description>

   <description>The productivity and distribution of northern and alpine plant species are predicted to increase and advance upslope and northwards in response to climate warming, particularly across the treeline ecotone.  However, responses to warming in the past century have been highly variable, especially in regions with complex topography. In order to improve predictions of future change, I used field surveys, dendrochronology, and remote sensing to characterize variability in plant community composition, woody plant growth, and tree spatial patterns across treelines in a range of topographic settings. I then attempted to explain this variability using measured edaphic, climatic, and topographic variables.  I found substantial differences in community composition, woody plant growth, and treeline ecotone abruptness between north and south-facing slopes.  Shallow active layers and cold soils on north-facing slopes resulted in low shrub cover and slow rates of woody plant growth.  The comparatively high cover of tall deciduous shrubs on south-facing slopes, in turn, restricted tree seedling establishment and resulted in relatively abrupt treeline ecotones.  Trends in tree growth and the degree of clustering between tree stems varied between mountain ranges with different slope angles.  Rapid spring runoff in steep valleys likely caused a spring soil moisture deficit that curbed tree growth over the past several decades, while high exposure to damaging winter winds in shallow valleys resulted in clustered patterns of tree stems.  My findings suggest that changes in treeline vegetation over the next century will depend not just on rising air temperatures, but also on edaphic variables, wind exposure, snowpack dynamics, and tree-shrub interactions.  Given that much of the landscape-scale variability in the composition, growth, and pattern of treeline vegetation can be attributed to slope aspect and angle, I recommend that these factors be included in predictive models of future vegetation change.</description>

   <description>Over the last decade, steps have been taken by the Canadian Armed Forces as well as non-government organizations to provide better healthcare and services to military personnel affected by issues that impact their mental health. Current research shows that the stigma towards mental illness remains an issue for many military and Veteran personnel. &#xd;
 The purpose of this study was to conduct a program evaluation of the Outward Bound Canada Veterans (OBCV) program with a particular focus on the previously uncovered theory that the program provides a stigma-free environment for participants. An earlier study on the OBCV program found that participants felt the program was stigma-free. For the current study, the program process was reviewed to investigate if, and how this environment was facilitated. To further investigate this aspect of the program, this study also evaluated the impact of this program on perceptions and lived experiences of stigma in participants. &#xd;
 An exploratory mixed-methods design was used for this study evaluating three OBCV courses held in 2016. The focus of this design was on the qualitative aspect with pre-post surveys serving to triangulate results. The Endorsed and Anticipated Stigma Inventory (EASI) was selected to explore constructs of stigma beyond barriers to care. The survey results received an 80% (n=20) response rate and the interviews consisted of (n=6). &#xd;
 The focus of this study was on the qualitative aspect with the pre- and post surveys serving to triangulate results. The interview questions were designed by the researcher and approved by supervisors. The Endorsed and Anticipated Stigma Inventory (EASI) was selected to explore constructs of stigma beyond barriers to care. Of the 25 individuals that participated in the program 20 completed the surveys and 6 completed the interview process. &#xd;
 Results of this study found that the program process of the OBCV program facilitated an environment that was perceived by participants to be stigma-free. This study found evidence that suggests aspects of self-stigma may be positively influenced by participation in this program.    This study was able to lend support to the premise that the OBCV program provides a stigma-free environment. This research also provides insights into the lived experiences and impact of stigma in OBCV program participants. This information could be used to inform policy makers and program planners on the current needs of military and Veteran personnel utilizing the mental health services in Canada.</description>

   <description>Representing the functional behaviour of a system is a critical practice in any engineering discipline. However, how to compare and reason about the represented systems has mostly been dependent on our cognitive processing ability.  An effective representation must support machine-assisted reasoning mechanism as well as human intuitions. We present an effective, ontology-oriented formal approach of representation that is designed to be both machine-processable and human comprehensible. Based on the theory of events and change in AI-based commonsense reasoning and the notion of affordances, we developed a novel approach to functional reasoning which is more intuitive and practical compared to the existing formal systems of representation. After discussing the notion of ontologies along with their implementation formalisms, we present our representational facility called the Event-Based Functional Behaviour Ontology (EFBO). A detailed overview of the EFBO is presented along with our own approach to behaviour modelling. As a special application, we present and demonstrate the EFBO-based validation system that can be used to validate the levels of functional consistencies between cross-platform systems. We also discuss the commonsense reasoning theories relevant to our representation along with other related work. Finally, we discuss the broader perspectives of our contributions within the context of modern computing and software engineering.</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: Substantial interindividual variability in response to a standard dose of exercise exists independent of the trait under investigation. Whether interindividual variability attributed to exercise exists after accounting for random variability is unknown.   &#xd;
OBJECTIVE:  To determine the magnitude of the interindividual variability in response to exercise for waist circumference (WC) and body weight (BW) after accounting for random variability and, the extent to which the variability is explained by lifestyle behaviors.&#xd;
METHODS: Participants were 181 (61% female) sedentary, abdominally obese adults (mean, (SD); 53, (7.5) years) who completed a 24-week intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to: control (n=44) or 5 weekly sessions of low amount, low intensity (LALI) (180 and 300kcal/session for women and men respectively at 50% V02peak, n=46); high amount, low intensity (HALI) (360 and 600kcal/session for women and men respectively at 50% V02peak, n=53); or high amount, high intensity (HAHI) (360 and 600kcal/session for women and men respectively at 75% V02peak, n=38). Adherence was ≥ 80% in all exercise groups.  Physical activity (PA) performed outside of the prescribed exercise was measured by accelerometer. Daily self-report diet records were used to derive energy intake (kcal) and diet quality (Canadian-Healthy Eating Index-2010, Mediterranean Score). The variability in response to exercise (SDR) was determined by separating the random variability from the intervention variability by comparing standard deviations (SD) from both the control and intervention groups.&#xd;
RESULTS:  WC and BW were substantially reduced at 24 weeks in all exercise groups compared to control (P&lt;0.01). The variability due to exercise (SDR) for change in WC was 3.1, -0.3 and 3.1 cm for LALI, HALI and HAHI groups respectively.  Corresponding values for BW were 3.8, 2.0 and 3.5 kg for LALI, HALI and HAHI respectively. No dietary or PA variable was identified as a determinant of the interindividual variability in response to exercise for WC or BW (p>0.05).&#xd;
CONCLUSION:  A substantial interindividual variability in response to exercise was observed for change in WC and BW after accounting for the random variability.  The determinants of the heterogeneity in response to exercise remain to be determined.</description>

   <description>As a result of anoxia or abrupt change in temperature spreading depolarizations (SD)&#xd;
occur in the grey matter of the higher brain, promoting neuronal injury. SD in mammals and&#xd;
insects induces a sudden shutdown of the central nervous system (CNS) gray matter, but it is&#xd;
unclear if SD is generated in the cerebral cortex (CC) of lower vertebrates. In this study, the&#xd;
effects of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD, which simulates ischemia) or abrupt temperature&#xd;
change was studied on live coronal brain slices from Northern Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) and&#xd;
Sprague Dawley rat (Rattus norvegicus) brain slices to compare SD susceptibility. We&#xd;
hypothesized that this cold-blooded vertebrate generates SD, reflecting the need for a shutdown&#xd;
capability, but that the frog brain is less susceptible to anoxia or temperature change because of&#xd;
its variable environment. We used light transmittance imaging (LT) during exposure to various&#xd;
solutions/temperatures to examine whether frog CC can generate SD and if so, its propensity to&#xd;
initiate and propagate compared to the rat. The frog CC generated delayed OGD-SD at 12±2.6&#xd;
min (mean ± SE) at 35oC (n=8) compared to rat slices at 1.6±0.34 min at 35oC (n=4). The frog&#xd;
CC generated ouabain-SD at 5.6±0.3 min at 35oC (n=12) compared to 4.8 min on average in rat&#xd;
neocortex as shown previously in our lab. At 26oC, frog slices generated SD induced by 100 M&#xd;
ouabain (a Na+/K+pump inhibitor) at 9.3±0.5 min (n=12) compared to rat slices at 6.6±0.2 min&#xd;
(n=10). Unlike in rat, SD was not evoked in frog CC by elevating bath [K+]o to 26 mM at any of&#xd;
the tested temperatures. A 35 to 40⁰C ramp generated SD at 10.8±1.1 min (n=6) in frogs and&#xd;
5.5±0.5 min (n=16) in rats. A 35 to 4.7⁰C ramp generated SD in the rat at 2.5±0.6 min (n=8) but&#xd;
did not elicit SD in the frog. Our findings show that the capacity to generate SD in the cerebral&#xd;
cortex evolved early in vertebrate evolution. However, the frog CC is less sensitive to SD&#xd;
shutdown evoked by simulated ischemia or by sudden temperature change. This appears &#xd;
appropriate to the amphibian environment where oxygen content of the water and ambient&#xd;
temperature vary considerably.</description>

   <description>It has been reported that when listening to a lecture, the average student spends approximately one third of lecture time thinking about things unrelated to the lecture material (Szpunar et al., 2013). With that said, drifting off mentally during the performance of a task is something that everyone experiences to some extent. This state of being where our internal thoughts are unrelated to the task being performed has been termed mind wandering (MW), and has been studied increasingly in recent years. Despite this increase in research on the topic, explanations for why MW occurs in the first place, and how it affects constructs such as attention and memory remain limited. The current study examined whether memory retrieval tendencies and executive control (EC) were able to predict the propensity to MW, and further assessed how MW affected retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). We found evidence that both EC and memory retrieval tendencies are significant predictors of MW propensity. However, there was no evidence to suggest that MW had an effect on RIF. Overall, our findings provide a novel view of MW’s relationship with both memory and attention, and suggests that higher MW propensity is not always detrimental to performance on memory and EC tasks.</description>

   <description>A separation of the abdominal muscles at the linea alba, diastasis recti abdominis (DRA), appears to persist beyond the first postpartum year in a substantial proportion of women. Although tissue strain at the linea alba should theoretically cause difficulties during tasks that require load transfer across the midline, there is limited evidence to support that DRA impairs trunk muscle function. Four studies are presented in this dissertation, in which we aimed to investigate the impact of DRA on women’s health. The first two studies established the reliability and validity of two key outcome measures. A custom isometric trunk dynamometer (IFLEXD) was validated against the Biodex 3TM dynamometer. Torque values from the two systems were found to be strongly correlated. The between-day reliability for outcomes derived from the IFLEXD were excellent. In the next study we investigated whether the angle at which an ultrasound transducer is held influences measurements of inter-rectus distance (IRD). Transducer angle did not appear to impact IRD measured in parous women. The latter two studies investigated the impact of DRA on trunk symptoms and function. In the third study we explored whether women with and without DRA at one-year postpartum demonstrated differences in their maximal trunk flexion, extension, and rotation torque generating capacity, trunk flexion, extension, and lateral flexion endurance, ability to perform a sit-up and the Sitting-Rising Test, and/or self-reported pain and dysfunction. The results suggest that women who present with DRA at one-year postpartum have reduced maximal trunk rotation torque generating capacity and perform more poorly on a sit-up test. Women with DRA did not report higher levels of lumbopelvic pain or dysfunction. In the final study, we investigated whether a recently proposed measurement of DRA severity, the distortion index (DI) predicted impairment and dysfunction associated with DRA more strongly than IRD. DI and IRD were highly correlated, and, as such, DI was associated with women’s ability to generate trunk rotation torque and to perform a sit-up. Yet, our sample of women with mild DRA, relative to IRD, DI did not appear to contribute to our understanding of the functional impacts of DRA.</description>

   <description>Geographers have warned against essentializing responsibility in the geographies of responsibility literature. What responsibility is, however, and how it can be enacted remains under-explored. Yet, in published texts and public statements that seek to acknowledge relationships between Indigenous and settler peoples in Canada, the language of responsibility is used with abundance. I chose to pick up this concept of responsibility in my research. My dissertation is the result of a partnership-based project with Huu-ay-aht First Nations. I investigate what responsibility looks like with respect to new relationships under a modern treaty using the Maa-nulth Treaty as an exploratory case study.&#xd;
 &#xd;
I begin by theorizing settler responsibility by extending Hannah Arendt’s work to the settler colonial context of Canada and argue that a collective responsibility is necessary to address settler colonial relationships. I then explore how settler researchers can better navigate and work through research—research with Huu-ay-aht First Nations for me as mamaałni (white person/settler)—in settler colonial contexts to support social change. Drawing from the Treaty itself and key informant interviews with Huu-ay-aht and First Nations leaders, Maa-nulth Treaty negotiators, and implementation teams (n=26), my inquiry focuses on Huu-ay-aht First Nations’ self-government as they move from under the thumb of the Indian Act through the tools provided by the Maa-nulth Treaty. Finally, I investigate the ‘new relationship’ between Federal, Provincial, and Huu-ay-aht First Nations Governments under the Treaty.&#xd;
 &#xd;
My theoretical findings contribute to literature contending that settler colonialism cannot be viewed as historical or structural only, void of personal affect, or detached from everyday lived experiences. In this vein, empirical findings from the case study reveal that Huu-ay-aht First Nations’ choice to enter treaty negotiations and implement the final agreement was linked directly to visions of ʔiisaak (respect with caring) and ʔuuʔałuk (taking care of, especially for future generations), while recognizing the imperfection of the treaty process and resulting agreements. Although Huu-ay-aht First Nations accepted the Maa-nulth Treaty to move from under the Indian Act, work to define new relationship needs to occur. To conclude, I offer recommendations—informed by research participants—for how to improve the treaty process.</description>

   <subject>Chronic Pain</subject>
   <subject>Coping Strategies</subject>
   <subject>Health Care Utilization</subject>
   <description>Objective: To characterize a chronic pain clinic population and determine whether specific coping strategies were associated with an unplanned health care visit(s) after controlling for predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics associated with health care utilization.&#xd;
&#xd;
Design: Observational study based on questionnaire data obtained in a southeastern Ontario chronic pain clinic. The analysis was guided by Andersen’s Behavioural Model of Health Services Use.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Participants (N = 559) were classified according to number of visits made for pain to emergency departments, urgent-care, and walk-in clinics in the previous year. Modified Poisson regression was used to determine the association between coping strategies and unplanned health care use and to identify other characteristics associated with visits.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Thirty-one percent (n = 176) of attendees reported at least one unplanned visit for pain in the year prior to attendance in the clinic. In adjusted analysis, the chronic pain coping strategies associated with higher unplanned visit(s) for pain were positive self-statements (RR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.00-1.13, p = .03) and asking for assistance (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03-1.15, p &lt; .01), while guarding (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85-0.98, p = .01) reduced use. Unplanned visit(s) were also associated with age, moderate to severe depression, greater opioid use, lower household income, and high-frequency primary care visits for pain.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: In addition to certain predisposing and enabling characteristics, coping strategies are correlated with unplanned health care use for pain. Prospective studies, using objective measures of service use, are needed to determine if the nature and direction of these associations are stable over time.</description>

   <title>“Ancient Spirit, Modern Mind”: Documenting Huu-ay-aht First Nations' Journey to the Maa-Nulth Treaty Through Community-Based Archival Research</title>

   <description>For many musčim (citizens) of Huu-ay-aht First Nations, a Nuu-chah-nulth worldview informs their individual identities and responsibilities to the world around them as Huu-ay-aht. Three sacred principles guide Huu-ay-aht relationships to each other, to other Nuu-chah-nulth, and all spiritual and physical lifeforms in their ḥahuułi (homelands): hišuk c̕awak (everything is one, connected), ʔiisaak (respect with caring), and ʔuuʔałuk (caring for present and future generations).&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
This worldview was challenged by setter contact in the late 18th century. Contact became a collision in which a European worldview drove colonial settlement across what is now Canada. Historic treaties were negotiated across much of Canada between the 18th and 19th century. However, this was not the case in British Columbia, where settlement occurred largely on the unceded territories of Indigenous Peoples. By the 20th century, Provincial and Federal governments halted the treaty process, and instead shifted toward a forced assimilative approach that worked to criminalize and suppress Indigenous ways of life. This continued until 1973 when the Supreme Court ruled that the Canadian government had the fiduciary duty to negotiate treaties under a modern process. This research explores the extent to which worldview shapes the relationship between Huu-ay-aht First Nations, the Government of Canada, and the Province of British Columbia in modern treaty negotiations.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis is the result of a community-based participatory research project with Huu-ay-aht First Nations. The research is primarily archival in nature, in which I trace Huu-ay-aht First Nations’ 18-year journey to the Maa-nulth Treaty. However, my analysis has also been supplemented by community engagement sessions and time spent in the community attending speaking with citizens about their memories of treaty negotiations and their experience with its implementation. By centering Huu-ay-aht voices throughout the research process, this work produces new insights into how one First Nation successfully managed to negotiate a modern treaty. These findings offer recommendations to Provincial and Federal negotiators to improve the modern treaty process. As well, this community-focused perspective offers insights into the strengths and challenges of the modern treaty process for First Nations considering, or who are currently participating in, modern treaty negotiations.</description>

   <title>External Stimuli Driven Transformation of BN-Heterocycles</title>

   <description>BN-heterocycles have important applications in synthetic methodologies, chemical reactivity and optoelectronics. This thesis focuses on the investigation of the thermal and photo-responsive properties of BN-heterocycles as well as applications in optoelectronic devices. In search of more efficient photoelimination of BN-heterocycles, we found that BN-heterocycles could have different and unique transformations upon external stimuli. The preparation of the BN-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is also described.&#xd;
     Boranes with the general formula of HBR2 have been found to undergo a facile 1,1-hydroboration reaction with pyrido[1,2-a]isoindole, resulting in insertion of a BR2 unit into a C-N bond and the formation of a variety of BN-heterocycles. Investigation on the thermal reactivity of the BN-heterocycles revealed that these molecules have two distinct and competitive thermal elimination pathways: HBR2 elimination (or retro-hydroboration) versus R-H elimination, depending on the R group on the B atom and the chelate backbone.&#xd;
    Given the 1,3-dipolar nature pyrido[1,2-a]isoindole, a “one-pot” cycloaddition procedure of pyrido[1,2-a]isoindole and its analogues with dimesitylboron functionalized alkynes has been successfully developed for the synthesis of a series of BMes2-functionalized N-heterocycles.&#xd;
      To further expand the photoelimination reaction to multiple BN-doped PAHs, new BN-heterocyclic compounds have been found to undergo double photoelimination, forming rare yellow fluorescent (BN)2-arenes that contain two B-N units. Most significant is the discovery that the double elimination can also be driven by excitons generated electrically within electroluminescent (EL) devices, enabling the in situ solid-state conversion of BN-heterocycles to BN-arenes and the use of BN-arenes as emitters for EL devices. The in situ exciton-driven elimination (EDE) phenomenon has also been observed for other BN-heterocycles.&#xd;
       Besides changing external stimuli to improve the efficiency of elimination of BN-heterocycles, the internal factor - the effect of substituents on boron atom was also investigated. We found that both electronic and steric effects have a significant and distinct impact on the photoreaction pathways of BN-heterocycles. With bulky, electron-donating aryl rings on the B atom, the photoelimination efficiency is enhanced. In contrast, with sufficiently electron-withdrawing aryl groups on the B atom, bulky or not, photoisomerization occurs exclusively with a high stereoselectivity.</description>

   <description>Unlike diamagnetic compounds, paramagnetic samples are more difficult to study by NMR because they usually exhibit wide chemical shift ranges and broadened signals. These peculiar features are mainly due to the strong hyperfine interactions between magnetic dipoles of unpaired electrons and nuclei. In order to understand experimentally observed NMR signals from paramagnetic molecules, quantum chemical calculations are often desirable. This thesis focuses on two areas of NMR studies of paramagnetic compounds. First, we have examined solution-state 1H, 13C, and 17O NMR spectra of several small paramagnetic vanadium compounds and established the validity of DFT computational approaches for calculating hyperfine shifts on 1H, 13C, and 17O nuclei. We then attempted to study a protein (transferrin) containing V(III) ions by 17O NMR. Second, we used the solid-state NMR data for paramagnetic Cu(DL-alanine)2•H2O reported in the literature to evaluate a periodic DFT code BAND in computing hyperfine coupling tensors in solids. This is the first time that this kind of test for BAND is carried out for molecular solids.</description>

   <description>Over the last two decades, distributed model predictive control (MPC) has become an increasingly popular research topic. Distributed MPC constitutes a valuable tool, providing computationally efficient optimal control algorithms that can successfully account for the interactions of complex, interconnected processes. Achieving closed-loop stability and centralized performance in nonlinear, distributed or decentralized systems remains an obstacle to existing distributed MPC formulations.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis a discrete-time cloud-based model predictive control architecture for application to unstable nonlinear systems under process constraints is developed using a cooperative, distributed optimization approach. Distributed time-varying extremum-seeking, a form of model-free optimal control, is integrated to a conventional MPC scheme to solve the optimization problem at each time step. Each of the control horizon’s inputs is assigned to an agent that shares its local cost information over a network. Agents use this data to estimate the average total cost of the system, which they minimize by a gradient-descent control law based on local approximations of the average total cost gradient.&#xd;
&#xd;
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the discrete-time cloud-based MPC architecture&#xd;
and its stability in closed-loop, three case studies are performed. The first study considers a nonlinear MIMO system subjected to input constraints. The numerical results indicate that the proposed controller recovers the performance of its centralized counterpart. The second case study considers a non-isothermal exothermic CSTR. The simulation demonstrates that the cloud-based architecture can effectively stabilize systems with complex dynamics of higher order. The third case study investigates the architecture’s applicability to economic MPC and shows that the developed controller is capable of stabilizing a system to a periodic orbit when suitable constraints are applied.</description>

   <description>As the size of Canada’s elderly population continues to grow, so will the demand for palliative (or end-of-life) health care services, which strive to improve the quality of life of those suffering with life-threatening illness. Unfortunately, access to palliative care is inconsistent across Canada, especially among those residing in rural settings who, unlike urban residents, encounter additional geographical and financial barriers to care. Access to culturally-sensitive palliative care, particularly for Indigenous peoples, can also be challenging in these settings. Therefore, the goal of my thesis is to understand health care providers’ (HCP) perspectives on barriers to palliative care delivery in rural Canadian settings and to identify their suggestions for delivery improvement in these regions. To achieve this goal, I analysed forty semi-structured interviews capturing the perspectives of formal and informal HCPs from four rural and/or remote communities with limited palliative care resources. Barriers to palliative care delivery were initially coded using Penchansky and Thomas’ five dimensions of access (i.e. availability, affordability, acceptability, physical accessibility, and accommodation), however a recently added sixth dimension of access (i.e. awareness) became the primary focus of this analysis. Next, barriers to Indigenous palliative care were identified according to three palliative care environments (i.e. community, hospital, and home). A supplemental quantitative analysis was also conducted exploring the association between Indigenous identity and short- and long-term healthcare service use, as well as reasons for unmet health care needs, using three cycles (2012-2014) of the Canadian Community Health Survey. Findings indicate that barriers to palliative care delivery, via palliative care awareness, stem from limited palliative care knowledge/education, communication, and coordination among HCPs, and suggest that inadequate palliative care awareness may jeopardize initiatives striving to address barriers to the original five dimensions of access. The barriers to palliative care delivery among Indigenous peoples were also shown to differ between palliative care environments, and suggested that improving cultural sensitivity among HCPs could address these barriers. To improve rural palliative care delivery HCPs suggested implementing community-led and community-specific initiatives that enhance HCP knowledge, communication, and coordination of culturally-sensitive palliative care within different environments to ultimately encourage equitable access for all Canadians.

   <title>Mathematical Modelling for Carbon Dioxide Removal from Flue Gas Using Micron-size Water Droplets</title>

   <description>Numerous technologies have been developed to reduce the amount of CO2 released to the environment via combustion processes. A promising process named the C-3 process uses micron size water droplets to remove contaminants (e.g., CO2, NOx, SOx, and Hg) from flue gas. However, the mechanisms for capturing CO2 using this relatively simple water-droplet-based process are not fully explained or understood. This work uses mathematical models to explore possible mechanisms for capturing CO2 by high-velocity water droplets with large surface-area-to-volume ratio.&#xd;
Several capture mechanisms are identified based on a literature review including: i) dissolution of CO2 in liquid water, ii) formation of H2CO3 and its ions, iii) adsorption of CO2 on the droplet surface, and iv) congregation of H2CO3 inside the droplet surface. A preliminary mathematical model is developed to study the importance of the proposed mechanisms, with the droplet surface treated as a region where CO2 and related species can accumulate. In addition, a more complex model that includes two additional phenomena: i) heat transfer from flue gas to water droplet and ii) shrinkage of the droplet due to water evaporation are also developed to explore the influences of these phenomena on the CO2 capture process.&#xd;
Simulation results reveal that equilibrium absorption following Henry’s law is insufficient to account for the relatively large quantities of CO2 (~27 g CO2/kg water) that have been absorbed in a demonstration unit, suggesting that surface adsorption/absorption effects are important. Adsorption/absorption of CO2 and H2CO3 at the droplet interface could explain the high observed levels of CO2 removal, if unknown partition coefficients K_(IL,CO2 )and K_(IL,H2CO3) are as large as 0.01 m and 0.1 m, respectively, or if the mean droplet diameter is smaller than 5 µm. Simulation results predict that the amount of CO2 captured increases as temperature and water droplet size decrease. Velocity of the water droplet is important when heat effects are considered in the simulations because high-velocity water droplets are predicted to shrink faster than stationary droplets. Droplets can either shrink or grow depending on the temperature and composition of the surrounding flue gas, which will change with position in the C-3 process.</description>

   <description>Liquid phase exfoliation of graphite is performed using ultrasonication and shear exfoliation to produce graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Ultrasonication is performed using a tip sonicator under power loads ranging from 35-100% amplitude (corresponding to power of 9-36 W) and concentrations of Pluronic® F127 surfactant in water ranging from 1-15 wt%, under batch and sequential addition of surfactant modalities. Shear exfoliation is achieved using a lab scale shear mixer operated with rotor speeds ranging from 1500 rpm to 8000 rpm and Pluronic® F127 concentrations ranging from 1-10 wt%. Ultrasonication exfoliation demonstrated GNP concentrations as high as 3.01 mg·mL-1 at 100% amplitude and 15 wt% surfactant concentration. The average particle sizes of the nanoplatelets, were approximately 200-550 nm for all exfoliation methods as estimated through dynamic light scattering (DLS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization revealed particle sizes on the order of hundreds of nanometers in lateral dimension.  Ultrasonication resulted in few-layer graphene, with thickness ranging from 4-77 nm as measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and aspect ratios of 36-96. Shear mixing generated multi-layer graphene, with thickness ranging from 6-11 nm and aspect ratios of 25-72.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both processes were modeled using dimensional analysis, which revealed that high yields can be achieved beyond specific thresholds of power density input, rotation speed, and surfactant concentration. Based on the results, shear mixing presents itself as a promising method that can be readily scalable above a rotor speed threshold.</description>

   <title>Arboreal Calling Behaviour Across the Range of the Spring Peeper: Potential Consequences and Benefits</title>

   <description>Understanding the trade-offs that affect potentially adaptive traits is fundamental to our understanding of evolutionary diversification and speciation. Heterogeneous landscapes may lead to spatial variation in such traits among populations as they may experience different selective pressures. In this study, I investigate the spatial variation associated with arboreal calling behaviour in the spring peeper, Pseudacris crucifer. Finding marked variation in the median height of perching and the proportion of males perching within a population, I investigated the factors that might mediate this behaviour. Spring peeper males at the northern extent of their range almost exclusively call from ground-level, whereas individuals in populations towards the central and southern part of the species’ range are largely arboreal callers. Results of a playback transmission study using male advertisement calls at different perch heights suggest that there is a benefit to arboreal calling: less call degradation across longer distances. To understand some potential physiological costs associated with calling from elevated perches, where individuals would experience higher wind and evaporative water loss, I performed a desiccation experiment using plaster model frogs. Model frogs at high perches lose water at a markedly faster rate than those on the ground, suggesting an increased risk of desiccation for arboreal individuals. Arboreal calling behaviour may therefore be partially governed by a trade-off between reproductive attractiveness and physiological limitations. In addition to spatial variation in arboreality, I investigated morphological variation associated with this behaviour. I found longer limb length and larger body size in arboreal individuals, suggesting possible local morphological adaptation for populations with increased propensities for calling from elevated perches. Whether arboreal calling behaviour is a behaviourally- plastic, context-dependent trait or is fixed within populations remains to be studied, although the trade-offs mediating its prevalence in a population offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the genetic underpinnings of a potentially adaptive trait that is found in only some populations of a species with a dynamic evolutionary history.</description>

   <description>In high baud fiber-optic communication systems, the bandwidth limitation at the transmitter and receiver, and the linear and nonlinear responses of electro-optical components, drive amplifiers and digital-to-analog converters can introduce pattern dependent distortion that caused the signal-quality degradation. Furthermore, the use of narrow subcarrier spacing leads to cross-phase modulation (XPM) distortion considered one of the main obstacles to achieving large transmission distances in superchannel systems. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the effect&#xd;
of pattern dependent distortion and enhance the transmission performance of high baud superchannel systems.&#xd;
&#xd;
Transmission of single-subcarrier 448 Gb/s dual-polarization 16-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation (DP 16-QAM) signal and a 1.206 Tb/s three-subcarrier superchannel signal using DP 16-QAM is demonstrated by applying&#xd;
a fixed look-up table (LUT) based on maximum-a-posteriori probability (MAP) detector at the receiver. Different decision rules for the MAP detector are considered based on multiple observations of the same symbol as the detection window advances through the received symbol sequence. Alternative approaches include a LUT based nonlinear pre-distorter (NLPD) at the transmitter, and a Volterra nonlinear equalizer (VNLE) or sparse-VNLE at the receiver. The LUT based NLPD with iterative calculation of the pre-distortion provides the best performance in back-to-back systems and transmission systems followed by the MAP detector, VNLE and sparse-VNLE.&#xd;
&#xd;
For a 1.206 Tb/s DP 16-QAM Nyquist-superchannel using 3, 5 and 9 subcarriers, the impact of the number of subcarriers on the relative strength of the intra- and inter- subcarrier nonlinearities and on the maximum achievable transmission distance for an information rate of 1 Tb/s is determined by simulation. The degree of correlation for the inter-subcarrier nonlinearity induced phase perturbation is assessed between a modulated center subcarrier and a continuous wave (CW) probe center subcarrier. The results provide an indication of the reliability of statistical information about the nonlinear phase perturbation that can be obtained from a probe signal either through simulation or experiment.</description>

   <description>The palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, in which a carbon-carbon bond is formed between an organohalide or pseudo-halide electrophile and an organoboron nucleophile, has developed into one of the most widely used bond-forming reactions in academic and industrial research alike. The development of automated syntheses in the past decade using this powerful methodology shows significant promise towards accessing a general approach to small-molecule synthesis. One of the largest drawbacks in this Nobel-Prize winning methodology is the sparsity of robust methods for incorporating sp3-hybridized coupling partners. The development of methods which allow sp3-hybridized reagents to participate in cross-couplings is of vital importance to the long-term goal of using Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling as a widely applicably technique in small molecule synthesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis describes the development of two methodologies which aim to incorporate sp3-hybridized coupling partners in iterative cross-coupling reactions. We report the use of benzyl trifluoromethyl sulfones as unique electrophiles in desulfonative cross-coupling reactions to synthesize diarylmethanes. This manifold was found to be tolerant to a range of structurally and electronically diverse organoboron coupling partners, although heteroaromatic species proved problematic. A sulfone bearing a pendant aryl bromide was found to undergo highly selective iterative cross-coupling reactions in which chemoselectivity is controlled through the oxidative addition step. Additionally, the application of sulfones towards a desulfonative borylation strategy for the synthesis of benzylic boronic esters was examined.&#xd;
&#xd;
The selective cross-coupling of vicinal 1,2-diboronates was also examined. These substrates were found to undergo highly chemoselective coupling at the terminal position based solely on the intrinsic reactivity difference due to the substitution at carbon, without the use of boron masking agents. Importantly, it proved feasible to functionalize both boron substituents through cross-coupling in an iterative fashion, affording multiply arylated structures with complete regioselectivity and excellent stereocontrol. Preliminary investigations into the origin of this chemoselectivity were performed.&#xd;
&#xd;
The research described herein will detail our efforts towards the development of these two novel methods in iterative cross-coupling.</description>

   <description>Lakes in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) are threatened by multiple environmental stressors linked to industrial development of the local hydrocarbon deposits and climate change. Waterbodies are vulnerable to changes in water quality and quantity, as well as shifts in ecosystem structure and function. Due to insufficient monitoring prior to industrial development, little is known about the long-term changes in AOSR lakes and the effects of multiple stressors in the region. This thesis uses paleolimnological approaches to determine baseline conditions, track biotic changes through time, and investigate the relative effects of industrial pollution (i.e., contaminants and nutrients) and climate change on the environmental trajectories of the region’s shallow lakes. A multiproxy study of a shallow, isolated lake receiving substantial industrial contamination assessed how multiple trophic levels of a typical AOSR lake have changed over the past ~75 years. While there was no evidence of a threshold-type response to industrial pollution, biotic assemblages from multiple trophic levels suggest the benthic environment increased in complexity, consistent with the warming climate. Spectrally-inferred sedimentary chlorophyll-a profiles from 23 lakes and bioavailable nutrient deposition maps were used to investigate the extent, timing, and causes of increased primary production. Widespread, asynchronous increases in primary production and correlations to observed air temperatures suggest climate change as the main driver of elevated primary production, rather than bioavailable nutrients from industry. Finally, a “top-bottom” paleolimnological analysis comparing pre-disturbance (~1850) and present-day subfossil diatom assemblages from 18 shallow lakes was completed to survey the region’s biotic changes and investigate which environmental variables structured the diatom communities. While diatom assemblages in some lakes changed markedly, most AOSR lakes demonstrated resiliency to the region’s stressors. There were no apparent biological responses to industrial airborne pollution, including deposition of bioavailable nutrients. Instead, most diatom community shifts were consistent with known responses to climate change, and were likely mediated by lake-specific characteristics. Collectively, this research concludes that anthropogenic climate change is the main driver of overall muted community change and marked primary production increases in the shallow lakes of the AOSR. Yet, future changes are possible given the expected continuation of the region’s industrial development.</description>

   <description>This thesis deals with love migration, a kind of mobility where the complicated and yet so common emotions and dynamics that characterize any romantic relationship intersect with the disruptions and processes of migration. Because love migration is a relatively unexplored area of study, the present work comprises an exploratory approach which focuses on the perspective of Mexican women who migrated to Canada for a romantic relationship. Specifically, this project aims to address the experiences of displacement and emplacement of love migrants. Put differently, it asks how Mexican women experience moving to Canada and adjusting to the country when their motivation is romantic love. To answer this question, I interviewed 15 Mexican middle-class women who settled in Montreal, Quebec and the greater area of Kingston, Ontario. The sample included participants in heterosexual and same-sex relationships with Mexican and non-Mexican partners they met “unexpectedly” in Mexico, online, or while travelling abroad. &#xd;
The women I interviewed described falling in love with partners who complemented the autonomous lives they had constructed so far. Geographic distance opened the question of migration, and they moved to Canada hoping to build a future with their partners. However, in this thesis I argue that the process of migration challenged these women’s autonomy and romantic motivations. On the one hand, I found that love migrants’ displacement was a disruptive process. It confronted them with the emotional conflict of leaving their family and community behind, and it involved a bureaucratic process that questioned their romantic motivations and imposed restrictive regulations for the initial years of life in Canada. On the other hand, their emplacements comprised a process of self-determination. They had to actively work to make space for themselves in their romantic relationships and in the Canadian society. Overall, I argue that Mexican women’s love migrations are an expression of autonomy. And, despite the challenges and restrictions they encountered when moving to a new country, their stories show the conviction they have to maintain a sense of independence and to construct the future they imagined when they decided to move to Canada.</description>

   <description>In this dissertation, I examine the relationship between visual culture and the culture of oil in Canada, specifically, the visual culture of the Alberta oil sands. I situate my research in the context of recent contentious environmental and infrastructural developments, including the Kinder Morgan pipeline (2004) and Northern Gateway pipeline (2006) proposals, and land claim disputes between the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and Canadian provincial and federal governments, which since the early-twenty-first century have been at the forefront of public discussions. This study seeks to explore what visual knowledge does, how environmental and social concerns are communicated visually, and the affective dimensions of these visualizations. I argue that the visual culture of the Alberta oil sands is both a strategic tool and a site of understanding that is key for advancing environmental and social knowledge. I examine the concept of wilderness in Canada and environmental and social justice as they are visualized in three areas: contemporary art, mass media and tourism, and activism. Each area forms a case study and is analyzed in context to explore the different ways in which the visual operates to deepen the moral and ethical dimensions of content—whether on informational, argumentative, emotional, or affective levels. Key to this discussion is sensitivity to the systems of meaning and value at play in each area, and how these both shape art, media, tourism, and activism and inform their reception. Attending to these systems of meaning also enables me to tease out within each area competing understandings, agendas, and ideologies, as well as relationships of one to another.</description>

   <description>The Cobalt-Coleman silver (Ag) mining camp has a long history of mining dating back to 1903. Silver mineralization is hosted within carbonate veins and occurs in association with Fe-Co-Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide mineral species. The complex mineralogy presented challenges to early mineral processing methods with varying success of Ag recovery and a significant amount of arsenic (As) in waste material which was disposed in the numerous tailings deposits scattered throughout the mining camp, and in many instances disposed of uncontained. The oxidation and dissolution of As-bearing mineral phases in these tailings and legacy waste sites releases As into the local aquatic environment. Determining the distribution of primary and secondary As mineral species in different legacy mine waste materials provides an understanding of the stability of As. Few studies have included detailed advanced mineralogical characterization of As mineral species from legacy mine waste in the Cobalt area.&#xd;
As part of this study, a total of 28 samples were collected from tailings, processed material near mill sites and soils from the legacy Nipissing and Cart Lake mining sites. The samples were analyzed for bulk chemistry to delineate material with strongly elevated As returned from all sample sites. This sampling returned highly elevated As with up to 6.01% As from samples near mill sites, 1.71% As from tailings and 0.10% As from soils. From the samples with elevated As, eight samples representative of the different sampling sites and material were selected for detailed mineralogical characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with automated mineralogy using mineral liberation analysis (MLA). Common primary As-bearing minerals identified include sulpharsenides and arsenides such as cobaltite, arsenopyrite, gersdorffite, safflorite and skutterudite; with common secondary As-bearing minerals forming post-processing including erythrite-annabergite, Fe-Ca arsenates and Fe-oxides with As. This characterization study highlighted the localized variability of mineralogical speciation and variations in the abundance of these species from the different sampling sites. The majority of the samples were dominated by secondary As minerals forming from the dissolution and oxidation of primary As-bearing mineral species and occurring as rims on grain particles, grain cementation and replacement of primary minerals. A single sample from fine-grained water saturated tailings is distinctly dominated by primary As-bearing minerals which highlights the localized redox conditions controlling oxidation. The results of this work, as well as previous characterization studies improves the understanding of the mineralogical characteristics and distribution of As-bearing legacy mine waste material with As which is critical to understand the stability of As and improve remediation planning and design.</description>

   <description>Brought back from the brink of extinction, conservation efforts are finding a home for plains bison on the North American prairie once again. This paper examines the impact that such efforts have had on Val Marie, Saskatchewan and Saco, Montana, two ranching communities separated by a national border, but sharing similar demographics and a prairie landscape. Historical differences between the two countries have led to two distinct paths toward bison conservation in each community. Interviews with Canadian participants reveal a government–led conservation program that is now largely embraced by residents of Val Marie. American interviews highlight a privately led environmental effort that has created a schism between conservationists and ranchers in Saco. Building off of concepts put forward by Paul Robbins and William Cronon, a qualitative media content analysis shows how these two projects are socially constructed in each country. The research suggests that nature and conservation is framed by communitarian values in Canada and individualistic values in the U.S.</description>

   <description>The overall aim of this research project was to develop a methodology for the development and evaluation of an energy storage and return (ESAR) system, specifically dynamic rods (DR), for insertion into a typical backpack. The criteria for a successful ESAR were to reduce the relative pack vertical displacement at a delayed phase of the gait cycle thus reducing the force demands on the body. The first objective of this research project was to investigate the effectiveness of the DR across different loads and dynamic conditions. The approach involved the use of two types of load carriage evaluation tools: (1) a computational dynamic biomechanical model (DBM) and (2) a physical Load Carriage Simulator (LCS). The secondary objective was to examine the efficacy of this methodology and determine if the DR design concept met the ESAR criteria in both the DBM and LCS. The results demonstrated that, even though the DR had a marginal effect on the relative z-displacement of the pack and z-forces experienced at the waist and hips for the DBM, similar results were not observed in the LCS trials. There was also no phase shift of the backpack observed in either evaluation tool. This, along with the displacement and force data, suggested that the current DR design did not meet the criteria for an ESAR load carriage device. Finally, the comparison of key variables between the DBM and LCS demonstrated that the LCS could not be used to validate the DBM. Despite the limitations of this study, it has provided a starting point toward developing a standardized protocol for the design and development of novel load carriage systems. A supplemental study demonstrated that increased tension of the DR straps resulted in a reduction of shoulder strap forces because the DR acted as a bridge in the mechanical system, transferring some of the forces from the shoulders to the hip belt (pelvis). Therefore, this DR concept should be considered in the design of LC devices as the reduction of shoulder forces during load carriage is an area of concern.</description>

   <description>The discharges from greenhouse operations (greenhouse effluent) in Ontario contain elevated concentrations of salts as well as nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate. The untreated release of this effluent can threaten the quality of our waters, while recycling it for repeated irrigation in greenhouses could reduce costs and save on water and nutrient resources. However, the crop damage caused by the accumulated salinity in the recirculation systems is a major drawback to this otherwise sustainable practice. In this study, engineered vegetated and unplanted gravel and wood-chip bioreactors, as well as a vertical-flow constructed wetland (CW) were operated over a long term and analysed for their nutrient and salt removal performances without seeding. The gravel-based reactors showed relatively low treatment efficiencies, while the wood-chip bioreactor planted with Typha angustifolia (narrowleaf cattail) was the first unit to achieve a near-complete denitrification, demonstrating average nitrate and phosphate removals of 92% and 26% respectively. The unplanted wood-chip bioreactor exhibited a similarly high denitrification efficiency at a later stage, while the other bioreactors removed up to 36% of the nitrate concentrations. Moreover, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (softstem bulrush) was selected as the species with the best phytodesalination performance. The microbial characterization on the interstitial water and biofilm samples showed a positive correlation between the abundance of the denitrifying genes nirS and nosZ with the denitrification performance in the T. angustifolia and unplanted units. A greater population of denitrifiers was found in these bioreactors, while the rhizosphere of T. angustifolia displayed the highest microbial activity. The contributions from the plant’s roots as well as the presence of wood-decomposing bacteria such as Bacillus spp. were suggested as the potentially important drivers of denitrification. The hybrid CW planted with the halophytic species Distichlis spicata (saltgrass) demonstrated average nitrate and phosphate removal efficiencies of 84% and 66%, as well as sodium and conductivity reductions of 15% and 25% respectively. Overall, the wood-based denitrifying systems showed promising results as an effective passive and sustainable technology for nutrient reduction for greenhouses, while more research on additional treatment was found necessary to achieve lower levels of salinity suitable for irrigation of sensitive crops using the recycled effluent.</description>

   <description>Water availability is obviously a primary regulator of plant productivity and species interactions in arid ecosystems, where many previous studies have documented these effects by manipulating soil moisture availability. The impact of altered precipitation patterns — predicted as a consequence of climate change — however, is less clear for more temperate-mesic habitats. How much does variation in soil moisture availability matter here relative to other key environmental factors?  To address this, we used a long-term field experiment to explore how the interaction of below-ground water and nutrient availability and above-ground herbivory, interact as regulators of neighbourhood biomass production and species composition in an old-field meadow in Eastern Ontario. After five years of soil water and nutrient level manipulation, with and without herbivore exclosures, we recorded above-ground dry biomass for each resident species within replicate plots. Analysis of treatment effects showed that community above-ground biomass increased with the addition of soil nutrients, decreased under reduced water levels, and was unaffected by increasing water levels or the presence of herbivore exclosures. By Contrast, species richness was altered by all applied treatments with the soil water level manipulations having the greatest effects. The soil nutrient manipulation induced changes in diversity consistent with the traditional ‘humped-back’ model, which predicts a unimodal relationship between productivity and diversity, but the soil moisture manipulation did not. Body size metrics (i.e. maximum potential body size or minimum reproductive threshold size) did not predict species biomass representation under any of the experimental manipulations. However, the biomass of the three most dominant plant species — each of agricultural and ecological significance — was altered by the soil resource manipulations. These results suggest that future precipitation regime changes are likely to negatively impact eastern Ontario’s native grassland plant species and its economically valuable hay and pasture lands. Furthermore, they challenge conventional theory regarding plant body size and competition and the relationship between productivity and diversity along gradients of soil moisture availability versus soil nutrient availability.</description>

   <description>This study focused on replacing conventional unsustainable resins currently used in the fabrication of externally bonded Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP) with bio-based resins. The first two phases of this study explored three partially bio-based resin blends, namely; one with 41% of its content derived from vegetable and wood industry by-products (VW), a cashew nut shell liquid (CN) resin blend and an epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) resin blend. The mix ratios with epoxy were varied to obtain 20 to 40% bio content for the CN resin, and 10 to 40% bio content for the ELO resin. Both glass (G) and carbon (C) fibres were investigated.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ninety tension coupons and sixty lap splice specimens were tested as part of the first phase of this study. The VW specimens had mean tensile strength (fu) within 9% of the epoxy (E) FRP specimens. The CN30%-CFRP specimens had a similar fu compared to the E-CFRP specimens, while the CN40%-GFRP specimens had a fu, 15% lower than the E-GFRP specimens. ELO20%-CFRP specimens had a fu similar to the E-CFRP specimens and the ELO30-G specimens had a fu, 13% higher than the E-GFRP specimens.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second phase, small concrete beam bond test specimens were tested to compare FRP bond strengths. It was found that the VW resin, with the highest bio content of 41%, had similar bond strength compared to epoxy. The ELO resin with 20% bio content showed the highest bond strength, at 30% higher than epoxy. The CN resin, at 20 to 30% bio content, resulted in comparable bond strengths compared to epoxy.&#xd;
&#xd;
This final phase examined the effects of freeze-thaw (FT) cycling on both FRP coupons and large-scale reinforced concrete beams with externally bonded FRPs fabricated with three different resins – a furfuryl alcohol fully bio resin, an epoxidized pine oil partial bio resin and the E resin. The FT conditioning was found to have minimal effects on the tensile strength and modulus of the FRP coupons. For the beams, the ultimate strengths after FT conditioning increased by 7 to 17%, likely due to the additional concrete curing during thawing in water.</description>

   <title>An Exploration of Coaches' Leadership Behaviours in Youth Sport</title>

   <description>There is an extensive body of literature suggesting that the full-range leadership model offers a valuable vantage point for examining leadership behaviours (Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006). Few studies, however, have applied this model to investigate coaches’ behaviours within the youth sport context (Vella, Oades, &amp; Crowe, 2013).  To address this research gap, this dissertation presented three studies examining the leadership process, the manifestation of youth sport coaches’ leadership behaviours, and the influence of coaches’ leadership behaviours on athletes’ motivational outcomes.&#xd;
	Study 1 focused on the transformational leadership (TFL) component of the full-range leadership model. This study employed a systematic literature review approach to synthesize and integrate TFL research.  Results indicated that TFL exerts its effects through processes at the intrapersonal (e.g., task perceptions, self perceptions, and emotions), interpersonal (e.g., relationship quality with leaders and peers), and environmental (e.g., climate and culture) levels.  Findings from this study highlighted key methodological considerations for researchers and practitioners wishing to examine TFL in the youth sport context.  &#xd;
	Building upon the recommendations of the first study, Study 2 focused on the development of a systematic observation instrument to capture the full-range of coaches’ leadership behaviours in sport.  This instrument was developed through an iterative process of literature review, qualitative interviews, and video observation.  The initial reliability and validity of the instrument was also assessed.  The resulting instrument: the Coach Leadership Assessment System (CLAS; Turnnidge &amp; Côté, 2016) consists of five higher-order leadership dimensions across 18 distinct behavioural categories.  &#xd;
	Finally, Study 3 utilized the CLAS to explore coaches’ leadership behaviours in youth sport.  Findings revealed that coaches most frequently displayed neutral coaching behaviours, followed by transformational and transactional coaching behaviours.  Moreover, results indicated that transformational coaching behaviours were associated with specific motivational outcomes at the interpersonal and environmental levels.&#xd;
	Overall, the present dissertation highlighted that the full-range leadership model is a valuable framework for understanding coaches’ leadership behaviours. Further, it suggested that observational methods can be a viable tool for investigating coaches’ leadership behaviours. It is hoped that the results of this dissertation will encourage further exploration of coaches’ leadership behaviours in youth sport.</description>

   <description>Though the medium of animation has existed since at least the 1900s, scholarship in the field of animation has been largely neglected in favour of the academic study of live-action films. This trend in film academia has gravely overlooked the cultural importance of animation, in particular mainstream animated television shows and feature-length films, as a medium that has historically been consumed voraciously by child and family audiences. Anime, or Japanese animation, has drastically increased in popularity in North America, spurring a wave of English-language subtitled and voice-over versions of anime television shows and films, with list of titles that are available to English viewers growing rapidly since the 1990s. Where the works of Walt Disney Studios have traditionally been the most popular and well-known in North America, Studio Ghibli takes that role in Japan as a critically acclaimed animation studio. A fundamental difference between the work of these two studios is the role of gender in the heroines that are depicted. Anime as a Japanese cultural export has become a transnational media form, in which international and particularly North American viewers have found value. This dissertation argues that Disney’s distribution of Studio Ghibli titles in North America has played a major role in anime gaining a place in the Western media landscape, therefore increasing the popularity and demand for anime being available to English-speaking audiences. It goes on to argue that there is a shift in the attitude from North American audiences towards and expectations for female characters in cinema, that can be linked to the popularity and cultural recognition of anime, and Studio Ghibli films in particular which are famous for their strong female characters. These points are evidenced by the retroactive English localization of Studio Ghibli’s 1991 film Only Yesterday (Isao Takahata dir. 1991), which only received its first English release in 2016. By exploring the ways in which anime is localized for Western audiences, this dissertation illuminates the transnational nature and potential of anime as it is interpreted by international audiences, as it contributes to the evolving role of female characters in both animated and live-action film.</description>

   <title>Characterization and Prediction of Hyporheic Flow Induced by Bars in Gravel Streams</title>

   <description>Hyporheic flows induced by bars in gravel streams are vital to the overall health of a river&#xd;
but can also be the primary mechanism for contamination to fish habitats. It is therefore of&#xd;
primordial importance to characterize such hyporheic flows under varying hydraulic and&#xd;
morphological conditions, and develop methods and tools for their prediction. This thesis&#xd;
is intended as a contribution to these ends.&#xd;
The work involves an extensive series of laboratory experiments, guided by a&#xd;
dimensional analysis of the phenomenon under consideration, and revealing a possible&#xd;
dependency of vhyp /k on Δ/Λ and Δ/hav. Hyporheic flows were visualized in a gravel bar&#xd;
and underlying substrate constructed in a 21 m long flume under nine different test cases&#xd;
(combination of varying free surface flow depths (18, 15 and 12 cm) and bar lengths (1.0,&#xd;
1.6 and 2.5 m)). Dye injections were recorded and processed to reveal hyporheic flow paths&#xd;
and velocities. Hyporheic flows upstream and downstream of the bar top traveled&#xd;
longitudinally, converged at the flow divide line and upwelled into the stream flow at the&#xd;
flow divide line. For any given bar, smaller free surface flow depths produced hyporheic&#xd;
flows that penetrated deeper into the gravel and emerged into the stream flow further&#xd;
downstream. Hyporheic flow was always turbulent with the 1.0 and 1.6 m long bars&#xd;
producing similar hyporheic flow velocities that were approximately 30% higher than those&#xd;
produced by the 2.5 m long bar. The present analysis shows that for any given value of&#xd;
Δ/Λ, vhyp /k varies with Δ/hav by first increasing from 0 to a maximum at Δ/hav ≈ 0.45, and&#xd;
then decreasing.&#xd;
Although Darcy’s equation is only valid for laminar flows, a simple model based&#xd;
on this equation was developed for determining hyporheic flows through a gravel bar with&#xd;
the goal of investigating if Darcy’s equation can provide any reasonable approximation of&#xd;
hyporheic flow. The computational grid represents the gravel bar and underlying substrate&#xd;
of the laboratory experiments. The model produced hyporheic flow paths which were in&#xd;
good agreement with the laboratory experiments. However, the hyporheic flow velocities&#xd;
were greatly underestimated. In spite of this, the model offers a quick and computationally&#xd;
simple method for preliminary assessments in practical applications.</description>

   <description>This dissertation provides the foundation for a research program in frugal digital innovation. "Frugal Digital Innovation” is a specific form of frugal innovation digital technologies play a pivotal role in enabling firm-level capabilities to overcome challenges of resource-constrained business environments. Frugal digital innovation is centered on development of products/services with a sharp focus on affordability, simplicity, and sustainability. The dissertation is rooted in two contexts – with case studies conducted in both an emerging economy (India) and a developed economy (Canada). This dissertation is among the first to theoretically and empirically confirm the presence of resource constraints and institutional voids, in certain Canadian contexts, that are similar to but less severe than those found in emerging markets. Moreover, the dissertation highlights how firms in both contexts negotiate such constraints and voids by developing frugal IT innovation capability (FITIC), which builds on business, technology, and social innovation capabilities. A digital ecodynamics perspective which focuses on the fusion of firm-level capabilities, the challenges of the ecosystem that the firm operates in, and underlying digital systems and technologies was used to examine how FITIC drives firm performance. Using affordance theory, theory of corporate frugality, and the dynamic capabilities perspective, a research framework was developed and the role of digital platforms, SMACIT technologies, and other socio-economic factors was also examined.&#xd;
As the world struggles to find innovative solutions to societal issues such as healthcare, education, poverty, and hunger, this research highlights digital strategies and capabilities that firms can develop to improve their financial, social, and sustainability performance. The dissertation discusses ecosystem-wide implications and contributes to advancement of both theoretical and practice-based knowledge. The research provides fertile ground to extend affordance theory and dynamic capabilities perspective by applying it in a frugal context while making theoretical linkages among constraints, affordances, and dynamic capabilities. It also provides insights to practitioners regarding the development of low-cost and high impact digital innovation capabilities.</description>

   <description>Birch pollen represents a significant trigger of allergic symptoms in sensitized individuals with allergic rhinitis (AR). Inhalation of birch pollen can elicit nasal and ocular symptoms, and in some patients, confer oral symptoms following ingestion of peanut-containing foods due to the cross-reactivity between birch pollen and peanut protein. These symptoms can negatively impact quality of life during in-season and out-of-season months. This thesis investigates the pathophysiology and genetics of birch pollen-induced AR using two experimental models of AR, the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) and the nasal allergen challenge (NAC), and genotyping analysis for mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG), a critical skin barrier protein. The EEU and NAC use contrasting methods of allergen delivery to mimic symptom manifestations associated with allergen exposure (EEU, continuous exposure with birch pollen grains; NAC, single dose nasal spray with birch pollen extract). Following birch allergen exposure, birch-allergic participants experienced a gradual increase in nasal and ocular symptoms over time in the EEU, which contrast the immediate sharp increase observed during the NAC. Responses to allergen challenge via these two models provided useful information to guide future studies of novel therapeutics. Using flow cytometric analysis, the frequency of group 2 innate lymphoid cells decreased in the blood and increased in the nose 4 hours after a NAC with birch pollen extract. The frequency of the four most prevalent FLG mutations in Caucasians in this investigation were significantly lower in birch-allergic participants compared to non-allergic controls, which contrasted current literature. When placed directly onto intact skin, birch pollen protein did not elicit allergic skin responses in these participants. Collectively, these data illustrate the distinct responses of the nasal mucosa compared to the epidermis when both were exposed to birch pollen. Additional studies with a larger sample size would be needed to address the lower rate of FLG mutations observed in individuals with birch pollen-induced AR.</description>

   <description>Delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch is a dominant practice in the modern Canadian administrative state.  This dissertation argues that such delegation is unconstitutional.  The unwritten principles of democracy, the separation of powers, and the rule of law – all defining features of the Constitution pursuant to leading Supreme Court of Canada decisions – demand that legislative decision-making be performed in legislatures.  Only the legislative branch has the mandate and the legitimacy to make substantive choices about the content of the law.  The dissertation draws on the architecture of the Constitution to posit a theory of democracy as an institutionally specific form of conflict resolution.  This theory provides that legislators abdicate their responsibilities when they delegate substantive legislative power, and courts abdicate their responsibilities when they permit such a fundamental distortion of constitutional structure to proceed.  A judicially enforced nondelegation doctrine is a corollary of the way the Constitution is built.  The project makes the case for the existence of a Canadian nondelegation doctrine, outlines its meaning and content, and illustrates its application in specific legislative contexts.</description>

   <title>An Assessment of Population Genetic Structure in Guillemots (Cepphus)</title>

   <description>Understanding how evolutionary forces shape population genetic structure is a principal goal of evolutionary geneticists. Guillemots (Aves: Charadriiformes: Alcidae: Cepphus) provide useful systems for investigating population genetic differentiation in a genus with a wide geographic range that disperses according to a one-dimensional stepping stone model. Guillemots may also be highly vulnerable to climate change in parts of their range. For this reason, identifying population genetic structure is important for their successful management and conservation. I used various genetic markers and methods to assess population genetic variation in pigeon guillemots (C. columba) and black guillemots (C. grylle). In both species, I found evidence of limited dispersal and restricted gene flow between distant populations. Genetic differentiation appeared to follow a pattern of isolation by distance in both species. In pigeon guillemots, evidence suggested that population genetic structure arose through a combination of both historical and contemporary processes. Based on my results, I recommend that pigeon guillemot subspecies be revised. I also suggest that pigeon guillemot populations in the Aleutian Islands be considered for designation as an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) as their differentiation has been strongly influenced by historical processes. Population genetic structure in black guillemots did agree with current subspecies delineations. Based on the level of variation detected within the subspecies however, I would recommend that black guillemots be treated as management units. The results from this study hold promising insight into how patterns of gene flow can lead to different patterns of population genetic structure.</description>

   <description>Haptic simulation systems allow human users to kinesthetically interact with virtual environment models through a robotic mechanism known as a haptic interface. The sampled-data nature of haptic interfaces limits the range of virtual environment dynamics that can be stably rendered in a haptic simulation system which limits the available performance of haptic systems. A method of increasing the range of stably implementable virtual environment dynamics, and the focus of this thesis, is through the investigation of different discrete virtual environment implementations. The passivity and uncoupled stability criteria are considered the most stringent conditions on the stability of haptic simulations systems. In this thesis, seven different discretizations of a spring-damper virtual environment are derived and studied using the passivity and uncoupled stability criteria. Traditionally, position-sampling is the method by which feedback is acquired from a haptic system, however, in this thesis the effects of sampling velocity and that of sampling both position and velocity are studied. As well, a single degree-of-freedom haptic device was developed with analog circuitry to implement velocity-sampled and position and velocity-sampled haptic simulation systems. Results indicate that a zero-order-hold position-sampled implementation may provide a larger range of implementable dynamics than the benchmark, backward difference. It was found that the sampled-PV implementation shows great potential to increase the range of implementable dynamics over existing position-sampled implementations.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: This study examined the associations between objective and perceived measures of pedestrian traffic safety in the home neighbourhood with outdoor active play among 10- to 13-year-olds.  It also determined if the association between objectively measured pedestrian safety and outdoor active play is moderated by parents’ perceptions of pedestrian safety. &#xd;
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 10- to 13-year-olds (N = 458) from Kingston, ON, Canada (population 123,798). Outdoor active play was measured over 7 consecutive days using a combination of data from activity logs, accelerometers, Global Positioning System loggers, and Geographic Information System. 1 km road network buffers were used to define participants’ home neighbourhoods. Within these buffers Geographic Information System software and data were used to create traffic volume, traffic calming, traffic speed, pedestrian infrastructure, and overall pedestrian safety indexes. Parents’ perceptions of these pedestrian safety domains were obtained by questionnaire. General linear models were used to examine the relationships of interest.  Several covariates were adjusted for in these models.&#xd;
Results: The average outdoor active play was 38.3 min/day (27.6 SD). The overall perceived and objective pedestrian safety indexes were not associated with outdoor active play (p > 0.1); however, significant associations were observed for some of the specific domains of pedestrian safety.  Children whose parents perceived moderate or high traffic speeds in their neighbourhood had outdoor active play values that were 0.35 (SE=0.10, p=0.021) and 0.20 (SE=0.15, p=0.048) SD units higher, respectively, than children whose parents perceived low traffic speed. By comparison to children from neighbourhoods in the lowest tertile, children from the highest traffic volume tertile had higher outdoor active play levels (0.26, SE=0.12, p=0.029), while children from neighbourhoods in the moderate traffic calming tertile (-0.28, SE=0.11, p=0.008) and the moderate pedestrian infrastructure tertile (-0.25, SE=0.11, p=0.023) had lower outdoor active play levels. There were no interactions between the objective and perceived measures (p>0.05).&#xd;
Conclusions: In this study of 10- to 13-year-olds from a mid-sized city there was some albeit inconsistent evidence that outdoor active play was lower in children residing in the most pedestrian safe neighbourhoods.</description>

   <description>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly-regulated enzyme that plays essential roles in central plant metabolism, particularly in the replenishment of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates withdrawn for biosynthesis or N-assimilation. In developing castor oil seeds (COS) an enigmatic ‘bacterial-type’ PEPC (BTPC) isozyme is highly expressed as a catalytic and regulatory subunit of a novel Class-2 PEPC heteromeric complex. During COS development BTPC is subject to in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser451, a highly conserved target residue occurring within an intrinsically-disordered domain. This phosphorylation event is catalyzed by RcCDPK1, a member of the castor Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family. Ca2+-dependent autokinase activity of CDPKs has been reported and may influence CDPK transphosphorylation activity and substrate accessibility. However, the functions and in vivo occurrence of CDPK autophosphorylation remain poorly understood. A major objective of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that autophosphorylation influences RcCDPK1’s ability to transphosphorylate its BTPC substrate at Ser451. Ca2+-stimulated autokinase activity of heterologously expressed RcCDPK1WT was readily detected by pIMAGOTM phosphoprotein reagent, and multiple pSer, pThr, and pTyr residues were mapped via LC-MS/MS. These included Tyr30 which: (i) occurs at the interface of RcCDPK1’s N-terminal variable and catalytic domains, and (ii) is conserved and also autophosphorylated in RcCDPK1 orthologs AtCPK4 and GmCDPKβ.  The influence of Tyr30 autophosphorylation was examined by generating a phosphoablative Y30F mutant (RcCDPK1Y30F). In vitro dephosphorylated RcCDPK1WT exhibited an ~9-fold increase in its rate of Ca2+-dependent BTPC transphosphorylation at Ser451 relative to autophosphorylated RcCDPK1WT. Conversely, RcCDPK1Y30F showed no obvious difference relative to RcCDPK1 WT with respect to its autokinase or BTPC Ser451 transphosphorylation activity. Although global autophosphorylation of RcCDPK1 is highly inhibitory, Tyr30 autophosphorylation appears to have little impact on its kinase activity. Preliminary attempts to detect in vivo RcCDPK1 phosphorylation in developing COS, as well as following via transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves were conducted by probing immunoblots of clarified extracts with anti-pTyr30 antibodies. Collectively, results of this thesis provide insight into the links between plant carbon metabolism, Ca2+-dependent signaling, and the biological significance of CDPK autophosphorylation.</description>

   <description>Based on participant interviews this project describes and interprets the practices, self understandings, and motivations of contemporary wildlife photographers. It seeks to contextualize these practices within the history of animal hunting, the genesis of animal photography, and with regard to the contemporary surge in biodiversity loss.  The central paradox of this work lies in the diminishing numbers of wildlife populations compared to the proliferation of images produced through animal photography.</description>

   <title>Evaluation of a Counterflow Thermoelectric Heat Exchanger in a Solar Domestic Hot Water System</title>

   <subject>Solar Domestic Hot Water</subject>
   <description>Solar assisted heat pumps are a method of improving the energy efficiency of a domestic hot water system while reducing the impact on the environment. Traditional vapour-compression heat pumps use harmful refrigerants that are susceptible to leaks and have moving parts that require maintenance. Thermoelectric devices have recently shown an increase in performance and a decrease in unit cost, allowing them to be a viable, maintenance-free alternative to traditional heat pump cycles. A thermoelectric model was developed using EES to determine the operating performances of an indirect solar assisted heat pump system (ISHAP), as well as a solar-side ISAHP. The model was verified using a twisted-tape liquid-liquid heat exchanger which incorporated 21 modules for a total heat pumping capacity of 1.62 kW. The thermoelectric heat exchanger was tested across a range of inlet conditions and applied currents and was shown to be accurate to within 7.9 % of the model. A custom TYPE was created in TRNSYS to allow for the optimization of the two systems over a simulated year using directly-coupled PV/T hybrid panels. Using the designed heat exchanger the optimized ISAHP produced a solar fraction of 70.2 % using 50 modules and 6 m2 of collector area. The solar-side ISAHP operated at a higher efficiency with a solar fraction of 73 % using just 21 modules and 6 m2 of collector area. A control scheme was recommended that showed an improvement of 10.3 % in solar fraction over the solar-side ISAHP, while operating at an average COP of 2.5. It was shown that in improvement in the heat transfer rate of the liquid-liquid heat exchanger could further improve the solar fraction of the standard ISAHP system by 12 %. Additional system optimization is required to aid in matching the electrical and thermal requirements of the thermoelectrics, through the decoupling of the electrical production of the panels to allow for more accurate control, or the addition of photovoltaic modules to supplement the electrical output of the PV/T panels.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we have extended the SCL (Structured and Context Language) network protocol description language to describe the complex constraints for the network engineer. Previous SCL developed with the focus of penetration testing and not sufficient for constraint scenarios. The constraint scenarios include multiple-packet with order and environmental information. To address the current limitation of the SCL, we have proposed syntaxes which are declarative in nature. We have studied three different styles of syntaxes to handle constraint scenarios of an IDS (Intrusion detection system). The three syntaxes are based on Java expressions, QUEL and Prolog. We have represented three constraints for command and control systems such as ATC (Air Traffic Control) network using our syntaxes. The same constraints have been previously used by a constraint engine to demonstrate the capability of the IDS. We evaluate each of the syntax based on the four design guidelines for the domain specific language (DSL). The Java-based syntax shows better capability to represent constraints based on four DSL design guidelines. Finally, we show the mapping of the constraints represented in our syntaxes with the low-level DSL (Domain Specific Language) of the constraint engine. The mapping shows our syntaxes has all relevant information to translate into the low-level DSL.</description>

   <title>Individual Variation in Glucocorticoid Levels: a Field Study of Repeatability</title>

   <description>We readily appreciate the wide phenotypic diversity that distinguishes animal species; however, even within a population of the same species, individuals can express significant phenotypic variation in their behavior, morphology, and physiology. Natural selection acts on among-individual phenotypic variation, linking an individual’s phenotype to its fitness. A necessary first step toward understanding some evolutionary and ecological processes, which are driven by the relative fitness of certain phenotypes over others, is to accurately characterize consistent individual differences in traits that influence survival and/or reproduction. Circulating concentrations of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are plastic (i.e., capable of changing across a range of temporal scales in response to internal or external conditions) and involved in numerous processes related to fitness. We assessed the repeatability (or, trait consistency) of corticosterone (CORT; the primary avian GC) titers in free-living black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) during the non-breeding season. We also investigated internal and external factors that could explain the degree of repeatability/plasticity we observed. We found that initial CORT concentration had a significant agreement repeatability of 0.284. On average, CORT concentrations were higher during the second capture compared to the first. Furthermore, initial CORT was lower among individuals that experienced lower temperatures and higher wind speeds prior to capture, and among individuals with relatively poorer oxidative balance. Overall, our results suggest that individuals respond plastically to harsh winter conditions, while also maintaining a degree of within- individual consistency that may reflect the influence of a combination of genetic differences among individuals and stability in aspects of their environment. These findings add to the accumulating evidence that suggests that individual variation in GC concentrations within populations can often reflect short-term, dynamic changes in the environment more so than fixed differences among individuals.</description>

   <title>Functional size traits in crowded vegetation: when bigger isn’t better</title>

   <description>Why do some species within crowded vegetation have greater numerical abundance than others?  Functional traits are often explored as predictors of success under certain habitat conditions, and in the context of competition, traditional plant competition theory is based on a ‘size advantage’ (SA) hypothesis, where larger plants are generally considered better competitors for contested resources. However, body size distributions are right-skewed at virtually all scales — from plants within populations to species within communities, within phylogenetic lineages, and across entire regional floras. And field studies in crowded natural vegetation—both woody and herbaceous—have generally failed to find evidence for a species size advantage in predicting numerical abundance. This paradox has recently been interpreted in terms of a ‘reproductive economy’ advantage (REA) whereby smaller species, although severely suppressed in size by neighbourhood crowding, are nevertheless generally more likely (than larger species) to produce at least some offspring. Traits that might be associated with greater reproductive economy, and of interest here, include smaller values for three size metrics: minimum reproductive threshold size (MIN), seed size, and leaf size. Here, we used a combination of natural field surveys, greenhouse studies and multi-season field experiments to further investigate the relative importance of SA and REA in old-field meadow vegetation in eastern Ontario. Overall, we found strong support for a reproductive economy advantage, particularly for smaller MIN – and especially when crowding from neighbouring vegetation was the most intense and when species had a long, relatively undisturbed history of growing together. We found weak and inconsistent support for the size advantage hypothesis across all studies and in many cases, we could not detect a signal for either the SA or the REA hypotheses. This was especially true when species were introduced that had no history of growing together. We also explored how dry mass predicts other metrics of plant body size that better reflect ‘space occupancy’ (SO) in situ (i.e. canopy height, area, and volume) — and found that plants/species with smaller SO body size often had greater dry mass per unit SO body size. These allometric relationships have important implications for fecundity allocation and the REA hypothesis. The combined results of these studies suggest that both SA and REA are likely important, but dependent on the local severity of crowding between near neighbours — with REA generally being more important as crowding increases, and SA (contrary to traditional theory) more important as crowding decreases.  At the whole community level then, across highly variable levels of local crowding, evidence for REA in predicting abundance is likely to be obscured by SA effects and vice versa.</description>

   <description>Production of flotation concentrates from ores require a variety of reagents that include&#xd;
complexing agents such as cyanide and triethylenetetramine (TETA). These chemicals, while&#xd;
being useful for the process, can cause environmental issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, the batch flotation of selected ores was investigated together with the surface&#xd;
chemical phenomena related to the use of three complexants, namely TETA, cyanide and&#xd;
chloride. The ores consisted of Ni-Cu sulfides, rich in pyrrhotite and a galena-pyrite sample, both&#xd;
of which involved the use of TETA and a pyrite-based sample. Investigations with the first group&#xd;
indicated that the metabisulfite SMBS/TETA combination in synthetic seawater performed better&#xd;
in comparison with tap water. The synergistic effect of SMBS/TETA was superior due to&#xd;
enhanced complexing activity in chloride-rich medium. The pyrite sample that had been pre-&#xd;
contacted with cyanide was successfully desulfurized to minimize acid production potential in the&#xd;
environment. These investigations were coupled with fundamental investigations on&#xd;
electrochemistry of pyrrhotite, pyrite and galena through cyclic voltammetry, electrical&#xd;
impedance spectroscopy, contact angle measurements under applied electrochemical potential, as&#xd;
well as Raman spectroscopy and UV studies.&#xd;
&#xd;
The electrochemical studies provided evidence for the synergistic effect of the SMBS/TETA&#xd;
combination. The contact angle measurements provided support for formation metastable sulfur&#xd;
causing hydrophobicity in the absence of collector, which was largely masked on iron sulfides&#xd;
due to dominance of their surfaces with ferric hydroxide/oxide. Raman spectroscopy of the&#xd;
flotation concentrates provided clear evidence for the formation of metastable elemental sulfur/polysulfide on cyanide-contacted pyrite, which was a key factor explaining its unusual&#xd;
floatability. UV spectroscopy of ethanol extracts from the flotation concentrates provided further&#xd;
evidence of elemental sulfur forming on the mineral surfaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
Overall, these results represent a unique linkage between surface chemical phenomena and&#xd;
genuine flotation behaviour of several ore samples. Proper use of the SMBS/TETA combination&#xd;
is demonstrated to be a potential solution to rectify poor flotation of sulfide ores in seawater. The&#xd;
sulfurous acid-copper sulfate treatment is demonstrated to be a potential solution for&#xd;
desulfurization of cyanide tailings. In the environmental area, the microorganism Paecilomyces&#xd;
sp. (KC790497.1) demonstrated to biodegrade over 90% Cu-TETA complex in aqueous&#xd;
solutions.</description>

   <description>This project seeks to account for the ways in which Anglo-settler anxiety has influenced the construction of the mythos of a benevolent Canadian national identity. I argue that settler anxiety toward Indigeneity is the underlying affective condition of Canadian Anglo-settler society, and continues to inform contemporary reconciliation politics. My thesis proceeds by questioning the role that this collective feeling of anxiety has played in the construction of Canada’s reconciliatory politics. To what extent has this anxiety motivated Canada’s reconciliation project? How does the current structure of the reconciliation process alleviate this anxiety rather than confront it? My thesis will wager that the provocation of settler anxieties by Indigenous artists — and the mobilization of those anxieties in popular discourse—has the potential to reveal the inadequacies of dominant understandings of a teleological reconciliation project in Canada and thereby re-politicize the reconciliation process. Specifically, I look to Haisla writer Eden Robinson’s fiction to examine how Robinson’s novel Monkey Beach and her short story “Terminal Avenue” exemplify an alternative approach to Canada’s reconciliation project through their provocation and textual representations of settler anxiety.</description>
