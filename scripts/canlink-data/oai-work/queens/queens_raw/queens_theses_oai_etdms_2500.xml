   <description>In Be Good, Sweet Maid: The Trials of Dorothy Joudrie (1999), Audrey Andrews recounts the life and trial of Dorothy Joudrie, a so-called wealthy socialite who was arrested in Calgary in 1995 for attempting to murder her estranged husband after decades of domestic abuse. Andrews tells Joudrie’s story in the form of a semi-auto/biographical text that quotes other scholarly and creative literary works in an intertextual dialogue about violence against women, post-World War II gender socialization, and the “battered women syndrome” defence. This thesis takes this highly referential dialogue as its starting point, and then extends Andrews’ cultural work by tracing a genealogy of colonialism in Canadian domestic violence laws with the help of selected intertexts – including Yvonne Johnson’s Stolen Life: Journey of a Cree Woman (1998), the trial of Angelique Lavallee, and Lorena Bobbitt’s infamous case. First, I source the epigraphs that Andrews strategically places at the start of each chapter and discern the layer of meaning that these external texts bring to Joudrie’s story in order to raise questions about how Andrews rearticulates the work of others and the politics of such a rearticulation. Second, I similarly frame Joudrie’s 1995 trial as a referential and intertextual discourse based in precedent established by the Supreme Court in 1990 when it ruled that expert testimony on the “battered woman syndrome” was admissible in the R. v. Lavallee case (Shaffer 1). This allows me to consider a consequence of the ruling often overlooked in feminist literature: due to the fact that the original defendant, Angelique Lavallee, was a Métis woman whose identity was erased in the courtroom and in case law, subsequent trials employing the “battered woman syndrome” defence repeat settler relations entrenched in colonial violence. Third, I expose how representations can fail by thinking through what Stephen Couser calls the auto/bio/ethics of life writing, which reveals the limits of Canadian laws and literatures. Ultimately, this discussion generates questions about who is considered human under the law and how life writing might re-imagine the “reasonable” human in more just and compassionate ways.</description>

   <description>The prothrombinase (IIase) complex is an essential component of the coagulation cascade and is composed of a serine protease, Factor Xa (FXa), its non-enzymatic cofactor, Factor Va (FVa), calcium and a phospholipid membrane surface. It activates prothrombin (FII) to thrombin, the principal stimulator of clot formation in vivo. FII activation by IIase is mediated by specific interactions between FII and FVa. Preliminary NMR and peptidyl mimicry studies identified six residues within the FII Fragment 2 (F2) domain (S160, Q177, R181, L182, V184 and T185) that likely mediate an interaction between it and the heavy chain of FVa. Therefore, six recombinant FII derivatives were prepared whereby each of the aforementioned residues was mutated to alanine. FII activation kinetics by FXa in the presence or absence of FVa was measured by DAPA-thrombin complex formation. The results show that FII-S160A, -R181A, -L182A, -V184A and &#xd;
-T185A had no significant effect on the catalytic efficiency of the reaction in the presence of FVa. In the absence of FVa, the catalytic efficiency of FII-R181A, -L182A, -V184A, and -T185A derivatives decreased by 17-27% compared with wildtype, while FII-S160A had no effect. FII-Q177A, however, showed a significant increase of 17% in catalytic efficiency in the presence of FVa but no change in its absence. Two double (FII-Q177A/R181A and FII-R181A/T185A) and one triple (FII-Q177A/R181A/T185) mutants were generated to determine if multiple mutations would have an additive effect. These derivatives were indistinguishable from wildtype in the presence of FVa. In the absence of FVa, however, their catalytic efficiency values decreased 12-25% compared with wildtype. Further comparison of these values showed that FII-R181A and &#xd;
-Q177A/R181A both decreased by 25%, while FII-R181A/T185A and &#xd;
-Q177A/R181A/T185A decreased by 12% and 24% with respect to the wildtype, respectively. Both comparisons, where the only difference was an additional mutation at Q177, suggest that Q177 does not affect the activation kinetics of FII in the absence of FVa. Taken together, our data suggest that Q177 in the F2 domain of FII is likely involved in interacting with IIase through a FVa-dependent mechanism while residues R181, L182, V184 and T185 may be involved through a FVa-independent mechanism.</description>

   <title>Functional characterization of a Kar3/Vik1-like Kinesin-14 heterodimer from the filamentous multinucleate fungus Ashbya gossypii</title>

   <description>Kinesins are motor proteins that convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical energy used to generate force along microtubules, transporting organelles, vesicles, and proteins within the cell. Kar3 kinesins are microtubule minus-end-directed motors with pleiotropic functions in mating and mitosis of budding and fission yeast. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kar3 is multifunctionalized by two non-catalytic companion proteins, Vik1 and Cik1. A Kar3-like kinesin and a single Vik1/Cik1 ortholog are also expressed by the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii, which exhibits different nuclear movement challenges and unique microtubule dynamics from its yeast relatives. We hypothesized that these differences in A. gossypii physiology could translate into interesting and novel differences in its versions of Kar3 and Vik1/Cik1. Presented here is a structural and functional analysis of recombinantly expressed and purified forms of these motor proteins. Compared to the previously published S. cerevisiae Kar3 motor domain structure (ScKar3MD), AgKar3MD displays differences in the conformation of the ATPase pocket. Perhaps it is not surprising then that we observed the maximal microtubule-stimulated ATPase rate (kcat) of AgKar3MD to be approximately 3-fold slower than ScKar3MD, and that the affinity of AgKar3MD for microtubules (Kd,MT) was lower than ScKar3MD. This may suggest that elements that compose the ATPase pocket and that participate in conformational changes required for efficient ATP hydrolysis or products release work differently for AgKar3 and ScKar3. There are also subtle structural differences in the disposition of the secondary structural elements in the small lobe (B1a, B1b, and B1c) at the edge of the motor domain of AgKar3 that may reflect the enhanced microtubule-depolymerization activity that we observed for this motor, or they could relate to its interactions with a different regulatory companion protein than its budding yeast counterpart. Although we were unable to gain experimentally determined high-resolution information of AgVik1, the results of Phyre2-based bioinformatics analyses may provide a structural explanation for the limited microtubule-binding activity we observed. These and other fundamental differences in AgKar3/Vik1 could explain divergent functionalities from the ScKar3/Vik1 and ScKar3/Cik1 motor assemblies.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-27 08:58:05.298</description>
   <description>Rationale: Methacholine and mannitol challenges are used clinically to assess airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Cough during (a) high-dose methacholine challenge in individuals with methacholine-induced cough and normal airway sensitivity and (b) mannitol challenge in some individuals with asthma both occur in the absence of significant declines in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). We hypothesized mechanical responses to these challenges would reflect a continuum amongst subjects with: (i) asthma; (ii) cough variant asthma (CVA) and (iii) methacholine-induced cough and normal airway sensitivity due to varying degrees of impairment/preservation of the beneficial effects of deep inspirations. &#xd;
Purpose: To compare cough and airway responses to mannitol and high-dose methacholine challenges between these groups. &#xd;
Methods: Individuals with asthma or suspected CVA were invited to participate. Subjects were challenged with mannitol and high-dose methacholine in random order 2-14 days apart. Cough frequency, spirometry and esophageal-pressure were recorded at baseline and after each dose of mannitol and methacholine to a maximal decline in FEV1 of 15% and 50% respectively. Plethysmography was used to measure lung volumes at baseline, the dose nearest to a 15% decline in FEV1 during mannitol challenge (PD15) and 20% decline in FEV1 during methacholine challenge (PC20), and at the highest dose of methacholine. Measurements were compared: (a) between groups at PD15, PC20 and the highest dose of methacholine; and (b) within groups at PD15 and PC20, and the highest equivalent level of bronchoconstriction. &#xd;
Results: 22 subjects (17 female; 48.0±12.7 (mean±SD years)) who completed both challenges were included. All subjects coughed during both challenges. Mechanical responses to mannitol and high-dose methacholine challenges reflected a continuum amongst groups. Six of 8 subjects with asthma were mannitol postitive (PD15=115.2±100.0 mg) and were significantly more sensitive to mannitol compared to 3 of 5 mannitol positive subjects with CVA (PD15=533.6±88.3 mg; p=0.020) and 3 of 9 mannitol positive subjects with methacholine-induced cough and normal airway sensitivity (PD15=472.8±203.0 mg; p=0.037). At the highest equivalent level of bronchoconstriction, methacholine induced significant declines in FEF50% and FEF25-75% in all subjects groups while mannitol did not.&#xd;
Conclusion: Mechanical responses to mannitol and high-dose methacholine challenges reflected a continuum amongst groups.</description>

   <description>This dissertation considers quantile regression models with nonstationary or nearly nonstationary time series. The first chapter outlines the thesis and discusses its theoretical and empirical contributions. The second chapter studies inference in quantile regressions with cointegrated variables allowing for multiple structural changes. The unknown break dates and regression coefficients are estimated jointly and consistently. The conditional quantile estimator has a nonstandard limit distribution. A fully modified estimator is proposed to remove the second-order bias and nuisance parameters and the resulting limit distribution is mixed normal. A simulation study shows that the fully modified quantile estimator has good finite sample properties. The model is applied to stock index data from the emerging markets of China and several mature markets. Financial market integration is found in some quantiles of the Chinese stock indices. The third chapter considers predictive quantile regression with a nearly integrated regressor. We derive nonstandard distributions for the quantile regression estimator and t-statistic in terms of functionals of diffusion processes. The critical values are found to depend on both the quantile of interest and the local-to-unity parameter, which is not consistently estimable. Based on these critical values, we propose a valid Bonferroni bounds test for quantile predictability with persistent regressors. We employ this new methodology to test the ability of many commonly employed and highly persistent regressors, such as the dividend yield, earnings price ratio, and T-bill rate, to predict the median, shoulders, and tails of the stock return distribution. Chapter Four proposes a cumulated sum (CUSUM) test for the null hypothesis of quantile cointegration. A fully modified quantile estimator is adopted for serial correlation and endogeneity corrections. The CUSUM statistic is composed of the partial sums of the residuals from the fully modified quantile regression. Under the null, the test statistic converges to a functional of Brownian motions. In the application to U.S. interest rates of different maturities, evidence in favor of the expectations hypothesis for the term structure is found in the central part of the distributions of the Treasury bill rate and financial commercial paper rate, but in the tails of the constant maturity rate distribution.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-31 12:45:57.767</description>
   <description>In this thesis, we study the operator algebraic structure of various classes of unimodular free quantum groups, including thefree orthogonal quantum groups $O_n^+$,  free unitary quantum groups $U_n^+$, and trace-preserving quantum automorphism groups associated to finite dimensional C$^\ast$-algebras. &#xd;
&#xd;
The first objective of this thesis to establish certain approximation properties for the reduced operator algebras associated to the quantum groups $\G = O_n^+$ and $U_n^+$, ($n \ge 2$). Here we prove that the reduced von Neumann algebras $L^\infty(\G)$ have the Haagerup approximation property, the reduced C$^\ast$-algebras $C_r(\G)$ have Grothendieck's metric approximation property, and that the quantum convolution algebras $L^1(\G)$ admit multiplier-bounded approximate identities. &#xd;
&#xd;
We then go on to study trace-preserving quantum automorphism groups $\G$ of finite dimensional C$^\ast$-algebras $(B, \psi)$, where $\psi$ is the canonical trace on $B$ induced by the regular representation of $B$. Here, we extend several known results for free orthogonal and free unitary quantum groups to the setting of quantum automorphism groups. We prove that the discrete dual quantum groups $\hG$ have the property of rapid decay, the von Neumann algebras $L^\infty(\G)$ have the Haagerup approximation property, and that $L^\infty(\G)$ is (in most cases) a full type II$_1$-factor. As applications of these and other results, we deduce the metric approximation property, exactness, simplicity and uniqueness of trace for the reduced C$^\ast$-algebras $C_r(\G)$, and the existence of multiplier-bounded approximate identities for the convolution algebras $L^1(\G)$. We also show that when $B$ is a full matrix algebra, $L^\infty(\G)$ is an index $2$ subfactor of $L^\infty(O_n^+)$, and thus solid and prime. &#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, we investigate strong Haagerup inequalities in the context of quantum symmetries arising from actions of free quantum groups on non-commutative random variables.  We prove a generalization of the strong Haagerup inequality for $\ast$-free R-diagonal families due to Kemp and Speicher, and apply this result to study strong Haagerup inequalites for the free unitary quantum groups.</description>

   <description>Aim: The aim of this study was to: 1) investigate the geographic distribution of six pregnancy complications associated with future maternal cardiovascular disease risk in the province of Ontario and 2) to identify regions where women are likely to benefit from post-partum cardiovascular disease screening, based on the development of complications during pregnancy. &#xd;
&#xd;
Rationale: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Canadian women. Pregnancy has been likened to a cardiovascular stress test and provides an early opportunity to assess a female’s lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of data collected for the Niday Perinatal Database, provided by the Better Outcomes Registry &amp; Network. Crude and age-standardized cumulative incidences of six pregnancy complications, and one or more pregnancy complications, were calculated for each Public Health Unit area in Ontario. The cumulative incidence of one or more pregnancy complications for women with no previous history of cardiovascular disease or traditional cardiovascular risk factors was calculated at the Public Health Unit and census subdivision area levels. Spatial statistics were applied to locate statistically significant clusters of high cumulative incidence.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Crude and age-standardized cumulative incidences of each pregnancy complication and one or more pregnancy complications varied across Public Health Unit areas in Ontario. The crude cumulative incidence of one or more complications ranged from 74 to 224 cases per 1000 pregnancies.  The spatial analysis identified one statistically significant cluster of high cumulative incidence at the Public Health Unit area level, spanning the Lambton, Chatham-Kent, and Windsor-Essex Health Unit areas. Seven statistically significant clusters of high cumulative incidence census subdivisions were located within the following Public Health Unit areas: Chatham-Kent, Lambton, Middlesex-London, Ottawa, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark, Renfrew County, Simcoe Muskoka, Grey Bruce, and Eastern Ontario.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: Regional variation in the cumulative incidence of six pregnancy complications associated with cardiovascular disease risk was observed in Ontario. Statistically significant clusters of high cumulative incidence of one or more of these pregnancy complications were identified. These regions in particular may benefit from post-partum screening clinics and increased awareness regarding the association between pregnancy complications and cardiovascular disease.</description>

   <description>The number of obese youth in Canada has tripled over the past 30 years. Two contributing factors to obesity are physical inactivity and poor nutrition. To improve these negative health behaviours, the factors that contribute to their development must be understood and intervened upon. Researchers are focusing on the built environment as one potential factor. The built environment refers to human made physical structures and infrastructure of communities that can influence health behaviours. These include the roads, buildings, parks and recreation facilities, and food retailers of which people can use through work, play, or eating. &#xd;
The purpose of this thesis was to determine how the built environment influences physical inactivity and fast food consumption in 11-15-year-old Canadians. Physical inactivity and fast food consumption were assessed in a national study called the Canadian Health Behaviour in School Aged Children Survey. Over 6000 youth in grades 6 to 10 were examined. Information on several built environment features were obtained in the neighbourhoods of these 6000 youth using Geographic Information Systems. Measures included walkability indices, parks and other outdoor play spaces, recreation facilities, aesthetics, and fast food restaurants. Relationships between behaviours (physical inactivity, excessive fast food consumption) and neighbourhood built environments were examined using complex statistical tests. &#xd;
Results indicated that youth living in highly walkable neighbourhoods, neighbourhoods with few or no cul-de-sacs, and neighbourhoods with a modest amount of park space were most likely to be physically inactive. Youth living in neighbourhoods with a moderate or high density of fast food restaurants were more likely to be excessive fast food consumers than youth living in neighbourhoods with no fast food restaurants. Approximately 15-30% of physical inactivity and excessive fast food consumption within the population was attributed to features of the neighbourhood built environment. 	&#xd;
This thesis demonstrates that several features of the neighbourhood built environment influence obesity-related health behaviours in youth. Results may guide future policy development and intervention research targeting the built environment.</description>

   <description>Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are the chief glial population of the mammalian olfactory nervous system and are thought to be responsible for the successful directional growth of new olfactory axons throughout the life of adult mammals. Due to this unique property, OECs have been targeted as a potential cellular transplantation therapy for spinal cord injury. In order to effectively isolate OECs for intraspinal transplantation, more knowledge must be gained on their phenotypic properties. We investigated the neurochemical features of OECs in a variety of mammalian species (including hamsters, rabbits, monkeys, mice, and pigs) using three biomarkers: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100β, and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA). In addition, we tested the ability of a few biomatrices to sustain and promote OEC growth and survival in vitro. The rationale for using biomatrices is to provide a supportive environment for glial and axonal growth in the spinal lesion. Here, we found that mucosal and bulbar OECs from all five of the aforementioned mammalian species express S100β. Expression of GFAP, however, was not consistent across the five species. Both mucosal and bulbar OECs of monkeys express αSMA; only bulbar OECs of hamsters and only mucosal OECs of rabbits express αSMA as well. Though αSMA immunostaining was not detected in the OECs of adult mice, in adult mutant mice lacking αSMA expression, OECs displayed perturbed ultrastructural morphology. None of the biomatrices used (methacrylated glycol chitosan, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid – grafted methacrylated glycol chitosan, and agarose) were able to promote OEC proliferation. Isolated strips of rodent olfactory lamina propria (the deep connective tissue layer in the olfactory mucosa containing primary sensory axons and OECs) showed sustained growth when cultured for 10 days. In sum, these findings highlight the following points: the efficacy of S100β and αSMA as biomarkers for mammalian OECs in vivo; the potential for isolated strips of lamina propria to provide a natural, supportive environment for OECs during intraspinal transplantation; the failure of methacrylated glycol chitosan and its derivatives, as well as agarose, to promote OEC proliferation.</description>

   <description>In the current study I explore the 'high-risk youth' label and why and how it is applied to young people in relation to community supports and service providers. Particularly, implications of this label are examined by detailing The Centre, a youth outreach, as an alternative to conventional approaches from community supports and service providers towards meeting the health needs of young people. The Centre is a pseudonym. Using a youth engagement model as an approach to harm reduction, The Centre appointed two experienced service users in leadership positions as peers to contribute towards developing programmes and delivering services. Collaborating with both peers at The Centre, the following research questions were explored: a) What do the peers understand as "good health"?; and, b) What do the peers identify and describe as barriers to attaining what they understand as "good health". With the use of Photovoice, a Participatory Action Research (PAR) method, the peers answer these questions by identifying and describing multiple themes through discussions of often complex and intersecting realities in regards to what they voice as their own health needs. By presenting the peers voice as captured through discussion, I provide an explanation for social exclusion from processes that define them and their needs as a fundamental determinant of health.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-30 11:56:23.999</description>
   <description>According to traditional theory, superior competitive ability in plants generally requires a relatively large plant body size. Yet, within natural, crowded vegetation, most resident species are small, and species size distributions are right-skewed at virtually all scales. I aim to provide a potential explanation for this paradox: small species are able to coexist with and outcompete larger species because smaller species have greater ‘reproductive economy’—the ability for some seed production despite severe size suppression when under intense competition. Tracey and Aarssen (2011) found an isometric relationship between minimum reproductive threshold size (MRTS) and maximum resident plant size (MAX); however, a more accurate measure of maximum potential body size (MPBS) was needed (without competition), as typically the effects of competition are size-dependent. An isometric relationship, similar to Tracey and Aarssen (2011) was seen. Tracey and Aarssen (2011) also found that, contrary to the predictions of traditional theory, larger species were not more abundant (based on plot occupancy) in an old-field community. A more accurate measure of abundance was obtained by locating random 1 x 1 m plots and counting the number of ramets for each species in the plot. A significant negative relationship was seen between abundance and MRTS. This suggests that the most abundant plants in communities are not those that are bigger, or smaller, they are those with the smallest MRTSs. To test whether this relationship exists in other habitats, plots were located in different old-field, shrub-land and wood-land communities. Ramets for each species within the plots were counted, and the largest plant of each species was measured. Significant negative relationships between abundance and MAX plant body size were seen in the shrub-land and woodland sites; however, no relationship was detected in this old-field site. The data support the idea that smaller species have greater reproductive economy, but the mechanism remains unknown. These results suggest that a smaller plant body size results in more effective gene transmission into future generations in all habitat types and stages of succession and indicates a suggested paradigm shift in the predicted selection effects of competition on the evolution of plant body size.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-30 13:43:39.521</description>
   <description>Most of the research on students’ school engagement is based on Western society (Maslak, Kim, &amp; Mcloughlin, 2010) and most was conducted on students in tertiary institutions (Kuh et al., 2005). This study pertains to the students’ school engagement factors in a non-Western one.&#xd;
Students’ school engagement continues to be an issue that attracts special attention. In this study, I review the existing literature relating to students’ school engagement while examining whether the success of a school as a learning environment is based on students’ interest in schooling or the fact that the school environment is crucial to students’ success (Bempechat, Beth, Piergross, &amp; Wenk, 2008; Bong &amp; Mimi, 2005; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1992; Harris, 2008; Leithwood, Seashore-Louis, Anderson, &amp; Wahlstrom, 2004; Newell, 2003; Satchwell, 2004; Spillane, Halverson, &amp; Diamond, 2001). In this study, I carry out a qualitative investigation through observations and interviews, of the factors present in school that influence students’ school engagement.&#xd;
The themes emerging from the data from the school observations and the interviews of the participants were colored by the unique school context, which inordinately did affect students' interest and school participation. Their analysis reveals the interplay of factors like the approach adopted in leadership, the teachers’ approach to pedagogy, and peer socialization towards students’ engagement. In my discussion, I provide suggestions derived from this study on how school administrators, educators and policy makers alike may indeed create, enhance, influence and sustain students’ school engagement in the context such as the one in my study.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a theoretical study of the collective effects of a large number&#xd;
of photon emitters coupled to optical cavities. The ensemble effects are accounted&#xd;
for by considering both the light emitting and scattering by the photon emitters. It&#xd;
suggests that, to correctly estimate the emitters ensemble coupled cavity mode, it&#xd;
is necessary to consider the existence of the excited excitons ensemble and optical&#xd;
pumps. This thesis shows that optical pumps can excite more excitons and scattering&#xd;
channels as pumping power increases. The change in exciton population can lead to&#xd;
comprehensive spectral behaviors by changing the cavity spectral shapes, bandwidth&#xd;
and resonance positions, through the inhomogeneous broadening and frequencies repulsion&#xd;
effects of collective emissions. The existence of the exciton ensemble can also&#xd;
enhance optical coupling effects between target excitons and the cavity mode. The&#xd;
target exciton, which has a relatively large coupling strength and is close to the cavity&#xd;
peak, can affect the properties of the background dipoles and their coupling to&#xd;
the cavity. All these collective effects are sensitive to the number, the resonances&#xd;
distribution, and the optical properties of the background excitons in the frequency&#xd;
domain and the property of the target exciton, if any. This study provides a perspective on the control of the optical properties of cavities and individual excitons through collective excitation.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2012-08-12 15:11:48.409</description>
   <description>Background: Active transportation refers to methods of travel that involve physical activity, such as walking and bicycling. For students, characteristics of both individual and contextual environments are likely associated with active transportation to school. Furthermore, injury is one possible but overlooked outcome of active transportation to school.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: To examine among urban Canadian youth in grades 6-10: 1) associations between individual- and area-level factors and active transportation to school and 2) the relationship between active transportation to school and active transportation injury.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Individual-level data were obtained from the 2009/2010 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey. Active transportation to school was measured via student’s report of their usual method of travel to school. Active transportation injury was assessed via self-report for a one-year recall period. Area-level data were obtained from a school administrators’ survey and from various geographical sources. Multi-level logistic regression was used to examine the associations of interest. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Multiple correlates of active transportation to school were identified from the individual/family, school, and neighbourhood. Correlates possessing a potential for intervention and a relatively high population impact were identified: gender (female: relative risk, RR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.91, population attributable risk, PAR: 7.1%), perception of neighbourhood safety (disagree vs. strongly agree: RR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95, PAR: 2.3%), percentage of roads with sidewalks (quartile 3 vs. quartile 1: RR=1.17, 95% CI: 0.96-1.34, PAR: 9.5%), and the total length of streets (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: RR=1.23, 95% CI: 1.00-1.42, PAR: 6.9%). A positive association between active transportation to school and active transportation injury was identified; the risk for injury increased as walking or bicycling increased (short distance: OR=1.17, 95% CI: 0.92-1.50; long distance: OR=1.56, 95% CI: 1.10-2.21).&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Many factors are associated with active transportation to school. While active transportation is associated with the potential for improved health, it also likely increases the risk for active transportation injuries. Interventions to increase active transportation to school should also consider potential negative outcomes. Future studies in this research area could focus on qualitative measures of the environment and school programs, in addition to the etiology of injuries experienced during school travel.</description>

   <description>What did William Blake mean when he threatened the world with a “Bible of Hell” in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790)?  A critical survey of the history of scholarship on the topic reveals a variety of unsupported Bible of Hell canon theories among 180 critics.  The most plausible theory (though not the most popular) among them is that the Bible of Hell comprises Blake’s eight core 1790-95 Illuminated Books—The Marriage, the Continental Prophecies (1793-95), and the Urizen Books (1794-95).  My thesis supports this theory from several angles.  Part I examines how The Marriage establishes a Bible of Hell program with four inclusion criteria by which the works of 1793-95 abide: (1) a rhetoric of diabolical revision, which reclaims the Devil as a Christological redeemer and exposes Yahweh as the Antichrist;  (2) organization by contraries; (3) mock-biblical revision; and (4) illumination.  Chapters 3-6 examine these criteria in their literary-historical contexts, first by tracing the genealogy of diabolical revision in satirical diabologies and mundus inversus literature and art of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Chapters 4-5 examine aspects of biblical revision in the context of early Christian heresies, modern sects, Enlightenment biblical scholarship, speculative mythography, and biblical parodies.  Chapter 6 considers Blake’s Bible of Hell in the context of the illustrated Bible market of the 1790s.  Part II (Chs. 7-10) assesses Blake's works of 1788-95 according to these criteria, showing that the works of 1788-89 develop Bible of Hell features that culminate in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and continue in the 1793-95 mock-biblical prophecies.  Here the dissertation’s focus shifts to the conceptual evolution of the Bible of Hell in response to the failure of the French Revolution and its authoritarian backlash in England.  Whereas The Marriage prophesied apocalypse as the righting of the upside-down world by a revolutionary, antinomian Christ, its 1793-95 sequels lose faith in revolution but critique biblical monotheism as the basis of historical tyranny.  The final chapter examines conceptual tensions within the works of 1793-95 to hypothesize why Blake abandoned the Bible of Hell.</description>

   <title>Effects-Driven Fractionation of Heavy Fuel Oil to Isolate Compounds Toxic to Trout Embryos</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-31 11:31:15.238</description>
   <description>Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) is a petroleum product and emerging contaminant used as fuel by cargo ships, cruise liners, and oil tankers. As a high-frequency, low volume commodity shipped by pipeline, train, truck, and ship, it is at high risk for small-scale spills in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments. There are few reports characterizing HFOs and quantifying the contaminants therein, but previous studies have shown that the most toxic classes of compounds in petroleum products are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This project seeks to address that by analyzing HFO 7102, the specific HFO spilled in Wabamun Lake, Alberta in August 2005.&#xd;
Through an Effects-Driven Fractionation and Analysis, HFO 7102 was successively fractionated by physical and chemical means. First, a low-temperature vacuum distillation separated the oil into three fractions by volatility. The most toxic of these (lowest median toxic concentration, or LC50), F3, underwent a series of solvent extractions to remove asphaltenes and waxes. The remaining PAH-rich extract (F3-1) was further separated using open column chromatography into non-polar, mid-polar, and polar fractions with groupings approximately by number of aromatic rings. At each stage, fractions and sub-fractions were characterized by GC-MS for compositional analysis and bioassays were conducted with rainbow trout embryos. In this fashion, toxicity thresholds were developed for all fractions and the components of HFO 7102 associated with toxicity were identified and quantified.&#xd;
The F3 fraction was six times more toxic than the whole oil. While the wax fraction (F3-2) was shown to be non-toxic, the remaining PAH-rich extract (F3-1) accounted for all of the toxicity in F3. Future work may be done to determine the relative toxicity of the last fractions generated and identify a range of PAH responsible for fish toxicity. It is expected that the F3-1-2 fraction will be most toxic, as it contains nearly all of the three-ring and most of the four-ring PAH. These size classes of PAH have been associated with chronic toxicity to fish embryos in studies of crude oil. Further separations may be attempted to identify a more specific range of toxic compounds, such as by degree of alkylation.</description>

   <description>In 1997, Xian-Jin Li gave an equivalence to the classical Riemann hypothesis,&#xd;
now referred to as Li's criterion, in terms of the non-negativity of a particular&#xd;
infinite sequence of real numbers. We formulate the analogue of Li's criterion as&#xd;
an equivalence for the generalized quasi-Riemann hypothesis for functions in an&#xd;
extension of the Selberg class, and give arithmetic formulae for the corresponding&#xd;
Li coefficients in terms of parameters of the function in question. Moreover, we&#xd;
give explicit non-negative bounds for certain sums of special values of polygamma&#xd;
functions, involved in the arithmetic formulae for these Li coefficients, for a wide class of functions. Finally, we discuss an existing result on correspondences between&#xd;
zero-free regions and the non-negativity of the real parts of finitely many Li&#xd;
coefficients. This discussion involves identifying some errors in the original source work which seem to render one of its theorems conjectural. Under an appropriate&#xd;
conjecture, we give a generalization of the result in question to the case of Li coefficients corresponding to the generalized quasi-Riemann hypothesis. We also&#xd;
give a substantial discussion of research on Li's criterion since its inception, and&#xd;
some additional new supplementary results, in the first chapter.</description>

   <description>Global position system (GPS) is widely used in land vehicles but suffers deterioration in its accuracy in urban canyons; mostly due to satellite signal blockage and signal multipath. To obtain accurate, reliable, and continuous positioning solutions, GPS is usually augmented with inertial sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes to monitor both translational and rotational motions of a moving vehicle. Due to space and cost requirements, micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) inertial sensors, which are typically inexpensive are presently utilized in land vehicles for various reasons and can be used for integration with GPS for navigation purposes. Kalman filtering (KF) usually used to performs this integration. However, the complex error characteristics of these MEMS based sensors lead to divergence of the positioning solution. Furthermore, the residual GPS pseudorange correlated errors are always ignored, thus reducing the GPS overall positioning accuracy. This thesis targets enhancing the performance of integrated MEMS based INS/GPS navigation systems through exploring new non-linear modelling approaches that can deal with the non-linear and correlated parts of INS and GPS errors. The research approach in this thesis relies on reduced inertial sensor systems (RISS) incorporating single axis gyroscope, vehicle odometer, and accelerometers is considered for the integration with GPS in one of two schemes; either loosely-coupled where GPS position and velocity are used for the integration or tightly-coupled where GPS pseudorange and pseudorange rates are utilized. A new method based on parallel cascade identification (PCI) is developed in this research to enhance the performance of KF by modelling azimuth errors for the RISS/GPS loosely-coupled integration scheme. In addition, PCI is also utilized for the modelling of residual GPS pseudorange correlated errors. This thesis develops a method to augment a PCI – based model of GPS pseudorange correlated errors to a tightly-coupled KF. In order to take full advantage of the PCI based models, this thesis explores the Particle filter (PF) as a non-linear integration scheme that is capable of accommodating the arbitrary sensor characteristics, motion dynamics, and noise distributions. The performance of the proposed methods is examined through several road test experiments in land vehicles involving different types of inertial sensors and GPS receivers.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-31 15:34:01.804</description>
   <description>The objective of this work was threefold: 1) to assess how local dynamic spinal stability is affected by various factors including: the personal lift-assist device (PLAD), different loads when lifting, and prolonged repetitive work; 2) to establish the between-day reproducibility of local dynamic stability and kinematic variability measures; and 3) to directly compare local dynamic spinal stability to quasi-static mechanical spinal stability. &#xd;
The first study was an investigation into the effects of the PLAD on local dynamic spinal stability during repetitive lifting. Short- (λmax-s) and long-term (λmax-l) maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were calculated from measured trunk kinematics to assess stability. PLAD use did not change λmax-s, but significantly reduced λmax-l; indicating increased local dynamic spinal stability when lifting with the device. &#xd;
The second study was a report on the effects of lifting two different loads (0% and 10% maximum back strength) on local dynamic spinal stability and kinematic variability, expressed as the mean standard deviation (MeanSD) across cycles. It was determined that increasing the load that was lifted significantly reduced λmax-s, but not λmax-l or MeanSD. Thus, as muscular and moment demands increased with load so did subjects’ spinal stability. &#xd;
The third study was designed to look at changes in local dynamic spinal stability and kinematic variability resulting from 1.5 hours of repetitive automotive manufacturing work, as well as the between-day reproducibility of the measures. Operators performed a repetitive dynamic trunk flexion task immediately pre- and post-shift, as well as at the same pre-shift time on the following day. Despite significant increases in back pain scores, operators were able to maintain their stability and variability post-shift. Moreover, λmax-s was the most reproducible measure.&#xd;
The final study was structured to directly compare lumbar spine rotational stiffness (quasi-static mechanical spinal stability), calculated with an EMG-driven biomechanical model, to local dynamic spine stability, during a series of dynamic lifting challenges. Results suggest that spine rotational stiffness and local dynamic stability are positively associated, as they provided similar information when lifting rate was controlled. However, both models provide unique information and future research is required to fully understand their relationship. &#xd;
In general, the results of these studies illustrate the potential for Lyapunov analyses of kinematic data to be used to assess local dynamic spinal stability in a variety of situations.</description>

   <description>I argue that the procession is a deliberate, desirable, and destabilizing social formation. In scholarship of the American nineteenth century, the procession is lost among the clutter of other urban assemblies—crowds, parades, riots—and never fully articulated as a unique vehicle for collective expression. The procession is an attractive alternative to tyrannical majorities and unwise crowds because of its linearity, rationality, and encompassment. Central to the trope of the procession, however, is the wayside or the periphery, adjacent spaces which are often discarded or suppressed by the procession’s forward movement. I trace the variations of this American allegory—national progress and its exclusions—across different genres in the writing of Nathaniel Hawthorne (domestic-cosmic sketches), Walt Whitman (war-time poetic fantasies), Emily Dickinson (regal satires), and as an informing but repudiated element of Martin Delany’s novel Blake; or The Huts of America. These authors critique chaotic and gaudy groups, and instead propose gentle and haptic ones. Whitman, Dickinson, and Delany also have in common their oblique contemplations of the Civil War and President Lincoln’s assassination. Although Lincoln’s multi-state funeral procession is an overwrought spectacle, the procession is so often virtuous because it is the opposite of the state funeral: the authors I consider presuppose, in their sporadic ways, an austere nature to the procession, as fundamental as the dictums “We, the people” or E pluribus unum. Yet, the “grand difficulty,” in Hawthorne’s words, is that in reality and on the streets, the procession’s conceptual intuitiveness—as all-inclusive and leveling as a “procession of life”—recedes from view, deteriorates into chaos, and must be constantly rehabilitated. My tropological analysis of American literature grapples with a vision of democratic organization and process that is not conceived of as the result of collective self-articulation and -determination. What is startling about membership in a procession is how often it does not respect individual choice. It is coercive; you are participating. The procession’s “measured and beautiful motion,” in Whitman’s words, topples assertive modes of authorship, leadership, and ownership because ever-present waysides flatten the hierarchy of center over periphery.</description>

   <description>Software systems continue to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives, making the quality of software systems an extremely important issue. Therefore, a significant amount of recent research focused on the prioritization of software quality assurance efforts. One line of work that has been receiving an increasing amount of attention is Software Defect Prediction (SDP), where predictions are made to determine where future defects might appear. Our survey showed that in the past decade, more than 100 papers were published on SDP. Nevertheless, the adoption of SDP in practice to date is limited. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we survey the state-of-the-art in SDP in order to identify the challenges that hinder the adoption of SDP in practice. These challenges include the fact that the majority of SDP research rarely considers the impact of defects when performing their predictions, seldom provides guidance on how to use the SDP results, and is too reactive and defect-centric in nature.&#xd;
&#xd;
We propose approaches that tackle these challenges. First, we present approaches that predict high-impact defects. Our approaches illustrate how SDP research can be tailored to consider the impact of defects when making their predictions. Second, we present approaches that simplify SDP models so they can be easily understood and illustrates how these simple models can be used to assist practitioners in prioritizing the creation of unit tests in large software systems. These approaches illustrate how SDP research can provide guidance to practitioners using SDP.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Then, we argue that organizations are interested in proactive risk management, which covers more than just defects. For example, risky changes may not introduce defects but they could delay the release of projects. Therefore, we present an approach that predicts risky changes, illustrating how SDP can be more encompassing (i.e., by predicting risk, not only defects) and proactive (i.e., by predicting changes before they are incorporated into the code base). &#xd;
&#xd;
The presented approaches are empirically validated using data from several large open source and commercial software systems. The presented research highlights how challenges of pragmatic SDP can be tackled, making SDP research more beneficial and applicable in practice.</description>

   <description>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s Canada Reads program, based on the popular television show Survivor, welcomes five Canadian personalities to defend one Canadian book, per year, that they believe all Canadians should read. The program signifies a common discourse in Canada as a nation-state regarding its own lack of coherent and fixed identity, and can be understood as a nationalist project. I am working with Canada Reads as an existing archive, utilizing materials as both individual and interconnected entities in a larger and ongoing process of cultural production – and it is important to note that it is impossible to separate cultural production from cultural consumption. Each year offers a different set of insights that can be consumed in their own right, which is why this project is written in the present tense. Focusing on the first ten years of the Canada Reads competition, I argue that Canada Reads plays a specific and calculated role in the CBC’s goal of nation-building: one that obfuscates repressive national histories and legacies and instead promotes the transformative powers of literacy as that which can conquer historical and contemporary inequalities of all types. This research lays bare the imagined and idealized ‘communities’ of Canada Reads audiences that the CBC wishes to reflect in its programming, and complicates this construction as one that abdicates contemporary responsibilities of settlers.</description>

   <description>In Marked Men: Sport and Masculinity in Victorian Popular Culture, 1866-1904 I examine the representation of the figure of the Victorian sportsman in different areas of nineteenth-century popular culture – newspapers, spectacular melodrama, and series detective fiction – and how these depictions register diverse incarnations of this figure, demonstrating a discomfort with, and anxiety about, the way in which the sporting experience after the Industrial Revolution influenced gender ideology, specifically that related to ideas of manliness. Far from simply celebrating the modern experience of sport as one that works to produce manly men, coverage in the Victorian press of sporting events such as the 1869 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, spectacular melodramas by Dion Boucicault, and series detective fiction by Arthur Conan Doyle and Arthur Morrison, all recognize that the relationship between men and modern sport is a complex, if fraught one; it produces men who are “marked” in a variety of ways by their sporting experience. This recognition is at the heart of our own understandings of this relationship in the twenty-first century.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2012-08-01 17:50:00.185</description>
   <description>Background: Palliative gemcitabine has been shown to prevent the deterioration of well-being and to prolong survival of patients with pancreatic cancer in phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It is unknown whether the efficacy reported in RCTs has translated into effectiveness in routine clinical practice.&#xd;
Objectives: 1) To describe the characteristics of patients with pancreatic cancer treated with palliative gemcitabine at the regional cancer centres (RCCs) of Ontario, 2) To describe: clinical benefit at two months, defined as stable or improved well-being; time to treatment discontinuation; and overall survival, 3) To identify factors associated with clinical benefit, and 4) To compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with its reported efficacy in RCTs.&#xd;
Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. The study included patients with pancreatic cancer treated with palliative gemcitabine at the RCCs of Ontario between 2008 and 2011. Information about well-being was patient self-reported as captured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) at the RCCs. The proportions of patients that achieved clinical benefit were reported. Time to treatment discontinuation and overall survival were calculated using Kaplan –Meier survival analysis. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with clinical benefit.&#xd;
iii&#xd;
Results: The study population included 423 patients. Only 168 (39.1%) patients completed a pre-treatment ESAS. Patients completing a pre-treatment ESAS were not different than those that did not. Patients treated at RCCs were not different than those in RCTs. The median age of the study population was 65 years, 50% were male, 57% had stage IV disease and 94% had adenocarcinoma morphology. Thirty-seven percent of patients achieved clinical benefit at two months. Median time to treatment discontinuation and overall survival was 2 and 5.7 months, respectively. Stage and pre-treatment wellbeing were associated with clinical benefit at two months. Similar proportions of patients at RCCs and RCTs experienced clinical benefit. Time to treatment discontinuation and survival were similar as well.&#xd;
Conclusions: Efficacy of gemcitabine in RCTs has translated into effectiveness for patients treated at the RCCs of Ontario. It is unknown if this is true for patients not treated at the RCCs.</description>

   <title>Understanding attachment anxiety and paradoxical reactions to conflict with romantic partners: The moderating role of attachment-related threat</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2012-08-06 10:39:27.373</description>
   <description>Prior research has shown that attachment anxiety is related to two contradictory conflict styles: submission and dominance. In a series of three studies, I clarified this research by introducing the role of attachment-related threat in moderating submissive versus dominant tendencies of highly anxious individuals in conflict with romantic partners. I propose that rejection-related threats activate the attachment system which motivates anxious individuals to engage in submission to restore psychological proximity to their partners. Alternatively, when threat levels are low, I propose that anxious individuals exhibit dominance towards their partners in attempt to seek validation. In Study One, I replicated and extended previous research by demonstrating the relationship between attachment anxiety and the submissive conflict style. The relationship between attachment anxiety and the dominant conflict style was moderated by gender such that this relationship was stronger for women than men. In Study Two, women read a vignette outlining a hypothetical scenario where their preferences and goals conflicted with those of their partner. This vignette contained a rejection component whereby their partner responded in either a rejecting or reassuring manner. Women high in anxiety reported being somewhat more likely to defer to the wishes of a rejecting versus non-rejecting romantic partner, relative to those low in attachment anxiety. Study Three was a daily diary study, examining the relationship between attachment anxiety and the nature of real life conflicts with romantic partners over 10 days. Individuals high in attachment anxiety reported lower quality interactions and more conflicts with their partners relative to low anxiety individuals. When engaged in conflict, anxious individuals expressed greater levels of hostility towards their partners, and left their conflicts less resolved relative to low anxiety individuals. Further, partner anger moderated the relationship between attachment anxiety and submissive versus dominant tendencies. Individuals high in attachment anxiety and low in avoidance were somewhat more likely to submit to their partners when their partners expressed high levels of partner anger. On the other hand, when their partners displayed low levels of anger, individuals high in attachment anxiety reported doing somewhat more of the arguing relative to low anxiety individuals. Future directions and clinical implications are discussed.</description>

   <description>Children's difficulties with regulating or controlling emotion are associated with externalizing problems (Eisenberg et al., 2001). Emotion regulation develops through interactions with caregivers during childhood, where children are socialized about the management and expression of emotions (Kopp, 1989). The parent-child relationship is thus one factor associated with children's externalizing problems and, to date, research on children’s externalizing problems has focused on relationships with parental emotion socialization and parent-child emotions (Granic &amp; Lamey, 2002; Lengua, 2006). However, parent-child co-regulation— the bidirectional process whereby individuals mutually regulate emotions with others (Fogel, 1993)— is also likely a proximal factor in children's externalizing problems. Over time, dyadic patterns emerge and are reinforced through co-regulation, and children develop regulated or dysregulated emotional patterns with their parents (Granic &amp; Lamey, 2002). Co-regulation is also likely related to differences in externalizing symptomatologies, as dyads with children with co-occurring externalizing and internalizing problems (MIXED) show more mutual hostility over the course of a conflict than dyads with purely externalizing children (EXT; Granic &amp; Lamey, 2002). &#xd;
	The current study examined co-regulation in 255 parent-child dyads, of which 80 had EXT children (73% male), 111 had MIXED children (87% male), and 64 had typically-developing children (63% male). Children were between the ages of 8 and 12 (M = 9.56). Behaviours during positive and conflict discussions were coded with a new observational tool, the Co-Regulation of Emotion (CORE) coding system. CORE's validity was supported with associations with independent raters’ impressions of the interactions. Generally, co-regulation was higher during the conflict as compared to the positive discussions, as expected. Contrary to hypotheses, dyads with EXT and MIXED children did not show more non-supportive co-regulation than dyads with typically-developing children, and dyads with typically-developing children did not show more supportive co-regulation. Similarly, group differences on the association between interaction partners' supportive and non-supportive co-regulation and negative affect were not significant. Overall, MIXED dyads did not show more non-supportive co-regulation than EXT dyads, as had been expected. The findings did not support the hypothesis that emotion co-regulation differentiates dyads with externalizing children from dyads with typically-developing children in middle childhood.</description>

   <description>One of the pressing concerns in Dark Matter detection experiments is ensuring that the potential signal from exceedingly rare Dark Matter interactions is not obscured by background from interactions with more common particles. This work focuses on the ways in which alpha particles from primordial isotopes in the DEAP detector components can cause background events in the region of interest for Dark Matter search, based on both Monte Carlo simulations and data from the DEAP-1 prototype detector.&#xd;
The DEAP experiment uses liquid argon as a target for Dark Matter interactions and relies on the organic electroluminescent dye tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) to shift the UV argon scintillation light to the visible range. The light yield and pulse shape of alpha particle induced scintillation of TPB, which is an essential input parameter for the simulations, was experimentally determined.&#xd;
An initial mismatch between simulated and measured background spectra could be explained by a model of geometric background events, which was experimentally confirmed and informed the design of certain parts of the DEAP-3600 detector that is under construction at the moment. Modification of the DEAP-1 detector geometry based on this model led to improved background rates. The remaining background was well described by the simulated spectra, and competitive limits on the contamination of acrylic with primordial isotopes were obtained. Purity requirements for the DEAP-3600 detector components were based on this work.&#xd;
The design and testing of a novel large area TPB deposition source, which will be used to make TPB coatings for the DEAP-3600 detector, is described.</description>

   <description>The powerful influence of group membership and similarity on perceptions and behaviour is well established; however, questions remain about the developmental trajectory of these patterns and the extent to which similarity bias and ingroup bias are truly distinct. In this thesis, I examined the relative impact of group membership and similarity on matching and non-matching identification, expression of similarity, extension of preferences, transgression attribution, selective helping and resource allocation among 2.5- to 3-year-old children. These findings suggest that early in life, the responses to similarity and group membership are largely overlapping; however, children in the similarity condition were more likely to select the matching puppet in transgression attribution, non-matching identification, and resource allocation. This pattern suggests that children display a stronger approach bias in the similarity condition and that similarity bias shows developmental discontinuity between early and later childhood.</description>

   <description>As interpersonal conflict constitute an integral part of a child’s social experience, individuals with LD require help in resolving interpersonal conflict in an appropriate and socially acceptable manner. Although practitioners have struggled with the best way to alleviate these problems, social skill interventions are considered to be an evidence based-method that offers hope in supporting students’ social progression.&#xd;
 Students with learning disabilities do not learn through observation of their peers or implicit teaching. Instead, these skills must be taught directly, extensively, and explicitly. This project is organized into three chapters. Following the introductory chapter, a chapter that reviews research studies that examine social skills in students with learning disabilities is included. Particular themes found within the articles, such as interpersonal conflict, social perception, and social interventions that relate to specific social skill deficits and LD are explored. In the third chapter, I present a curriculum unit. The curriculum unit is designed to meet three goals: to have the student: (1) manage and appreciate the components that make up the context of interpersonal conflict; (2) devise alternative solutions to resolve a conflict; and (3) appreciate the consequences of the solutions they propose.  After this unit has been completed, the primary students will be able to independently use their learning to identify and respond to interpersonal conflict with a variety of strategies.  There are ten activities in this module, all designed to increase student competence in resolving interpersonal conflict in an inclusive setting.</description>

   <title>Essays on Managerial Behaviour, Corporate Governance and Information Risk</title>

   <description>This three-essay dissertation first examines the impact of tax enforcement on the incidence of stock option backdating. Consistent with the theoretical prediction that tax authority enforcement can operate as a valuable monitoring tool by narrowing the scope for managerial entrenchment, we find robust evidence that the incidence of stock option backdating is lower when firms are more likely to be subject to IRS audits. Our results reinforce calls in the public policy discourse for institutions that protect investors by curtailing companies’ “degrees of freedom” to engage in corporate misbehaviour. The second essay examines how the market reacts to announcements of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) by well performing acquirers and evaluates the results in light of three hypotheses: 1) managerial ability, 2) empire building, and 3) chief executive officer (CEO) overconfidence. Our results indicate that an empire building motive drives the relationship between past superior operating performance and M&amp;A announcements. Long-term operating performance drops significantly for acquiring firms with past superior operating performance. Our evidence also indicates that the presence of insider directors helps to alleviate the negative perception of acquisitions made by firms with better operating performance or empire building CEOs. The final essay investigates the controversial issue of whether information asymmetry affects the cost of equity capital. We re-examine this unanswered question using a unique and simple measure of information risk rooted in the growing literature on geographic proximity. Relying on their distance from financial centers to gauge when firms are better known, we provide robust evidence that information risk shapes equity pricing.  In particular, we find that firms located in remote areas exhibit a higher cost of equity capital.</description>

   <description>Uranium deposits associated with Paleoproterozoic successor basins were investigated using structural, petrographic, geochronological and geochemical relationships to understand the character and timing of ore-forming fluids and the structural control on uranium mineralization. The work focused on two successor basins that share similar geological characteristics: the Martin Lake Basin in the Beaverlodge area in Canada, and the El Sherana Basin in the South Alligator River area in Australia.&#xd;
The Beaverlodge area records six temporally distinct stages of U mineralization spatially associated with the Martin Lake successor basin. Early minor stages are hosted in cataclasite and veins at ca. 2.29 Ga and in albitized granite in the Gunnar deposit between ca. 2.3 Ga and 1.9 Ga, which predates the main stage of U mineralization of hydrothermal breccias that formed at ca. 1.85 Ga. Later stages of mineralization are related to minor veins at ca. 1.82 Ga linked to alkaline mafic dikes associated with the Martin Lake Basin and to minor veins at ca. 1.62 Ga corresponding to the timing of unconformity-type U mineralization in the overlying Athabasca Basin. The main breccia-type U mineralizing event that affected all deposits in the Beaverlodge area formed at ca. 1.85 Ma from metamorphic fluids at ca. 330oC linked to metasomatism during regional metamorphism of the Trans-Hudson Orogen. The ore-forming fluids were likely derived from metamorphic remobilization of pre-existing U-rich basement rocks, and ascended upward along deep fracture systems that resulted from brittle reactivation of early ductile shear zones.&#xd;
The main event of U mineralization in the South Alligator River area formed at ca. 1.82 Ma, subsequent to deposition of the El Sherana Group at 1.84-1.83 Ma. The formation of these deposits is related to fluids derived from diagenetic processes in sandstone of the El Sherana Group. Mineralization formed when a 250oC, low latitude, oxidizing, U-bearing basinal brine from diagenetic aquifers in the Coronation sandstone descended downward into the unconformity along fracture systems created by brittle reactivation of the El Sherana-Palette fault system.&#xd;
Uranium deposits associated with successor basins in the Beaverlodge and South Alligator River area are older than those in the U-rich Athabasca and Kombolgie basins. Rocks that host these deposits have been folded, and then exhumed during subsequent tectonic events. These older U deposits can be considered as a potential source for detrital uraninite that fed sediments of the Athabasca and Kombolgie basins and therefore contributed to the inventory of uranium that formed unconformity-related U mineralization in the younger basins. Therefore, the occurrence of older U mineralization associated with successor basins can be considered as positive criterion for exploration of unconformity-related U mineralization in younger Paleoproterozoic basins.</description>

   <description>Transitive inference refers to the ability to use knowledge of pre-existing relationships to infer relationships between entities that have not been directly compared. This form of logical inference is an important skill for many social species, and has been thought to arise in an immature form in humans between the ages of four and six years. The experimental methods used to test this ability in humans often require some verbal skill, gross or fine motor coordination, a memory capable of containing numerous relationships, and often a great deal of time and repetition in testing. These methods of testing may have been too demanding on other physical and cognitive abilities to be successfully completed by children under four years of age, regardless of their ability to make transitive inferences.&#xd;
The present study used methods sensitive to infant cognition to test the current theory that the ability to make transitive inferences does not develop until the age of four. Nine-month-old infants were tested in three separate experiments using a visual habituation paradigm similar to that used by Woodward (1998) and through investigation of infants’ own imitative actions. Experiment 1 verified that infants can track the goals of others in a habituation paradigm when the goal object changes position throughout habituation trials, both through looking time measures and imitative action. Experiment 2 used an extension of this paradigm to examine the ability to make transitive inferences across a three item chain, serially ordered by the actor’s object preference, and no evidence of transitive inference was observed. Experiment 3 tested infants’ ability to habituate to and recall multiple goals using context as a cue to actor choice. Infants were able to consistently track only one of the pairings, suggesting that avoidance, in addition to selection, may play a role in infant performance in the visual habituation paradigm.</description>

   <description>The Canadian province of Nova Scotia has an abundance of lakes impacted by multiple stressors, including acidification, lakewater calcium (Ca) decline, climate change, and fish introductions. In spite of this, little is known about long-term trends in aquatic biota, especially microfaunal communities that are useful indicators of lake trophy. This thesis helps address this knowledge gap by providing information on the ecological distribution and long-term dynamics of Cladocera in softwater lakes in Nova Scotia using their subfossil remains preserved in lake sediments.  Based on a surface sediment survey of 49 lakes, Cladocera in Nova Scotia are mainly structured along gradients of maximum lake depth and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Daphnia (generally considered sensitive to low pH and [Ca]) were common in the Cape Breton Highlands National Park, but were rare in southwestern Nova Scotia in both modern and pre-industrial sediments, although some lakes exhibited declines in Daphnia since pre-industrial times. The most notable example of this is Lake George (Kings County), where a striking decline in Daphnia, likely a result of declining [Ca], resulted in a marked increase in estimates of past algal production. In Kejimkujik National Park, which has experienced declines in pH and [Ca] since pre-industrial times, significant reductions in chydorid relative abundances were observed, as well as significant increases in the jelly-clad planktonic cladoceran species Holopedium. Cladoceran assemblages in lakes near Yarmouth have also changed significantly since pre-industrial times, but showed no consistent regional trends in the direction of cladoceran species shifts, reflecting the influence of local anthropogenic stressors. An extreme example of this is Trefry Lake, which was treated with copper sulphate in 1938 to remove the native fish community and provide better stocking conditions for brook trout. Copper sulphate treatment resulted in significant and permanent changes to the aquatic food web inferred from a strong decline in the body size of Bosmina.  Collectively, these results suggest that many aquatic ecosystems in Nova Scotia are in a state of flux as a result of multiple anthropogenic stressors, and Cladocera subfossils can be effective for inferring the food web implications of these stressors.</description>

   <description>The classroom is a space in which students can participate in both academic and social experiences. Perceptions of school held by students with learning disabilities (LD) may be different than those held by their peers. Researchers suggest that students with LD may experience a sense of being different and isolated from their peers because of their learning differences (Alexander-Passe, 2008; Lackaye &amp; Margalit, 2006). Defining LD is a complex and contested process.  However, the lack of a universal definition can contribute to misconceptions about LD. Moreover, this lack of a universal definition makes it challenging for teachers, both new and experienced, to fully understand how to work with students who have LD.     Students who have been identified as having a learning disability are sometimes removed from their regular classroom for designated periods of time every day and are placed in a special education setting such as a resource room where they receive explicit instruction to help develop their reading and decoding abilities (Nugent, 2008). Thus, this location difference adds to the differences in educational experiences students with LD can encounter. &#xd;
This qualitative research describes the perceptions of three young adults (aged 18–21) with learning disabilities (YALD) about their educational experiences in elementary and secondary school. Data were collected through two face-to-face in-depth semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis of the data was conducted. &#xd;
The findings are reported both individually to allow unique stories to emerge and collectively to highlight similar themes discussed by all three participants. Furthermore, the analysis identified academic, social, and interconnection of academic and social experiences from the participants’ discussions. The participants did not think that they were disabled in learning; rather they understood it as they simply learned differently than their non-LD peers. The lack of understanding about LD from teachers and peers, especially in elementary school, was a predominant theme that emerged.

   <description>Two experiments examined the influence of affective vocal qualities on attitude change according to the degree of congruency between vocal qualities and the message content (i.e., the extent to which the vocal qualities matched the intent of the message content). In Experiment 1, the design was a 2 (attitude formation: affective base vs. cognitive base) x 4 (persuasive message: fully matched vs. partially matched vs. fully mismatched vs. written passage) between participants factorial. In the initial phase, an attitude was created towards a novel object. This goal was accomplished by directing each participant to read either an emotionally evocative passage or an informational passage designed to produce favorable attitudes towards a fictitious animal called a lemphur (Crites, Fabrigar, &amp; Petty, 1994). In the persuasion phase of Experiment 1, participants were exposed to a negative affective message designed to elicit fear. The results indicated the degree of attitude change produced by the fully matched vocal quality (i.e., a fearful voice) was no different relative to the written passage. However, both the partially matched (i.e., a bored voice) and fully mismatched vocal qualities (i.e., a content voice) generated significantly more attitude change than both the written passage as well as fear. In Experiment 2, the attitude formation phase was similar to that of Experiment 1. However, in the persuasion phase of Experiment 2, the focus was on messages that were cognitive in their content. Specifically, participants were exposed to a negative cognitive message designed to convey negative characteristics of the target. The data revealed the degree of attitude change generated by the fully mismatched vocal quality (i.e., an excited voice) was significantly greater than the written passage as well as both the partially matched (i.e., a fearful voice), and fully matched (i.e., an emotionless voice) vocal qualities. No further differences between vocal qualities were found.</description>

   <title>The Effect of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 on the Expression of the Coinhibitory Ligands B7-H3 and B7-H1 in Cancer: Relevance to Cancer Immune Escape</title>

   <description>The interactions between tumour cells and cells of the immune system are important in the natural evolution of cancer, and the acquired immune system plays an integral role in cancer immune escape. B7-H3 and B7-H1 ligands provide coinhibitory signals to T cells resulting in T cell anergy or apoptosis and their expression has been shown to increase in cancer cells. Tumour hypoxia (oxygen concentration below physiological level) is a major contributor to the spread of cancer and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. We proposed that hypoxia results in the upregulation of the B7 molecules B7-H3 and B7-H1. Furthermore, studies in our laboratory have shown that acquisition of malignant properties in tumour cells exposed to hypoxia can be inhibited by low concentrations of nitric oxide mimetic agents such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Using cultured breast and prostate cancer cells, we investigated whether the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α, would mediate an upregulation of these ligands. Using a mouse model, we investigated the effect of GTN on tumour growth in vivo. For the in vitro studies, we exposed MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells and DU-145 prostate cancer cells to standard culture conditions, hypoxic conditions, or 100 μM CoCl2 (stabilizes HIF-1α) for 24 hours. Our findings indicate that B7-H3 mRNA was upregulated in hypoxia (P = 0.0101). Contrary to our hypothesis, B7-H3 protein was not upregulated in hypoxia. Interestingly, increased B7-H1 protein expression correlated with increased HIF-1α expression (r2=0.48, P&lt;0.0001), and HIF-1α bound to the hypoxia response element (HRE) of B7-H1. These results indicate a role for HIF-1α in the upregulation of B7-H1 levels in MDA-MB-231 cells.  While in vitro studies indicated no effect of GTN, a study using female BALB/c mice injected with 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells resulted in a decrease in tumour volume in the GTN treated mice. Together, these results indicate a novel role for HIF-1α in the up-regulation of B7-H1 on cancer cells, thus potentially contributing to immune escape of cancer cells and additionally, a role for GTN as a possible breast cancer therapy.</description>

   <title>Characterization of Mobile Phase Flow Inhomogeneity in Micro-structured Fibres: Towards the Development of Multi-channel Supports for Open Tubular Liquid Chromatography</title>

   <description>Despite the prominent role played by open tubular columns in gas chromatography, they have enjoyed comparatively little success as supports for open tubular liquid chromatography (OTLC), owing to impractical channel diameters (3-5 μm) required to facilitate retention in the liquid phase. In an effort to circumvent the technical issues associated with such narrow diameters, columns with multiple parallel channels have been suggested as alternatives – to this end, micro-structured fibres (MSFs) have been proposed as supports for OTLC. Much research has been conducted using MSFs for chromatography in the Oleschuk group, and although some success has been achieved, performance has been continuously hindered by flow velocity variation among the channels stemming from differences in channel sizes (or channel variance) as well as differences in stationary phase coverage, which serve to degrade column efficiency. Recent efforts have focused on devising a novel method for assessing the channel variance of MSFs. This method seeks to determine hole tolerance through evaluation of the extent of band broadening that occurs when performing chromatography in the absence of a retentive mechanism. Using this method, a linear correlation between the relative standard deviation of the channel diameters and the amount of broadening was revealed. To supplement the results, computational fluid dynamics was employed to simulate fluid flow through multi-channel columns. The results of these simulations again provided a linear correlation between the RSD of the channel diameters and the extent of flow velocity variation among the channels.</description>

   <description>Preservice teachers bring to their studies a host of beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics. These mathematical beliefs have been shown to influence teachers’ instructional practices. Research that examines the alignment of beliefs about the nature of mathematics and beliefs about effective instructional practices have left many unanswered questions including, do beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics held by preservice primary-junior mathematics teachers align with beliefs concerning effective mathematics instruction at the beginning of teacher education programs? In this study, the beliefs Ontario preservice primary-junior (grades JK-6) teachers bring to their teacher preparation programs were examined and the alignment of beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics and the teaching and learning of mathematics was explored. Specifically, I investigated the beliefs of preservice teachers who displayed contradictory views on the nature of mathematics and effective instructional practice; preservice teachers who held absolutist beliefs about mathematics but intended to teach using a constructivist approach. A questionnaire was used to identify participants with misaligned beliefs, and interviews, with a focus on manipulative use, were used to further explore the nature of the misalignment. Preservice teachers were found to hold primarily absolutist beliefs about the source, stability and structure of mathematical knowledge and intended to use many constructivist tools and techniques in their teaching of mathematics. Further exploration of how and why these constructivist teaching tools and techniques were intended to be used revealed a more traditional mathematics teaching approach. The findings of this study therefore suggest that preservice teachers’ beliefs at the beginning of their teacher education program were primarily absolutist and traditional in nature and therefore were aligned. The misalignment of beliefs detected by the questionnaire could more appropriately be labelled an apparent misalignment.</description>

   <description>There is a societal need for design education to prepare holistic engineers with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to innovate and compete globally. Design skills are paramount to the espoused values of higher education, as institutions of higher learning strive to develop in students the cognitive abilities of critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity.  To meet these interests from industry and academia, it is important to advance the teaching and learning of engineering design. &#xd;
This research aims to understand how engineering students learn and think about design, as a way for engineering educators to optimize instructional practice and curriculum development.  &#xd;
Qualitative research methodology was used to investigate the meaning that engineering students’ ascribe to engineering design.  The recruitment of participants and corresponding collection of data occurred in two phases using two different data collection techniques.  The first phase involved the distribution of a one-time online questionnaire to all first year, third year, and fourth year undergraduate engineering students at three Canadian Universities.  After the questionnaire, students were asked if they would be willing to participate in the second phase of data collection consisting of a personal interview.  A total of ten students participated in interviews.  Qualitative data analysis procedures were conducted on students’ responses from the questionnaire and interviews.  The data analysis process consisted of two phases: a descriptive phase to code and categorize the data, followed by an interpretative phase to generate further meaning and relationships.      &#xd;
The research findings present a conceptual understanding of students’ descriptions about engineering design, structured within two educational orientations: a learning studies orientation and a curriculum studies orientation.  The learning studies orientation captured three themes of students’ understanding of engineering design: awareness, relevance, and transfer.  With this framework of student learning, engineering educators can enhance learning experiences by engaging all three levels of students’ understanding.  The curriculum studies orientation applied the three holistic elements of curriculum—subject matter, society, and the individual—to conceptualize design considerations for engineering curriculum and teaching practice.  &#xd;
This research supports the characterization of students’ learning experiences to help educators and students optimize their teaching and learning of design education.</description>

   <description>The thesis suggests the toy-like mask of a white man, ‘Hello, Mr. Gaijin,’ as a site of analysis where the culture of racisms is (re)produced in the specific context of contemporary Japan. Sold as a gig gift in Japan, the mask, consisting of two stickers for blue-eyes and a prominent plastic nose, embodies the popularized image of whiteness in Japan, and presents it as a source of fascination as well as ridicule and mockery. Approaching this mask as an analytical text, I ask: How is race manifested in the Japanese culture? C. W. Mills (1997) suggests that there exists a global system that privileges whites and normalizes their beneficial racial position. This trend is certainly omnipresent in contemporary Japan, where one observes the sense of superiority being affixed to the white body in the frequent use of white models in the media (Creighton, 1997). Yet, how is this theory of white supremacy significantly complicated by the particular representations of whiteness seen in the ‘Hello, Mr. Gaijin’ mask? Through mimicry, the power of whiteness is mocked and commodified into a sleazy toy mask. Critically engaging with these primary questions, the thesis situates the analysis of the ‘Hello, Mr. Gaijin’ mask within the particular history of racialization developed in Japan where the culture of whiteness holds its unique complexity and significance in the society. Drawing largely on the idea of ‘the culture of racisms’ that Goldberg (1993) suggests, the thesis argues that the seemingly contradictory sentiment towards whiteness embodied in the mask presents the key to the holistic understanding of Japan’s particular culture of racisms. Specifically, it analyzes three levels of transformation that the mask presents in embodying the particular culture of racisms: the discursive transformation of whites into gaijin; the temporal physical transformation of the user into Mr. Gaijin; the visual and material transformation of whites into the toy-mask.</description>

   <description>Stigma is one of the key barriers to mental health services and there has been growing efforts to develop anti-stigma programs. However, little research has been done on quantifying experiences of stigma and their psychosocial impacts in the perspectives of those that suffer from mental illnesses. It is essential to develop an instrument that quantifies the extent and impact of stigma. Therefore, we conducted a study to field-test The Inventory of Stigmatizing Experiences and measure the difference in perceived stigma and its psychosocial impacts on Korean and Canadian patients with Depression and Bipolar disorders. &#xd;
&#xd;
A cross-sectional comparison study was conducted. Data collection took place at tertiary care hospitals located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada and Seoul, South Korea. In total, 214 Canadian and 51 Korean individuals with depression and bipolar disorder participated. Canadian participants reported significantly higher experience with stigma (p &lt;&lt; 0.05) and its impact (p &lt;&lt; 0.05) compared to Korean participants. Moreover, patients with bipolar disorder had significantly higher scores on both stigma experience and impact compared to patients with depression (p &lt;&lt; 0.05). However, the diagnosis status was not a significant factor in the linear regression analyses, whereas nationality remained as a strong predictor of stigma. Age of symptom onset was also a strong predictor for both stigma experience and stigma impact. Marital status was also a significant factor for stigma impact. Both subscales of the inventory (the stigma experiences scale and the stigma impact scale) were highly reliable, with reliability coefficients of 0.81 and 0.93, respectively.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In conclusion, there seems to be higher level of stigma and impact in the Canadian population compared to the Korean population. In addition, bipolar disorder patients may experience more stigma and higher impact compared to patients with depression. These differences in stigma experience and its impact in different populations (by nationality and diagnosis) suggest the need to develop more tailored anti-stigma programs. The Inventory of Stigmatizing Experiences is a highly reliable instrument.</description>

   <description>Potential new ore deposits containing significant levels of enargite, a copper arsenic sulphide mineral, are being considered for development. The processing of high arsenic copper concentrates directly in copper smelters is difficult due to environmental concerns. This thesis investigates a process using sulphation roasting as an alternative method for processing enargite concentrates; copper is recovered from the calcine by acid leaching, gold is extracted from the leach residue by conventional cyanidation and arsenic is either fixed in the calcine or precipitated from process emissions. In this research, sulphation roasting between the temperatures of 300-800oC, with varying oxygen and sulphur dioxide partial pressures, was investigated. &#xd;
Experiments indicated that high levels of copper extraction, as well as arsenic fixation, could be achieved from the produced calcines through hydrometallurgical processes. At operating temperatures between 400-550oC copper sulphate, copper arsenate, iron sulphate, hematite and iron arsenate form in the calcine, as well as some arsenic being volatilized as arsenic trioxide. At processing temperatures between 475-575oC, greater than 80% of the arsenic was retained in the calcine as copper and iron arsenates. Copper arsenate would be weak-acid soluble and fixed in an effluent treatment plant along with arsenic captured in the wet-gas scrubber bleed solution. As operating temperatures increase above 650oC copper sulphates were converted into oxysulphates, oxides and ferrites, hematite production was favoured, and arsenic was primarily volatilized. Increasing the sulphur dioxide addition in the reaction atmosphere resulted in additional sulphate formation and increased sulphate stability at higher temperatures.&#xd;
Sulphation roaster heat balances were developed for calcines produced at two temperatures, 500 and 750oC. They indicated that while high copper extraction and arsenic fixation rates could be achieved, the sulphation roasting reactions are highly exothermic and significant cooling water would need to be added. Due to these issues, it is likely that partial roasting operations would be economically favourable in greenfield operations. However, niche applications of this process in operations with existing copper SX/EW facilities in good acid markets, have the potential to be economically favourable.</description>

   <description>A study was undertaken to evaluate an automated process to invert for seismic moment tensors from seismic data recorded in mining environments. The data for this study was recorded at Nickel Rim South mine, Sudbury, Ontario.&#xd;
	&#xd;
The mine has a seismic monitoring system manufactured by ESG Solutions that performs continuous monitoring of seismicity. On average, approximately 400 seismic events are recorded each day. Currently, data are automatically processed by ESG Solution's software suite during acquisition. The automatic processors pick the P- and/or S-wave arrivals, locate the events and solve for certain source parameters, excluding the seismic moment tensor. In order to solve for the moment tensor, data must be manually processed, which is laborious and therefore seldom performed.&#xd;
&#xd;
This research evaluates an automatic seismic moment tensor inversion method and demonstrates some of the difficulties (through inversions of real and synthetic seismic data) of the inversion process. Results using the method are also compared to the inversion method currently available from ESG Solutions, which requires the manual picking of first-motion polarities for every event.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result of the extensive synthetic testing of the automatic inversion program, as well as the inversion of real seismic data, it is apparent that there are key parameters requiring greater accuracy in order to increase the reliability of the automation. These parameters include the source time function definition, source location (in turn requiring more accurate and precise knowledge of the earth media), arrival time picks and an attenuation model to account for ray-path dependent filtering of the source time function. In order to improve the automatic method three key pieces of research are needed: (1) studying various location algorithms (and the effects of increasing earth model intricacy) and automatic time picking to improve source location methods, (2) studying how the source time pulse can be accurately extracted from the seismic records, as well as the validity of various source models, and (3) studying how attenuation can be modeled more accurately to account for the filtering of the seismic waves through the earth media (in particular distortion to the source time function).</description>

   <description>Solar thermal systems have great potential to replace or reduce the dependence of conventional fossil fuel based heating technologies required for space and water heating. Specifically solar domestic hot water systems can contribute 50-75% of the annual thermal load. To date residential users have been slow to purchase and install systems, primarily due to the large monetary investment required to purchase and install a system. Recent innovations in materials design and manufacturing techniques, offer opportunities for the development of absorber plate designs that have the potential to reduce cost, increase efficiency and reduce payback periods. Consequently, this design study was conducted in conjunction with industrial partners to develop an improved absorber based on roll bond manufacturing that can be produced at reduced cost with comparable or greater thermal efficiency.</description>

   <description>A new intermolecular potential energy surface, rovibrational transition frequencies, and line strengths are computed for OCS-OCS and CO2-CS2. The potentials were made by fitting energies obtained from explicitly correlated coupled-cluster calculations and fit using an interpolating moving least squares method. Rovibrational transition frequencies are also calculated for four isotopologues of the N2O dimer using a previously presented potential energy surface. The rovibrational Schroedinger equation for all three dimers is solved with a symmetry-adapted Lanczos algorithm and an uncoupled product basis set. All four intermolecular coordinates are included&#xd;
in the calculation. &#xd;
&#xd;
On the OCS-OCS potential energy surface, a previously unknown, cross-shaped&#xd;
isomer is found along with polar and non-polar isomers. For CO2-CS2, the previously found cross-shaped minima is found along with a slipped-parallel configuration. The associated wavefunctions and energy levels for each of these isomers is presented. To identify states that have a permanent dipole, both calculations of line strengths and vibrational parent analysis is used. For non polar states of, OCS-OCS, and N2O-N2O isotopologues, and all CO2-CO2 states, only vibrational parent analysis was used. Calculated rotational constants differ from their experimental counterparts by less&#xd;
than 0.001 wavenumbers for OCS-OCS and CO2-CS2, and less than 0.002 wavenumbers for any N2O-N2O isotopologue.</description>

   <description>Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have been researched for operation on anaerobic digester (AD)-derived biogas at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). SOFCs can perform well on light hydrocarbon fuels and the use of AD-derived biogas provides an opportunity for biogas to be used as a renewable fuel.  &#xd;
Tests were conducted at three levels of H2 dilution (using N2, Ar and CO2 as diluent gases, plus H2O) to examine the performance of tubular SOFCs. When gases that are inert in SOFC reactions are used there is a decrease in cell performance. When CO2 was used the decrease in cell performance was higher due to the reverse water-gas shift (WGS) reaction reducing the partial pressure of H2. A computer simulation was developed to predict SOFC system efficiency and GHG emissions. The simulation indicated that the system electrical efficiency is higher for a S/C ratio of 2 then a S/C ratio of 1 due to the increased partial pressure of H2 in the reformate. The reduction in GHG emissions is estimated to be approximately 2,400 tonnes CO2, 60 kg CH4 and 18 kg N2O, annually. &#xd;
Testing was conducted using a simulated biogas reformate mixture that was developed through a research initiative in which urban areas with populations over 150,000 in the United States and 50,000 in Canada were solicited to participate in a survey of biogas composition. The biogas reformate composition was determined to be 66.7% H2, 16.1% CO, 16.5% CO2 and 0.7% N2, which was then humidified to 2.3 and 20 mol% H2O. The reformate tests conducted at the higher humidification level yielded a better performance than those at the lower humidification because the WGS reaction produced more H2 when additional H2O was provided. &#xd;
It was concluded that WWTP AD-derived biogas, when cleaned effectively to remove H2S, Si compounds, halides and other contaminants, could be reformed to provide a clean, renewable fuel for SOFCs. Biogas/SOFC systems could provide electricity and heat to WWTPs, as well as reduce GHG emissions, thus reducing their energy costs and environmental impact.</description>

   <description>In the widely accepted core accretion model of planet formation, small rocky and/or icy bodies (planetesimals) accrete to form protoplanetary cores. Gas giant planets are believed to have solid cores that must reach a critical mass, ∼10 Earth masses (ME), after which there is rapid inflow of gas from the gas disk. In order to accrete the gas giants’ massive atmospheres, this step must occur within the gas disk’s lifetime (1 − 10 million years).&#xd;
Numerical simulations of solid body accretion in the outer Solar System are performed using two integrators. The goal of these simulations is to investigate the effects of important dynamical processes instead of specifically recreating the formation of the Solar System’s giant planets.&#xd;
The first integrator uses the Symplectic Massive Body Algorithm (SyMBA) with a modification to allow for planetesimal fragmentation. Due to computational constraints, this code has some physical limitations, specifically that the planetesimals themselves cannot grow, so protoplanets must be seeded in the simulations. The second integrator, the Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics (LIPAD), is more computationally expensive. However, its treatment of planetesimals allows for growth of potential giant planetary cores from a disk consisting only of planetesimals. Thus, this thesis’ preliminary simulations use the first integrator to explore a wider range of parameters while the main simulations use LIPAD to further investigate some specific processes.&#xd;
These simulations are the first use of LIPAD to study giant planet formation and they identify a few important dynamical processes affecting core formation. Without any fragmentation, cores tend to grow to ∼2ME. When planetesimal fragmentation is included, the resulting fragments are easier to accrete and larger cores are formed (∼4ME). But, in half of the runs, the fragments force the entire system to migrate towards the Sun. In other half, outward migration via scattering off a large number of planetesimal helps the protoplanets grow and survive. However, in a preliminary set of simulations including protoplanetary fragmentation, very few collisions are found to result in accretion so it is difficult for any cores to form.</description>

Three months of on-going daily critical reflections on past and present experiences related to my teaching resulted in 26 written documents illuminating memories, thoughts, feelings, insights, and epiphanies.  Data collection strategies included narrative writing, dialogue with a mentor, and engagement in contemplative practices, such as Yoga, meditation, and mindfulness.  The main purpose of this study was to explore, learn, and develop a core teacher identity and teaching practice while addressing two main research questions: how am I authentic in my teaching practice; and how might engaging in self-study contribute to my authenticity as a teacher?  I used Cranton and Carusetta’s research, specifically referring to “Authenticity in Teaching” (2004a) and “Developing Authenticity as a Transformative Process” (2004b) to guide this study and analyze my findings.  Results revealed the various ways in which I practice authenticity in my teaching and that my engagement in on-going critical reflection through self-study contributed to my authenticity as a teacher.</description>

   <description>The most common and natural human behaviours are often the most computationally difficult to understand.  This is especially true of spoken language comprehension considering the acoustic ambiguities inherent in a speech stream, and that these ambiguities are exacerbated by the noisy and distracting listening conditions of everyday life.  Nonetheless, the human brain is capable of rapidly and reliably processing speech in these situations with deceptive ease – a feat that remains unrivaled by state-of-the-art speech recognition technologies.  It has long been known that supportive context facilitates robust speech perception, but it remains unclear how the brain integrates contextual information with an acoustically degraded speech signal. &#xd;
The four studies in this dissertation utilize behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods to examine how the normally functioning human brain uses context to support the perception of degraded speech.  First, I have observed that text presented simultaneously with distorted sentences results in an illusory experience of perceptually clearer speech, and that this illusion depends on the amount of distortion in the bottom-up signal, and on the relative timing between the visual and auditory stimuli.  Second, fMRI data indicate that activity in the earliest region of primary auditory cortex is sensitive to the perceived clarity of speech, and that this modulation of activity likely comes from left frontal cortical regions that probably support higher-order linguistic processes.  Third, conscious awareness of the visual stimulus appears to be necessary to increase the intelligibility of degraded speech, and thus attention might also be required for multisensory integration.  Finally, I have demonstrated that attention greatly enhances the processing of degraded speech, and this enhancement is (again) supported by the recruitment of higher-order cortical areas.&#xd;
The results of these studies provide converging evidence that brain uses prior knowledge to actively predict the form of a degraded auditory signal, and that these predictions are projected through feedback connections from higher- to lower-order order areas.  These findings are consistent with a predictive coding model of perception, which provides an elegant mechanism in which accurate interpretations of the environment are constructed from ambiguous inputs in way that is flexible and task dependent.</description>

   <description>Physical inactivity is a national issue affecting more than half of all Canadian adults (Colley et al., 2011). Health messaging, including message framing, has been a popular medium for encouraging individuals to adopt recommended health behaviours such as physical activity. Previous research has demonstrated that gain-framed messages, which emphasize the benefits of a behaviour, are more effective at promoting physical activity (PA) than loss-framed messages which emphasize the costs. However, the mechanism through which this facilitating effect occurs is unclear. The current study examined the effects of message framing on attention, attitudes, recall, decision to be active and behaviour as well as the mediating effects of these variables on the frame-behaviour relationship in accordance with the communication behaviour change (CBC) model (McGuire, 1989). Sixty moderately active women, aged 18-35 viewed 20 gain- or loss- framed ads and 5 control ads while their eye movements were recorded via eye tracking. Attitudes towards PA, message recall, decision to become active and PA behaviour during an acute bout of exercise were measured immediately following ad exposure. Self-reported PA was measured one week later. Univariate ANOVAs, ANCOVAs and logistic regressions were conducted to examine the effects of message framing on each level of the CBC model. The gain-framed ads attracted greater attention, ps&lt;0.05, produced more positive attitudes, p = .06, were better recalled, p &lt; .001, influenced decisions to be active, p = .07, and had an immediate and delayed impact on behaviour, ps &lt; .05, compared to the loss-framed messages. However, mediation analyses failed to reveal any significant effects suggesting that alternate mechanisms may be influencing framing effects on behaviour. This study demonstrates the effects of framed messages on several novel outcomes; however the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-08-23 16:22:45.395</description>
   <description>Microstructural characterization and mechanical properties of Excel (Zr-3.5%Sn-0.8%Mo-0.8%Nb), a dual phase αZr-hcp and βZr-bcc pressure tube material, is discussed in the current study which is presented in manuscript format. Chapter 3 discusses phase transformation temperatures using different techniques such as quantitative metallography, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and electrical resistivity. It was found that the αZr → αZr+βZr and αZr+βZr → βZr transformation temperatures are in the range of 600-690°C and 960-970°C respectively. Also it was observed that upon quenching from temperatures below ~860°C the martensitic transformation of βZr to –hcp is halted and instead the microstructure transforms into retained βZr with ω hexagonal precipitates inside βZr grains. Chapter 4 deals with aging response of Excel alloy. Precipitation hardening was observed in samples water-quenched from high in the αZr+βZr or βZr regions followed by aging. The optimum aging conditions were found to be 450°C for 1 hour. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed dispersion of fine precipitates (~10nm) inside the martensitic phase. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed the chemical composition of precipitates to be Zr-30wt%Mo-25wt%Nb-2wt%Fe. Electron crystallography using whole pattern symmetry of the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns together with selected area diffraction (SAD) polycrystalline ring patterns, suggests the -6m2 point group for the precipitates belonging to hexagonal crystal structure, with a= 2.936 Å and c=4.481 Å, i.e. c/a =1.526.&#xd;
Crystallographic texture and high temperature tensile properties as well as creep-rupture properties of different microstructures are discussed in Chapter 5. Texture analysis showed that solution treatment high in the αZr+βZr or βZr regions followed by water quenching or air cooling results in a more random texture compared to typical pressure tube texture. Variant selection was observed upon water quenching while partial memory effect and some transformation texture with variant selection was observed in the air-cooled sample. The results of creep-rupture tests suggest that fully martensitic and aged microstructure has better creep properties at high stress levels (>700 MPa) while the microstructure from air cooling from high in the αZr+βZr region is less sensitive to stress and shows better creep properties compared to the as-received annealed microstructure at lower stresses (&lt;560 MPa).</description>

   <description>Orthophosphate (Pi) is a limiting macronutrient in most soils and is essential for plant metabolism. Massive amounts of Pi-fertilizers are applied to agricultural fields to compensate for this limitation. However, Pi-fertilizers are made from non-renewable rock Pi-sources and their application is environmentally destructive.  Plants have evolved numerous ways to survive in Pi-deficient (-Pi) soils, including the upregulation and secretion of acid phosphatases (APases). APases catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate (Pi) from Pi-esters in an acidic environment. The major group of plant secreted APases, purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), have been hypothesized to scavenge Pi from organic-Pi (Po) sources that can compose up to 80% of the total P-content of some soils. Previous biochemical and proteomic studies indicate that AtPAP26 and AtPAP12 are the predominant secretory PAP isozymes upregulated by –Pi Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures and seedlings. This thesis examines the influence of different Po supplements on the growth, Pi content, secretory APase activity, and secreted AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 polypeptides of wildtype (Col-0) Arabidopsis seedlings. Additionally, this thesis assesses the potential role that AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 play in scavenging Pi from extracellular Po sources by utilizing a homozygous atpap12/atpap26 double knockout mutant. Loss of AtPAP26 and AtPAP12 expression resulted in a 64% decrease in root secreted APase activity of –Pi seedlings. These results corroborate previous findings implying that: (i) Arabidopsis are able to grow on a variety of extracellular Po sources as their sole source of P-nutrition, and (ii) AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 are the principal contributors to secreted APase activity of –Pi Arabidopsis. Total shoot Pi levels, and growth of atpap12/atpap26 Arabidopsis seedlings cultivated in -Pi/+Po media were significantly lower relative to Col-0 controls, but unaffected under Pi sufficient conditions. The atpap12/atpap26 seedlings were unable to grow in a –Pi/+Po soil, whereas the Col-0 seedlings were able to develop. Additionally, both PAPs were strongly upregulated on root surfaces and in shoot cell wall extracts of –Pi seedlings. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 play an important role in the hydrolysis of Pi from extracellular Po and make a large contribution to Pi-recycling and scavenging in –Pi Arabidopsis.</description>

   <description>The study presents a numerical analysis of series of unanticipated events that took place upon the excavation of a landfill in a deep deposit of clayey soil in southwestern Ontario, Canada. During the excavation of a landfill cell to be used for waste disposal, unexpected lateral slope movements were observed followed by gas and water venting in several locations (while the excavation in low permeability clayey till was about 14m above the underlying aquifer). The clayey till is known to be underlain by permeable, natural gas bearing rock, and gas has been diffusing through the clayey deposit over about the last 13,000-15,000 years.  &#xd;
   Preliminary 2D and 3D elasto-plastic effective stress analyses using conventional soil mechanics –similar to what was used in design- are used to capture the general behaviour of the excavation. However, the analyses revealed the need for model modification to account for other governing factors (gassy soil and hydrofracturing) to be able to explain the mechanism that might have lead to the evolution of gas vents and upward water flow through the thick shale aquitard. &#xd;
   The clayey deposit contains silty sand lenses at different elevations. The upward diffusion of methane and chloride from the bedrock aquifer through the clay till is modelled and the potential for chloride migration contributing to the exsolution of methane due to reduction in methane solubility is discussed. Two approaches to modelling the lenses are examined where gas exsolution either occurs prior to or during the excavation.&#xd;
   The FE model is modified to account for hydrofacturing and gassy soil behaviour (for sand lenses). 2D and 3D forensic modelling studies are presented examining the potential causes for the unanticipated movements and the gas and water venting observed during the excavation. The model investigates the role of presence of gassy sand lenses and of the presence of a discontinuous weak sandy clayey silt layer between the bedrock and the low permeability till on the hydrofracturing path and gas venting. &#xd;
   Finally, a parametric study is conducted to examine the effect of different parameters on the soil behaviour when excavated. Recommendations regarding further excavations within the same soil deposit are presented.</description>

   <description>The objective of this dissertation is to unearth the multi-scalar political geographies of regional development using an empirically intensive, single-region, case study approach focussing on Northern Ontario.  This research focuses on Northern Ontario because it provides a unique setting to understand the political strategizing and contestation of regional development.  Northern Ontario has had a long history of federal and provincial regional development initiatives from region specific policies, reports, and studies to regional development institutions.  In fact, up until recently it was the only sub-provincial region in Canada with a federally appointed regional development institution.  In Northern Ontario there is also a deep sense of territorial grievance and discontent that has generated a number of organizations and movements to mobilize regional interests in the quest for greater autonomy over decision-making and economic development.  &#xd;
The main objective of unpacking the multi-scalar political geographies of regional development in Northern Ontario translates into the following questions: 1) How and why have federal regional development initiatives in Northern Ontario changed since the 1960s? 2) How and why have provincial regional development initiatives in Northern Ontario changed since the 1960s? and 3) What are the regional responses? Answers to these questions underscore the messy and complex nature and politics of regional development.  More pointedly, this thesis clearly demonstrates that regional development is not just about finding economic solutions to regional challenges but that these initiatives are also deeply political.  &#xd;
To explore the politics of regional development, I draw on insights from Canadian political economy, new regional geography, state theory, and new regionalism literature.  By viewing regional development through these frameworks, I expose the nuanced nature of regional development so that ultimately, we may learn to adopt more effective regional policy innovations for Northern Ontario and other peripheral regions in Canada.  This research makes several important contributions.  Empirically, it provides a rich history of federal and provincial regional development initiatives in Northern Ontario since the 1960s.  Theoretically, it contributes to debates on the conceptualization of regions and regional development including the politicization of boundaries and the paradox of regional development institutions.</description>

   <description>Purpose:  A key objective feature in Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is the presence of Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs). The gold standard for documenting PLMs is through polysomnogram (PSG), an overnight sleep study in a sleep laboratory, which is expensive and often inaccessible. This work explored the ability of a portable sleep monitor (PM) to reliably record surface EMG signals, to reliably record limb movements overnight in comparison with PSG, and examined intra- and inter-rater reliability for scoring the PM recordings.&#xd;
Methods: The PM’s surface EMG channel was tested against a standard EMG amplifier by recording bilateral tibialis anterior muscle activity in five healthy participants. It was also tested for recording PLMs simultaneously with polysomnography at Kingston General Hospital with 40 participants referred for screening of sleep disorders.  PLMs were scored using standard criteria according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Scoring Manual (2007)&#xd;
Analyses: Comparison between the two methods of surface EMG recording was through counts of muscle activity bursts.  Comparison of overnight PLM counts was through t-test, Pearson’s r, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots.  Intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability between two analysts was examined by ICC.&#xd;
Results:  Examination of the PM surface EMG recordings demonstrated an exact match of muscle activity counts between the PM and standard EMG recordings. In the PSG study, mean difference between the two PLMI values was +4.8 ± 11.1, t (34) = 2.1, p = 0.04, which was statistically significant and demonstrated systematic over-reporting by the portable monitor.  The two PLMI values were strongly correlated, giving a Pearson’s r = .87, p &lt; 0.001. ICC for absolute agreement was 0.87, (95% CI, 0.76 – 0.93), p &lt; 0.001.  Bland-Altman analysis gave 95% limits of agreement between the two PLM Indices as +27.9 (95% CI +33.0 to 20.2) to – 19.3 (95%CI -10.6 to -23.4).&#xd;
Conclusions:  These data suggest there may be sufficient agreement between PLMI collected by PM and polysomnography to support the use of the PM for measuring PLMs. Further testing should address test retest reliability and examine the performance of the PM in a wider patient population.</description>

   <description>In the structural engineering community, a need exists for a non-contact two-dimensional measurement system which could provide information for field monitoring and greatly enhance the accuracy of numerical structural models. Recent advances have enabled the use of digital image correlation (DIC) to calculate the surface displacements of chosen targets in a series of digital images with a high degree of accuracy. Images are recorded during an experiment and are afterwards post-processed to find relevant information including, but not limited to, a) global displacement, b) relative displacement and c) changes in strain. &#xd;
In this research, a series of experiments were conducted to create measurement techniques for monitoring steel and reinforced concrete (RC) structures utilizing DIC. However, to ensure accurate DIC measurements, the addition of artificial texture from lightly applied spray paint on finished concrete was investigated and was determined to noticeably improve results. Furthermore, the placement of the digital camera relative to the structure being monitored was shown to control not only the desired field of view in the region of interest, but also the resulting image texture and DIC measurement accuracy. &#xd;
The DIC technique was applied to monitor and understand two important aspects of structural evaluation: a) the movement along shear planes and b) the evaluation of changes in strain due to curvature in beam elements. To monitor the change in crack width and slip, a method was created and validated on a series of artificial and reinforced concrete images for the cases of pure shear, pure flexure and combine flexure and shear. Curvature was found to impact the crack slip measurement, but its effect can be removed by using an innovative averaging technique.&#xd;
The curvature of a steel HSS and RC beams was found by using virtual DIC strain gauges and the horizontal strain profile. Results matched well with the curvature from electrical foil gauges and numerical models when the gauge length was maximized and selected so that the effects of cracking were accounted for.</description>

   <description>Purpose: This thesis focuses on the development of occupational therapy competencies to enable executive occupational performance with school-aged children and youth. Methods: Three studies were structured according to the knowledge inquiry, synthesis, and product stages of the Knowledge To Action cycle (Graham et al., 2006). A scoping review in Phase One explored how executive functioning is described in the occupational therapy literature. In Phase Two, a qualitative study was conducted to determine how occupational therapists who have worked with children and youth perceive executive functioning to be understood and addressed. Phase Three used established competency development processes to produce an occupational therapy competency model and framework for enabling executive occupational performance.&#xd;
Results: Although there is little consensus on how executive functioning is understood, literature reviewed in Phase One demonstrated its pervasive effect on performance of complex, novel, and goal-directed occupations. Emerging themes suggest that assessment requires occupational, dynamic, and performance-based approaches, with interventions rooted in metacognitive frameworks. The Phase Two qualitative study suggested that, although there are challenges to being able to “see” executive functioning, it is necessary to explicitly and systematically consider executive functioning during clinical reasoning. Learning to “see” through the executive functioning lens is a complex process. The competency framework development process utilized in Phase Three yielded the Competencies in Context Model. Responding to series of contextual challenges related to system, client, and occupational therapist factors, professional assessment, intervention,&#xd;
iii&#xd;
knowledge acquisition, and knowledge translation competencies are used to organize 16 specific occupational therapy practice competencies.&#xd;
Conclusion: Points of tension within the literature and the field have implications for occupational therapy curricula, research, practice, and professional development. Executive functioning issues have wide reaching effects on occupational performance of children and youth that have not been adequately recognized or explored in the occupational therapy literature. The competency model and framework developed through this research make a substantive contribution to the field in beginning to redress the dearth of occupational therapy-specific models, resources, and tools designed to support occupational therapists’ acquisition or implementation of the executive functioning perspective.</description>

   <description>The goal of this thesis was to use an ecological framework to examine how individual and community characteristics interact and are related to bullying and victimization. Data were collected from over 20 000 students in Grades 6 to 10, living in 436 communities as part of the 2009/2010 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Survey, from Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data, and from 2006 Canadian Census data. First, we explored the individual and community factors that contributed to the power differential in bullying in electronic and traditional contexts. Bullying and victimization were primarily related to the characteristics of individuals that affected interpersonal power dynamics, but some community factors were also associated with decreased likelihood of victimization. Second, we examined how community ethnicity characteristics affected likelihood of racial bullying and victimization in different youth according to their individual ethnicity. Individuals in the ethnic minority in a community were more likely to be racially victimized than individuals of the same ethnicity in a community in which they were the majority. The findings from both studies help to shed light on power and group dynamics and the relative importance of individual and community characteristics in bullying involvement.</description>

   <description>The Goldstrike property, located in northern Nevada within the Carlin Trend, contains one of the largest Carlin-type Au deposits in the world. The vast majority of this mineralization, formed in the Eocene, is in the form of Au-bearing, trace element-rich arsenian pyrite, either as very fine grains, overgrowths on earlier pyrite, or as reported in this study, patchy zones with high As values. Eight samples characteristic of Ore I and Ore II - ore types defined by Almeida et al. (2010) - were selected and analysed using electron microprobe, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and synchrotron !-XRF. !-XRF is a non-destructive technique for the elemental analysis of these samples with additional structural analysis capability. Although Ore I and Ore II yield similar Au values in whole rock analyses, and in the samples selected in this study, Ore II yielded much lower Au and trace element values in pyrite than Ore I. However, free gold was found in an Ore II sample, which explained their similar gold grade in whole rock.&#xd;
Two compositional trends were identified based on the ratio of Au and As in auriferous pyrite from both Ore I and Ore II: 1) those above an Au/As ratio of 0.007, characterized by elevated Ag, Au, As, Cu, Hg, Sb, and Tl that trend positively with respect to Au. The maximum value of Au ranges from 0.12 to 0.15at% (0.56 to 0.68wt%), occurring at an As concentration of 2.5 to 4.3at% (5 to 7.4wt%), and 2) those below an Au/As ratio of 0.007, characterized by As above the optimal range associated with lower Au and lower trace element concentrations. The peak in As corresponds well with the theoretical maximum amount of As that can be incorporated as a solid solution in pyrite (~6wt%) before the structure changes to a two-phase pyrite-arsenopyrite system. The less structurally stable solid solution has a more reactive surface that is more amenable to adsorption of other trace elements, including Au, especially with increased As.</description>

   <description>The Karku unconformity-type uranium deposit is located in the Proterozoic Pasha-Ladoga Basin in western Russia. The deposit is located in basinal sandstones near a reverse fault that offsets the unconformable contact with underlying graphite-bearing biotite schist basement rocks. Meteoric water-sourced diagenetic fluids altered sandstones outside mineralized zones, producing clay assemblages of interstratified illite-smectite with minor dickite and Fe-rich chlorite, and fluid isotopic compositions of d18O = 3.3‰ to 6.0‰ and dD = -55‰ to -44‰ at 130°C. Altered sandstones within zones of mineralization include a clay mineral assemblage of Fe-rich chlorite with minor illite, and fluid isotopic compositions of d18O = 6.0‰ to 12.7‰ and dD = -8‰ to -4‰ at 210°C, caused by seawater-derived fluids related to ore formation. In addition, a Mg-chlorite occurring with uraninite in the mineralized lenses was identified. Dating of Karku uraninite using U/Pb isotope systematics from LA-MC-ICP-MS, LA-HR-ICP-MS, and SIMS gave upper-intercept ages of 1467 ± 39 Ma, 1459 ± 74 Ma, and 1302 ± 150 Ma respectively. The lower-intercept age of all methods was around 300 Ma.&#xd;
A formation model for the Karku uranium deposit is proposed based on the results of this study and incorporating previously published. Early, low-temperature diagenesis resulted in cementation of distal, basin-marginal sandstones by mixed-layer illite-smectite clays, preventing later, higher-temperature diagenetic alteration in this unit. Sandstones towards the centre of the basin allowed the circulation of higher-temperature basinal fluids that later flowed along the unconformity to the graphitic schist unit. A fault intersecting this unit facilitated the mixing of basement and basinal fluids, causing uraninite to precipitate at the unconformity.</description>

   <description>The environment in which animals are maintained is a factor that has the potential to alter the physiologic phenotype. We addressed the hypothesis that the standard animal care (SAC) environment cause significant deviations in the circadian variation of heart rate (HR), body temperature (Tb) and activity (ACT) in chronically instrumented mice.   These data were used to inform the design of a subsequent study addressing the hypothesis that loss of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) function blunts the thermoregulatory, ventilatory and metabolic responses to hypoxia. Mice were implanted with intraperitoneal transmitters for chronic recording of HR, Tb and ACT. The animal environment study consisted of a 3-week protocol comprised of  SAC (wk 1) utilizing standard animal care procedures of a health check and bottle and cage changes SPA (service personnel absent; wk 2) with no SAC interventions and building malfunction (BLDMAL+SAC, wk 3).  Mean HR was elevated across the week of SAC, as well as for the light and dark cycles.  Cage change caused the most profound changes (lasting 4 h), while health check/bottle change alterations lasted approx. 30 min. TRPV1-/- and TRPV1+/+ (wild-type, WT) mice exposed acutely to hypoxia (FIO2=0.1 for 4 h) resulted in a greater hypometabolic response for the mutant compared with WT genotype, reaching a lower value for HR, Tb, ACT, V ̇CO2 (carbon dioxide production) and ventilation. We conclude that the animal care environment provides a novel environment to assess murine phenotype and must be considered in genotype/phenotype assessments. Further, TRPV1 provides a significant tonic input to the integrated thermoregulatory, metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypoxia.</description>

   <description>Vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by extensive interpersonal dysfunction. A framework that has been used to understand this impairment is theory of mind, or the ability to decode and reason about others’ mental states. Previous research has identified a mental state decoding advantage in individuals with a past history of MDD, which has been explained in terms of an enhanced social orientation in those with depression vulnerability. Although social phobia is highly comorbid with MDD, there is no research investigating theory of mind abilities in individuals with social phobia, nor has there been research examining how social anxiety may better account for the relation of depression to heightened theory of mind ability. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research investigating whether evidence of such a relation extends to the more complex task of reasoning about others’ mental states. Thus, the goals of the current investigation were to examine whether heightened ToM accuracy in those with a history of MDD is better accounted for by social phobia, and whether superior ToM skills in those with past MDD are seen across tasks that tap the domains of decoding and reasoning. Participants (N = 109) were assigned to one of four groups based on a structured diagnostic interview: (a) past MDD only (n = 36); (b) social anxiety disorder only (n = 9); (c) comorbid past MDD and social anxiety disorder (n = 23); and (d) no psychiatric history (n = 41).&#xd;
     Results show that having a history of MDD is associated with heightened mental state reasoning abilities only in the presence of current social phobia. However, theory of mind decoding was not elevated in this condition. This suggests that social phobia differentially influences the relation of past MDD and theory of mind ability for decoding and reasoning abilities. Furthermore, social phobia without a history of depression was associated with poor theory of mind decoding and reasoning. This reduced ability in individuals with social phobia may be the result of self-focused attention or avoidance of potential negative evaluation, but future research is required to specifically address these possibilities.</description>

   <description>The ability to extract meaning from text is an important skill. Yet many students struggle with effectively comprehending what they read. In comparison with research carried out with younger students, there is a lack of research in the reading comprehension of adolescents (Grades 4 – 12). The goal of this dissertation was to increase our understanding of the factors that underlie the poor reading comprehension abilities of this older group of students. This dissertation includes two studies drawn from a sample of 137 age 15 year old high school students. Study One utilized archival data from government mandated tests of reading achievement of 78 students administered in Grades 3, 6, and 10, and results from a commercially available test of reading comprehension administered in Grade 10. This longitudinal study examined the prevalence of the stability, cumulative growth, and compensatory models in reading comprehension development. Probabilities of later-grade reading achievement categorization conditioned on earlier-grade reading achievement were computed, the prevalence of developmental paths was estimated, and tests of regression to the mean were conducted. Overall findings suggest considerable stability across time. &#xd;
Study Two examined the specificity of the comprehension weaknesses of 15 year old readers whose comprehension skills are below those expected from their skill in word reading and nonverbal ability (unexpected poor comprehenders). Regression analyses identified unexpected poor comprehenders, and two contrast groups (expected average and unexpected good comprehenders). Characteristics of unexpected poor comprehenders are examined after controlling for word-reading accuracy, phonological decoding, reading rate, nonverbal ability, and vocabulary. Findings indicate a critical disadvantage of unexpected poor comprehenders lies in their weakness in vocabulary and that comprehension difficulties related to the identification of details and main ideas in summary writing remain when vocabulary is controlled. Implications for interpreting previous and informing future research are discussed. &#xd;
Results of both studies are discussed with respect to the nature of the reading comprehension construct, identification and remediation of reading comprehension difficulties, and the assessment of reading comprehension.</description>

   <description>Disordered speech has long been recognized as one of the core features of schizophrenia; it is stable across the course of the disorder, and has been identified as a rate limiter of functional outcome (e.g., social skills, scholastic achievement, vocational success). While much of the recent research on thought disorder has focused on the mechanisms behind disordered speech, we have observed a very limited transfer to clinical applications that promote gains in communication skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel treatment,&#xd;
Structured Therapy for the Enhancement of Purposeful Speech (STEPS), based in behavioural learning principles, to increase goal-directed speech in individuals with schizophrenia. The current study is one of the first to evaluate an intervention specifically aimed at increasing the core symptom of disorganized speech and evaluating change across multiple indicators of discourse. STEPS is based in principles of operant conditioning, wherein sessions take place three times per week for a total of three weeks. In a single-case multiple baseline design, participants (N=3) received positive reinforcement for engaging in goal-directed speech and directive feedback for committing speech errors, thereby increasing or decreasing frequency of that behaviour, respectively. Participants were assessed before, during, and after treatment on a series of thought disorder and speech coherence measures. Primary outcome measures included change in frequency of communication errors within sessions over the course of treatment and severity of thought disorder on standard disorder measures at three assessments points. Participants demonstrated a significant reduction in number of communication errors across unstructured conversations and structured storytelling components such that all participants engaged in significantly more goal-directed communication during treatment sessions compared to baseline performance. Furthermore, all participants were rated as expressing less severe disconnected speech according to a gold-standard measure of thought disorder. Effective communication is central to successful social interactions from building new interpersonal relationships, advocating for oneself to medical professionals, to demonstrating appropriate skills during interviews. The results of this study suggest that this symptom is amenable to change and can be treated in order to promote real-world functional gains.</description>

   <description>Game development is a complex and time-consuming activity that requires domain-specific knowledge and implementation skills. Networked games are particularly difficult due to the additional challenges of implementing the distribution. In recent years, game development has been simplified through tools that allow game development based on entities (objects that compose the game, e.g., avatar, vehicles, trees, and monsters). Entity-based tools simplify game programming by providing entity-level constructs and abstractions to the game developer. However, current entity-based tools fail to appropriately address the development of networked multiplayer games; they either do not support network gaming at all, or compromise the purity of the model by exposing low-level network programming to the game developer.    &#xd;
               &#xd;
In this thesis, we present a pure entity-based model for developing networked multiplayer games. In our model, the game developer is completely shielded from network programming concerns. In order to demonstrate the model’s practicality, we implemented a game development toolkit called Meerkat. Meerkat uses a combination of generic distribution algorithms and a proxy-based architecture to provide a pure entity-based game programming interface. The same interface can be used to develop both distributed and non-distributed games. Meerkat automates all aspects of networking for the game developer. To evaluate the performance of our system, we built three multiplayer games of different genres. Our experiments show that the overhead of using fully-automated networking can be acceptable for a wide range of games, except in extreme cases where there are strict performance requirements.  Meerkat demonstrates that it is possible to extend the pure entity-based approach to networked games while ensuring sufficient performance.</description>

   <description>As open pit mines get larger and their road networks more complex, haul road traffic is an area of increasing concern for mine operators. In particular, engineers from Barrick Gold Inc. have observed haul truck interactions in some of their larger open pit mines that are clearly disruptive to the haulage cycle. Such traffic effects cause uncertainty in haul times over identical routes and commercial dispatch systems do not explicitly account for this variability. This research, based on first-hand data collected from the Goldstrike Open Pit in Northern Nevada, focuses on assessing the level of variability in haul times, identifying the sources of said variability, and determining the effects on haulage optimization. Initial data analysis shows different levels of variability over the range of observed haul times, and further investigation identifies certain haulage parameters as significant sources of said variability, such as road topography and intersection effects. Focusing on these areas of interest, relevant data sets were manipulated to reduce levels of data dispersion and compared to observed results in order to quantify the effects in terms of changes to overall mean haul times along identical routes. It was observed that variability has a negative impact on travel times and moderate variability reduction was observed to increase productivity by 1–2 % when used as an input to a simple dispatch simulation program based on the Goldstrike Open Pit.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores the recognition of institutional racism in Ontario. It examines &#xd;
discourses of institutional racism between the late 1960s and early 1980s and argues that the recognition of institutional racism at the provincial and national levels was facilitated by overt acts of racism in one of Canada’s most populous and diverse cities – Toronto. The targets of overt racism were new immigrants from decolonizing nations who utilized the discourse of rights &#xd;
in the context of an increase in racist incidents to press for state recognition of institutional racism. This rise in racially motivated violence concerned most Canadians as it went against Canadians’ self-perception as a raceless, tolerant and peaceful society. &#xd;
&#xd;
The recognition of structural racism was a gradual and contested process as municipal, &#xd;
provincial and federal government actors often denied its existence and deemed overt acts of racism aberrant. When racist acts did occur, state officials and media reports blamed the increased racial tensions on the personal prejudice of extremists. Activist groups composed of visible minorities and human rights activists were key in the formation of a counter-narrative that &#xd;
challenged this persistent denial of structural racism. These groups played a fundamental role in redefining the nature of racism in Canadian society.&#xd;
&#xd;
A central theme of this dissertation is that disintegrating race relations allowed for a&#xd;
redefinition of the Canadian state. It was the increase in racist incidents in 1970s Toronto that fostered a broad discussion on racism in Canada. This discussion emphasized that Canada’s people of colour experienced second-class citizenship because of structural inequalities which were rooted in Canadian institutions. Racial violence in 1970s Toronto was crucial in the &#xd;
recognition of institutional racism as racist incidents brought visible minorities into the public sphere and gave them an opportunity to identify the existence of systemic and institutional racism in Canadian society. However, the recognition of institutional and systemic racism did &#xd;
not result in a deep transformation of the Canadian racial state as policy changes have not been successful in challenging structural inequality.</description>

   <description>Upregulation of intracellular and secreted acid phosphatases (APases) is a universal response of orthophosphate-starved (-Pi) plants. APases hydrolize Pi from a broad spectrum of phosphomonoesters at an acidic pH. Plant APases belong to a relatively large multigene family whose specific functions in Pi metabolism are poorly understood. This study focuses on the identification and characterization of cell wall (CW) localized purple acid APases (PAPs) upregulated by -Pi Arabidopsis thaliana. Three glycosylated PAP isozymes secreted into the CW of -Pi Arabidopsis suspension cells were purified and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and N-terminal microsequencing as AtPAP12 (At2g27190; subunit size 60-kDa), AtPAP25 (At4g36350; subunit size 55-kDa) and AtPAP26 (At5g34850; subunit size 55-kDa). Both AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 were previously shown to be upregulated and secreted by –Pi Arabidopsis to scavenge Pi from extracellular organic-P. However, the novel AtPAP25 has never been suggested to be involved in the plant Pi-starvation response. Biochemical characterization of AtPAP25 revealed a monomeric 55 kDa protein. Similar to other PAPs it was purple-in-solution and insensitive to tartrate. Glycoprofiling via LC MS/MS revealed highly complex NXS/T glycosylation motifs at Asn172, Asn367 and Asn424. I hypothesize that these motifs play a role in AtPAP25 targeting and function. Kinetic characterization revealed a broad pH optimum centered at 5.6 and inhibition of activity by several common APase inhibitors. AtPAP25 exhibited broad substrate selectivity, low Vmax, and a Km (phosphoenolpyruvate) value of 0.52 mM. Immunoblot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR transcript analysis indicated that AtPAP25 is exclusively synthesized under –Pi conditions. Deduced amino acid sequences were compared using multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Growth of atpap25 T-DNA insertion mutant knockout seedlings was completely arrested when transferred to a soluble Pi deficient organic-P containing soil mix, pointing to a potential regulatory function of AtPAP25 during nutritional Pi stress. Overall, this research is helping to shed light on the functional importance of specific PAP isozymes in facilitating plant acclimation to nutritional Pi deficiency. This is important because there is an urgent need to engineer Pi-efficient transgenic crops to minimize the huge input of expensive, non-renewable, and polluting Pi fertilizers in agriculture.</description>

   <description>One enduring question in the study of speech concerns the nature of the link between speech perception and production. Although accumulating evidence suggests that these two facets of spoken language are tightly coupled, the cognitive structure and neural organization underlying the interactions between the two processes are not well understood.&#xd;
   In this thesis, I focus on questions that arise from observations related to when individuals are both talking and listening, and assess the sensitivity of talkers and listeners to the same change in the acoustics of speech. First, I aim to elucidate the neural substrates of auditory feedback control during vocalization by examining the brain response to acoustic perturbations towards auditory concomitants of speech using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Chapters 2 and 3). I demonstrate, for the first time, an extensive network of brain regions involved in the detection and correction of auditory feedback errors during speech production, for which three functionally differentiated neural systems can be delineated. Then I set out to address the online perception of own voice identity as individuals are talking. Chapters 4 and 5 measure the perceptual sensitivity of individuals to the auditory concomitants of their own speech by presenting temporally gated auditory feedback in stranger’s voices during talking. The results show that people perceive stranger’s voices as a modified version of their own voice and adjust their vocal production accordingly, when their utterances and heard feedback are phonetically congruent. Chapter 6 further examines this perceptual effect by using experimental paradigms in the domain of body ownership and shows that the misattribution of the stranger’s voice, is not predicted by individual differences in suggestibility; rather it is related to the integration of multimodal cues. &#xd;
   In summary, by focusing on how the acoustics of speech are simultaneously processed for both the perception and production sides of spoken language, the series of studies add significantly to our understanding of the psychophysical, cognitive and anatomical relationships between speech perception and production, and are relevant to a wide range of clinical pathologies (e.g., stuttering, schizophrenia).</description>

   <description>Since the mid-1970s, the Ontario (Canada) Ministry of Environment (OMOE) has been collecting data on fish tissue mercury (Hg) contamination in provincial waterbodies.  By 2004, approximately 160,000 fish from 86 species at over 1,600 sites were tested for Hg. This large database is primarily used to issue advisories for safe human fish consumption via publication of the biennial Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish. Analysis to uncover spatio-temporal trends while maximising the use of data points is complicated by the application of a non-random heterogeneous sampling design. The National Descriptive Model for Mercury in Fish (NDMMF) developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) is a statistical model of Hg concentrations that can potentially mitigate these challenges by separating the spatiotemporal variability of fish-[Hg] sampling while considering the effects of species, size, and fish sample portion type. However, the NDMMF has not been fully exploited, likely due to lack of rigorous evaluation. We conduct the first detailed investigation on the ability of the NDMMF to reproduce the observed fish-[Hg] in coolwater walleye (Sander vitreous) and warm-water yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Approximately two-thirds of both walleye and yellow perch [Hg]-length relationships could be accurately predicted using the NDMMF. For these cases, a majority (>85%) of the estimates are within the same consumption advisory categories as the interpolated [Hg] value based on the observed data, using an average-length fish. For the remaining incidences with significantly different NDMMF fish [Hg]-length relationships compared to those from the observed data, the NDMMF notably yields similar results, with a majority (>75%) of [Hg] estimates still falling within the same consumption advisory categories. For the small fraction of incidences with inaccurate advisory categorization, the instances of conservative over-prediction (&lt;18%) would be of little human health concern as these would recommend fewer meals than otherwise suggested using observed data. For the few instances when [Hg] is under-predicted (&lt;11%), the nature of the human health concern would be relatively minor because the advisory classification is almost never (&lt;1%) more than one category less restrictive.</description>

   <description>Chronic abdominal pain is a major cause of patient morbidity in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A balance of pro- and anti-nociceptive factors regulating colonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which synapse onto second order dorsal horn neurons, are known to regulate chronic pain but the mechanisms are poorly understood. This thesis examined whether neuroanatomical remodeling of DRG central nerve terminals underlies pro-nociceptive signaling and whether subsets of immune cells source the anti-nociceptive factor, β-endorphin.&#xd;
To examine pro-nociceptive mechanisms, acute and chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse models of colitis were established and substance P (SP; marker of nociceptor terminals) immunohistochemistry used to investigate changes in immunoreactivity of DRG terminals in the thoracic dorsal horn (segments T9-T13). SP immunoreactivity was increased in the dorsal horn (4 fold; P &lt; 0.001) and central canal (P &lt; 0.001) following chronic colitis. In contrast, SP immunoreactivity was unchanged in acute colitis. However, five weeks later SP immunoreactivity was increased both in the dorsal horn (4 fold; P &lt; 0.01) and central canal (P &lt; 0.001). In the cervical spinal cord, SP immunoreactivity was not increased following colitis, suggesting that changes seen in the thoracic level were specific to signaling from colonic DRG neurons. Immunoreactivity for the SP NK1 receptor on second order neurons was also examined and a significant increase in immunoreactivity was observed on post-synaptic second order cell bodies following chronic DSS. This could provide an additional mechanism for enhanced SP neurotransmission centrally.&#xd;
ii&#xd;
The source of the anti-nociceptive mediator, β-endorphin, during chronic DSS colitis was investigated using magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry. The number of β- endorphin expressing CD4+ (2.4 fold; P &lt; 0.05) and CD11b+ (2.6 fold; P &lt; 0.05) cells in mice increased following chronic colitis.&#xd;
These findings suggest that during colitis there is a time-dependent increase of SP immunoreactivity in thoracic DRG central terminals, which could play a role in pro- nociceptive signaling in chronic inflammation. These actions may be balanced by anti- nociceptive factors such as β-endorphin which are found in subsets of immune cells.</description>

   <description>Establishing a valid, reliable, and objective method for determining the number of functioning motor units in a muscle is important clinically, as it would provide a quantitative means of documenting changes in neuromuscular health over time.  This thesis addressed the reliability of motor unit number estimates (MUNEs) derived using decomposition-based quantitative electromyography (DQEMG) from the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) and abductor hallucis (AH) muscles.  Additionally, the effect of the mean surface motor unit potential (SMUP) parameter averaging method (arithmetic/ensemble), the size-related parameter used to calculate MUNE (amplitude/area), and the type of SMUP marker editing (automatic/manual) was investigated in terms of MUNE values.  &#xd;
Two separate analyses on a single data set collected from twenty healthy subjects on two occasions were conducted.  MUNEs were calculated by dividing a size-related parameter (amplitude/area) of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) by the same size-related parameter of a representative mean SMUP.  First, paired t-tests investigated differences in MUNEs calculated using arithmetic and ensemble averaged SMUP parameters. Within- and between-day reliability of the two measurements was established using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), coefficients of variation (CV), mean absolute differences (MAD), and Bland Altman limits of agreement (LOA). Second, MUNEs (using both parameters) derived from automated and manually edited SMUPs were compared.  The effect of the size-related parameter and editing type was identified using a two-factor, repeated measures analysis of variance.  Reliability was determined as described above. &#xd;
Arithmetic averaged SMUP parameters produced smaller MUNEs than those derived from ensemble averaging (p&lt;0.001).  SMUP area produced higher MUNEs than SMUP amplitude (p&lt;0.05), except when using arithmetic averaged parameters in AH.  Interaction effects between editing type and size parameter were present in both muscles (F>6.68, p&lt;0.001).   &#xd;
Between-day MUNEs had lower CVs and MADs, higher ICCs, and narrower LOAs than within-day MUNEs.  MUNEs derived from arithmetic averaged SMUP parameters showed the highest reliability (ICCs>0.91).  MUNEs calculated from automated SMUP marker placements were highly correlated (r>0.86) and displayed comparable reliabilities to those derived from manual marker placement (ICCs>0.90).&#xd;
To optimize the reproducibility of MUNEs calculated using DQEMG, while minimizing processing time, between-day automated estimates using arithmetic averaged SMUP amplitude is recommended.</description>

   <description>Background: Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the world. Non-curative, metastatic disease is frequent in low incidence countries; management strategies for relief of symptoms include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The resource utilization of metastatic gastric cancer patients is unstudied in the Canadian system, and predictors of major cost drivers and end-of-life care unknown. Our purpose was to describe the resource utilization of metastatic gastric cancer patients in Ontario, compare resource utilization among Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) and examine predictors of inpatient hospital days and receipt of homecare.&#xd;
Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma patients registered in the Ontario Cancer Registry between April 1, 2005 and March 31st, 2008. Chart review and administrative healthcare data were linked to describe non-therapeutic endoscopic, radiologic and surgical investigations and treatment strategies from the healthcare system perspective, using a two-year and two month time horizon. Chi square tests were used to compare proportions of resource utilization, and non-parametric one-way ANOVA compared mean per patient usage. Negative binomial regression was used to model the number of inpatient hospital days. Modified Poisson regression was used to model receipt of homecare.&#xd;
Results: The cohort consisted of 1433 patients with metastatic disease. Less than half of the patients received chemotherapy (43%), gastrectomy (37%) or radiotherapy (28%). Geographic variation existed in the type of health services consumed and in the frequency of their use among LHINs. Location of the primary tumour, resource utilization band, receipt of a gastrectomy and care from a high volume physician were independent predictors of inpatient hospital days. Home care use was predicted by location of the primary tumour, receipt of care from a high volume physician and the number of days survived within the study period.&#xd;
Conclusion: Variation in healthcare resource utilization exists between LHINs in Ontario for the care of metastatic gastric cancer patients. Whether these differences reflect differential access to&#xd;
iii&#xd;
resources, patient preference or physician preference is not known. Further research needs to examine differences and how they impact on clinical disease outcomes. Next steps include incorporating predictors of resource utilization measures into clinical and policy-level decision-making.</description>

   <description>This project defines the potential benefits of bicycling in major Canadian cities; determines the role of cycling within sustainable urban development; and suggests recommendations for maximizing the benefits of cycling in Canadian cities. The first phase of the project involved a review of academic literature and analysis of documents for four city case studies: Vancouver, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; Ottawa, Ontario; and Toronto, Ontario. Information was analyzed and themed to develop recommendations to maximize bicycling in these cities. The research suggests Vancouver and Ottawa are two of Canada’s leading cities in cycling innovation. Analysis of city documents found that most cities create in-depth cycling master plans which are difficult to successfully complete. Phase two of the project involved a 5400 kilometer bicycling tour in the summer of 2010 from Vancouver to Toronto. During the tour, each of the four cities were visited for a period of five to seven days and observations were made on cyclist infrastructure, safety, promotional and educational initiatives, planning, policy and law, and unique features. Photography and semi-structured interviews with urban planners, government officials, and cycling advocates were utilized to gain a unique perspective of the major cycling issues and innovations within each city. The research and observation indicated that a focus on creation of complete cycling networks; enforcement of cyclist rights; promotion and education; incentives and disincentives to the use of motorized vehicles; efficient use of funds for cycling infrastructure; the examination of municipal level cycling master plan policy; recognition of economic benefits of cycling; and knowledge and experience sharing between Canadian municipalities can increase overall rates of cycling within a city.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2012-08-30 14:58:10.637</description>
   <description>The Dark Triad consists of three overlapping personality traits: Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and Narcissism, (Paulhus &amp; Williams, 2002). This investigation examines two main research goals. The first aims to identify the common traits that occupy the core of the Dark Triad of personality. The literature suggests that the Dark Triad Core traits are low agreeableness (e.g., Jakobwitz &amp; Egan, 2006), aggression (e.g., Kerig &amp; Stellwagen, 2010), impulsivity (e.g., Thomaes, Bushman, De Castro, &amp; Stegge, 2009), low emotional intelligence (e.g., Ali, Amorim &amp; Chamorro-Premuzic, 2009), and potentially low neuroticism (Paulhus &amp; Williams, 2002). The second research goal aims to identify a developmental trajectory of how early life risk factors influence each other and the Dark Triad. The literature suggests that being raised in a low SES environment (e.g., Chapple &amp; Johnson, 2007), experiencing trauma (e.g., Tackett et al., 2009), and being the child of poor parenting styles (e.g., De Clercq et al., 2008), are related to the occurrence of the Dark Triad. An anxious or avoidant attachment style (Loeber &amp; Hay, 1997) and low self-control (Gramzow et al., 2004) may also predict the Dark Triad. &#xd;
Using a sample of 546 adults, the first study demonstrated that the proposed Dark Triad Core traits represent a construct that is overlapping, but not equivalent to, the construct represented by the Dark Triad personality traits. Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, Narcissism, low agreeableness, and aggression load one factor, while aggression, impulsivity, low emotional intelligence, neuroticism, Narcissism and Machiavellianism load a second correlated factor. Using Structural Equation Modeling, several models were tested and a final model was generated that provides a preliminary developmental trajectory of the Dark Triad. This model indicates that poor parenting practices tend to increase the expression of anxious attachment in children. Furthermore, fathers’ poor parenting marginally decreases children’s self-control. Experiencing trauma also tends to increase anxious attachment and decrease self-control in victims. Then, anxious attachment and low self-control influence the expression of the Dark Triad. This line of research begins to define the core of the Dark Triad, while also defining the impact of childhood experiences and personal characteristics in the expression of the Dark Triad.</description>

   <description>Our everyday interactions with the world are subject to affordance: the interaction that exists naturally between an object and the action possibilities inherent within it. Object affordances result from complex visuomotor interactions and are reflected in many processes, including reaching and grasping behaviours, distance judgments, and object identification. With the present study we extended current research on the use of affordances in visual searches of arrays to investigate whether guidance by affordance occurs in searches of real-world scenes and is the result of knowledge of target function (Experiment 1), and whether it is integrated with the use of scene context in guidance of search (Experiment 2).&#xd;
	To investigate the contribution of object function to guidance by affordance in real-world scenes we tracked participants’ eye movements while they performed visual searches. The target objects were invented objects with invented functions that were learned by the participants prior to beginning search. By providing participants with information about only the features and functions of targets (and not about location) we omitted any effects on search from previously learned associations between the objects and their locations in the scene.  This allowed us to examine guidance by affordance independently of traditional contextual effects. In Experiment 1 we compared the searches of participants who learned the functions of the targets to those who learned only the targets’ features. Results showed facilitation of visual search by knowledge of target function as compared against searches in which target function was not known. Experiment 2 compared searches for objects placed in locations congruent and incongruent with their function to show that guidance by affordance is benefitted by knowledge of target function in congruent searches. We concluded that guidance by affordance results from an understanding of the function of an object and the integration of that understanding into an understanding of the context of the scene as a whole</description>

   <description>The detonation characteristics of dimethyl ether-air, methanol-air and ethanol-air mixtures, initially at atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of 298K to 373K, were investigated in this study. Experiments were performed in a heated detonation tube, 6.1m long with an inner- diameter of 10cm. Transition to detonation was achieved for fuel-air mixtures by spark ignition and subsequent flame acceleration using orifice plate obstacles in the first half of the tube, and via a gas driver with a short orifice plate obstacle section. Cell width measurements where obtained using the soot foil technique for fuel-air mixtures inside the detonation limits. The measurements show that dimethyl ether-air, methanol-air and ethanol-air mixtures are less “sensitive” to detonation than propane-air and ethane-air mixtures, but more sensitive than methane-air mixtures, within the tested temperature range. Soot foil records also indicated the presence of substantial cellular substructure for all three fuel-air mixtures. One-dimensional detonation reaction zone length calculations were performed and fit with the measured cell width using a simple linear correlation, which resulted in an accurate representation of the data. The correlation proportionality constants for dimethyl ether-air, methanol-air and ethanol-air were obtained for the dominant cellular structure as well as the substructure. The values obtained for the substructure are comparable to values reported in the literature for typical hydrocarbons.</description>

   <description>Flowering plants display remarkable phenotypic diversity, especially in reproductive structures, much of which is thought to be associated with pollination by animals. Pollination syndromes are collections of floral traits (e.g. flower colour, shape, odour) that are associated with a plant attracting particular functional groups of animal pollinators. We explored the extent to which traits associated with the moth pollination syndrome translated into pollination by moths in the Pacific coast dune endemic Abronia umbellata and found mixed results: in one year of study, there was no difference in seed set by day- vs. night-pollinated inflorescences, but in another year of study, night-pollinated inflorescences set significantly more seed than those pollinated during the day. We integrate this work with tests of pollen and resource limitation of seed production and with seed set surveys of natural populations to address proximate and ultimate causes of low seed set, finding low rates of pollinator visitation, high pollen limitation of seed production in all populations studied, and no evidence of endogenous resource limitation of seed production. We propose that “excess” flowers may be functionally male, serving to increase outcross siring success. &#xd;
The transition from self-incompatibility and obligate outcrossing to self-compatibility and predominant selfing is the most common evolutionary transition among the flowering plants and traits associated with outcrossing may become reduced across such shifts, potentially through the action of natural selection, especially if pollinators are also herbivores, or if the signals that pollinators use to locate flowers are also used by herbivores. We examined the reduction of attractive visual and olfactory floral traits in A. umbellata across a shift from outcrossing to selfing and found a reduction of all floral traits considered. We found that floral volatile emissions were reduced more strongly than flower size or floral display (number of flowers per inflorescence), but there was no evidence of an ecological cost associated with conspicuousness: we did not find reduced leaf herbivory among selfers relative to outcrossers.</description>

   <title>Factors Predicting the Social Participation of Children With and Without Developmental Disabilities</title>

   <description>Although participation in social, recreational, and leisure activities is essential to overall well being, children with developmental disabilities (DD) participate in fewer activities than their typically developing (TD) peers (e.g., Solish, Perry &amp; Minnes, 2010).  The purpose of the current study was to explore the factors that predict participation of preschool- and early school-aged children by investigating the contributions of the child, the family, and the environment in which the child and family reside.&#xd;
The theoretical model used in the current study is an adaptation of two conceptual models proposed by King et al. (2003) who investigated the factors predicting participation of individuals with physical disabilities between the ages of 6 and 21 years, and Orsmond, Wyngaarden Krauss, and Mailick Seltzer (2004) who investigated the factors predicting participation for adolescents and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  These authors proposed that a combination of environmental factors (e.g., supportive relationships), family factors (e.g., absence of financial and time impacts on the family), and individual/child factors (e.g., cognitive skills, communication) would be associated with participation.  These models were adapted for use in the current study to include: 1) factors that have been shown empirically to be predictors of involvement for children with physical disabilities and for adolescents/adults with ASD (e.g., child’s functional ability); and 2) additional factors that may be theoretically relevant to the participation of preschool-aged children with DD. The outcome variables included the child’s participation in a variety of activities and parental satisfaction with the child’s sense of belonging. The results demonstrate that preschool- and early school-aged children, and children with and without disabilities, differed from each other on a number of variables (e.g., adaptive behaviour, family stress, etc). In addition, children with ASD and children with other DD participated in fewer social, recreational, and leisure activities than their TD peers, and parents of children with ASD and other DD reported lower satisfaction with their child’s sense of belonging. Adaptive behaviour, social skills, number of services used, family active recreation, and income were significant predictors of the child’s participation in activities. Limitations and theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a framework for a microstructural model of a catalyst layer in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell.  In this study, a stochastic model that uses individual carbon, platinum and ionomer particles as building blocks to construct a catalyst layer geometry, resulting in optimal porosity and material mass ratios has been employed.  The construction rule set in this design is easily variable, enabling a wide range of catalyst layer geometries to be made.  The generated catalyst layers were found to exhibit many of the features found in currently poduced catalyst layers.  The resulting geometries were subsequently examined on the basis of electronic percolation, mean chord length and effective diffusivity of the pore phase. Catalyst layer percolation was found to be most effected by the number of carbon see particles used and the specified porosity.  The mean chord lengths of all of the catalyst layer geometries produced Knudsen numbers ranging in order of magnitude between 0.1 and 10, thus indicating that gas diffusion within the catalyst layers lies in the transition regime between bulk and Knudsen diffusion. Calculated effective diffusivities within the pore space of the model were shown to be relatively insensitive to changes in the catalyst layer composition and construction rule set other then porosity, indicating that the pore size distribution does not significantly vary when the catalyst layer mass ratios vary.</description>

   <description>Similarity in music is a concept with significant impact on ethnomusicology studies, music recommendation systems, and music information retrieval systems such as Shazam and SoundHound. Various computer-based melody similarity measures have been proposed, but comparison and evaluation of similarity measures is inherently difficult due to the subjective and application-dependent nature of similarity in music. In this thesis, we address the diversity of the problem by defining a set of music transformations that provide the criteria for comparing and evaluating melody similarity measures. This approach provides a flexible and extensible method for characterizing selected facets of melody similarity, because the set of music transformations can be tailored to the user and to the application.&#xd;
&#xd;
We demonstrate this approach using three music transformations (transposition, tempo rescaling, and selected forms of ornamentation) to compare and evaluate several existing similarity measures, including String Edit Distance measures, Geometric measures, and N-Gram based measures. We also evaluate a newly implemented distance measure, the Beat and Direction Distance Measure, which is designed to have greater awareness of the beat hierarchy and better responsiveness to ornamentation. Training and test data is drawn from music incipits from the RISM A/II collection, and ground truth is taken from the MIREX 2005 Symbolic Melodic Similarity task. Our test results show that similarity measures that are responsive to music transformations generally have better agreement with human generated ground truth.</description>

   <description>Fer is a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase that regulates normal physiology through signaling in a variety of cell types. Fer signals downstream of growth factor receptors frequently activated or amplified in human cancers and Fer has been identified as a positive regulator of cancer progression in the prostate and liver. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is frequently activated due to gene amplification or gain-of-function mutations in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) leading to aggressive tumours that frequently metastasize. Since EGFR activates Fer, I tested whether Fer participates in EGFR-driven NSCLC cell migration, tumour progression and metastasis. Here, I show that Fer is expressed in cell lines derived from both normal lung epithelia and NSCLC and is activated following EGF treatment of NSCLC cells. To probe Fer function we used a lentiviral shRNA system to achieve stable knock-down (KD) of Fer in H1299 cells. Compared to control cells, Fer KD cells displayed a significant reduction in EGF-induced cell migration and invasion which correlated with reduced phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2. Consistent with Vav2 phosphorylation promoting Rac activation, we observed reduced localization of active, GTP- bound Rac1 to the leading edge of Fer KD cells treated with EGF. Tumour xenograft experiments were performed to test the role of Fer in NSCLC tumour progression and metastasis in immune compromised mice. Growth of primary tumours was normal, despite efficient Fer silencing in vivo. Interestingly, fewer spontaneous lung metastases were observed from subcutaneous Fer KD tumours compared to control. However, no differences were observed in lung seeding efficiency in experimental metastasis assays, suggesting that Fer may play a role in early stages of metastasis. Together, this study identifies Fer as a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of EGFR-driven lung cancer metastasis.</description>

   <description>This work concerns the development of π-conjugated materials for optoelectronic applications, with emphasis on organoboron- and organoplatinum-containing compounds. The preparation of a nonconjugated two-chromophore emissive material is described, containing both organoplatinum and organoboron units. This material exhibits simultaneous fluorescent and phosphorescent emission at ambient temperature. Both emission colours are switchable in the presence of fluoride, giving a dual-emissive compound with multiple observable luminescent colours. &#xd;
&#xd;
The preparation of a nonconjugated donor-acceptor triarylborane containing both Lewis acidic and basic receptor sites is also described. This highly fluorescent compound is reversibly switchable between three emissive states upon addition of acid or fluoride. Furthermore, platinum(II)-acetylacetonates with nonconjugated antenna chromophores were prepared, and their luminescent properties were investigated. &#xd;
&#xd;
A series of directly conjugated platinum(II)-acetylacetonates have been synthesized incorporating a triarylboron group. The presence of boron was found to enhance the electron-transporting capabilities, film-forming properties, and phosphorescent quantum yields of these complexes. Highly efficient OLEDs were prepared incorporating these materials as dopants, including the first example of a Pt(II)-based OLED with an external quantum efficiency >20%. Triarylboron-containing Pt(II) complexes of N-heterocyclic carbenes were also prepared. Using this design, blue to blue-green phosphorescence was achieved with high quantum yield, and their use in OLEDs was demonstrated. &#xd;
&#xd;
A new high-yield synthetic route has been developed to cyclometalated Pt(II)-β-diketonates, requiring stoichiometric reagents and short reaction times at ambient temperature. This methodology has broad substrate scope across a variety of N^C-chelate ligands, as well as P^C-chelate phosphines and C^C-chelate carbenes as well. &#xd;
&#xd;
The preparation of N-heterocyclic carbazole-based host materials for OLEDs is also described. These materials exhibit improved electron-transporting capabilities relative to the more commonly used host 4,4’-N,N’-dicarbazolylbiphenyl (CBP), and were used to fabricate the first single-layer electrophosphorescent devices with efficiencies competitive with conventional multilayer structures. &#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, the discovery of a triarylboron-based vapochromic material is described. This Pt(II)-alkyne complex was shown to change luminescent colour in response to a variety of volatile organic compounds, with distinct responses dependent on the nature of the analyte. The mechanism of vapochromism was investigated in detail by optical and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and differs in origin from all previously reported examples.</description>

   <description>Mobile devices are frequently used to view rich content while on the go.  However, they have a tradeoff between increased screen size and portability; mobile devices, by definition, are constrained to a fraction of a desktop computer’s display area. This constraint means a user has to frequently navigate to content that lies outside the display.&#xd;
We present FlexView, a prototype system and set of interaction techniques, which allows users to navigate through depth-arranged large information spaces using display curvature as an additional input channel. FlexView augments the planar (X-Y) navigation currently performed by touch input with two forms of bend input to navigate through depth (Z). With leafing, the user holds one side of display and bends the opposite side. Squeezing involves gripping the display in one hand and applying pressure on both sides to create concave or convex curvatures, and supports concurrent interaction with touch input.&#xd;
We performed two evaluations to investigate the performance of FlexView’s interaction techniques. In Experiment 1, we measured the efficiency of participants when searching through pages of a document, and compared touch input to squeezing and leafing used in isolation. Experiment 2 introduced X-Y navigation in a pan-and-zoom pointing task where multi-touch pinch gestures were compared against squeezing and leafing for zoom operations. Panning, across all conditions, was performed with touch input using the index finger.&#xd;
Our experiments demonstrated that touch and bend interactions are comparable for navigation through depth-arranged content, and squeezing to zoom recorded the fastest times in the pan-and-zoom pointing task. Overall, FlexView allows users to easily browse depth-arranged information spaces without sacrificing traditional touch interactions.</description>

   <description>As a successor of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, the SNO+ experiment is planned&#xd;
to start data taking in early 2013. Making use of the liquid scintillator, Linear&#xd;
Alkylbenzene (LAB), the SNO+ experiment aims to perform ux measurements of&#xd;
low energy solar neutrinos in one phase, and wait for neutrinoless double beta decay&#xd;
events in another phase where 44 kg of natural Neodymium would be added into&#xd;
LAB.&#xd;
The Rayleigh ratio of LAB was found to be 16.60 _ 3.14 _10􀀀6 cm􀀀1 at 546&#xd;
nm using the relative measurement technique. The wavelength dependency of the&#xd;
Rayleigh scattering was also examined and compared with the theoretical prediction.&#xd;
A setup which is usable to measure the angular dependency of the Rayleigh scattering&#xd;
was built, and an isotropic behaviour of the scattering was tested. The _ and &#xd;
backgrounds, due to the internal calibration ropes situated in the scintillator volume,&#xd;
were studied using the SNO+ Monte Carlo Package. Also, the amount of 210Pb&#xd;
originating from the internal calibration ropes due to the intrinsic contamination of&#xd;
238U, Rn emanation and plated on the surface prior to the installation were assessed&#xd;
to examine if it is a tolerable level to achieve the target level of 13.4 background&#xd;
events per day.</description>

   <description>A series of experiments were conducted to explore the hydration state of the mineral lausenite.  The experiments of Posnjak and Merwin (1922) were recreated and the conclusion is reached that lausenite is of mineral formula Fe2(SO4)3∙5H2O, rather than Fe2(SO4)3∙6H2O as suggested by Posnjak and Merwin (1922).  This conclusion is based on the X-ray diffraction data which found that the Posnjak and Merwin experiments produced a phase whose pattern matched that of the pentahydrate identified by Majzlan (2005).  The refractive index data and morphology of this phase is also a match for the mineral described previously as a hexahydrate by Posnjak and Merwin (1922) and Lausen (1928).&#xd;
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data was collected from a possible new phase in the hydrous ferric sulfate system.  The data were analyzed and a unit cell was identified with monoclinic unit cell dimensions of a = 7.532(3)Å b = 12.551(6)Å c = 7.077(4)Å and β = 96.775(8)° with a unit cell volume of 664.4Å3.  This phase was determined to grow only at temperatures above 85°C and at a RH of ~23%.  &#xd;
The atomic structures of the minerals quenstedtite [Fe2(SO4)3∙11H2O] and romerite [Fe2+Fe3+2(SO4)4∙14H2O] are refined, hydrogen positions are identified and hydrogen bonding scheme is discussed.  The weakest hydrogen bonds are found to occur between layers of differently coordinated tetrahedral groups in both romerite and quenstedtite.  The transition from romerite to quenstedtite involves the oxidation of the ferrous iron in romerite converting into a Fe3+(SO4)∙5H2O cluster.</description>

   <description>Exploring Urban Spaces in the Young Imagination makes the case for taking seriously children's and young adult fiction as a topic worthy of scholarly analysis beyond a purely didactic focus. The recent explosion of interest in this literature among adult readers and the blurring of boundaries between adult and youth media demonstrate that it has become a powerful influence on popular culture and has captured the collective imagination. As the future inhabitants of urban spaces, paying close attention to children’s and youth perspectives can provide fresh lenses, with which to view the cultural construction of cityscapes. &#xd;
This dissertation examines post-millennium children’s and YA fiction and film. Drawing on theories of the spatial turn, my research provides five case studies on a variety of topics related to the contemporary metropolis – ranging from cognitive disability to environmental concerns. Specifically, it pays close attention to the inherent connections between the developing perceptions of metropolises and the various protagonists’ processes of identity formation. &#xd;
Beginning with Berlin, as portrayed in Andreas Steinhöfel’s popular Rico-und-Oskar-trilogy, my analysis explores the protagonist’s shifting perceptions of his urban surroundings while overcoming the limitations of his learning disability. Furthermore, my research shows how Steinhöfel’s Der mechanische Prinz utilizes the cityscape as a mirror for the protagonist’s psyche and how his knowledge of the Berlin subway system contributes to his self-healing. In contrast, China Miéville’s Un Lun Dun explores the ecocritical implications of London’s urban ‘other’, UnLondon. Katherine Marsh’s The Night Tourist and its sequel The Twilight Tourist illustrate the literary construction of New York City as a ‘mediascape’ and modern myth. Finally, I focus on alternative family structures and their connection to urban spaces, specifically Venice in Cornelia Funke’s Herr der Diebe, and Paris in Brian Selznick’s The Invention of Hugo Cabret. The study concludes with an examination of these novels’ filmic versions and their respective romanticisations of Venice and Paris. The dissertation contributes to the fields of child and youth studies and urban geographies by exposing the manifold symbiotic constructions of cityscapes and youth in post-2000 children’s and YA fiction that shape identities and spaces alike.</description>

   <description>Objectives. To design a group-based, psychoeducational and behavioural modification course to help individuals with mood and anxiety disorders who are directly affected by mental health stigma. Second, to gather feedback on the course content and design using focus groups, then to finalize the course sessions. &#xd;
Methods. Course development occurred in two phases. Phase I included content that was based on published research, including readings of personal experiences, and informal conversations with mental health service providers and mental health service consumers. In Phase II, three focus groups were conducted to gather feedback. Focus Group 1 included ten mental health service providers, Focus Group 2 included twelve mental health service consumers, and Focus Group 3 included three experts in the field of mental health stigma.  &#xd;
Results. All three groups had a positive reaction to the draft course and many suggestions were offered based upon focus group members’ personal experiences dealing with mental health stigma. All suggestions were taken into consideration and many were applied to refine the course content. &#xd;
Conclusion. The revised anti-stigma course content is based on a compilation of research and suggestions taken from a wide variety of sources. This should ensure a comprehensive, feasible, and effective course. Development of this course is the first step towards a larger project aimed at reducing stigma directly experienced by those affected by mood and anxiety disorders in an effort to better their lives and encourage both resiliency and recovery.</description>

   <description>Software repositories such as source code repositories and bug repositories record information about the software development process. By analyzing the rich data available in software repositories, we can uncover interesting information. This information can be leveraged to guide software developers, or to automate software development activities. In this thesis we investigate two activities of the development process: selective code integration and grouping of field crash-reports, and use the information available in software repositories to improve each of the two activities.</description>

   <description>Objectives:  To determine whether for a given waist circumference (WC), a larger hip circumference (HC) was associated with a reduced risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in HIV-infected patients.  A second objective was to determine whether, for a given WC, the addition of HC improved upon estimates of abdominal adiposity, in particular visceral adipose tissue (VAT), compared to those obtained by WC alone.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods:  HIV-infected men (N=1481) and women (N=841) were recruited between 2005 and 2009.  WC and HC were obtained using standard techniques and abdominal adiposity was measured using computed tomography.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Results:  After control for WC and covariates, HC was associated with a lower risk of HOMA-IR (p&lt;0.05) and T2D [Men: OR=0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.96); Women: OR=0.91 (95% CI: 0.84-0.98)].  For a given WC, HC was also associated with a lower risk of hypertension (p&lt;0.05) and CVD [OR=0.94 (95% CI: 0.88-0.99)] in men, but not women.  Although HC was negatively associated with VAT in men and women after control for WC (p&lt;0.05), the addition of HC did not substantially improve upon the prediction of VAT compared to WC alone.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions:  The identification of high-risk HIV-infected individuals by WC alone is substantially improved by the addition of HC.  Estimates of VAT by WC are not substantially improved by the addition of HC and thus variation in visceral adiposity may not be the conduit by which HC identifies increased health risk.</description>

   <description>Shear stress is the frictional force exerted on the vascular wall by blood flowing through an artery.  It is a major regulator of endothelial cell function, which is essential for vasoprotection and local regulation of vascular tone.  Using handgrip exercise (HGEX) to increase shear stress is an increasingly popular method for assessing brachial artery (BA) endothelial cell function via flow-mediated dilation (FMD, dilation which increases with improved endothelial function).  However, different exercise duty-cycles (ratio of handgrip relaxation to contraction in seconds) produce different patterns of BA shear stress with different anterograde and retrograde flow magnitudes.  PURPOSE: To determine the impact of HGEX duty-cycle on BA %FMD while maintaining a constant mean shear stress.  METHODS: N=16 healthy males. BA diameter (BAD) and blood velocity (BV) were assessed via echo and Doppler ultrasound.  Shear stress was estimated as shear rate (SR=BV/BAD) and reported as mean SR during the last minute of baseline (target 10 s 1) and each minute of HGEX (75 s-1).  Subjects performed 3 six minute HGEX trials on each of 2 separate days (like trials averaged). Each trial was one of 3 randomly ordered HGEX duty-cycles (1:1, 3:1, 5:1).   %FMD was calculated as the increase in BAD from baseline to the end of HGEX and at each minute (subset N=10) during HGEX.  RESULTS: Data are means ± SD. As intended, mean SR was similar between duty-cycles (main effect, p=0.835), despite significant differences in anterograde and retrograde SR (P&lt;0.001).  There was no impact of duty cycle on blood pressure (p=0.188) or heart rate (p=0.131) responses.  End exercise %FMD (4.0 ± 1.3%, 4.1 ± 2.2%, 4.2 ± 1.4%, p=0.860) and minute by minute %FMD (main effect p=0.939; interaction, p=0.545) were also not different between duty-cycles.  CONCLUSION:  Distinct HGEX duty-cycles create markedly different shear stress patterns in the BA. However, duty cycle had no impact on %FMD magnitude suggesting that mean shear stress is the most important stimulus for FMD in the BA.  Using a 5:1 duty cycle may yield the best vessel image and diameter measurement quality due to the long period of arm stability between contractions.</description>

   <title>Regulation of the GABPβ Promoter and the Role of NRF-1 in Mammary Epithelial Morphogenesis</title>

   <description>Decreased expression of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset) is frequently observed in sporadic breast tumors, with the decrease not attributed to mutations or hypermethylation of the promoter. A critical regulator of the BRCA1 promoter is the GA-Binding Protein (GABP), a heterotetramer of GABPα and GABPβ. Previous analysis of the GABPβ promoter revealed a regulatory multi-protein complex containing Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF-1), which was aberrant in SK-BR-3 cells, resulting in decreased GABPβ and BRCA1 expression. To identify the unknown co-regulators of the NRF-1-containing complex at the GABPβ promoter, an immobilized-template assay containing the complex binding site was utilized. Despite optimization of binding and elution conditions through variations in salt content, Mg2+ concentration and pH, non-specific DNA-binding proteins were present in the column eluate. Further experimentation is therefore required to distinguish between non-specific proteins and complex co-activators. As this complex containing NRF-1 is also able to modulate BRCA1, a regulator of luminal progenitor differentiation, a defect in NRF-1 or complex co-activators could contribute to the abnormal morphogenesis and differentiation of BRCA1-deficient tumors. We therefore investigated the role of NRF-1 in mammary cell morphogenesis and its link to the GABP/BRCA1 pathway. As both GABPβ and NRF-1 are known regulators of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, this association also provides a link between mitochondrial metabolism and breast differentiation, both of which are frequently disrupted in breast cancer. An inducible lentiviral system was used to generate NRF-1 knockdown cell lines to examine its effect on morphogenesis. Growth in 3D culture resulted in abnormal cell structures having impaired cell polarization and lumen formation. In monolayer culture, prolonged NRF-1 knockdown did not result in decreased BRCA1 or GABP expression. However, these cells did display notable mitochondrial dysfunction, accompanied by the downregulation of several NRF-1 target genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis including Tfam and cytochrome c. These results suggest a role for NRF-1 in mediating mammary morphogenesis through maintenance of functional mitochondria. Further investigation into the role of the NRF-1-containing complex at the GABPβ promoter during differentiation might also provide insight into the altered cell metabolism and differentiation observed in cancer cells.</description>

   <description>High-stakes testing is used for the purposes of providing results that have important consequences such as certifications, licensing, or credentialing. The purpose of this study was to examine aspects of an exam recently written by flight paramedics for recertification and make recommendations for development of future exams. In 2008, an unexpectedly high failure led to revisions in the exam development process for flight paramedics. Using principles of classical test theory and generalizability theory, I examined the decision consistency and dependability of the examination and found the decision consistency for dichotomous items to be within acceptable limits, yet the dependability was low. Discrimination was strong at the cut-score. An in-depth look into the process used to set the exam, as well as the psychometric properties of the exam and the items have led to recommendations that will contribute to future development of dependable exams in the industry that result in more valid interpretations with respect to paramedic competence.</description>

   <title>It's Not Just Business, It's Personal: The Self-Concept and Consumers' Fairness Judgments</title>

   <subject>Price Fairness, Self-Threat, Relational Value, Incompetence, Affect-as-Information</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-07 08:20:05.227</description>
   <description>Consumers often pay different prices for the same product, and prices commonly vary across stores and time. Theories of fairness suggest that such price discrepancies will be deemed unfair, yet consumers’ perceptions of unfairness in such situations vary greatly (Haws and Bearden 2006). This dissertation aims to enrich our understanding of this issue by examining the role of threat in shaping consumers’&#xd;
perceptions of unfairness. Specifically, integrating the extant literature on unfairness, affect and identity, it argues that an important basis for consumers’ perceptions of unfairness is the degree to which price differentials convey threatening information about important aspects of the consumers’ self-concept. In fact, it suggests that price differentials can convey threatening information about two distinct aspects of consumers’ identity – their perceived relational value and their personal identity - and identifies conditions under which such information is likely conveyed. Here, relational value refers to assessments of social worth and personal identity refers to the aspect of&#xd;
the self concerned with the achievement of individualized goals such as competence,&#xd;
mastery and conscience (Skitka 2003). The logic underlying this central argument is&#xd;
that self-threatening price differentials trigger more intense negative affect, which is subsequently used by consumers to inform their fairness judgments. The current work&#xd;
also examines whether price differentials that convey self-affirming information are&#xd;
likely to be deemed less unfair because of the positive feelings they inspire. Taken as a whole, this dissertation highlights the central role of threat in shaping consumers’ price fairness judgments. In doing so, it contributes to the fairness literature, both in marketing and more broadly, by offering an organizing framework for understanding the basis of consumers’ price fairness judgments.</description>

   <title>A Context Management Framework to Support Context-Aware Pervasive Computing</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-07 11:42:42.117</description>
   <description>As computing devices become more pervasive and integrated with our lives, it becomes useful for these devices to understand the environment which surrounds them and the activities of their users, so that they may adapt themselves to suit the circumstances and best assist their users.  To accomplish this, it is necessary that these devices have a model for expressing and sharing contextual data which characterizes the state of the surroundings, the devices and people in an environment, and the relationships between each.&#xd;
This thesis describes a framework for managing the exchange of contextual data between devices and sensors with information about their shared environment, with other devices whose goals are to adapt their behaviour to best suit the circumstances.  This function supports the greater goal of implementing a pervasive computing environment.  We identify three roles in context sharing:  Context Providers which are sources of contextual data such as sensors; Context Consumers which are applications which use contextual data to adapt themselves; and Context Hosts which act as intermediaries facilitating the exchange of data and provide a proxy host for contextual data on behalf of Context Providers.  This framework includes protocols to facilitate data exchange between each with considerations for the security and data privacy.&#xd;
This thesis also outlines an extensible model for defining and expressing contextual data and related meta data.  The context model can be passed among the context sharing actors to communicate state and relationships between entities in the working environment.</description>

   <description>This research examines the process of memorialisation around the Indian Residential School System in Canada to draw connections between the fields of transitional justice and professional urban planning. For over a century, government and churches in Canada operated a system of residential schools that removed Indigenous children from their families and communities. Today, many Indigenous communities struggle with the intergenerational impacts of this system, and as a society we are attempting to heal the damaged relationships that have resulted.&#xd;
This research presents a comparative case study of two processes of memorialisation surrounding the residential school system. Through site observations, interviews, and analyses of documents, this research examines the transformation and memorialisation of the Mohawk Institute, a former residential school, into the Woodland Cultural Centre, a First Nations-run centre located in Brantford, Ontario. I compare this example with the national Commemoration Fund, set out in the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement (2006), which settled lawsuits filed by residential school survivors against the federal government of Canada and several church organisations. &#xd;
This research underlines some tensions inherent in memorialising the human rights abuses experienced in the residential schools. A significant difficulty is establishing balance between leaving ownership of stories of the residential school experiences with survivors, while acknowledging the responsibilities that the whole of society must carry if reconciliation is to be achieved. I conclude that the process established through the Commemoration Fund does not adequately reflect this balance, leaving a heavy burden on survivors and their communities without providing adequate support. I further argue that the timelines established through this fund do not allow for the longer-term evolution that may characterize effective memorialisation projects. &#xd;
These themes link to theories around collaborative planning, and considerations of social justice and procedural fairness. In recent decades, collaborative planning has been seen as a way to make planning practices more inclusive. However, in the context of planning with Indigenous Peoples, collaborative processes may not be a sufficient response to rights claims. This has important implications for professional planners, as we work towards decolonization, reconciliation, and establishing just-relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Canada.</description>

   <description>Improved transient performance and converter miniaturization are the major driving factors behind high frequency operation of switching power supplies.  However, high speed operation is limited by topology, control, semiconductor, and packaging technologies.  The inherent mitigation of switching loss in resonant converters makes them prime candidates for use when the limits of switching frequency are pushed.  The goal of this thesis is to address two areas that practically limit the achievable switching frequency of resonant topologies.  &#xd;
Traditional control methods based on single cycle response are impractical at high frequency; forcing the use of pulse density modulation (PDM) techniques.  However, existing pulse density modulation strategies for resonant converters in dc/dc applications suffer from:&#xd;
•	High semiconductor current stress.&#xd;
•	Slow response and large filter size determined by the low modulating frequency.  &#xd;
•	Possibly operating at fractions of resonant cycles leading to switching loss; thereby limiting the modulating frequency.  &#xd;
A series resonant converter with variable frequency PDM (VF-PDM) with integral resonant cycle control is presented to overcome the limitations of existing PDM techniques to enable efficient operation with high switching frequency and modulating frequency.  The operation of the circuit is presented and analyzed, with a design procedure given to achieve fast transient performance, small filter size, and high efficiency across the load range with current stress comparable to conventional control techniques.  It is shown that digital implementation of the controller can achieve favourable results with a clock frequency four times greater than the switching frequency.&#xd;
Driving the synchronous rectifiers is a considerable challenge in high current applications operating at high switching frequency.  Resonant gate drivers with continuous inductor current experience excessive conduction loss, while discontinuous current drivers are subject to slow transitions and high peak current.  Current source drivers suffer from high component count and increased conduction loss when applied to complementary switches.  &#xd;
A dual-channel current source driver is presented as a means of driving two complementary switches.  A single coupled inductor with discontinuous current facilitates low conduction loss by transferring charge between the MOSFET gates to reduce the number of semiconductors in the current path, and reducing the number of conduction intervals.  The operation of the circuit is analyzed, and a design procedure based on minimization of the total synchronous rectifier loss is presented.  Implementation of the digital logic to control the driver is discussed.&#xd;
Experimental results at megahertz operating frequencies are presented for both areas addressed to verify the theoretical results.</description>

   <title>Adopting Obligations: Duties to Existing Children</title>

   <description>This thesis argues that infertile prospective parents have a moral obligation to adopt rather than pursue ARTs (Assisted Reproductive Technology). The first chapter presents the negative argument against the common desire among prospective parents for a genetically related child. After refuting the five most promising reasons for wanting a biological child, I show that the burden of proof lies with defenders of ARTs to justify their use. In the second chapter I make the moral case in favour of adoption. By drawing an analogy to a standard and incontrovertible duty to aid case, I argue that infertile prospective parents have a duty to adopt. The final chapter justifies limiting the scope of my argument to the infertile. I argue that unlike fertile parents, the infertile who elect to pursue ARTs are clearly willing and able to assume additional costs in order to have a child. Consequently, there is a relevant difference between these two groups that justifies focusing on the latter.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Urban &amp; Regional Planning) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-10 19:05:31.748</description>
   <description>This master’s thesis examines the extent to which collaborative planning and sustainable development theories and practices exist in First Nations’ Community-Based Land Use Plans in Canada. Collaborative planning has been developed from a westernized worldview. Despite its best intentions, collaborative planning has not always incorporated a First Nations’ perspective into its approach, which continues to reinforce a dichotomy between First Nations’ governments and Canadian federal and provincial governments (Porter, 2006). The dichotomy potentially exists due to the lack of grounds for successful collaborative planning between the various types of government bodies. It is important to examine, collaborative planning, and sustainable development in First Nations’ Community-Based Land Use Plans for theoretical/conceptual, practical, and ethical applications to Canadian planning.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis’ research was conducted using the following methodological processes: A literature review, thematic review and content analysis. The thematic review was of 14 First Nations’ Community-Based Land Use Plans throughout Canada. The thematic review resulted in a similarities, differences, and gap analysis. The content analysis was of three of the original 14 First Nations’ Community-Based Land Use Plans and used William C. Baer’s General Plan Evaluation Criteria (1997) adapted with collaborative planning and sustainable development elements to evaluate the three selected plans. The results from this research produced theoretical/conceptual, practical, and ethical contributions to the planning profession.</description>

   <title>THE NRF-1/GABP/BRCA1 Transcriptional Network in Mammary Epithelial Differentiation</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Pathology &amp; Molecular Medicine) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-11 14:22:26.407</description>
   <description>Evidence indicates that the mammary epithelium is arranged in a hierarchy in which mature luminal and myoepithelial cells are derived from stem cells through a series of lineage-restricted intermediates.  One of the more compelling hypotheses in breast cancer research is that transformation of a particular cell within the hierarchy will initiate a tumour with a specific molecular profile and clinical outcome.  If this is true, valuable insight into tumourigenesis can be gained by investigating normal and malignant pathways of differentiation.  A well-known tumour suppressor in breast cancer, BRCA1, plays a role in mammary epithelial differentiation.  It has been proposed that haploinsufficiency or loss of BRCA1, either by germline mutation or sporadic downregulation, blocks differentiation producing a pool of genetically unstable mammary stem/progenitor cells that are prime targets for transformation.  Thus, investigation of BRCA1 regulation and its role in differentiation are important to our understanding of breast cancer etiology.  In this study, we determined that BRCA1 is at the end of a transcriptional network comprised of NRF-1 and GABP, a transcription factor comprised of two distinct subunits GABPalpha and GABPbeta.  Decreased BRCA1 transcription in SK-BR-3 cells was found to be caused by aberrant activation of the GABPbeta promoter by an NRF-1 binding protein complex. We determined that the SWI/SNF family members BRG1, ARID1A and BAF155 may participate in the complex that activates GABPbeta transcription in conjunction with NRF-1.  Examination of NRF-1, GABP and BRCA1 in 3D culture models suggests that mammary epithelial differentiation is biphasic with the transition between the phases being driven by changes in BRCA1 expression and localization.  In the first phase, BRCA1 promotes differentiation in the nucleus, and in the second phase, BRCA1 is downregulated as a result of diminished GABP expression and relocated to an apical position, presumably to facilitate cell polarization.  Following BRCA1 downregulation, NRF-1 and GABP levels increase indicating they are inducing oxidative phosphorylation in the second phase of differentiation.  The involvement of NRF-1 and GABP in cellular respiration as well as differentiation through targets such as BRCA1 suggests that these proteins may integrate the cellular functions and mitochondrial metabolism required for mammary epithelial differentiation.</description>
