   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, French) -- Queen's University, 2010-07-23 13:33:45.297</description>
   <description>In this thesis, I am interested in studying how African writers incorporate cinema in their works while focusing on the impact of Western and Asian films on the African public. My corpus includes writers such as Abdoulaye Sadji (Maïmouna), Ousmane Sembène (Les Bouts de bois de Dieu), Sylvain Bemba (Rêves portatifs), Tierno Monénembo (Cinéma), Henri Lopes (Le Pleurer-Rire) and Alain Mabanckou (African psycho and Verre Cassé). I use criticism by Freud, Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jean Bellemin-Noël, Christian Metz, Frantz Fanon, Achille Mbembe, Paulin Soumanou Vieyra and others to analyze, through the mechanisms of alienation, of depersonalization and corruption of the imaginary, the transmutation that cinema lovers in the African novel undergo. By « transmutation », I mean the process which leads to the expulsion of the individuality of some characters. This transformation will be manifested by an overactive imagination, by the exaltation of the most extravagant fantasies and by the violence inherent to the characters that now, in a perverse way, strive to reproduce in their social world the fictional world of movies that they have watched and which are fully disconnected from their environment. As these characters do not manage to draw the line that separates cinematic facts from their illusions, the narrative will suggest the confusion between cinema and "reality". Therefore, the loss of direction and other dealings will lead to personality disorders and criminal behaviors.</description>

   <description>Benzene is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and a known human leukemogen. Early-life exposure to environmental carcinogens, including benzene, may lead to genomic instability in the fetus, ultimately leading to an increased risk for the development of childhood cancers including leukemia.  It is possible that exposure to benzene results in DNA damage that may either be left unrepaired or be repaired erroneously causing genotoxicity. &#xd;
The first objective of this study was to determine if exposure of fetal hematopoietic cells to p-benzoquinone, a known toxic metabolite of benzene, increased DNA recombination in the pKZ1 model of mutagenesis. A significant increase in recombination was observed following exposure to 25 μM and 50 μM p-benzoquinone for 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. A significant increase in recombination was also observed following exposure to 25 μM p-benzoquinone  for 30 min, 45 min, and 1 hour, but not 15 min as compared to vehicle alone. &#xd;
Secondly, this study determined if exposure of fetal hematopoietic cells to p-benzoquinone resulted in DNA damage using γ-H2A.X as a marker for DNA double strand breaks and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine as a marker of oxidative DNA damage. A significant increase in γ-H2A.X foci formation was observed following exposure to 25 μM p-benzoquinone for 30 min, 45 min and one hour. Exposure of fetal hematopoietic cells to 25 μM p-benzoquinone did not significantly increase oxidative DNA damage at any of the examined time points. &#xd;
The third objective of this study was to determine whether or not reactive oxygen species were involved in the observed increase in DNA damage and recombination. Exposure to 25 μM p-benzoquinone for 15 min and 30 min, but not 45 min or one hour, led to an increase in reactive oxygen species production as measured by 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2-7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence. Additionally, pretreatment with 400 U/mL PEG-catalase, an antioxidative enzyme, attenuated the increases in both DNA recombination and DNA double strand breaks as compared to treatment with p-benzoquinone alone. These studies indicate that p-benzoquinone is able to induce DNA damage and recombination in fetal hematopoieitic cells and that reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress may be important in the mechanism of toxicity.</description>

   <description>Present land vehicle positioning and navigation relies mostly on the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, in urban canyons, tunnels, and other GPS-denied environments, the GPS positioning solution may be interrupted or suffer from deterioration in accuracy due to satellite signal blockage, poor satellite geometry or multipath effects. In order to achieve continuous positioning services, GPS is augmented with complementary systems capable of providing additional sources of positioning information, like inertial navigation systems (INS).  Kalman filtering (KF) is traditionally used to provide integration of both INS and GPS utilizing linearized dynamic system and measurement models. Targeting low cost solution for land vehicles, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors are used. Due to the inherent errors of MEMS inertial sensors and their stochastic nature, which is difficult to model, KF has limited capabilities in providing accurate positioning in challenging GPS environments. &#xd;
This research aims at developing reliable integrated navigation system capable of demonstrating accurate positioning during long periods of challenging GPS environments. &#xd;
Towards achieving this goal, Mixture Particle filtering (MPF) is suggested in this research as a nonlinear filtering technique for INS/GPS integration to accommodate arbitrary inertial sensor characteristics, motion dynamics and noise distributions. Since PF can accommodate nonlinear models, this research develops total-state nonlinear system and measurement models without any linearization, thus enabling reliable integrated navigation and mitigating one of the major drawbacks of KF. Exploiting the capabilities of PF, Parallel Cascade Identification (PCI), which is a nonlinear system identification technique, is used to obtain efficient stochastic models for inertial sensors instead of the currently utilized linear models, which are not adequate for MEMS-based sensors. Moreover, this research proposes a method to update the stochastic bias drift of inertial sensors from GPS data when the GPS signal is adequately received. Furthermore, a technique for automatic detection of GPS degraded performance is developed and led to improving the performance in urban canyons. &#xd;
The performance is examined using several road test experiments conducted in downtown cores to verify the adequacy and the benefits of the methods suggested. The results obtained demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over conventional techniques.</description>

   <description>This research program examined the implications of level of representation for the belief change process.  Specifically, it investigated whether representational level of information underlying initial beliefs (individual vs. category) and disconfirming information (individual vs. category) influences the magnitude of belief change about a variety of objects.  Chapter 2 examined the hypotheses for beliefs about categories.  In 3 experiments, two key effects emerged.  A main effect of type of disconfirming information indicated that category-level disconfirming information produced more belief and attitude change than individual-level disconfirming information.  Also, a significant interaction between type of information at formation and disconfirmation indicated a relative matching effect, with category-level disconfirmation producing substantially more belief and attitude change than individual-level disconfirmation when initial beliefs were based on category-level information, but only slightly greater change when initial beliefs were based on individual-level information.  Chapter 3 examined the hypotheses for beliefs about individual instances.  A main effect of type of disconfirming information indicated that individual-level information produced more belief and attitude change than category-level information.  A main effect of type of formation revealed that category-level formation was more susceptible to persuasion than individual-level formation.  Also, a significant interaction between type of information at formation and disconfirmation indicated a relative matching effect, with individual-level disconfirmation producing substantially more change than category-level disconfirmation when initial beliefs were based on individual-level information, but no difference when initial beliefs were based on category-level information.</description>

   <description>Von Willebrand factor (VWF) promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular damage.  This function is directly related to the multimer size of VWF.  The VWF-specific metalloprotease ADAMTS13 decreases VWF multimer size by cleaving at Y1605-M1606 in the VWF A2 domain.&#xd;
This thesis examined the sensitivity of ADAMTS13 cleavage to mutagenesis of the full-length multimerized VWF substrate, and a small VWF A2 domain fragment, VWF115.  The ADAMTS13 cleavage site at Y1605-M1606 was mutated with the most severe loss of cleavage observed in Y1605A/M1606A.  In addition, 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms were examined, with D1472H, Q1571H, P1601T proteins all showing increased resistance to cleavage.  In contrast, G1643S has enhanced cleavage in the full-length VWF substrate but shows cleavage resistance in VWF115.  Three von Willebrand disease mutations were also examined.  In patients, R1597W has enhanced ADAMTS13 cleavage and a loss of high molecular weight multimers, while R1205H has enhanced protein clearance resulting in very low VWF levels and Y1584C patients have moderately low VWF levels.  R1597W has enhanced cleavage of full-length VWF, while a slight cleavage increase is observed in VWF115 for Y1584C, and no change is seen with R1205H.  &#xd;
The VWF mutations R1597W, Y1605A/M1606A, R1205H and Y1584C were further examined in the VWF knockout mouse using recombinant VWF protein infusion and hydrodynamic delivery of VWF cDNA to determine the effects these mutations produce on VWF antigen levels, multimer structure, secretion, clearance and function in a thrombotic injury model.  All four mutations had different pathogenic mechanisms.  R1597W showed accelerated clearance with loss of multimer structure, and greatly increased time to thrombotic occlusion.  Y1605A/M1606A showed accelerated clearance with normal or supranormal multimer structure, a loss of thrombotic occlusion but increased platelet accumulation.  Y1584C showed no change in protein clearance, with decreased VWF antigen level, reduced multimer structure, and reduced thrombotic potential.  R1205H demonstrated a synthetic defect in vitro and in vivo increased clearance with a decrease in VWF antigen levels and normal multimer structure and a variable thrombotic potential.  These results validate the use of the genetically-modified VWF knockout mouse model for evaluating the pathogenic mechanisms of putative VWF mutations.</description>

   <description>Pathogen evolution poses a significant challenge to public health, as efforts to control the spread of infectious diseases struggle to keep up with a shifting target.  To better understand this adaptive process, we turn to mathematical modelling.  Specifically, we use multi-type branching processes to describe a pathogen's stochastic spread among members of a host population or growth within a single host.  In each case, there is potential for new pathogen strains with different characteristics to arise through mutation.&#xd;
&#xd;
We first develop a specific model to study the emergence of a newly introduced infectious disease, where the pathogen must adapt to its new host or face extinction in this population.  In an extension of previous models, we separate the processes of host-to-host contacts and disease transmission, in order to consider each of their contributions in isolation.  We also allow for an arbitrary distribution of host contacts and arbitrary mutational pathways/rates among strains.  This framework enables us to assess the impact of these various factors on the chance that the process develops into a large-scale epidemic.  We obtain some intriguing results when interpreted in a biological context.&#xd;
&#xd;
Secondly, motivated by a desire to investigate the time course of pathogen evolutionary processes more closely, we derive some novel theoretical results for multi-type branching processes.  Specifically, we obtain equations for: (1) the distribution of waiting time for a particular type to arise; and (2) the distribution of population numbers over time, conditioned on a particular type not having yet appeared.  A few numerical examples scratch the surface of potential applications for these results, which we hope to develop further.</description>

   <description>Every day, 1500 women die in pregnancy or due to childbirth related complications worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of maternal mortality. Maternal health care use is critical in reducing maternal mortality worldwide. Cameroon has one of the highest maternal mortality rates worldwide (over 1000 deaths per 100,000 live births), but there is little knowledge about maternal health care use in the Far-North province. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of education, urban and rural residence, social networks, and cultural beliefs on the use of maternal health care use in the Far-North province. A maternal health questionnaire was completed by 110 Cameroonian women between the ages of 18-45. Participants were recruited door-to-door in the urban town of Maroua and rural village of Moutourwa in the Far-North province. Questionnaires assessed maternal health care history, social networks and demographics. Follow-up interviews were conducted with nine questionnaire participants to gain a greater understanding of how daily activities, food consumption and beliefs in the supernatural impact maternal health care use. Poisson regression analyses were used to determine the association among education, social network characteristics, urban and rural residence, and maternal health care service use in Maroua and Moutourwa. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews revealed themes of witchcraft, diet and social ties. Women in the rural sample had a greater risk of failing to seek prenatal consultations than women in the urban sample (RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.61-0.88).  When stratified by urban/rural location, education played a greater role in women’s use of prenatal services in Moutourwa (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.94) compared to Maroua (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.41-1.06). Qualitative analyses suggested that beliefs in witchcraft may deter women from speaking about pregnancy, and that mothers often believe that envious women can cause harm to mother and child through the use of witchcraft. Social network analysis revealed that women who belonged to a women’s organization were more like to use prenatal services (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.07-1.62). Both qualitative and quantitative findings have implications for maternal health interventions in the Far-North province of Cameroon.</description>

   <description>This thesis examined the effect of age on sexually offensive behaviour. Research has noted both an increase in the average age of incarcerated offenders and that a higher percentage of older offenders are incarcerated for sexual offences than are younger offenders. Older sexual offenders were initially compared with younger offenders on offender and offence characteristics and these analyses revealed that older sexual offenders had a higher incidence of male victims, a younger victim age, and more intra-familial victims. Phallometric assessments of all sexual offenders were then examined to see whether sexual deviance may account for the differences found between older and younger sexual offenders in victim age and gender. These analyses revealed that the oldest and youngest offenders were more deviant than middle-aged sexual offenders and that the sexual interests of older offenders were more commonly for females. Finally, all subjects were classified as either Historical (offending had ceased, without judicial intervention, at least 7 years prior to incarceration), First-time (incarcerated for a recent sexual offence and no history of sexual offending), or Recidivist sexual offenders (currently incarcerated for a sexual offence and have at least one prior sentencing date for any sexual offence): age accounted for 12% of the variance in categorisation. Fifty-five percent of the sexual offenders age 60 years or more were found to have committed and ceased their offending at least seven years prior to incarceration (i.e., were Historical offenders). The percentage of Recidivist offenders remained relatively consistent across age groups at about 20%. No difference was found in phallometrically assessed sexual deviance between the groups of older offenders.</description>

   <description>My dissertation, The Fringes of Immortality: A Goodly Company and Artistic Collaborations in Visionary Art 1880-1930 engages with fluctuating and often intermingling concepts of spirituality that took place in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century England. My discussion examines mediumistic visual representation inspired by interest in modern Spiritualism and modern Theosophy and takes the form of two case studies that focus on the work of visionary artists, Georgiana Houghton (1814-1884) and Ethel le Rossignol (1874 – 1970) both of whom believed that they were the recipients of information disclosed by disembodied entities. My study reconstructs possible meanings embedded in mediumistic images to disrupt longstanding artistic hierarchies that label visionary art as marginal.</description>

   <description>To date the majority of research in the area of cooperative communications focuses on maximizing throughput and reliability while assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) and synchronization. This thesis, seeks to address performance enhancement and system parameter estimation in cooperative networks while relaxing these idealized assumptions.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter 3 the thesis mainly focuses on training-based channel estimation in multi-relay cooperative networks. Channel estimators that are capable of determining the overall channel gains from source to destination antennas are derived. Next, a new low feedback and low complexity scheme is proposed that allows for the coherent combining of signals from multiple relays. Numerical and simulation results show that the combination of the proposed channel estimators and optimization algorithm result in significant performance gains.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
As communication systems are greatly affected by synchronization parameters, in Chapter 4 the thesis quantitatively analyzes the effects of timing and frequency offset on the performance of communications systems. The modified Cramer-Rao lower bound (MCRLB) undergoing functional transformation, is derived and applied to determine lower bounds on the estimation of signal pulse amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to timing offset and frequency offset, respectively. In addition, it is shown that estimation of timing and frequency offset can be decoupled in most practical settings.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
The distributed nature of cooperative relay networks may result in multiple timing and frequency offsets. Chapters 5 and 6 address multiple timing and frequency offset estimation using periodically inserted  training sequences in cooperative networks with maximum frequency reuse, i.e., space-division multiple access (SDMA) networks. New closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multiple timing and multiple frequency offset estimation for different cooperative protocols are derived. The CRLBs are then applied in a novel way to formulate training sequence design guidelines and determine the effect of network protocol and topology on synchronization parameter estimation. Next, computationally efficient estimators are proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed estimators outperform existing algorithms and reach or approach the CRLB at mid-to-high SNR. When applied to system compensation, simulation results show that application of the proposed estimators allow for synchronized cooperation amongst the nodes within the network.</description>

   <description>The ENE-trending Himalayan fold-thrust belt in Pakistan exhibits contrasting deformation styles both along and across the strike. The centrifuge modelling technique has been used to investigate these variations in structural style. For the purpose of modelling, the Salt Range and Potwar Plateau (SR/PP) stratigraphy has been grouped into four mechanical units. From bottom to top these are the Salt Range Formation, carapace unit (Cambrian-Eocene platform sequences), Rawalpindi Group, and Siwalik Group. These stratigraphic units of alternating competence, composed of thin layers of plasticine modelling clay and silicone putty, rest on a rigid base plate that represents the crystalline basement of the Indian plate. The models are built at a linear scale ratio of ~10-6 (1mm=1km) and deformed in a centrifuge at 4000g. The models are subjected to horizontal shortening by collapse and lateral spreading of a “hinterland wedge” which simulates overriding by the Himalayan orogen (above the Main Boundary Thrust).&#xd;
	The models of the central SR/PP show that the accretionary wedge develops a prominent culmination structure with fault-bend fold geometry over the frontal ramp, while the eastern SR/PP is more internally deformed by detachment folds, fault-propagation folds and pop-up and pop-down structures. Model results show that the transition from fault-bend fold to detachment-fold and fault-propagation-fold geometry in the prototype may take place in a transfer zone marked by an S-bend structure (Chambal Ridge and Jogi Tilla) at the surface and the lateral ramp in the subsurface. Moreover, the models suggest that an oblique ramp below the Kalabagh strike-slip connecting the two frontal ramps below the Surghar Range and the central Salt Range developed similar structure that can be observed in the prototype.&#xd;
	The model results also show that the Northern Potwar Deformed Zone may have been developed over ductile substrata due to the close similarity between the models and the prototype structures.&#xd;
	The deformation style in the models illustrates the importance of mechanical stratigraphic and basement ramp systems in the evolution and the structural styles of the SR/PP.</description>

   <description>Reliable and energy-efficient delivery of multimedia to mobile terminals in dynamic networks is a very challenging problem. In this thesis, we focus on a cooperative extension to the Digital Video Broadcasting – Handheld (DVB-H) standard, forming a cooperative broadcast network whereby terminal-to-terminal cooperation creates a distributed form of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) that supplements existing fixed network infrastructure.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, we develop a novel and computationally-efficient hierarchical Markov model that is able to accurately perform a cross-layer packet error mapping between the physical and transport layers of the DVB-H/IPDC (IP DataCast) protocol stack. We then construct a discrete-event simulator in MATLAB® that incorporates all of the necessary modules to conduct dynamic multiterminal network simulations. Next, the convergence of cooperative wireless communication, Raptor application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC) and Network Coding (NC) is examined. Originally proposed for broadcasting over the Internet, the application of Raptor codes to wireless cooperative communications networks has been limited to date, but they have been mandated for use in DVB-H. Network coding is used to reduce energy consumption by opportunistically recombining and rebroadcasting required combinations of packets. Two novel coding-enabled cooperative relaying protocols are developed for multicast and multiple unicast file distribution scenarios that are transparent, fully distributed, and backwards compatible with today's systems. Our protocols are able to exploit several different forms of diversity inherent to modern wireless networks, including spatial diversity, radio interface diversity, and symbol diversity. Extensive simulations show that our protocols simultaneously achieve breakthroughs in network energy efficiency and reliability for different terminal classes and densities, allowing greatly improved user experiences.</description>

   <description>As is predicted by Moore’s law, the transistors in microprocessors increase dramatically. In order to increase the power density of the microprocessors, the switching frequency of the Voltage Regulator (VR) is expected to increase to MHz level. However, the frequency dependent loss will increase proportionally. In order to meet requirements of the next-generation microprocessors, three new ideas are proposed in this thesis. &#xd;
The first contribution is a new bipolar Current Source Driver (CSD) for high frequency power MOSFET. The proposed CSD alleviates the gate current diversion problem of the existing CSDs by clamping the gate voltage to a flexible negative value during turn off transition. Therefore, the proposed driver turns off the MOSFET much faster. For buck converters with 12 V input at 1MHz switching frequency, the proposed driver improves the efficiency from 80.5% using the existing CSD to 82.5% at 1.2V/30A, and at 1.3V/30A output, from 82.5% to 83.9%.&#xd;
The second contribution is an accurate analytical loss model of a power MOSFET with a CSD. The current diversion problem that commonly exists in CSDs is investigated mathematically. The inductor value of the CSD is optimized to achieve minimum loss for the synchronous buck converter. The experimentally measured loss matches the calculated loss very well. The efficiency with the optimal CSD inductor is improved from 86.1% to 87.6% at 12V input, 1.3V/20A output in 1MHz switching frequency and from 82.4% to 84.0% at 1.3V/30A output.&#xd;
The third contribution is a new inductorless bipolar gate driver for control FET of buck converters. The most important advantage of the driver presented in this thesis is that it can turn off the power MOSFETs with a negative voltage, which will significantly reduce the turn off time and thus switching loss. In addition, the proposed bipolar gate driver has no inductor in the driver circuit; therefore it can be fully integrated into a chip. For buck converter with 5V input, 1.3V/25A load, in 2 MHz frequency, the proposed gate driver increases the efficiency from 75.8% to 77.8% and from 72.9% to 76.5% at 5V input, 1.3V/25A load, in 2.5 MHz switching frequency.</description>

   <description>ABSTRACT&#xd;
 Although sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear the brunt of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic and other sexually transmitted diseases (UNAIDS and WHO 2008; Fatusi and Wang 2009), very few studies in the region and for that matter Ghana have systematically and exclusively examined adolescent risky sexual behaviour in a manner that is theoretically consistent with the unique socio-cultural norms that govern sexuality in the society.  Given that involvement in risky sexual behaviour constitutes sexual deviance in the Ghanaian context, and from the ontological position that behaviour is a product of structure and human agency (Sewell 1992), this study extends the theories of social control (Hirschi 1969), power control (Hagan et al. 1979, 1985,1987, 2002; McCarthy et al. 1999) and rational choice (Cornish and Clarke 1986) in examining the predictors of risky sexual behavior among Ghanaian adolescents. Using the 2004 Ghana National Adolescent Survey data (N=3985), the study employs descriptive statistics, measures of association and complementary log-log regression models in predicting the likelihood of being sexually active before marriage, having more than one lifetime sexual partner and  condom use.&#xd;
Overall findings provide mixed support for the theoretical expectations. From the perspective of Hirschi’s control theory, the findings suggest among others that while some measures of conventional behaviour do not discourage premarital sex, they do so with respect to multiple sexual partnerships. A puzzle that needs further elaboration is the finding that highly educated adolescents who hold leadership positions have a higher significant taste for premarital sex and multiple sexual relations than their uneducated counterparts who are not leaders. Overall findings regarding the predictions of power control theory are consistent with the revised version offered by McCarthy and Colleagues (1999) and Hagan and colleagues (2002); that daughters in less patriarchal or matriarchal households are more likely than sons to have premarital sex and be in multiple sexual partnerships. Findings regarding the predictions of rational theory suggest a mixed rationality; condom use among adolescents in many instances is inconsistent with rational choice behaviour.  General and specific policy implications of the findings and direction for future research are also discussed.</description>

   <description>Ethnic media are powerful, and yet overlooked, spaces that immigrants and ethnic minorities establish to address issues that are not discussed in the dominant host society media. With the international migration of over five million people each year from majority to minority world nations, the emergence of ethnic media in countries around the world has increased significantly; however, relatively little is understood about the ways in which these spaces are used by immigrants and ethnic minorities. This thesis adds to a relatively new area of study in sociology, international development, and alternative media studies and investigates the ways in which Spanish-language ethnic media acts as a ‘Third Space’ where Hispanics disseminate, negotiate, (re)construct, and (re)articulate new notions of hybrid Hispanic-Canadian identity, an identity that operates against, and engages with, multiple-forms of difference and exclusion within Canada. A qualitative discourse analysis of 18 articles from Spanish-language ethnic media source El Correo Canadiense reveals the ways in which Hispanics in Canada negotiate hybridized identity by using ethnic media as a space to create a discourse that acts counter-hegemonically to Canadian mass-media. The findings also reveal the ways in which Hispanics are aiming to engage Canadians in the process of de- and re-constructing preconceived notions of what it means to “be Hispanic” in a transnational context.</description>

   <description>To date, most studies investigating the neural signature of pain in humans have focused on the brain, and those studies concerned with more caudal areas (such as the spinal cord (SC) or brainstem) have used only experimental models of pain.  The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the neural activity in the human brainstem and SC that is caused by a noxious mechanical stimulus and 2) to compare the neural response to noxious stimuli in healthy controls and a patient population diagnosed with peripheral neuropathic pain.  The SC and brainstem contain important synaptic points in several major pain pathways, and comparing the neural response between a control and patient population in these areas provides a more complete picture of healthy and pathological pain processing. &#xd;
Functional MRI studies of the SC and brainstem were carried out in healthy control subjects and patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in a 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio.  Subjects reported the point at which the pressure (in mmHg, applied to the wrist at the location of the median nerve) corresponded to a pain level of 2, 4, and 6 on a numerical 11 point pain scale.  Spatially normalized group results superimposed on anatomical templates in the axial orientation were visually identified using several stereotaxic atlases.&#xd;
We observed consistent signal intensity change in areas implicated in the transmission and modulation of pain in both control and CTS groups.  Both groups showed a similar decrease in signal change with increasing pain, as results at pain level 2 are predominantly positive signal change and at pain level 6 are typically negative.  This may indicate a reduction in the tonic inhibition of painful sensations.  Differences between groups were readily visible in regions anatomically consistent with the dorsal horn (DH) of the cervical SC, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), dorsolateral pontine tegmentum (DLPT), and midbrain periaqudectal gray (PAG).  The anatomical variation in signal change between groups may represent, for the first time, a visualization of the functional difference between healthy and pathological pain processing in the SC and brainstem using spinal fMRI.</description>

   <description>Decisions are based on multiple sources of information. For example, sensory information encoding environmental features may be combined with prior experience to bias judgements in visual behaviour. With the goal of characterizing the rules by which sensory and non-sensory variables combine to direct saccade selection processes monkeys were trained in a visual search task where the discriminability of a visual target and reward outcome for correct foveation varied systematically. Target discriminability was manipulated across three levels of luminance contrast while reward was manipulated by 'tagging' a spatial location such that target foveation at the tagged location yielded one, two or four times the liquid reward available at all other locations. The location and discriminability of the search target amongst seven distractor stimuli varied randomly from trial-to-trial while the magnitude of reward at the tagged location was fixed for each experimental block.&#xd;
Reward was found to have a large effect on search behaviour when target discriminability was low, but as discriminability increased, the effect of reward diminished. More specifically, reward increased choice probability and reduced the latency of saccades to target and distractor stimuli appearing in the tagged location. Together, the results suggested the effects of reward and luminance on saccade selection were dependent on one another.&#xd;
To characterize the nature of this interaction search psychophysics were couched in saccade selection processes using signal detection theory. Signals carrying target and distractor related information were modelled and taken to capture an actual discrimination process implemented by the brain. It was found that a response bias in saccade selection processes could largely reproduce monkey choice behaviour for both correct and incorrect trials.</description>

   <description>Freshwater systems in Canada are affected by a multitude of environmental stressors, including cultural eutrophication, introduction of non‐native species, and&#xd;
climate change. Multiple stressors can interact in unpredictable ways and generate&#xd;
novel ecological scenarios, thus creating challenges for lake management. Lake&#xd;
Simcoe is an example of an aquatic system impacted by multiple stressors, facing&#xd;
management challenges of deteriorating water quality and coldwater fisheries. In order to better understand stressor interactions and pre‐disturbance lake conditions, a long‐term perspective is necessary. Therefore, this study used paleolimnological techniques to assess changes in the water quality of Lake Simcoe over the past ca. 200 years. Sedimentary diatom assemblages were analyzed in 210Pb‐dated cores from five sites across the lake. Diatom assemblages recorded&#xd;
several pronounced and synchronous shifts over the last ca. 200 years. Modest lake‐wide shifts in diatom community composition occurred in the late‐1800’s and early‐1900’s, suggesting that early cultural disturbances, such as land clearance and canal construction, had relatively minor impacts on Lake Simcoe. However, starting in the 1930’s, agricultural and urban development intensified, as indicated by substantial increases in eutrophic taxa. The most pronounced lake‐wide shift in diatom assemblages occurred in the mid‐to‐late 1900’s, the taxonomic nature and timing of which strongly suggest a response to regional climate warming.&#xd;
Moreover, diatom compositional trends at all sites were significantly correlated with&#xd;
instrumental records of regional temperature and lake ice the last ca. 100 years. An&#xd;
additional and marked lake‐wide shift in diatom assemblages occurred in the mid-1990’s, coinciding with the invasion of dreissenid mussels. The combination of&#xd;
stressors acting concurrently on Lake Simcoe, as well as the lake’s distinct water&#xd;
chemistry and size, make it challenging to reconstruct single limnological variables&#xd;
(such as, total phosphorus) in this system. Nevertheless, overall patterns of diatom&#xd;
compositional changes from the five sites revealed the largest shifts occurred in the&#xd;
post‐1950 sediments and that change in lake‐water total phosphorus concentrations&#xd;
played a minor role. Our results imply that substantial changes in climate have&#xd;
amplified the effects of multiple stressors in this complex system.</description>

   <title>Psychache and Self-Harming Behaviour Among Men Who Are Homeless: a Test of Shneidman's Model</title>

   <description>Suicidal ideation among the homeless is 10 times greater than in the general population. Therefore, research helping mental health professionals better predict and potentially prevent suicide within the homeless population is an important societal focus. Various cognitive theories of depression and hopelessness have been proposed to explain suicidality, however, to date, none of these are able to fully explain the phenomenon. More recently, Shneidman has suggested a theory of psychache (i.e., unbearable psychological pain) to explain suicidality. Although this theory has been supported by investigations with university students, there has not been much research exploring psychache with populations at high risk for suicide. The current study attempts to assess Shneidman’s theory with a high risk population, namely the homeless. Ninety-seven men were recruited at homeless shelters and drop-in centres. Participants completed questionnaires assessing criterion measures of suicidality and psychological predictors of depression, hopelessness, life meaning, and psychache. Analyses revealed that psychache was the only variable with statistical predictive ability over and above the other three psychological variables in predicting suicide ideation, motivation, preparation, and attempt history. This finding indicates that psychache is a better predictor of suicidality than depression, hopelessness, and life meaning and supports Shneidman’s model of psychache as the most proximal cause of suicide. Results also indicate the potential use of a scale assessing psychache in mental health settings to predict those who are, and are not, at risk for suicide.</description>

   <title>The Impact of Agricultural Practices on Environmental Health: A Comparative Analysis in India</title>

   <description>There is growing evidence of multiple links between human health and the practice and products of agriculture through a complex set of factors including environmental change, exposure to a variety of natural and human-origin stressors, social position, changing behavior, occupation, and access to services. However, in policy initiatives, agriculture and health are often pursued in an unconnected manner. In India’s context, this has immense significance as nearly seventy percent of the total population is involved directly or indirectly with agriculture. The need to be aware of the health implications is therefore especially important.  &#xd;
The objective of the study was to examine the changing agricultural scenario in India and the consequences for health. A survey was carried out in 2009, in six villages in Karnataka state, India.  The data were collected by in-depth interviews, focus groups discussion, participant observation, laboratory tests (mercury and pesticide residues in rice, and nitrate and fluoride in groundwater) and secondary materials.  &#xd;
India has undergone a rapid transformation in agriculture and has achieved remarkable success in food production. The nation has followed the strategies of the popular ‘Green Revolution’, including promotion of high yielding seeds, monoculture, extensive use of agrochemicals and large scale management of land and water resources. &#xd;
Modern agriculture has improved the socioeconomic and nutritional status of the population. However, the traditional coarse cereals and pulses have been replaced by mill-polished less nutritious rice. Extensive mechanization of agriculture activities has meant reduced physical stress, but fatal accidents and injuries have increased considerably. Along with already existing malnutrition, overweight/obesity has emerged as a new public health challenge. The changing landscape with much standing water and extensive use of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer has augmented the mosquito population, resulting in greater incidence of vector borne diseases such as malaria and Japanese encephalitis. Agrochemicals, fertilizers and pesticides, are applied in excess and often in an irrational manner, without following any norms. Drinking water is contaminated with nitrate and fluoride. Rice samples contain pesticide residues and mercury.</description>

   <description>Spreading depression (SD) is an interesting and important phenomenon due to its role in mammalian pathologies such as migraine, seizures, and stroke.  Until recently investigations of the mechanisms involved in SD have mostly utilized mammalian cortical tissue, however in my thesis I demonstrated that SD-like events occur in the CNS of an invertebrate model, Locusta migratoria.  Locusts enter comas in response to stress during which neural and muscular systems shut down until the stress is removed, and this is believed to be an adaptive strategy to survive extreme environmental conditions.  Using the ventilatory central pattern generator (vCPG) as a model circuit I was able to show that stress-induced arrest of vCPG function is associated with SD-like events in the locust metathoracic ganglion (MTG) that closely resemble cortical SD (CSD) in many respects, including mechanism of induction, extracellular potassium ion ([K+]o) changes, and propagation in areas equivalent to mammalian grey matter.  SD-like events in the locust were characterized as abrupt [K+]o increases associated with electrical activity silence in the locust CNS that propagate to other areas within the MTG.  In this thesis I described the generation of comas by several cellular stressors (hyperthermia, metabolic stressors, Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition, and KCl) and the associated SD-like events in the locust, provide a description of the similarities to CSD, and show how they can be manipulated both by stress preconditioning and pharmacologically.  I showed that hyperthermic vCPG arrest can be preconditioned by prior heat shock (HS) treatment and induced-thermotolerance was associated with an increased rate of [K+]o clearance associated with vCPG recovery that was not linked to changes in ATP levels or total Na+/K+-ATPase activity.  I also provided evidence for the involvement of the stress-sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in stress-induced comas in the locust.  AMPK activation was linked to a switch in motor pattern behavior following recovery from anoxia-induced vCPG arrest and exacerbated repetitive SD-like events induced by ouabain (Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor).  I suggested that locust SD-like events are adaptive by conserving energy and preventing cellular damage, and I provided a model for the mechanism of SD onset and recovery in the locust nervous system.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we build upon the work of Plate by advancing the theory and utility of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRRs). HRRs are a type of linear, associative memory developed by Plate and are an implementation of Hinton’s reduced representations. HRRs and HRR-like representations have been used to model human memory, to model understanding analogies, and to model the semantics of natural language. However, in previous research, HRRs are restricted to storing and retrieving vectors of random numbers, limiting both the ability of HRRs to model human performance in detail, and the potential applications of HRRs. We delve into the theory of HRRs and develop techniques to store and retrieve images, or other kinds of structured data, in an HRR. We also investigate square matrix representations as an alternative to HRRs, and use iterative training algorithms to improve HRR performance. This work provides a foundation for cognitive modellers and computer scientists to explore new applications of HRRs.</description>

   <description>Many fish species respond to cold temperatures by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis, reflected in an increase in the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX). COX is composed of 13 subunits, 3 encoded by mtDNA and 10 encoded by nuclear genes. I used thermal acclimation/winter acclimatization to explore how fish muscle controls the synthesis of COX. In this study, I used real-time PCR to measure mRNA levels for the 10 nuclear-encoded COX genes and several transcriptional regulators. I compared the thermal response of two cyprinid species, the tropical zebrafish (Danio rerio, acclimated to 11 and 30°C) and the temperate redbelly dace (Phoxinus eos, winter and summer acclimatized). I hypothesized that (i) there would be an increase in COX activity in the cold- versus warm-acclimated fish and (ii) changes in COX activity would be paralleled in the transcript levels of the nuclear-encoded COX subunits as well as the master-regulators and transcription factors of mitochondrial biogenesis. &#xd;
Zebrafish COX activity did not change in the cold but the transcript levels of some subunits decreased up to 70%. Redbelly dace COX activity was 2.9-fold higher in winter fish and though nuclear-encoded subunits had higher transcript levels the increases did not parallel enzyme activity, ranging from 1.7- to 21-fold higher in winter. There also did not appear to be parallel patterns in mRNA for the transcriptional regulators.  In zebrafish, when COX activity did not change, there was no significant change in PGC-1α mRNA.  In redbelly dace, when COX activity was 2.9-fold higher, PGC-1α mRNA was 6.3-fold higher. These observations suggest that coordination of COX subunit expression is imperfect, implying that subsets of these genes are more important in determining the COX activity. I assert that those genes that are most likely the candidates for regulating COX activity are COX4 and COX5A as they are the first regulatory subunits incorporated into the holoenzyme. Though arguments can also be made for COX5B, 6A and 7B based on the parallels between changes in enzyme activity and transcript abundance as well as the position in which they are assembled into the enzyme complex.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research program was to explore how the personality traits of extraversion and self-monitoring may impact a persuasive appeal within the framework of the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion. Using both descriptive and injunctive normative messages, I hypothesized that under conditions of low elaboration, when one is unable and unmotivated to process a message; those high in the traits of extraversion and self-monitoring would be more compliant to a persuasive appeal that utilized a descriptive normative message. Further, I hypothesized that under conditions of low elaboration, those low in the aforementioned traits would be more compliant to an appeal utilizing injunctive normative messages. I did not expect to find any differences relating to personality under conditions of high elaboration. In order to examine these expected interactions, I pre-tested messages to ensure they were adequately descriptive or injunctive (study one) and then presented these messages to participants who had previously completed measures of extraversion and self-monitoring (study two). In study one I successfully created both injunctive and descriptive normative messages that were adequately divergent. In study two, I manipulated elaboration by giving participants in the low elaboration condition a distracter task while they were reading the message, and by reducing personal relevance of the message, whereas for those in the high elaboration condition, there were no distractions and personal relevance was high. Contrary to predictions, I did not find the expected three-way interactions between extraversion, message type, and elaboration or self-monitoring, message type, and elaboration. However, I did find evidence supporting a two-way interaction between message type and elaboration, suggesting that descriptive messages are more persuasive under conditions of low elaboration whereas injunctive messages are more persuasive under conditions of high elaboration. Explanation for these findings, as well as implications of the findings both theoretical and practical, will be discussed in terms of the persuasion literature.</description>

   <description>Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone malignancy with neither reliable prognostic or predictive biomarkers nor drugs for targeted therapy. It is the most common malignant tumour of bone, predominantly occurring in adolescents. Currently, the mainstay of treatment is surgical resection in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. Understanding of the genetic basis of osteosarcoma has been impeded by the complex and heterogeneous nature of genome-wide rearrangements in tumour cells. It has been shown that the genetic complexity arises as a result of unusually high levels of chromosomal instability (CIN), which causes numerous copy number changes. This extensive CIN leads to genomic gains or amplifications of various chromosomal regions including, frequently, a portion of chromosome 6 between cytobands 6p12-p21. The high frequency of these particular rearrangements implies they could confer selective advantage to tumour cells during osteosarcoma development. In the present study, we examined the relationship between genomic gain of chromosome 6p12-p21, including increased copy number of the osteogenic transcription factor gene RUNX2, and measures of CIN as well as tumour response to chemotherapy in a retrospective cohort of osteosarcoma patients. The present study demonstrates: 1) Gain and amplification events involving chromosome 6p12-p21 have been frequently reported in a variety of cancer types in addition to osteosarcoma. 2) Clusters of segmental duplications greater than 10,000 base pairs in length flank the commonly amplified region of 6p12-p21, and cytobands 6p12 and 6p21.3 are enriched in highly similar segmental duplications. 3) Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) confirmed array comparative genomic hybridisation-detected copy number changes in E2F3, PIM1, and RUNX2 and identified trends between increased RUNX2 copy number and poor tumour response to chemotherapy, and between increased E2F3 copy number and CIN. 4) Interphase FISH for chromosome-specific enumeration identified a high rate of aneuploidy in the sample set. 5) Moderate to strong RUNX2 immunoreactivity, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, was present throughout the samples, and a trend was observed between high RUNX2 levels and poor tumour response to chemotherapy. Our study thus identified potential roles for genomic gain of chromosome 6p12-p21 and amplification-related overexpression of RUNX2 in the development of osteosarcoma and in resistance to chemotherapy.</description>

   <description>Bullying is a serious and common problem in Canadian schools. Despite three decades of comprehensive research on this complex behavioural problem, much remains to be understood. The general purpose of the current studies was to comprehensively examine bullying from an ecological perspective and the roles that school climate and peer processes play in the development of this behaviour, in order to elucidate mechanisms for intervention. The first study was a multilevel analysis of the relative importance of individual and school characteristics in bullying in Canadian schools. In a second study, we examined the experiences of peers who witnessed bullying incidents in order to investigate whether there were factors that predicted a decrease in witness behaviour. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of a peer-mediated bullying prevention program using a pre/post controlled study design. We assessed the impact of this program on behaviour, socioemotional skills, and school climate. Overall, our findings were consistent with the view that bullying is a problem of destructive relationships that needs to be addressed from this perspective. We found that relationships among peers and adults at school contributed to the overall climate of a school, and an overall climate of peer connectedness was associated with less bullying. Provictim attitudes and emotional supportiveness predicted change in bystander behaviour, although the nature of these changes differed for boys and girls. Finally, we did not find evidence of an effect of the prevention program on bullying behaviour or school climate, and we discuss the lack of findings with regard to program implementation and future program evaluations.&#xd;
	This research has implications for understanding the influence of peers and peer group processes on the development of bullying. It is our hope that these studies will contribute important information to the bullying literature to expand our knowledge of the ways in which school climate and peers affect and are affected by bullying and victimization. In turn, this information may help to inform intervention efforts and encourage future program evaluation research and research examining the mechanisms by which we might mobilize peers to behave in ways that could help to stop bullying and victimization.</description>

   <description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common soil organism as well as an opportunistic human pathogen. Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections is often complicated by innate resistance to a variety of antimicrobials mediated by multidrug efflux systems. The MexAB-OprM efflux system is constitutively expressed in wildtype strains and contributes to innate antimicrobial resistance, while hyperexpression of the system results in acquired high levels of resistance. MexAB-OprM is hyperexpressed in nalC mutants containing mutations in the gene encoding NalC, a repressor of a two-gene operon, PA3720-armR. armR encodes a protein modulator of MexR, a repressor of mexAB-oprM expression. Previous reports showed that genes encoding the MexAB-OprM efflux system are upregulated in response to pentachlorophenol (PCP), a phenolic compound that is a common environmental contaminant. Induction of mexAB-oprM and PA3720-armR by PCP was confirmed using RT-PCR, and MexAB-OprM was shown to be involved in PCP resistance. An electromobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that PCP interacts with NalC, interfering with its binding to the PA3720-armR promoter region and thereby promoting PA3720-armR expression.  Nonetheless, the increase in ArmR did not drive mexAB-oprM expression suggesting that PCP induction of this efflux operon occurred via a different mechanism. A direct PCP-MexR interaction could not be demonstrated using an EMSA. PCP exposure did, however, reduce expression of nalD, encoding a second repressor of mexAB-oprM, which might explain the PCP-promoted increase in mexAB-oprM expression. PCP is unlikely to be the intended inducer(s)/substrate(s) for this system but probably resembles these. Several compounds related to PCP were tested for an interaction with NalC but all were negative in EMSAs. Plants produce a variety of phenolic compounds, which are often antimicrobial and, so, root extracts of various plants were tested for an ability to interact with NalC and interfere with promoter binding.  Extracts from Boehmeria tricuspis, Uncaria tomentosa and Ixiolirion tataricum were shown to interact with NalC, suggesting that plant compounds may be the intended inducers/substrates for NalC/MexAB-OprM.</description>

   <description>Inuit estimates of polar bear characteristics from tracks could complement ongoing capture-mark-recapture methods to frequently monitor polar bear populations in response to climate-induced habitat changes. Before the inclusion of these Inuit track estimates, they need to be evaluated for reliability and accuracy. Building on previous work, which showed increased reliability among active Inuit hunters, this thesis research reports i) reliability in estimates of sex, age, size, and age of track of a larger number of tracks by a larger number of Inuit hunters; ii) preliminary accuracy assessments of sex and size estimates; iii) semi-structured interviews with Inuit hunters regarding their polar bear tracking experience and techniques; and iv) potential relations between Inuit hunting experience and reliability and accuracy in diagnosing tracks. The Inuit hunters were reliable and consistent as a group in making estimates of sex (α=0.74 and mean corrected item-total correlation=0.45), age (α=0.81 and mean corrected item-total correlation=0.63), and size (α=0.91 and mean corrected item-total correlation=0.73), as well as age of track estimates with the exclusion of a single participant (α=0.85 and mean corrected item-total correlation=0.63). Preliminary accuracy assessments suggest Inuit hunters are generally accurate in their estimates of sex (mean 65.28% agreement with genetic sex estimates) and potentially size from tracks, warranting further efforts to determine accuracy in these estimates as well as age and age of track. Semi-structured, open-ended interviews with each hunter revealed they use similar tracking techniques, which may explain their high agreement in making estimates. In addition, Inuit tracking experience and the use of particular tracking methods may correlate with individual reliability and accuracy in track diagnoses. These results suggest the information that Inuit hunters provide may inform any tracking-based polar bear survey.</description>

   <description>The law of bone remodeling, commonly referred to as Wolff's Law, asserts that the internal trabecular bone adapts to external loadings, reorienting with the principal stress trajectories to maximize mechanical efficiency, thereby creating a naturally optimum structure. The primary objective of the research was to utilize an advanced structural optimization algorithm, called design space optimization (DSO), to create a numerical framework to perform a micro-level three-dimensional finite element bone remodeling simulation on the human proximal femur and analyze the results to determine the validity of Wolff's hypothesis. DSO optimizes the layout of material by iteratively distributing it into the areas of highest loading, while simultaneously changing the design domain to increase computational efficiency. The result is a "fully stressed" structure with minimized compliance and increased stiffness. The large-scale computational simulation utilized a 175µm mesh resolution and the routine daily loading activities of walking and stair climbing. The resulting anisotropic human trabecular architecture was compared to both Wolff's trajectory hypothesis and natural femur data from the literature using a variety of visualization techniques, including radiography and computed tomography (CT). The remodeling predictions qualitatively revealed several anisotropic trabecular regions comparable to the natural human femurs. Quantitatively, the various regional bone volume fractions from the computational results were consistent with CT analyses. The strain energy proceeded to become more uniform during optimization; implying increased mechanical efficiency was achieved. The realistic simulated trabecular geometry suggests that the DSO method can accurately predict three-dimensional bone adaptation due to mechanical loading and that the proximal femur is an optimum structure as Wolff hypothesized.&#xd;
&#xd;
The secondary objective was to revise this computational framework to perform the first in-silico hip replacement considering micro-level bone remodeling. Two different commercially available hip prostheses were quantitatively analyzed using stress, strain energy, and bone mineral density as performance criteria and qualitatively visualized using the techniques above. Several important factors for stable fixation, determined from clinical evaluations, were evident: high levels of proximal bone loss, distal bone growth, and medial densification. The results suggest the DSO method can be utilized for comparative prosthetic implant stem design, uniquely considering post-operation bone remodeling as a design criterion.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research was to examine how attachment style and rejection interact to influence female body image. I hypothesized that women who were high in attachment anxiety would report more negative self-evaluations than women who were low in attachment anxiety. I also hypothesized that this main effect would be qualified by a significant interaction between attachment anxiety and rejection, such that highly anxious women who were rejected would report even more negative self-evaluations than highly anxious women who were not rejected. In Study One, I found that higher levels of attachment anxiety were associated with lower self-evaluations but, contrary to expectations, attachment avoidance and rejection condition interacted to influence self-evaluations. At low levels of avoidance, women in the rejection condition reported significantly higher levels of appearance state self-esteem, body esteem, and trait self-esteem than women in the non-rejection condition. However, at high levels of avoidance, women in the rejection condition reported lower levels of these three constructs than women in the non-rejection condition, although this finding was statistically significant only for appearance state self-esteem. In Study Two, my goal was to replicate and extend these unexpected findings by examining perceived partner regard and public self-awareness as potential mediators of the interaction between avoidance and rejection on self-evaluations. Although a main effect of attachment anxiety was revealed for each of the dependent measures, contrary to Study One and my hypotheses, attachment avoidance and rejection did not interact to influence any of the self-evaluation measures and, thus, no mediational analyses were performed. Importantly, I discovered that even though participants’ mean ratings of their body esteem did not change following the rejection manipulation, the degree to which highly anxious women in the rejection condition associated how they felt about their appearance and how they thought their partner perceived them was significantly stronger than that of highly anxious women in the non-rejection condition and low anxious women in either condition. Explanations for the findings found in Study One and Study Two are discussed and the implications of these findings for future research and promoting a positive body image are considered.</description>

   <description>Background: The central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the most debilitating aspect of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Affected children exhibit numerous cognitive and behavioural deficits which can severely affect quality of life. As the diagnosis of FASDs often requires specially trained physicians, there is a need for sensitive and specific tools that screen PAE-related CNS dysfunction in order to identify individuals who require further consultation. Additionally, objective measures of intervention end-points are critical to assess potential treatments for this population. As saccadic eye movement behaviours reflect the integrity of multiple brain structures, a battery of oculomotor tasks may serve both these functions. This study sought to test the hypothesis that oculomotor performance in FASD would differ from typically developing children and would allow the objective measure of cognitive improvements resulting from a strength-based motor skills intervention. Methods: A cohort of 31 children with FASD, and 31 age- and sex-matched controls completed prosaccade, antisaccade, delayed memory-guided sequential (DMS) and predictive eye movement tasks. Additionally, a selection of these children were involved in an intervention study and therefore tested on three separate occasions using the eye movement tasks and computerized neuropsychological tests. Results: Compared to controls, children with FASDs elicited increased direction and anticipatory errors in the antisaccade task, increased timing and sequence errors in the DMS task, and increased anticipatory and decreased express saccades in the predictive task. The FASD group also exhibited an increase in the error of saccade trajectories in the pro- and antisaccade tasks, in addition to increased velocities of&#xd;
visually-guided saccades in the predictive task. Furthermore, those involved in the intervention study improved in measures of response inhibition in the DMS task. Conclusion: This study indicates that frontostriatal and cerebellar dysfunction can be assessed in children with FASDs using a battery of eye movement tasks. In addition, children involved in the strength-based motor skills intervention improved in the ability to perform complex oculomotor tasks. These findings suggest that select eye movement tasks may be utilized to identify CNS dysfunction in FASD and to measure cognitive improvements resulting from behavioural interventions.</description>

   <description>Integrating research on attachment anxiety, rejection, self-regulation and health behaviours, I investigated the interactive effect of attachment anxiety and relationship threat on self-regulation. I hypothesized that self-regulation would decrease following a threat to one’s romantic relationship. Moreover, I expected that this association would be moderated by attachment anxiety, such that it would be stronger for individuals high, relative to low, in attachment anxiety. In three laboratory experiments, relationship threat was made salient and participants were given the opportunity to consume snack foods. In a non-experimental diary study, participants’ relationship stress and health behaviours were measured for a period of seven days.&#xd;
	The results for Study 1 indicated that women, but not men, high in attachment anxiety experienced self-regulation failure (i.e., ate more jelly beans) when relationship threat was elicited. In contrast, although women low in attachment anxiety demonstrated the same pattern, it was attenuated and non-significant. &#xd;
Study 2 was designed to replicate the findings from Study 1 using a more powerful relationship threat manipulation that I hoped would cause a consistent pattern for both genders. Contrary to hypotheses, both men and women high in attachment anxiety experienced increased self-regulation (i.e., ate fewer brownie pieces) in the experimental, compared to the control, condition. &#xd;
One important difference between these studies was the presence of the partner in the laboratory in Study 2. I hypothesized that this might account for the discrepant findings between these studies and designed Study 3 accordingly, such that participants either participated alone or with their partners. Unfortunately, this study did not reconcile the discrepancies between the first two studies:  Only a main effect of relationship threat on number of jelly beans consumed emerged.  &#xd;
For Study 4, individuals completed questionnaires for seven days that assessed how fluctuations in relationship stress interacted with attachment anxiety to affect health outcomes. Analyses of the same-day and lagged effects demonstrated several significant interactions consistent with the hypotheses.&#xd;
These four studies provide initial evidence for the interactive effect between attachment anxiety and relationship stress on health outcomes and well-being. Although the findings were inconsistent, two of the studies provided support for my hypotheses.</description>

   <description>The objectives of the present body of work were 1) to evaluate the Personal Lift-Assist Device (PLAD) in terms of its effect on lifting technique, interjoint coordination, and whether sex modulates these effects and 2) to explore the use of principal component analysis (PCA) as a method to investigate lifting waveforms. Thirty participants (15M, 15F) completed a freestyle, symmetrical lifting protocol during which three-dimensional kinematics of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar and thoracic spine were collected using a two-camera Optotrak 3020 system. There were four testing conditions: a) with and b) without wearing the PLAD; and c) 0% load and d) 10% of maximum back strength load. All data were evaluated using PCA. In the first analysis, the relationship between the PLAD and lifting technique under a loaded condition was explored. Results showed that 8 PCs were significantly different between the PLAD/No PLAD conditions yet there were no significant effects of sex on any of the PCs. It was concluded that wearing the PLAD encourages a lifting technique that is reflective of a squat lift, independent of sex. In the second analysis, the PLAD’s effect on interjoint coordination patterns under both loaded and unloaded conditions was examined using the relative phase angle (RPA). It was found that there were no significant differences between device, sex, or load conditions on any of the PCs retained in the model. A novel approach to enhance interpretability of PCs was developed during this study. Finally, when the PLAD was not worn, male and female differences were further investigated under loaded and unloaded conditions. It was determined that when the load is individualized to personal strength characteristics, sex differences in lifting technique are negligible. This is a contradictory finding from previous research. Overall, the major contributions of this research are: support for the use of the PLAD in industry; the recommendation that load be selected based on individual strength characteristics for lifting research experimental design; the use of PCA as a method to effectively evaluate lifting waveforms; and the development of a novel approach to aid in the interpretation of principal components.</description>

   <description>Previous studies have suggested the importance of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) in modulating drug seeking behaviors.  With heavy reciprocal projections from the BST to various dopamine rich areas (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens shell (NAc shell), retrorubral nucleus (RR), periaqueductal gray region (PAG)), BST dopamine receptors are indeed an important part of the highly integrated reward system and thus possess sensitivity to pharmacological rewards.  In the present study, the effects of bilateral intracranial injections of the D1- dopamine receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 microgram total bilateral dose) , the D2-dopamine receptor antagonist Sulpiride (3.2 microgram total bilateral dose), and D2- dopamine receptor agonist Quinpirole (3.0 microgram total bilateral dose), administered into the BST immediately prior to self-administration sessions, were examined in both sucrose (180-minute sessions) and cocaine (270-minute sessions) self-administering rats.  Injections of SCH-23390 (3.2 &amp; 6.4 microgram) to the cocaine group significantly reduced the final ratio of operant lever responding (0.75 mg/kg/i.v. injection; progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement (PR); timeout 20 sec); there was no effect of SCH-23390 in the sucrose group.  Injections of Sulpiride (3.2 microgram) to the cocaine group produced a significant attenuation in the final ratio of operant lever pressing, with no effect in the sucrose group.  Injections of Quinpirole, however, resulted in no alternations in both the cocaine and sucrose self-administration group.  These results suggest that both D1 and D2 dopamine receptor activation is occurring in the reinforcement of cocaine, with the possibility that D2 receptors are not as highly activated as the D1 receptors.  This conclusion further implicates the complexity of the neurobiological factors involved in drug addiction and the essential role of the BST in dopamine-facilitated reward reinforcement.</description>

   <description>I conducted four studies that develop and test a safety-specific model of exit, voice, patience, and neglect (EVPN) in the context of young workers’ reactions to declining safety conditions (Hirschman, 1970). In the face of hazardous working conditions, contemplating exiting (i.e., quitting the job) or voicing concerns about the risks (e.g., reporting a safety issue to a supervisor) are proactive responses. Conversely, neglecting safety concerns (i.e., ignoring personal safety in the face of danger) is a passive response. Workers may also choose patience (i.e., taking a wait-and-see approach) about concerns. &#xd;
	In total, 833 young people participated in four studies. Manuscript 1 (Chapter 5) is a focus group study that explores the types, frequency, temporal patterns, and consequences of the safety-related EVPN behaviours. The results showed (1) most participants favoured patience if and when they have concerns about workplace safety; (2) voice is reserved for serious safety concerns; and (3) exit is very uncommon and only used as a last resort. &#xd;
	Manuscript 2 (Chapter 6) describes the development of age-appropriate measures for general turnover intentions (i.e., exit), and safety-specific voice, patience, and neglect. The reliability, dimensionality, and validity of these scales are demonstrated over three studies.&#xd;
	Manuscript 3 (Chapter 7) used an experimental scenario approach in which safety conditions (high vs. low), financial reasons for working (high vs. low), and being injured (injured vs. not injured) are manipulated. The role of participant gender (male vs. female) was also examined. Participants assigned to the injury condition were more likely to exercise patience than those assigned to the non-injury condition. Low quality safety conditions were associated with higher turnover intentions. Finally, females reported higher voice than males. &#xd;
	Finally, Manuscript 4 (Chapter 8) reports on findings from a short-term longitudinal design meant to replicate and extend the results from the previous studies. Support for Hirschman’s loyalty proposition was also found. Specifically, felt responsibility for improving safety was found to moderate the relationship between organizational loyalty and both exit and voice.&#xd;
	The final chapter integrates these findings and discusses future research directions as well as implications for public policy, management practice, and theory.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Education) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-19 20:41:24.683</description>
   <description>Educational programs are typically guided by complex overarching aims that demark broad expectations for program graduates. In practice, these aims tend to become operationalized into specific, measurable learning objectives, which form the basis for assessment of student learning. Research suggests that this practice limits the accuracy and validity of overarching program aims and may result in misrepresentation of student competency. This limitation is in part due to the use of traditional assumptions of measurement that operate on a validity of correspondence that is linear, singular, and value-free. Accordingly, through this research, I construct a framework for understanding the validity of complex program aims by drawing on contemporary validity theory.&#xd;
Specifically, I use an interpretive, argument-based approach to validation to connect, analyse, and evaluate multiple interpretations towards a program’s overarching aims. Methodologically, I draw on hermeneutics to collect validity evidence for the construction of a multiple perspective validity argument. I contend that this framework for validation results in a complex articulation of the quality of program coherence between program users’ interpretations of complex aims and their practices. In this dissertation, I apply this validation framework to one teacher education program and its aim to promote inclusivity as a fundamental pedagogical principle. In doing so, I provide a complex description of the multiple ways inclusivity is interpreted by diverse program users (i.e., senior program administrators, faculty members, and teacher candidates) and through various program structures. Thus in addition to articulating a validity argument for one teacher education program, this work also contributes a framework of inclusivity towards broader educational discourse.</description>

   <description>In the developed world, the principal sources of morbidity and mortality are diseases of lifestyle, and one of the central goals of health promotion is the encouragement of risk-reducing behaviour. In a series of 3 studies, the present program of research examined the effect of self-affirmation and manipulated perceived efficacy on perceptions of efficacy, risk perception, and risk-reducing behavioural intentions. Participants were undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to a self-affirmation manipulation (self-affirmation versus no self-affirmation) and a perceived efficacy manipulation (high versus low versus baseline), followed by exposure to negative health risk information (risk of a heart attack or colorectal cancer). Across the 3 studies, factor analyses indicated 3 distinct categories of risk-reducing intentions: intentions associated with maintaining an active lifestyle, seeking medical advice and assessment, and maintaining a healthy diet. There was little evidence that self-affirmation affected efficacy, risk, or intentions. Structural equation modeling and meta-analytic analyses suggested the presence of a suppression effect for risk perception: a manipulation designed to increase perceived efficacy had direct positive effects on risk, but also had indirect negative effects on risk, with measured efficacy acting as a mediator. These analyses also showed that the 3 categories of behavioural intentions had distinct (and often different) antecedents. These results highlight the complexity of variables in health risk behaviour. Implications and future directions are discussed.</description>

   <description>In this qualitative study the experience of a young woman with an intellectual disability (ID) auditing a university course was explored from multiple perspectives. This young woman audited a curriculum course in a one-year, after-degree Teacher Education program at an Ontario university. The purpose of this study was to explore the meaning of this experience for the student, her classmates, and her curriculum course instructor. Data were collected at the University from observations of the curriculum course and from interviews with the participants. As well, observations were made at a community-based program that prepares adults with ID to take part in inclusive post-secondary education (IPSE) to provide a description of the preparation of these adults for university experiences. The focal participant attended this program for four months prior to auditing the University course.&#xd;
Data from interviews with the classmates and the course instructor elicited both positive and negative responses concerning their experiences in the inclusive class. Positive responses include seeing inclusion in practice and coming to know the focal participant on a personal level. Negative responses concern whether or not a curriculum class was the right fit for the focal participant. Interview data from the focal participant show that she overwhelmingly enjoyed her experience auditing the Education course. She saw the interaction with same-age peers as a chance to socialize with these peers and as an opportunity to learn about being independent.</description>

   <title>Deconstructing Attitude Strength: Understanding the Cognitive Structures and Subjective Beliefs Related to Attitudes</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-23 10:51:04.52</description>
   <description>The effects of various antecedents to cognitive elaboration on the structural properties and subjective beliefs related to attitude strength were examined in 2 experiments.  Participants read vaccine-related information and received arguments for and against the implementation of a vaccine program for a fictitious virus.  Their ability and motivation to attend to the central merits of the arguments were manipulated using a 2 (high vs. low ability) x 2 (high vs. low motivation) between-participants design, and the effects on 21 attitude- and attitude-strength related outcome variables were observed.  Ability was determined by time pressure (Study 1) and distraction (Study 2), and motivation was determined by personal responsibility (Study 1) and involvement (Study 2).  A meta-analysis of the experiments revealed that whereas none of the structural properties related to attitude strength were affected, all of the subjective beliefs were affected, and ability and motivation had differential effects.  Ability primarily affected beliefs that reflect the validity and consistency of the knowledge base as well as the intensity of the attitude; motivation affected beliefs that reflect the intensity of the attitude and the functional relevance of the attitude object.  As well, ability and motivation interacted on a number of variables, with a consistent pattern emerging: High (vs. low) motivation was associated with increased perceived knowledge, clarity, and accessibility, and decreased ambivalence under low ability; the opposite pattern occurred under high ability.  Overall, this research represents the first systematic and the most comprehensive attempt to determine which strength dimensions are affected by variations in elaboration.  It also provides evidence that the subjective beliefs might operate independent of the structural properties, that various antecedents to elaboration might not be directly interchangeable, and that ability and motivation might have different strength-related outcomes.  Finally, this research demonstrated that when used in tandem, the effects of ability and motivation do not necessarily operate in an additive fashion, but can interact in some previously unforeseen ways.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-23 13:35:36.534</description>
   <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a widely used technique for non-invasive brain mapping, and methods have now evolved to allow fMRI of the spinal cord (spinal fMRI) as well.  With the goal of improving spinal fMRI, the studies presented herein have investigated potential sources of noise that might limit its sensitivity and reliability.  For example, multiple studies had previously suggested that the majority of structured physiological noise, such as spinal cord motion and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, appeared to be synchronous with cardiac pulsations.  Therefore, we measured cardiac-related spinal cord motion at various levels along the cord, finding that peak anterior-posterior spinal cord displacements often exceeded 0.5 mm throughout the cervical and upper-thoracic regions.  On the other hand, we found that cord motion throughout the lower-thoracic, lumbar and sacral levels was consistently small.  Based on these findings, we concluded that cord motion is likely to be a significant source of error in spinal fMRI throughout superior, but not inferior, cord regions. &#xd;
&#xd;
Since all motion measurements were acquired at 24 phases of the cardiac cycle, this also allowed us to determine, and subsequently model, the main components of cardiac-related spinal cord motion.  By then including these terms in a general linear model (GLM) analysis and reanalyzing 100 previously acquired cervical spinal fMRI datasets, we showed that the sensitivity and specificity were improved by 15-20 % and 5-6 %, respectively, over previous spinal fMRI methods.  To push the limits of these improvements, we then carried out the first event-related spinal fMRI study, consistently observing spinal cord responses to 1 s applications of 22 °C thermal stimulation.  By measuring these responses at many different phases, we were also able, for the first time, to characterize the impulse response function of SEEP (signal enhancement by extravascular water protons) contrast in the human cervical spinal cord.</description>

   <title>Relay Selection in Two-Hop Wireless Communications</title>

   <subject>Relay selection, two-hop communication, unidirectional, bidirectional, PNC, ANC, TDBC, OSS</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-23 15:29:50.026</description>
   <description>Relay communication has been shown to be effective to&#xd;
extend service coverage and mitigate channel impairments. This thesis focuses on&#xd;
relay selection (RS) of both unidirectional and bidirectional&#xd;
relay networks employing the amplify-and-forward (AF)&#xd;
and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents four works on RS in two-hop relay networks.&#xd;
In the first work, we study opportunistic relaying (OR) and&#xd;
selection cooperation (SC) in&#xd;
DF-based unidirectional multi-antennas relay networks.&#xd;
We first propose two joint relay-and-antenna selection&#xd;
schemes which combine OR and SC, respectively,&#xd;
with transmit antenna selection.&#xd;
For each joint selection scheme,&#xd;
a single best transmit antenna at the source,&#xd;
a single best relay,&#xd;
and a single best transmit antenna at this selected relay&#xd;
are jointly determined.&#xd;
Then we derive the outage probabilities,&#xd;
and show that the two schemes achieve the same outage performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second work, we study RS with&#xd;
the physical-layer network coding (PNC)&#xd;
in DF-based bidirectional relay networks.&#xd;
By modifying the well-known SC and OR,&#xd;
we first propose two RS schemes for the PNC network:&#xd;
SC-PNC and OR-PNC.&#xd;
Then we derive the outage probability&#xd;
and diversity order of the SC-PNC.&#xd;
Finally, we show that the OR-PNC achieves the same outage performance&#xd;
as the SC-PNC.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In the third work, we study RS with&#xd;
the analog network coding (ANC) and time division broadcast (TDBC),&#xd;
in AF-based bidirectional relay networks.&#xd;
We first consider RS schemes&#xd;
for the ANC and TDBC protocols&#xd;
based on a max-min criterion.&#xd;
Then we derive outage probabilities for the ANC and TDBC protocols.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In the fourth work, we study joint relay-and-source selection&#xd;
in an AF-based bidirectional relay network.&#xd;
Since RS and opportunistic source selection (OSS) could individually improve&#xd;
performance of relay networks,&#xd;
we propose a joint RS-OSS protocol.&#xd;
In this network, a best source is selected to transmit data&#xd;
to the other source with the help of a selected best relay.&#xd;
Then, we derive the outage probability and&#xd;
average bit-error rate.&#xd;
&#xd;
The considered RS schemes and obtained outage probability expressions will help the design of two-hop wireless communications in determining the system parameters such as relay location and the transmission power at each terminal.</description>

   <description>Total Hip Replacement (THR) has become a common surgical procedure in recent years, due to the increase in the aging population with hip osteoarthritis. Identifying the proper orientation of the pelvis is a critical step in accurate placement of the femur prosthesis in the acetabulum in THR. The general approach to localize the orientation of the pelvic anatomical coordinate system (PaCS) is to use intra-operative X-ray fluoroscopy in a specialized interventional radiology facility to guide the procedure. Employing intra-operative ultrasound (US) imaging fused with pre-operative CT scan or fluoroscopy imaging was proposed to eliminate the ionizing radiation of intra-operative X-ray to the patient and the need for radiology facilities in the OR.  However, the use of pre-operative imaging exposes patients to accumulative ionizing radiation which is desirable to be eliminated.&#xd;
 &#xd;
In this thesis, I propose to replace pre-operative imaging with a statistical shape model (SSM) of the pelvis which is constructed from CT images of patients. An automatic deformable registration of a pelvis anatomical shape model to a sparse set of 2D ultrasound images of the pelvis is presented in order to localize the PaCS. In this registration technique, a set of 2D slices are extracted from the pelvic shape model, based on the approximate location and orientation of a corresponding 2D ultrasound image. The comparison of the shape model slices and ultrasound images is made possible by using an ultrasound simulation technique and a correlation-based similarity metric. During the registration, an instance of the shape model is generated that best matches the ultrasound data. I demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach in localizing the PaCS on four patient phantoms and on data from two male human cadavers. None of the test data sets were included in the SSM generation.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-24 16:49:22.151</description>
   <description>The focus of this study is to explore what I, a Canadian educator, can learn about development deriving from my relationship with five Burkinabé street youth and from participating in a development project. Furthermore, this thesis explores the following questions: What are the possibilities and challenges associated with Participatory Development according to my experiences during my project? What can be learned from my development experiences? How can my international “development” experience influence my practice in the Canadian classroom? Two conceptual frameworks have guided this thesis: Narrative Inquiry and Participatory Development. The latter was selected for two reasons; firstly, the non-profit development organization I represented and worked with in Kingston, Ontario strongly believe in working with partner organizations in a participatory fashion. Secondly, I was personally interested in exploring whether a participatory approach could be successful in eliminating the power relationships sometimes present in development work. The former was chosen because it offered the most flexibility in terms of writing design and supported the three levels of narrative: experience, telling, and interpreting (Polkinghorne, 1988). As such, this thesis is a self-study narrative that enabled me to present my story as a young teacher, volunteer and researcher. My research has been shaped by (1) my experiences, (2) stories of others, (3) my experiences with individuals who have impacted my journey, (4) my relationships with five Burkinabé street youth, and (5) finally my learning that took place before, during and after my three month volunteer project. ii My experience of volunteering in Burkina Faso has taught me that development is a complex field that should not be as easily accessible to those whom are inexperienced and unprepared to handle the challenges inherent in development work. My self-study cautions new researchers doing fieldwork abroad, volunteers and non-profit organizations of the possible negative effects such as harming the host community/culture, experiencing culture shock or reverse culture shock and practicing volunteer tourism while claiming to do development.</description>

   <description>Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flows and equations have been the focus of a large number of researchers. Here a study of such flows and equations is presented. &#xd;
The first chapter contains a brief introduction to Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) along with some other definitions. A detailed example on the application of HAM is also included to further clarify the scheme of the method.&#xd;
Second chapter deals with a study of symmetry transforms for ideal MHD equations which comes from the work of Bogoyavlenskij [18]. Different properties of such transforms are also discussed which include the infinite-dimensional Abelian group formed by the symmetries, breaking of geometrical symmetries and ball lightning phenomenon.&#xd;
Next we review the recent work of Bogoyavlenskij [19] to present the derivation of exact plasma equilibria with axial and helical symmetries. Asymptotic and periodic nature of the obtained solutions has also been studied.&#xd;
The last chapter comprises of my own results and it deals with finding solution to unsteady thin film flow of a magnetohydrodynamic fluid. Governing equations of such flows are often very complex and nonlinear. So, we use Homotopy Analysis Method to find exact solution to such nonlinear equations.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we study Sobolev gradient flows for Perona-Malik style energy functionals and generalizations thereof. We begin with first order isotropic flows which are shown to be regularizations of the heat equation. We show that these flows are well-posed in the forward and reverse directions which yields an effective linear sharpening algorithm. We furthermore establish a number of maximum principles for the forward flow and show that edges are preserved for a finite period of time. We then go on to study isotropic Sobolev gradient flows with respect to higher order Sobolev metrics. As the Sobolev order is increased, we observe an increasing reluctance to destroy fine details and texture. We then consider Sobolev gradient flows for non-linear anisotropic diffusion functionals of arbitrary order. We establish existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial data for a broad class of such equations. The well-posedness of these new anisotropic gradient flows opens the door to a wide variety of sharpening and diffusion techniques which were previously impossible under L2 gradient descent. We show how one can easily use this framework to design an anisotropic sharpening algorithm which can sharpen image features while suppressing noise. We compare our sharpening algorithm to the well-known shock filter and show that Sobolev sharpening produces natural looking images without the "staircasing" artifacts that plague the shock filter.</description>

   <description>Biphasic systems such as two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) have been used to alleviate biological inhibition by sequestering inhibitory compounds within an immiscible phase.  The use of solid polymer beads as this auxiliary phase provides a fully biocompatible alternative to commonly used yet potentially toxic organic solvents.  This work focused on the application of solid-liquid TPPBs to the bioproduction of the pharmaceutical precursor L-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC), a biotransformation which suffers from substrate (benzaldehyde), product (PAC), and by-product (benzyl alcohol) inhibition, and simple strategies to improve TPPB performance in general.&#xd;
A wide range of commercially available, biocompatible, and non-bioavailable polymers were screened for their affinity for benzaldehyde, PAC, and benzyl alcohol.  Hytrel G3548L demonstrated the highest affinity for all three target compounds and was subsequently used in solid-liquid TPPBs for PAC production.  Using 15% v/v polymer beads, PAC concentration was increased by 104% and benzyl alcohol concentration decreased by 38% over the single phase control. The delivery of benzaldehyde from polymer beads demonstrated only a 6-8% reduction in mass productivity with improved operational simplicity and reduced operator intervention.    &#xd;
The final objective of this work was to independently investigate various aspects of the aqueous phase composition and determine how each factor affects the partition coefficient of benzaldehyde in Hytrel G3548L.  Temperature and pH were observed to have no significant effect on partitioning.  Salt and glucose additions increased the partition coefficient by 173% and 30% respectively compared to RO water, while ethanol was found to decrease the partition coefficient from 44 (±1.6) to 1 (±0.3).  These findings may be applied to solid-liquid TPPBs to increase or decrease partitioning as required, leading to improved bioreactor performance.&#xd;
This work has successfully shown that with careful polymer selection, solid-liquid TPPBs can be used to increase the productivity of a biotransformation without the associated biocompatibility problems that have sometimes been observed with organic solvents.  The delivery of inhibitory substrate from the polymer phase was successfully accomplished, which is a novel demonstration in the field of solid-liquid TPPBs for biocatalysis.  Finally this work contributes a range of simple strategies to improve the partitioning behavior of solid-liquid TPPBs using the aqueous phase composition.</description>

   <description>Energy efficiency and network lifetime are key factors in characterizing wireless sensor networks due to the nodes having a finite and exhaustible source of energy. Due to the nodes limited energy, it is vital to have the node functioning for as long as possible otherwise it will render the technology futile. Transmission is the most energy consuming activity a node undertakes, therefore by decreasing the number of unnecessary transmissions, the energy consumption in the nodes decreases significantly. In order to reduce unnecessary transmissions, energy-efficient data dissemination techniques have been developed to deliver the data using the minimum number of necessary transmissions. The topic of this thesis is to develop a routing protocol that will extend the network lifetime by introducing cognition to routing. Cognitive routing is an approach to make nodes more intelligent by utilizing information from the lower layers and network in order to make more informant decisions. Data from the physical layer can relay important information about the state of the node, its neighbors, and the surrounding environment hence enabling the node to make energy-efficient and aware decisions. The routing protocol formulates an energy profile, a channel profile and a traffic profile in order to make adapted and intelligent decisions. Diversity routing is used to increase the reliability of transmissions in the network to reduce unnecessary transmissions as communication is the primary reason for energy consumption in wireless sensor networks. Combining these two approaches in one protocol allows for cognitive routing to operate based on energy constraints obtained from the lower levels hence optimizing the process yielding a longer network lifetime.</description>

   <description>Timely and spatially controlled endosomal trafficking and signaling is important for cell proliferation, directed cell migration, and cell invasion, which are frequently misregulated in cancer cells.  Cdc42-interacting protein-4 (CIP4) family adaptors promote endocytosis by inducing membrane invaginations via their Fer/CIP4 Homology-Bin/Amphyphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) domains, coupled with activation of the actin assembly machinery to promote vesicle fusion or motility.  My thesis focuses on defining the roles of CIP4, and a related protein, Transducer of Cdc42-mediated actin assembly-1 (Toca-1), in regulating Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) endocytosis, EGFR trafficking, cancer cell motility, and invasion.  In Chapter 2, I show that CIP4 and Toca-1 localize to early endosomes and promote EGFR trafficking from early endosomes to lysosomes for degradation, thus limiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling from early endosomes and proliferation of A431 carcinoma cells.  In Chapter 3, I provide novel evidence that depletion of Toca-1 results in defects in actin-based lamellipodial protrusions that are required for cell motility.  The cause of these defects may relate to altered recruitment of the Abelson-interactor-1 and its effector Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein to the lamellipodia in A431 cells depleted of Toca-1.  Results in Chapter 4 identify CIP4 as a negative regulator of breast cancer invasiveness downstream of Src protein-tyrosine kinase.  Src is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading structures called invadopodia that function in tissue invasion by cancer cells.  I found that CIP4 is a Src substrate that localizes to Src-induced invadopodia in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.  Interestingly, depletion of CIP4 results in enhanced ECM degradation, invadopodia formation, and invasiveness compared to control cells.  Thus, CIP4 and Toca-1 are multifaceted regulators of EGFR downregulation, EGF-induced cell motility, and Src-induced cell invasion.</description>

   <description>Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), or recurrent vulvar pain, is a prevalent condition&#xd;
among women. Although research has documented that PVD is associated with sexual&#xd;
problems, little research has systematically examined the intimate relationships of affected women. The general purpose of the current studies was to comprehensively&#xd;
examine sexual and relationship functioning among women with provoked vulvar pain.&#xd;
In order to do so, three related studies were conducted. The first study was a systematic review of the literature examining sexual and relationship satisfaction among PVD-affected&#xd;
women. Secondly, an online study was conducted using both standardized and&#xd;
qualitative measures to examine sexual, relationship, and psychological functioning&#xd;
among women with self-reported provoked vulvar pain and their male partners in&#xd;
comparison to controls. The online study also examined associations between affected&#xd;
women’s pain and women and partner’s functioning. The final study was a laboratory-based study that included women with PVD and matched control women and examined psychosexual functioning, including sexual and relationship satisfaction, and vestibular pain sensitivity; additionally, this study examined potential associations between women’s pain and self-reported functioning. Overall, these studies suggest that women with provoked vulvar pain experience decreased sexual functioning, sexual satisfaction, and psychological functioning in comparison to control women, and that pain-affected partners experience decreased sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction. The findings also indicate that some aspects of women’s pain experiences are related to their self-reported functioning and to that of their partners. This research has implications for&#xd;
understanding the potential sexual and relationship consequences associated with&#xd;
provoked vulvar pain, and is among the first to comprehensively examine affected&#xd;
partners’ functioning. It is hoped that these studies will contribute novel information to the vulvar pain literature, and that they will encourage future research examining sexual and relationship functioning among women with provoked vulvar pain and their partners.</description>

   <description>Clinical and preclinical research both indicate that early life adversities alter sensitivity to stress well into adulthood. Although clinical research identifies infancy, childhood, and adolescence as periods of heightened vulnerability, the majority of preclinical research experiments have examined the enduring impact of stressors delivered either prenatally or prior to weaning.  It was recently shown that exposing rats to intermittent stressors across the childhood/ adolescent period (PD 21-51) increased their behavioural and endocrine sensitivity to stress in adulthood. The purpose of the current project was to determine whether specific developmental periods are differentially sensitive to the lasting effects of intermittent stress. Male and female Long-Evans rats were exposed to three stressors (foot shock, elevated platform exposure, and cold water emersion) two times each, randomly over a twelve day period (childhood: PD 22-33 vs. adolescence: PD 35-46). Age-matched controls were briefly handled on each of the stressor application days. After completion of the stress exposure period, rats were left undisturbed for 27 days and behavioural testing commenced in adulthood.  Intermittent physical stress exposure during the childhood period increased anxiety-like behaviours in adulthood, as indexed by the Elevated-Plus Maze (EPM) and Shock Probe Burying Test (SPBT).   This also increased depression-like behaviour in adult male rats and decreased depression-like behaviour in adult female rats, as indexed by the Forced Swim Test (FST).  Intermittent physical stress exposure in the adolescent period increased open-arm activity, increased burying behaviour and increased immobility in the forced swim test, in both male and female rats.  Stress during either developmental period, failed to alter corticosterone (CORT) reactivity to restraint stress in adulthood.  Thus, it appears that the long lasting behavioural impact of early-life adversity can vary, according to the developmental period the stressors are experienced in, but this is further modified by sex and the type of test used to evaluate adult behaviour.</description>

   <title>Determining the Modulus of Intact Bovine Vertebral Cancellous Bone Tissue: Development and Validation of a Protocol</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-26 00:03:49.732</description>
   <description>Cancellous, or spongy, bone accounts for nearly 80% of the human skeleton’s internal surface area, despite comprising only 20% of its mass.  It is made up of a network of struts and plates that provide lightweight internal support to mammalian bones.  In addition, it often serves as the main interface between the skeletal system and implanted devices such as artificial hips, knees, and fracture fixation devices.  However, hip arthroplasties can succumb to loosening of the implant due to bone resorption, which is thought to be caused by a mismatch in both apparent and real stiffness between the device and the surrounding bone.  Many studies have attempted to determine the Young’s modulus of cancellous bone tissue, but the results are far from being in agreement.  Reported values range from less than 1 to nearly 20 GPa.  In addition, the small size of trabeculae has made dissection and testing a challenge.&#xd;
	In this thesis, whole individual trabeculae from a bovine lumbar spine were tested in three-point bending to determine their Young’s modulus using custom-made equipment to fit a miniature single-axis testing device.  The device itself was validated by testing materials with moduli ranging from 1 to 200 GPa.  The structure of the cancellous bone and the morphology of the individual struts were determined using micro x-ray computed tomography (µXCT).  Individual struts were manually isolated from slices made using a low-speed saw under constant lubrication and measured under a stereomicroscope.  Samples exhibiting no machined surfaces (and thus deemed to be whole, or “uncut”) were compared to struts that had been cut by the saw during sectioning.&#xd;
	Validation showed that the system was capable of determining the modulus of materials that were approximately five times stiffer than the expected cancellous modulus (copper, at 115 GPa) to within 10% of published values.  This gave confidence in the results for bone.  The modulus of the “uncut” specimens was found to be 15.28 ± 2.26 GPa, while the “cut” specimens had a significantly lower modulus (p = 1.665 × 10-6) at 2.63 ± 2.65 GPa.  The lower modulus for “uncut” specimens may be due to microdamage that occurred during machining and dissection.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to discover and describe how two teachers effectively interacted with and differentiated instruction for students who displayed off-task behaviors in the classroom. Through the use of observations and interviews, I described how two teachers interacted with students who display high-frequency, low-intensity off-task behaviors; identified strategies these effective teachers used in dealing with these behaviors; described where the teachers’ behaviours, attitudes, and practices lay on the Preventive-Restorative (P-R) continuum of beliefs of inclusion; and discovered how the teachers’ self-efficacy is related to P-R orientations and effective teaching behaviors. &#xd;
The teachers were chosen based on their principals’ belief in their effectiveness in dealing with off-task behaviours. The principal and the teacher collaboratively chose the students who displayed off-task behaviours on a consistent basis. The findings of this study confirm the existing research; the two teachers, whose beliefs lay on the preventive end of the continuum of beliefs of inclusion, tended to use effective teaching practices; these beliefs and practices were related to the teachers’ beliefs of their capability in being able to effectively help their students; these two teachers, who have preventive beliefs and high efficacy beliefs, interact in ways that are beneficial to students who display off-task behaviours. &#xd;
The common themes that emerged through the analysis of both teachers’ data included the belief in and the use of differentiated instruction; the belief in the importance of having a positive classroom environment; the practice of ensuring student engagement; the teachers’ use of their knowledge about students; and the teachers’ beliefs about inclusion and efficacy beliefs. The diversity of the teachers and their classroom contexts resulted in some differences in the findings, which are also discussed.                          This research extends previous research about teachers’ beliefs about inclusion and efficacy beliefs to teaching practices used for and interactions with students who display off-task behaviours. The findings also extend previous research revealing a relationship between teachers’ beliefs about inclusion and the belief in the importance of creating a positive classroom environment. Implications of this research for practice and for future research are discussed.</description>

   <title>Evaluating the Impact of Climate Change Mitigation Strategies on Water Distribution System Design and Optimization</title>

   <description>In response to growing environmental concerns, policy makers in Canada have been developing climate change mitigation strategies that will enable Canada to meet medium and long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets. The water industry is energy- and carbon-intensive, thus the magnitude and long-term uncertainty of proposed carbon mitigation policies could have implications for water distribution system capital planning decisions that are made today. &#xd;
&#xd;
The intent of this thesis was to examine the implications of discount rate and carbon price uncertainty on cost, energy use and GHG emissions in the design/optimization of the Amherstview water distribution system in Loyalist Township, Ontario, Canada. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is coupled with the hydraulic solver EPANET2 in a single-objective optimization approach to identify network expansion designs that minimize total cost as the sum of: i) capital cost of installing new and parallel pipes and of cleaning and lining existing pipes; ii) operation cost of electricity for pumping water; and iii) carbon cost levied on electricity used for pumping water. The Amherstview system was optimized for a range of discount rates and carbon prices reflective of possible climate change mitigation strategies in Canada over the next 50 years. The problem formulation framework was developed according to a “real-world” municipal approach to water distribution system design and expansion. Decision variables such as pipe sizes are restricted to “real-world” commercially-available pipe diameters and parameter values are chosen according to engineering judgment and best-estimates. Parameter uncertainty is characterized by sensitivity analysis rather than the more computationally-demanding and data-intensive Monte Carlo simulation method.  The impact of pipe material selection on energy use and GHG emissions was investigated for polyvinyl chloride and cement-mortar lined ductile iron pipes. Results from this first-ever study indicate that the discount rate and carbon prices investigated had no significant influence on energy use and GHG emissions in the Amherstview system. Pipe material selection was also found to minimally affect the amount of GHG emitted in the Amherstview system.</description>

   <description>The current study investigates the relationship between analyst coverage and the moments of the return distribution.  Results are presented to support a time-varying pattern in the premiums associated with the higher moments of returns, particularly for the fourth moment of the distribution.  In addition, evidence is presented to suggest that there exists some ex-post and ex-ante forecasting ability based on the use of the higher moments of the return distribution as stock selection criteria.  In the second half of the study, results show that as the number of analysts following a firm increases, the third and fourth moments of the return distribution are impacted, with the former being reduced and the latter increased.  In addition, the initiation and discontinuation of analyst coverage are both found to be related to the higher moments of the return distribution.  The initiation of analyst coverage is associated with a reduction in skewness and an increase in excess kurtosis, while the discontinuation of coverage results in an increase in both of the higher moments of the distribution.  &#xd;
Taken together, the results of the two main questions in the current research study suggest that investors seeking higher distributional moments of returns may favor neglected firms over their followed counterparts, particularly in periods of heightened market volatility.  In addition, the results show that the two main competing hypotheses concerning the causes of non-normal security returns, namely firm information structure and security liquidity, both impact the higher moments of the return distribution.</description>

   <description>We present the first fully self-consistent, axisymmetric, dynamical model of the Andromeda galaxy (M31).  We constrain the physical parameters of the model with datasets on all radial scales: the bulge projected velocity dispersion, rotation curve, surface brightness profile, and the kinematics of globular clusters and satellite galaxies.  Combining these highly heterogeneous datasets into a single self-consistent analysis is natural in the framework of Bayesian inference.  Using a geometric argument, we also infer the three-dimensional velocity of M31 relative to the Milky Way.  From this orbit, we constrain the total mass of the Local Group by the ``timing argument''.  We find that the virial mass of M31 is $M_\mathrm{M31,vir} = 5.0^{+2.2}_{-1.7} \times 10^{12} \, M_\odot$ and the mass of the Local Group is $M_\mathrm{LG} = 8.8^{+8.0}_{-4.2} \times 10^{12} \, M_\odot$.  We conclude that the large uncertainties in our results are due primarily to the small sample size at large radii and that either a significantly larger sample or unjustifiably informative priors are necessary to improve the constraint.</description>

   <description>The electrical heterogeneity of the heart has been recognized as an important feature of normal cardiac function.  In cardiac myocytes, considerable electrophysiological differences in sodium channel currents have been reported between the atria and the ventricle.  Although, these differences have been primarily attributed to heterogeneous populations of Na+ channel isoforms within cardiac tissue, the link between these electrophysiological differences and certain cardiac pathologies has been loosely studied.  We sought to further elucidate the electrophysiological differences between the atria and the ventricle by characterizing INa in both cell types.  For these studies we had initially predicted the atria to contain a greater density of TTX-sensitive Na+ channel isoforms compared to that of the ventricle.  We used two well-known Na+ channel blockers: lidocaine (100 μM, 30 μM, 10 μM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX; 10 nM, 30 nM).  In addition, we also applied hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 100 μM, 30 μM, 10 μM) to atrial myocytes, which served as our pathological model for reactive oxygen species (ROS).  When we applied lidocaine to cardiac myocytes, we observed an overall mixed response in both cell types.  Specifically, we noted the most significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in peak INa, shifts in steady-state inactivation, and impaired recovery from fast inactivation in the presence of 100 μM lidocaine.  Given the non-uniform responses to lidocaine, our results support the theory that tissue specific populations of Na+ channel isoforms exist within cardiac myocytes.  In order to further elucidate the electrophysiological differences between the ventricle and the atria, we applied TTX, which is selective for TTX-sensitive Na+ currents.  Our results indicated no overall significant differences between the ventricle and the atria, suggesting that the population of TTX-sensitive Na+ channel isoforms within the atria specifically, may not be pharmacologically detectable.  Finally, our results also demonstrated that the atria are sensitive to ROS, where H2O2 significantly prolonged the action potential duration (APD) in atrial myocytes.  Our results also suggest that, in addition to INa, other ion channels may be mediating a component of the H2O2-induced prolongation of the APD in adult rat atrial myocytes.</description>

   <description>In this study, I investigate the institutional relationship between heritage, living history, and memory in Canadian living history museums, specifically, historic homes that represent Victorian material culture in the contemporary multicultural context.  I consider how historic homes in Canada have been preserved, restored, and constructed as evidentiary – as artefacts for use as civic instruments in the practice and performance of history.  My study connects the artefact to the performance of history at three living history museums which, like so many heritage sites in Canada, taken together deploy “founding nations” mythologies: Dundurn Castle in Hamilton and William Lyon Mackenzie House in Toronto, Ontario, and the Sir George-Étienne Cartier National Historic Site of Canada in Montreal, Quebec. To make this connection, I examine the “Victorian Christmas” program offered annually at each site; the Christmas programs are examples of “living history” in action – period rooms are decorated to represent a historical seasonal celebration, interpreters discuss traditions and activities associated with the occasion, and visitors sing carols and eat festive treats. I explore the implications of institutional interpretations of the past that privilege bi-national mythologies, despite the fact that each site I have chosen is located in the midst of a large urban centre’s ethnically diverse (multicultural) population – and, in the case of the Cartier Houses in Montreal, a constituency informed by contemporary souverainiste issues.</description>

   <description>Dans la littérature africaine et antillaise la question des relations de pouvoir est omniprésente. Elle est repérable depuis la littérature des indépendances, qui explorait les enjeux socioculturels lorsque les pays africains et antillais se dégageaient de l’emprise des pouvoirs coloniaux, jusqu'à celle d’aujourd’hui où les pays développés et ceux en voie de développement négocient toujours leur relation avec ces anciens pouvoirs colonisateurs. Alors que la femme noire est la première à ressentir les effets de pouvoir, car doublement marginalisée de ce dernier en tant que femme et noire, elle a historiquement été muselée par un canon littéraire qui ne lui laissait pas de place. Par l’intermédiaire d’une analyse des relations de pouvoir entre la femme noire et l’institution patriarcale, nous dévoilons les tactiques que ces femmes utilisent afin de supporter les systèmes aliénants dans lesquels elles se trouvent : 1) la réhabilitation de leur sexualité 2) la solidarité féminine 3) l’éducation formelle 4) le pouvoir surnaturel et 5) la remise en question des valeurs occidentales. &#xd;
	A cette fin, nous nous appuyons sur la théorie de l’oppositionnalité de Ross Chambers, mettant en valeur la mise au point sur les modes d’opposition (subtiles) plutôt que sur les modes de résistance (évidents). En récupérant sa sexualité, et une relation saine avec son homologue masculin noir, la femme noire retrouve sa subjectivité et une nouvelle source d’espoir. La solidarité féminine, quant à elle, s’avère nécessaire pour faire reculer l’idéologie et les pratiques qui vont à l’encontre de la femme ; sans elle, la femme n’a pas de moyen de sortir de la domination patriarcale. D’après les romans étudiés, l’éducation formelle est une solution sûre pour la femme de sortir de la misère et de rôles qui limitent ses horizons. Le pouvoir surnaturel, peu étudié jusqu’ici, est un recours problématique pour la femme mais peut la mener à un sens de liberté. Enfin, par la remise en question de valeurs et de jugements occidentaux, les femmes noires assument leur propre image et présentent une version corrective des faits, ce qui est en soi subversif.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to explore specific types of informal social relationships- family or friends formed in nursing homes and to determine how each affected the health of the elderly, especially in the areas of loneliness and depression. A face-to-face interview using four structured questionnaires was adopted for this descriptive study design. &#xd;
      The main outcomes of depression and loneliness were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and University of California Loneliness Scale (UCLA). The Duke Inventory Social Support Scale, measuring both family and friend support separately, measured predictor variables of family and friend support. Eighty-seven percent of participants completed the study.&#xd;
        The results indicate that friend support was a more reliable factor for predicting the levels of loneliness and depression after controlling for all other co-founding variables. The findings will help nurses and other health care personnel when assessing the social support networks, beliefs and preferences of older adults to plan and implement the best practices. This will also offer health care facilities suggested ways to reduce or combat loneliness and depression among the elderly people.</description>

   <description>Transient uterine Natural Killer (uNK) cells are the predominant leukocytes of early gestational human and murine uteri. Murine uNK cells promote changes in endometrial structure including initiation of perivascular smooth muscle reduction in spiral arteries. Less is known about human uNK cell functions due to sampling constraints. Xenogeneic engraftment of human lymphocyte progenitors to alymphoid mice has been useful in understanding human lymphocyte functions in vivo. Irradiation of recipients is required to create a niche for successful humanization of the mice but renders recipient mice sterile. The goal of my thesis was to develop a protocol enabling engraftment of human hematopoietic stem cells in alymphoid mice that would permit differentiation of functional human uNK cells. I then planned to evaluate human uNK cell functions and their regulation in vivo.  Neonatal Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice, which lack T cells, B cells and NK cells were preconditioned with 5-fluorouracil and inoculated with syngeneic mouse bone marrow cells. As adults, inoculated female mice conceived and differentiated functional mouse uNK cells. In contrast, neonatally-preconditioned Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice inoculated with human cord blood hematopoietic stem cells conceived but differentiated non-lymphoid cells in sites normally occupied by uNK cells. Weekly injections of human IL-15, which is required for NK cell differentiation, proliferation and survival, did not promote uNK cell differentiation. Rather, treatment with IL-15 altered gestational uteri, even in mice receiving neither preconditioning nor hematopoietic stem cells. I was successful in developing a protocol that enables hematopoietic stem cell engraftment in neonatal mice without compromising mouse fertility. However, this model is apparently not suitable for in vivo studies of human uNK cell functions.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-30 22:44:44.501</description>
   <description>A series of medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (MCL-PHAs) with enriched 3-hydroxynonanoate (HN) content (up to 95.8 mol% compared to 68.6 mol% without acrylic acid) or 3-hydroxyoctanoate (HO) content (up to 97.5 mol% compared to 88.0 mol% without acrylic acid) was produced in continuous culture by co-feeding fatty acid and glucose plus inhibiting fatty acid β-oxidation using acrylic acid. Using a similar feeding strategy in fed-batch fermentation, similar monomeric compositions but a higher biomass concentration and PHA content could be obtained. However, at a lower growth rate (0.15 h-1 vs. 0.25 h-1), the biomass concentration and PHA content could be greatly enhanced from 17.1 to 71.4 g L-1 and from 64.4 to 75.5%, respectively, while the HN content decreased slightly from 92.2 to 88.9 mol%. PHAs produced under acrylic acid inhibition possessed improved physical properties including a higher melting point, faster crystallization rate, and greater tensile strength at break and Young’s modulus. &#xd;
Two recovery methods were developed for the recovery of MCL-PHA from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. One applied acetone extraction which was capable of recovering all the PHA from the cells with a purity of 91.6% and no detectable polymer molecular weight loss using Soxhlet extraction. Further purification was achieved by redissolving in acetone and reprecipitating in cold methanol. The other method used sodium hydroxide to solubilize the non-PHA cellular material. PHA purity of about 85% was obtained from a biomass containing 65.6% PHA after treatment with 0.2 N NaOH at 22 ± 1oC for 2 h or with 0.1 N at 80 ± 1oC for 15 min. However, a treatment at 22 ± 1oC followed by a second NaOH treatment at 80 ± 1oC resulted in higher PHA purity (94.7%) with a recovery efficiency of 88%. Under these conditions, NaOH digestion had a negligible effect on PHA molecular weight.</description>

   <description>A CO2 emission analysis and system investigation of a direct fuel cell waste energy recovery and power generation system (DFC-ERG) for pressure letdown stations was undertaken. The hybrid system developed by FuelCell Energy Inc. is an integrated turboexpander and a direct internal reforming molten carbonate fuel cell system in a combined circle.&#xd;
At pressure letdown stations, popularly called city gates, the pressure of natural gas transported on long pipelines is reduced by traditional pressure regulating systems. Energy is lost as a result of pressure reduction. Pressure reduction also results in severe cooling of the gas due to the Joule Thompson effect, thus, requiring preheating of the natural gas using traditional gas fired-burners. The thermal energy generated results in the emission of green house gases. The DFC-ERG system is a novel waste energy recovery and green house gas mitigation system that can replace traditional pressure regulating systems on city gates.&#xd;
A DFC-ERG system has been simulated using UniSim Design process simulation software. A case study using data from Utilities Kingston’s city gate at Glenburnie was analysed. The waste energy recovery system was modelled using the design specifications of the FuelCell Energy Inc’s DFC 300 system and turboexpander design characteristics of Cryostar TG120. The Fuel Cell system sizing was based on the required thermal output, electrical power output, available configuration and cost. The predicted performance of the fuel cell system was simulated at a current density of 140mA/cm2, steam to carbon ratio of 3, fuel utilization of 75% and oxygen utilization of 30%. The power output of the turboexpander was found to strongly depend on the high pressure natural gas flowrate, temperature and pressure. The simulated DFC-ERG system was found to reduce CO2 emissions when the electrical power generated by the DFC-ERG system replaced electrical power generated by a coal fired plant.</description>

   <description>Laser Transmission Welding (LTW) involves localized heating at the interface of two pieces of plastic (a laser transparent plastic and laser absorbing plastic) to be joined.  It produces strong, hermetically sealed welds with minimal thermal and mechanical stress, no particulates and very little flash. An ideal transparent polymer for LTW must have: a low laser absorbance to avoid energy loss, a low level of laser scattering so it can provide a maximum energy flux at the weld interface and also have a high resistance to thermal degradation. The objective of the project was to analyze the effect of blend ratios of polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate (PBT/PET) on these laser welding characteristics.&#xd;
The blends were manufactured by DSM (Netherlands).  They were characterized using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermal Gravimetry Analysis (TGA).  The latter technique was used to estimate the order (n), activation energy (ΔH) and frequency factor (A’) of the degradation reaction of the polymer blends.&#xd;
The normalized power profile of the laser after passing through the transparent polymer was measured using a novel non-contact technique and modeled using a semi-empirical model developed by Dr.Chen.  Adding more PET ratio to the blend, did not change beam profile of the transmitted beam significantly.  Laser welding experiments were conducted in which joints were made while varying laser power and scanning speed. Measuring the weld strength and width showed that the blends containing PET have higher strength in comparison to pure PBT.&#xd;
The temperature-time profile at the interface during welding was predicted using a commercial FEM code. This information was combined with the degradation rate data to estimate the relative amount of degraded material at the weld interface.  It showed that increasing the ratio of PET in the blend makes it more resistant against thermal degradation which can be one of the reasons the PET containing blends reach higher weld strengths when compared to pure PBT.</description>

   <description>Background: Shift work is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, where decreased melatonin has been proposed as an intermediate in the causal pathway. The influence of physical activity on melatonin has rarely been studied in an observational setting, and it may be important in mediating the effects of shift work. We aimed to assess the influence of energy expended during physical activity of different intensities on melatonin among rotating shift nurses.  We hypothesized that physical activity before the night shift would lessen the decrease in melatonin production that occurs with exposure to light at night.&#xd;
Methods: 123 female rotating shift nurses working at Kingston General Hospital were recruited over a one-year period.  Physical activity and sedentary behaviours for each participant were recorded during both a day and a night shift using activity diaries, and analysis was restricted to activities between 3 p.m. and 7 a.m. Concentrations of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, a melatonin metabolite, in morning void urine samples were analyzed for each shift.  &#xd;
Results: The average age of participants was 41 years, and 60% were overweight or obese (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2). An average of 6.9 and 5.2 hours of sleep were reported after the day shift and night shift, respectively. Sedentary behaviours such as standing and television watching accounted for over half of the total reported energy expenditure. During the day shift, energy expended in moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity between 3 p.m. and 7 a.m. was negatively associated with melatonin levels (p=0.024, R2 = 0.09). During the night shift, energy expended in sedentary behaviours was negatively associated with melatonin levels (p=0.008, R2 = 0.03).&#xd;
Conclusions: Physical activity energy expenditure explains only a small amount of melatonin variation, suggesting that other factors are influencing melatonin production, or that melatonin production is minimally effected by these patterns of physical activity.</description>

   <description>Rates of female Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection continue to rise despite the existence of effective methods of prevention.  What is the fundamental variable acting as a barrier to women’s self-protection? Researchers have suggested that the oppression of women increases their vulnerability to HIV infection, and that the relationship between oppression and HIV infection must be examined to effectively address this public health issue.  &#xd;
The purpose of this research was to gain greater insight into the life experiences of women with HIV, in order to clarify whether or not women with HIV have, indeed, experienced oppression.  Answering this question was necessary prior to the study of the relationships between oppression and subsequent female HIV infection.    &#xd;
	Women, age 18 years of age or older, who live in Canada, are proficient at speaking English and HIV positive were recruited to this phenomenological study and each participant was asked to tell their “life story”.   The findings of this study provide support for the ongoing use of both the oppression framework and feminist perspective in future research.  Future studies may include replication of this study in partnership with women with HIV and other academic/community organizations, as well as further analysis of the use of both the Theory of Gendered Power and Social Dominance Theory/Four Bases of Gendered Power in addressing female vulnerability to HIV.</description>

   <description>Objective: To determine whether genotype at the catechol-O-methyltransferase rs4680, dopamine D2 receptor rs1800497, serotonin receptor 1A  rs6295 or serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR single nucleotide polymorphisms is associated with response to citalopram and escitalopram treatment in patients with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Twenty one patients with depression or anxiety who were treated with citalopram or escitalopram for greater than one year, and who stopped the medication for a period of time during which their symptoms returned, and upon re-commencing the medication their symptoms were again reduced, were classified as responders. Patients were assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology- self report. The control group consisted of 146 healthy participants. Genotype was determined at each of the candidate genes studied: catechol-O-methyltransferase, dopamine D2 receptor, serotonin receptor 1A and serotonin transporter. Chi squared tests were used to compare genotypic and allele frequencies between responders and controls.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: There was no significant difference in genotypic or allele frequencies between responders and controls at each of the genes analyzed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that genotype at the catechol-O-methyltransferase, dopamine D2 receptor, serotonin receptor 1A  and serotonin&#xd;
transporter genes is not associated with response to citalopram and escitalopram treatment in patients with depression and anxiety. A larger sample size, along with a genome-wide scan are needed to identify genetic variants that predict medication response in future patients.</description>

   <description>Neuronal-glial interactions play an important role in the development of neuropathic (NP) pain states. Earlier studies in our laboratory suggest a role for activated glia in morphine-induced delta opioid receptor (DOR) trafficking by altering DOR functional competence. Thus, chronic treatment with the glial inhibitor, propentofylline (PF) blocks the anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of the DOR agonist deltorphin II.  The present study aimed to determine whether NP pain-induced changes in DOR function and trafficking are dependent on glial activation. &#xd;
The first global aim of this study was to determine the molecular and behavioural effects of glial activation by two glial inhibitors, PF and PJ34 in a model of neuropathic pain.  Glial activation was assessed via changes in specific proteins using fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC). Neuropathy-induced c-Fos activation was assessed by IHC and pain hypersensitivity was assessed, including mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain. The second global aim determined the role of activated glia in changes in neuropathy-induced increases in DOR function and DOR subcellular localization using immunogold IHC and transmission electron microscopy (EM). &#xd;
Chronic PJ34 attenuated chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced mircoglial, but not astrocyte activation. Chronic administration of either PF or PJ34 attenuated the CCI-induced increase in c-Fos immunoreactive expression. However, neither drug attenuated CCI-induced mechanical allodynia or spontaneous pain. &#xd;
Both chronic PF and PJ34 administration in NP animals attenuated the anti-allodynic effects of the DOR-selective agonist deltorphin II, suggesting glial inhibition blocks DOR function. However, chronic PF, but not PJ34, blocked the anti-allodynic effects of another DOR agonist, SNC80.  These data suggest that SNC80 might be targeting a different DOR molecular species that is not affected by factors released from microglia. Finally, EM experiments revealed that chronic PF treatment prevented the CCI-induced increase in DOR trafficking providing a positive correlation between behaviour and receptor localization.&#xd;
This study suggests that activated glia contribute to changes in DOR function and trafficking in NP pain states.  It also suggests that there is a dissociation between glial inhibition and pain hypersensitivity.</description>

   <description>Cellulosomes are the most efficient plant cell wall degradation machines discovered to date. All cellulosomal components contain protein modules connected by linkers of varying lengths, which are predicted to be flexible. Consequently, structural studies of the cellulosome have employed a “dissect and build” strategy, whereby individual modules are studied in isolation with the hope to later model the intact complex. However, representative individual structures are now available for all of the cellulosome modules and many questions still remain. The studies described in this thesis depart from the ‘dissection’ stage and enter the ‘build’ stage of cellulosome structural studies of the cellulosome from Clostridium thermocellum.&#xd;
We first describe the crystal structure of a heterodimeric complex comprising the type-II cohesin (CohII) from cell surface anchoring protein SdbA and a trimodular C-terminal truncation of the CipA scaffoldin protein containing the ninth type-I cohesin module (CohI9), a linker, the X-module (X), and the type-II dockerin module (DocII). This structure revealed novel intertwining of scaffoldin molecules and extensive reciprocal contacts between the CohI9 and the X-module of another scaffoldin molecule. Sedimentation velocity experiments indicate dimerization also occurs in solution. &#xd;
We have carried out the crystallization and structural analysis of a heterotrimeric complex containing the CohI9—X-DocII:CohII complex bound to the type-I dockerin module (DocI) from the Cel9D enzyme, which represents the largest cellulosome fragment ever determined. Identical inter-scaffoldin interactions were observed in the heterotrimeric complex structure as were seen in the heterodimeric complex. However, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies indicate that this dimerization does not occur in solution. The crystal structures and additional SAXS studies reveal flexibility in the CohI9—X linker that is surprisingly restricted to two dimensions. In addition, this structure provides the first evidence of an orientation bias in DocI binding. &#xd;
Finally, SAXS was used to investigate modular orientations and linker flexibility in several cellulosome fragments. These studies indicate that cellulosomal linkers exhibit restricted and in some cases highly restrained flexibility. Specifically, scaffoldin linkers display two dimensional motions, enzymes maintain close contact with their cognate DocI modules, and enzyme positions rotate about 90° relative to neighbouring enzymes on the scaffoldin.</description>

   <description>Nuclear reactor steam generator tubes, manufactured from Nickel alloys such as Inconel 690 (INC690), are potentially susceptible to failure by Stress Corrosion Cracking where crack initiation may be exacerbated by internal stress fields.  A more comprehensive understanding of this potential failure mechanism was gained via an exploration of a model of INC690’s behaviour under Constrained loading conditions in compression and tension.   An Elasto-Plastic Self-Consistent (EPSC) model was used to predict the lattice stresses and strains resulting from Constrained loading in INC690 for four crystallographic planes.  The internal strain fields generated under such conditions were shown to be markedly different from those developed under Uniaxial loading.  Finite Element Modeling was used to design tensile and compression samples as well as a testing rig that would allow the application of a compressive load along one axis of the specimen with simultaneous constraint along another and free-deformation along the third.  Lattice strain measurements were done for both compressive and tensile loading using Time-Of-Flight neutron diffraction.  The predicted and experimental values showed reasonable agreement; mainly in terms of crystallographic plane interaction and behaviour.  Iterative computer modeling was used to achieve a more realistic depiction of the lattice strains developed. This research allowed for an extension on the Uniaxial findings by examining the material’s behaviour under more complex loading that better approximates steam generator tube operating conditions.</description>

   <description>The American eel (Anguilla rostrata) has suffered a serious population decline in Lake Ontario since the early 1980s due to a decline in recruitment of juveniles migrating from the Sargasso Sea. This has resulted in the closure of the Lake Ontario fishery in 2004 and its listing as endangered under the Ontario Species at Risk act in June of 2008 in Ontario. Due to their complex life cycle, little is known about eels once they leave their freshwater habitats and migrate to the Sargasso Sea to reproduce. Ocean conditions, habitat destruction, disease, reduced lipid content, over-fishing, physical barriers (hydroelectric dams), and chemical contamination are all possible reasons for recruitment decline and may be acting cumulatively. Maternally derived dioxin-like contaminants (DLCs) accumulated during the growth phase of eels in Lake Ontario are toxic to fish embryos, and embryotoxicity is expressed as a series of malformations known as blue sac disease (BSD). I assessed whether these toxicants are in high enough concentrations in sexually maturing, eels to be embryotoxic to their offspring, as assessed by using Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), a surrogate species. Medaka embryos were first injected with 2,3,7,8-tetracholordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) to establish their sensitivity to this test chemical expressed as an 11-day EC50 of 3.79 pg/mg, for the induction of BSD. Medaka embryos were injected with eel extracts and their response compared to the TCDD toxicity curve to assess whether extracts caused developmental problems and to estimate the relative concentration of DLCs. Eel extracts from all collection sites caused no dioxin-like toxicity to Japanese medaka embryos. However, significantly higher toxicity at 10 eeq relative to triolein was found for all extracts with no differences among sites, suggesting the presence of non-dioxin-like toxicants. The low level of maternal tissue contamination by DLCs implied by this bioassay is mirrored in chemical monitoring of persistent organic pollutants in Lake Ontario fish. If correct, the low levels of toxicity of extracts to embryos could contribute to the observed increase of eels entering L. Ontario from 2003 to 2008.</description>

   <description>Healthy term pregnancy requires precisely timed coordination of multiple systems, including reproductive, neuroendocrine, immune and cardiovascular.  Dynamic maternal alterations occur systemically as well as locally within the reproductive tract. Systemic cardiovascular changes during gestation are relatively conserved in mammals, permitting comparison.  These physiological changes are relatively acute and reversible, in contrast to the pathological changes seen during cardiovascular disease development.  Gestational hypertensive disorders, such as preeclampsia, are the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.  The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not fully elucidated, but perturbation of the immune system is a fundamental component.  The angiogenic and vascular properties of uterine NK lymphocytes have been well studied in mice and women, but their relationships to gestational blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular adaptations have not been addressed.  In non-pregnant women and mice, T cells, but not B cells, have been found to alter cardiovascular functioning.  NK cells in humans also possess these capabilities, but no functional studies have been completed.  The aim of this thesis was to define the role of NK and T lymphocytes in cardiovascular adaptations during mouse gestation.  Using chronic radiotelemetry, histology, post-mortem and other techniques, female inbred mice of differing genotypes that lack specific lymphocyte subsets were compared before and across gestation.  In normal, immune competent mice, a five-phase gestational blood pressure profile was found.  This dynamic profile corresponded to stages of placental development.  In mice with a compound deficit in arterial modification and lymphocytes, no gestational hypertension was observed.  To elevate the maternal challenge of pregnancy, studies of pregnant, autoimmune Type 1 Diabetic mice were conducted. Impaired spiral artery remodeling, dysfunctional lymphocytes and growth-restricted fetuses were identified.  From mid-gestation, diabetic pregnant mice were hypotensive and bradycardic and showed signs of pre-renal failure (proteinuria and electrolyte imbalances).  In pregnant mice lacking T cells, tachycardia was observed despite otherwise normal gestational outcomes.  In pregnant mice lacking T cells with impaired NK cells, blood pressure was blunted and tachycardia was observed.&#xd;
These findings support the conclusion that impaired spiral artery remodeling is insufficient to cause gestational hypertension in mice. The data further identify a role for T and NK cells in cardiac function during gestation.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines how people use information technologies to generate transparency in organizations.  Transparency has long been considered a core feature of the contemporary digital workplace (Zuboff, 1988).  Transparency is defined here as a functional affordance provided by information technologies which, once appropriated, contribute to solve three types of problems faced by organizations: mobilizing the workforce, pooling work artefacts among occupational communities, and reporting accountability. An inductive theory building case study of four similar high-growth ventures from the business and entertainment software industries was conducted.  The findings indicate that appropriations of information technology compete with alternative practices to fulfill transparency functions and a set of coherent contextual conditions have been found to influence the type of appropriations that will emerge and be selected in a given organization.  Appropriations of information technology also exhibit functional equivalence, as distinct appropriations of technology were observed to fulfill the same transparency function with the same level of adequacy. This research contributes to information systems and social informatics theory by synthesizing and extending previously disparate studies to develop a theoretical explanation of how information technology appropriations fulfill transparency functions within an organization.  Because of the nature of the cases studied in this research, this research also has implications for researchers and practitioners interested in how information technology gets appropriated by high-growth ventures in the “creative” and “new media” industries.</description>

   <description>Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancers, with an incidence increasing more rapidly than any other malignant cancer in the past 40 years. Metastatic melanoma is resistant to conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Our lab has previously demonstrated that Mcl-1 is a key contributor in protecting melanoma from therapy-induced cell death. RNAi therapeutics was employed as a novel way to silence the anti-apoptotic protein by using Mcl-1 mRNA sequence-specific siRNAs in vitro. In our hands, passive non-targeted delivery of RNAi therapy into melanoma tumours has been shown to be neither effective, nor selective in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, in this study, siRNA was linked to a delivery system which expressed a ligand specifically targeting melanoma cells. Previously shown, melanoma overexpresses the cell surface ganglioside GD3, thus it is my belief that the anti-GD3 R24 monoclonal antibody can function as a targeting molecule. The antibody was linked to coated cationic liposomes (CCLs) carrying siRNA molecules. Our first step was to confirm R24 ligation to CCLs. Untargeted CCLs showed insignificant values of antibody, whereas antibody-conjugated CCLs presented approximately 30 antibodies per liposome. I also confirmed that siRNA was internalized within CCLs using spectrometry, with an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 80%. Since liposomes need to be small to be effective in vitro and in vivo, CCLs were confirmed to be less than 100nm in diameter. In vitro studies using fluorescent microscopy demonstrated greater binding to melanoma cells with antibody-conjugated CCLs as compared to untargeted CCLs. In vivo experiments showed specific localization of targeted CCLs to induced subcutaneous mouse xenograft tumours. Western blotting demonstrated greater Mcl-1 knockdown using GD3-targeted CCLs. Taken together, these results suggest that anti-GD3 antibodies can serve as targeting molecules to deliver siRNA to melanoma cells and furthermore, GD3-targeted CCLs can promote siRNA-mediated gene silencing.</description>

   <description>The present research explored cross-cultural differences in postdecisional confirmation bias. I hypothesized that, following a personal decision—one that entails consequences for the decision maker only, Euro-Canadians would be more likely to seek out confirmatory information than would Japanese, whereas following an interpersonal decision—one that entails consequences for those closest to the decision maker, Japanese would be more likely to do so than Euro-Canadians. In Study 1, Euro-Canadians and Japanese university students were randomly assigned to either the self or friend condition. Participants in the self and friend condition selected a movie for which they or their friend would ostensibly receive a free pass to see in theatres, respectively. After selecting a movie, participants were presented with a list of 12 movie reviews that either confirmed or disconfirmed their choice. Participants then indicated which of the reviews they wanted to read further. Study 2 employed the same paradigm as did Study 1 and also included a measure of participants’ information processing goals. For Study 1, the results of a series of one-sample t tests revealed that Euro-Canadians in the self condition exhibited confirmation bias as well as did those in the friend condition, albeit this latter trend was not significant. In contrast, Japanese in both conditions showed no preference for confirmatory or disconfirmatory information. For Study 2, Japanese continued to exhibit a balanced search. However, Euro-Canadians in the friend condition preferred confirmatory information, whereas Euro-Canadians in the self condition exhibited a slight, non-significant preference for disconfirmatory information. Regarding participants’ information processing goals, those in the friend condition were more concerned with affirming and convincing others of the correctness of their choice than were those in the self condition. Also, Euro-Canadians indicated that they were motivated to be accurate more than did Japanese. The present research indicates that Euro-Canadians and Japanese differ in terms of the decisions that they seek to confirm (albeit not in the predicted direction). Reasons for such discrepant findings and limits of the present research are discussed.</description>

   <description>Maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can induce a range of behavioral and cognitive deficits in offspring, which are collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD).  There are significant delays in motor development and sensory-motor skills in children with FASD, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these deficits are poorly understood. The goal of this research project is to test the hypothesis that the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements (KINARM) will serve as an effective tool for identifying and measuring specific, neurologically-based motor deficits in children with FASD. These deficits were revealed through investigation of multi-joint upper limb movements during the performance of sensory-motor tasks. Children (31 FASD; 83 controls, aged 5 to 18 years, male and female) performed: (1) a visually-guided reaching task with fingertip feedback only; and children (31 FASD; 49 controls, aged 5 to 18 years, male and female) performed: (2) an arm position-matching task in the absence of visual feedback. Children with FASD differed significantly from controls in many reaching task outcome measures, specifically those related to the initial motor response and corrective responses. In particular, large effect sizes were observed for outcome measures related to the first (initial) movement (corresponding to feedforward control; e.g., direction error; distance error), as well as for those measures related to corrective responses (corresponding to feedback control; e.g., difference between minimum and maximum hand speeds; number of speed peaks during movement).  In the position-matching task, children with FASD constricted the spatial workspace of the subject-controlled arm relative to the robot-controlled arm, in the horizontal axis. There was also observed a systematic shift between the subject- and robot-controlled arms in the XY end position, resulting in significant error. Additionally, children with FASD exhibited significantly increased trial-to-trial variability for final hand position of the subject-controlled arm, over all targets, and for which large effect sizes were observed. The results suggest that children with FASD have difficulty integrating sensory information into planned motor movements. The KINARM is a promising research tool that may be used to assess motor control deficits in children affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol.</description>

   <description>The complex dose distributions delivered by modern, conformal radiation therapy techniques present a considerable challenge in dose verification.  Traditional measurement tools are difficult and laborious to use, since complete verification requires that the doses be determined in three dimensions (3D). The difficulty is further complicated by a required target accuracy of ± 5% for the dose delivery. Gel dosimetry is an attractive option for realizing a tissue-equivalent, 3D dose verification tool with high resolution readout capabilities. However, much important work remains to be completed prior to its acceptance in the clinic. The careful development of easily accessible, fast optical readout tools such as cone beam optical computed tomography (CT) in combination with stable and reliable low-toxicity gel dosimeters is one key step in this process. &#xd;
	In this thesis, the performance capabilities and limitations of the two main classes of cone beam optical CT-based absorbing and scattering gel dosimetry are characterized, and their measurement improved through careful matching of dosimeter and scanner performance. These systems are then applied to the evaluation of clinically relevant complex dose distributions. Three-dimensional quality assurance assessments of complex treatment plan dose distributions are shown to be feasible using an optically absorbing Fricke-xylenol-orange-gelatin-based gel dosimeter. Better than 95% voxel agreement is achieved between the plan and the delivery, using 3% dose difference and 3 mm spatial distance-to-agreement gamma function comparison criteria. Small field dose delivery evaluations are demonstrated to be viable using an optically scattering N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM)-based polymer gel, with the same comparison criteria. Full treatment process quality assurance is also possible using a NIPAM dosimeter in-phantom, but is limited in its accuracy due to the inherent difficulty of managing the effects of stray light pertubation in the optical attenuation-to-dose calibration.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines three contemporary Newfoundland novels to reconsider the relationship among loss, environment, and Newfoundland identity. Studies of Newfoundland literature often perform environmentally deterministic readings, or readings that characterize Newfoundland as a nostalgic and pathological culture fixated on loss and disaster. Newfoundlanders are too frequently understood as victims either of environment or of their colonial past. The dissertation argues that Newfoundlanders are, rather, victims of a misunderstanding of both. Using the works of philosophers Edward Casey and Arnold Berleant, I contend that these novels retell the history of Newfoundland as the story of places being treated as interchangeable sites, and criticize the consequences that stem from this misperception.&#xd;
   Chapter 1 outlines the development of two dominant literary traditions in Newfoundland writing—“Romanticism” and stoicism—and their corresponding place myths. Chapter 2, which discusses Wayne Johnston’s The Colony of Unrequited Dreams (1998), explains Casey’s and Berleant’s distinction between space and place, traces the history of Newfoundland being treated as an exchangeable site in empty space rather than as a unique place, and sets the theoretical framework for the dissertation. I counter environmentally deterministic readings and argue that Johnston reveals Newfoundlanders’ relationship with place to be reciprocal.&#xd;
	Chapters 3 and 4 question the assumption that “Romantic” and sentimental expressions of loss are pathological fixations. Chapter 3 examines Kenneth J. Harvey’s The Town that Forgot How to Breathe (2003), an antimodern and dystopic novel set in outport Newfoundland following the collapse of the cod fishery. I employ Svetlana Boym’s distinction between “restorative” and “reflective” nostalgia to suggest that reflective nostalgia might play a key role in re-placing Newfoundland. Chapter 4 focuses on Lisa Moore’s February (2009), which portrays the grief of a family following the loss of their father in the Ocean Ranger disaster. The chapter contends that the same mentality that regards places merely as sites for resource extraction also considers people to be dispensable, and I argue that “resistant mourning”—rather than being pathological—amounts to an ethical protest against this mentality. I conclude by discussing the difficulty and necessity of understanding the ocean as place.</description>

   <description>Family members are in an optimal position to identify changes in behaviour of loved ones suffering from delirium. To date there are no known studies on educational interventions specifically targeting families of the elderly related to delirium outside of the hospital setting.&#xd;
Using the Knowledge to Action Process, families became involved in the development of a knowledge translation product related to delirium. It was found from two focus groups that participants’ knowledge of delirium was limited. Also, it was determined that participants were most interested in receiving an educational session in a group setting. The education session was developed using feedback from the focus groups as well as evidence based resources. The focus for the education session was on prevention and identification of delirium.&#xd;
There were a total of seven education sessions held and 16 eligible participants. In each session a pre and post-test for delirium knowledge was given to the participants. There was a significant increase in scores on the post-test following the session. Participants were also given a post session questionnaire to evaluate the education session. Overall the session was well received; participants were often interested in learning more about delirium. Half of the participants felt they would be able to identify delirium in someone close to them. The majority of participants thought that it is important for other families of the elderly to receive a similar session on delirium.&#xd;
&#xd;
Four to six weeks following the education session, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with five participants from the second phase in order to receive further feedback on the intervention. Most participants were able to recall information related to risk factors and signs of delirium. Three participants stated that the education sessions should be longer in order to provide more time for discussion. Participants still thought they would be able to recognize delirium as long as they were close to the person experiencing it. Since the education session none of the participants had witnessed anyone who was delirious.</description>

   <description>Cystatin Related Epididymal Spermatogenic protein (CRES) is expressed in both the testis and epididymis and found associated with spermatozoa. It appears as non-glycosylated (14 and 12 kDa) and glycosylated isoforms (19 and 17 kDa). The role of CRES is enigmatic and dependent on localization of its isoforms, which is the objective of this study. The initial approach was to investigate testicular and epididymal origins of these isoforms by immunohistochemistry and immunogold cytochemistry. To further pinpoint CRES localization we then selectively extracted and fractionated epididymal spermatozoa in order to find by immunoblotting which sperm fractions contained CRES isoforms. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse spermatogenesis showed that CRES was expressed in the tail cytoplasm of elongating spermatids from step 9-16, with a pattern reminiscent of outer dense fibre (ODF) proteins. Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry revealed that the immunogold label was concentrated over growing ODFs and mitochondrial sheath in the testes which persisted in spermatozoa through the epididymis. Sequential extractions of isolated sperm tails with Triton X-100-dithiothreitol (DTT) to remove the mitochondrial sheath, whose extract contained an unrelated 66 kDa immunoreactive band, followed by either sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-DTT or urea-DTT to solubilise accessory fibres of the tail revealed a 14 kDa immunoreactive band associated with the ODF. In addition, Western blots revealed glycosylated and non-glycosylated CRES isoforms in nonyl phenoxylpolyethoxylethanol (NP40) extracts of the caput, but not cauda, sperm. Immunohistochemical analysis of the caput and cauda epithelium showed that CRES is secreted by the Golgi apparatus of the&#xd;
ii&#xd;
initial segment, fills the proximal caput lumen, and disappears by mid caput. Western blots of caput and cauda tissue and luminal fluid revealed 14 and 19 kDa immunoreactive bands in caput tissues and luminal fluid, but not in the cauda. This study concludes that there are two origins of CRES, one arising in the testis and the other in the epididymis. Testicular CRES is ionically and covalently associated with the ODF while epididymal CRES is detergent soluble and is most likely associated temporarily with the surface of caput epididymal sperm.</description>

   <description>Term fetuses show differential heart rate responses to their mother’s vs. a female stranger’s voice and newborns show a preference for their mother’s vs. a female stranger’s voice, indicating recognition/learning of the mother’s voice before birth.  However, fetal response to the father’s voice is unknown and was examined in this study. Forty mother-fetal pairs and the fathers participated.  Parents were audio recorded reading a story.  Each fetus was presented with the recordings using the following 3 min periods:  pre-voice no-sound, voice (mother or father, counterbalanced over subjects), post-voice no-sound. Following a 20 min delay, the opposite voice was delivered. Voices were presented about 10 cm above the maternal abdomen at an average of 95 dB A; heart rate and body movements were recorded continuously.  After delivery, newborn head-turning to three, 20 s trials of each parent’s voice (counter balanced over subjects) delivered at an average of 80 dB A was observed. Results showed that fetuses responded to the mother’s and father’s voices, demonstrating a heart rate increase to both voices compared to no heart rate change during the pre-voice baseline period. Fetuses showed no heart rate response to their mother reading a story but showed a heart rate increase when her audio recording was played. After birth, as newborns, they turned their heads more often towards their mother’s voice and away from their father’s voice. It was concluded that both the mother’s and father’s voice can capture and sustain the fetuses’ attention and that newborns prefer their mother’s vs. their father’s voice.</description>

   <description>In the first chapter, I examine the definitions and axioms in Part One of Spinoza's Ethics. From there, I discuss five interpretations of Spinoza's notion of `axiom' in order to strengthen our understanding of the role Spinoza took axioms to play in his work. &#xd;
&#xd;
In the second chapter, I move from the discussion of what an axiom is to a consideration of the precise meaning of the fourth axiom of the first part (1A4). A key move in this chapter is to show that Spinoza does not separate causation and conception.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the third chapter, I defend the truth of 1A4 by showing that it follows from the definitions of Substance and Mode. I argue that in virtue of the conclusions of the previous two chapters, the axiom can be regarded as true for its relevant magnitude (in a way akin to the 'common notions' of Euclid's Elements).</description>

   <description>To date, research on the effect of depressive symptomatology on victim-witness identification is scarce even though depressive symptomatology is highly prevalent in the victim-witness experience.  Furthermore, being a victim-witness often instigates the use of counselling services, which could cause a shift in affect, and applying mood dependent memory theories, any change in affect should be detrimental to eyewitness accuracy.  Still, individuals suffering from subclinical depression, or dysphoria, have exhibited heightened perceptual skills, and depressed affect exhibits remarkable stability over time.  Therefore, I theorized that: (1) dysphoric people’s heightened sensitivity and motivation towards accurate understanding may result in more accurate eyewitness identifications, and (2) individuals who express stable levels of dysphoria should have greater eyewitness identification accuracy than should people with stable levels of nondysphoria, with stable levels of severe depressive symptomatology, or with unstable depressive symptomatology.  In Study One, 132 students were randomly assigned to one of three autobiographical mood inductions: a positive, negative, or neutral/control.  Following this manipulation, participants completed 12 experimental trials each consisting of a target exposure, a 30-second distraction task, and lastly, a six-person simultaneous line-up.  Higher levels of dysphoria were associated with greater overall identification accuracy and that temporary mood conferred an advantage only when participants recalled highly sad memories.  In Study Two, 173 participants were exposed to 12 target faces at a first session and returned two-to-four weeks later to identify these faces from 12 six-person simultaneous line-ups.  Individuals who exhibited stable levels of dysphoria from eyewitness event to the line-up task performed significantly better on the simultaneous line-ups than all of the other groups.  Among those exhibiting unstable dysphoria, people whose depressive symptomatology improved were almost as accurate as those who had stable dysphoria.  These results support the need for victim-witnesses to receive immediate help to stabilize or improve depressive symptomatology not just for their mental well-being but also to preserve eyewitness accuracy.</description>

   <description>PURPOSE: To generate a theory of the psychosocial processes influencing weight management among persons newly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications.&#xd;
RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xd;
1. What influences weight management in persons with first-episode psychosis who are newly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications?&#xd;
2. How is weight management facilitated in persons with first-episode psychosis who are newly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications?&#xd;
3. What psychosocial processes impede weight management in persons with first-episode psychosis who are newly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications?&#xd;
METHODS: A qualitative, grounded theory research design was used to guide the study. Semi-structured interviews were the method of data collection and analysis was performed using constant comparison.&#xd;
SAMPLE &amp; SETTING: A sample of 10 participants with first-episode psychosis prescribed atypical antipsychotics for at least eight weeks and six participants with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia who have been taking atypical antipsychotic medication for at least three years were obtained from an Outpatient Psychiatric program using theoretical sampling.&#xd;
FINDINGS: Contextual factors influencing weight management were: accessibility to resources, unstructured lifestyle, and others’ perception of their weight. Conditions influencing weight management were: rapid weight gain, insatiable hunger, and a lack of motivation boosters. Participants’ early responses to actions influencing weight gain management included discontinuing medications, choosing lower calorie foods, using walking in daily activities as exercise, accepting weight gain, and trying to manage weight but giving up. The consequences revealed from data analysis were contemplating weight management and not trying, as the barriers to weight management substantially exceeded the facilitators and many procrastinated in taking on any weight management strategies.&#xd;
CONCLUSION: The theoretical framework developed in this study can assist with the understanding and management of weight gain among this unique population.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, Lisa Figge analyzes the political space of ecological citizenship by theorizing her art practice.  Beginning with an Arendtian lens, Figge creates projects in the vein of New Genre Public Art, to trace the qualitatively-distinct activities of the public sphere, in which ecological citizens appear.  The art practices of Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Colette Urban, Pat Aylesworth, Helen and Newton Harrison help move this critique along.  Then, taking Judith Butler’s thinking on the bond between speech and action, or speech acts, Figge situates her art practice and thesis writing as an account of herself as an ecological citizen.  Figge is interested in finding ways to multiply opportunities, for her and others, to perform concerned engagement with the world.  In order to begin this process Figge acts out and analyses her three art interventions: Madame E and her suit of environmentally conscious a(r)mour, Ecological Citizen in Training, and 86 Hands on Wolfe Island.  In giving an account of herself, she shows how our aptitude for sorting things should not be used to override our capacity to make a meaningful life.  The art exhibition Dust to Dust, 2010 is the twin of this accounting, which was held at Queen’s University’s Union Gallery.</description>

   <description>It is well recognized that there is a lack of effective therapies for treating chronic pain.  Therefore, development of novel analgesics with minimal side effects and the absence of addiction potential are essential. The present study assessed the effectiveness of a novel class of selective heme oxygenase (HO) inhibitors in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in rats.&#xd;
A research collaboration of Dr. Kanji Nakatsu (Pharmacology and Toxicology) and Dr. Walter Szarek (Chemistry) has designed and synthesized a series of azole-based compounds with a range of activity as HO inhibitors. This series has been dubbed as QC-xx. QC-15 selectively inhibits the HO-1 isoform, while QC-10 inhibits both HO-1 and HO-2. &#xd;
Intraplantar injection of 1% formalin produces a biphasic nociceptive response characterized by licking and flinching of the affected hind paw. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of QC-15 (100μmol/kg) attenuated nociceptive behaviors to formalin, which were not blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (1 mg/kg, IP). Similarly, IP delivery of QC-10 (100μmol/kg) decreased formalin-induced nociceptive behavior. To determine whether the effects of the drug were peripheral or spinally mediated, compounds were delivered either locally or spinally. Intrathecal (IT) administration of QC-15 (0.3 μmol) attenuated pain behavior, whereas local injection into the paw had no effect. &#xd;
 The effects of QC-15 were also assessed in a model of neuropathic pain, induced by constriction of the common sciatic nerve using 4 chromic sutures. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds (von Frey filaments) were used to assess mechanical allodynia before and after IP administration of QC-15. Animals treated with the HO-1 inhibitor had significantly higher thresholds (indicating decreased mechanical allodynia) on both day 7 and 14 compared to pre-drug baselines. These observations suggest that HO-1 may also play a role in neuropathic pain.&#xd;
	Finally we were able to demonstrate that QC-15 had no effect on motor coordination that would interfere with behavioral testing. Animals treated with the 100μmol/kg dose of QC-15 were able to maintain equal performance as controls treated with saline. In conclusion, behavioral results indicate that the inducible form of HO (HO-1) may play an important role in persistent and chronic pain states.</description>

   <title>Relating to Reasons</title>

   <subject>Practical Reason</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2010-09-07 20:05:36.934</description>
   <description>While each of us has an intuitive sense of what a reason is, when considered more carefully the concept is not so clear. There are a number of questions to which any successful account of reasons will provide some answer. For example, on some accounts reasons may appear to be metaphysically odd entities, unlike other sorts of facts in our world. From here there are very serious questions which spring up regarding the motivational efficacy of reasons: given the nature of reasons, as respective accounts describe them, how is it that reasons get a grip in an agent? Further, whatever reasons are, and in whichever relation agents stand to reasons, how is it that agents get in touch with truths about reasons? How in theory – and importantly, in practice – do agents figure out which reasons apply to them?&#xd;
I will be defending a view of reasons in which reasons are primitive. This is what T.M. Scanlon calls 'Reasons Fundamentalism'. In particular, I will defend this view against charges which claim that an account of reasons as primitive or fundamental fails us in the following three respects: 1) it cannot provide us with an adequate account of what sorts of facts reasons are, and how they intermingle with other sorts of facts; 2) it cannot provide us with adequate account of how a consideration can count as a reason for an agent even if that agent fails to be gripped by the consideration, and; 3) it cannot provide us with an adequate account of how we figure out, in principle and in practice, what count as reasons and which reasons apply to us.&#xd;
If reasons are fundamental, existing and applying to us independently of anything already true of particular agents and are the sorts of things we can come to understand through reflection, it seems that such a story also succeeds in capturing our&#xd;
phenomenological experience of practical reasoning in our every day lives. This, I will suggest, goes some distance toward setting it apart from – and ahead of – other accounts.</description>

   <description>Microorganisms have evolved a stunning array of strategies for nutrient competition, ranging from concerted effort of antibiotic release to kill off competing species, to evolving complex enzymatic pathways that are capable of scavenging nutrients from sources not utilizable by other organisms. The carbon-phosphorous (C-P) lyase pathway is a survival mechanism that is activated during phosphate limitation in certain species of bacteria and enables cleavage of the extremely stable C-P bond in order to obtain phosphorous from organophosphonates. The structure and biochemical characterization of PhnP, a critical accessory protein from C-P lyase pathway of E. coli is presented in this thesis. The structure of PhnP revealed a conserved metal-dependent hydrolase active site with two Mn2+ ions, and another unique mononuclear Zn2+ site that appears to have a structural role. A non-physiological ligand that fortuitously co-crystallized with the enzyme provided insights into the catalytic features of the active site. We were able to demonstrate hydrolytic activity towards a number of phosphodiesterase substrates, and propose a plausible physiological role for PhnP. These results contribute to deciphering the mechanism of phosphonate utilization, which would allow design of bioremediation programs to remove toxic phsophonates from the environment. Antibiotic production is another mechanism for resource competition. Structural characterization of CmlS, a halogenase from the chloramphenicol biosynthesis pathway of S. venezuelae is presented. The crystal structure revealed a novel covalent modification of its FAD cofactor, which was confirmed through ESI-MS and chemical denaturation studies. The unique C-terminal domain, active site architecture, and the position of the C-terminus suggest that halogenation mechanism of CmlS may differ from the currently proposed mechanism for structurally related halogenases. This work provides early steps towards understanding mechanisms of enzymatic halogenations, which is of great scientific, as well as pharmaceutical interest.</description>

   <description>Considerable research has been conducted on the control of pneumatic systems due to their potential as a low-cost, clean, high power-to-weight ratio actuators. However, nonlinearities such as those due to compressibility of air continue to limit their accuracy. Among the nonlinearities in a pneumatic system, friction can have a significant effect on tracking performance, especially in applications that use rodless cylinders which have higher Coulomb friction than rodded cylinders.&#xd;
Compensation for nonlinearities in pneumatic systems has been a popular area of research in pneumatic system control. Most advanced nonlinear control strategies are based on a detailed mathematical model of the system.  If a simplified mathematical model is used, then performance is sensitive to uncertainties and parameter variations in the robot. Although they show relatively good results, the requirement for model parameter identification has made these methods difficult to implement. This highlights the need for an adaptive controller that is not based on a mathematical model.&#xd;
The objective of this thesis was to design and evaluate a position and velocity controller for application to a pneumatic gantry robot. An Adaptive Neural Network (ANN) structure was implemented as both a controller and as a compensator. The implemented ANN had online training as this was considered to be the algorithm that had the greatest potential to enhance the performance of the pneumatic system.&#xd;
One axis of the robot was used to obtain results for the cases of velocity and position control. Seven different velocity controllers were tested and their performance compared. For position control, only two controllers were examined: conventional PID and PID with an ANN Compensator (ANNC). The position controllers were tuned for step changes in the setpoint. Their performance was evaluated as applied to sinusoid tracking.&#xd;
It was shown that the addition of ANN as a compensator could improve the performance of both position and velocity control. For position control, the ANNC improved the tracking performance by over 20%. Although performance was better than with conventional PID control, it was concluded that the level of improvement with ANNC did not warrant the extra effort in tuning and implementation.</description>

   <description>Purpose: To evaluate differences in perceived workplace social support for different disability groups, and to better understand the support experiences of persons with mental health disabilities. Methods: A sequential mixed methods design was used. Phase I involved the analysis of an existing dataset to compare perceived social support scores between participants with different disabilities. Phase II, rooted in the phenomenology tradition, involved interviews with workers with mental health disabilities. Triangulation of methods was done in the analysis phase by comparing participant interviews with their corresponding support scores. Results: Phase I - No significant differences were found between participants with orthopaedic and emotional disabilities regarding their total perceived social support score, or support scores according to type (e.g. informational) or source (e.g. supervisor) of support; however, trends suggested that participants with emotional disabilities had higher perceived support scores for friends/family support and lower perceived support scores for appraisal support. Regression models developed from the demographic variables did not predict the perceived amount of social support. Phase II – 9 theme clusters concerning the role of supervisors, external and internal factors, and disclosure emerged from the interviews with workers with mental health disabilities regarding their experiences of support in the workplace. Conclusions: This was the first mixed-methods study to examine the workplace support experiences of individuals with mental health disabilities using a workplace and disability context specific support scale and interviews rooted in phenomenology. No significant differences in perceived support scores between orthopaedic and emotional disabilities were found and this may be attributable to small sample size. In addition, although the qualitative findings provide interesting insight into support experiences, additional research with more participants from a variety of industries would add to the findings.</description>

   <description>Historically, obituaries were created as news items and published in print media with the intentions of informing an audience of public hangings or similar sensational deaths. Over the years, obituaries changed in form to become a way of publicly notifying audiences of one’s life upon their death, focusing more on biography and familial structure than sensation. However, with advancements in communicative mediums, including the increased popularity and easy accessibility of the Internet, traditional understandings of the term ‘obituary’ are challenged to include all forms of media publications that draw on elements of sensation and biography. The combination of this new, inclusive definition and the increasing popularity and advancement of technological mediums has republicized deceased celebrities as marketable and profitable brands that rely on subject formation through media and participatory fandom. However, the branding of celebrated, deceased figures through processes of social subjectification often remains embedded within cultural texts. As a result, audiences are often unaware of their ability to shift or influence identities of the deceased, and their fandom becomes the target of alternative messages embedded in sites of obituarization. By applying Marshall McLuhan’s theory of technology as an extension of human consciousness in addition to Roland Barthes’ theory of mythologisation when examining Michael Jackson’s 2009 death, this thesis explains how the subject formation of deceased individuals becomes so powerful and globalized that their death becomes a positive and beneficial occurrence with regards to the profitability and marketability of their brand. Therefore, the subject formation of celebrated, deceased figures is a fragile process that is altering how North Americans mediate the culture surrounding death and dying.</description>

   <description>The effect of calcium uptake by hydration and diffusion from an adjacent calcium-rich soil on the performance of a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) is examined for three cases. In Case 1 the GCL rested directly on a soil with a high calcium (1800 mg/l) concentration in the pore water (called “calcium rich soil” herein). Case 2 involved a GCL resting on 300 mm of soil with a low (200 - 300 mg/l) calcium concentration in the pore water (“foundation soil”) overlying the calcium rich soil. In the third (“control case”), the GCL only rested on the foundation soil. The overburden pressure was 15 kPa. The moisture content of GCL increased to 96%, 86% and 108% in the first 279 days for Cases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Under isothermal conditions, the GCL moisture content decreased to 80% and 67% for Cases 1 and 2 respectively and increased to 113% for Case 3. After 1100 days, the hydraulic conductivity (k) of the GCL was 4×10-11 m/s for Case 3 but had increased up to about 7×10-11 m/s and 2×10-10 m/s for cases with and without the foundation layer respectively. The results are used to calibrate finite element models. A good correlation was found between k the bulk void ratio (eB) of GCL.&#xd;
Leakage and contaminant transport through 10 mm diameter hole in a geomembrane in a composite liner involving a GCL is examined at a stress of 100 kPa for hydraulic heads of 0.3 or 1 m. When permeated with distilled water, the interface transmissivity (θ) was about 2.3 × 10 11 m2/s. After 800 days of permeation with 0.14M NaCl there was only about 3% increase in the flow despite an order of magnitude increase in GCL permeability near the hole because θ decreased from 2.3×10-11 m2/s to 1.1×10-11 m2/s and controlled the leakage despite the increase in GCL permeability. Numerical modeling demonstrated reasonable agreement with the observed transport.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2010-09-09 12:17:46.904</description>
   <description>Many studies of ‘executive control’ have focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which contains the neuronal functional properties, modulatory neurotransmitters, and network connections with sensory and motor regions to make this large brain area a candidate region to provide all the necessary elements to voluntarily control behavior. However, like the motor and premotor cortex, the PFC is integrated with the basal ganglia (BG) in such a similar fashion, that it is impossible not to consider that the PFC might depend on the BG to implement executive control effectively. This thesis draws on knowledge of PFC and BG function, and combines studies that require the instantaneous top-down control over motor behavior with a neurological patient group with primarily BG dysfunction (Parkinson’s disease), to provide for a new understanding of prefrontal-BG networks sub-serving executive control. The tasks performed by subjects consist of antisaccades (generate a voluntary eye-movement away from a visual stimulus) and those dealing with task switching (change behavior after an alternate was previously required). Numerous neural and functional imaging studies have identified key areas of the prefrontal cortex and BG that are critical to antisaccade generation, and studies in task switching have implicated similar neural mechanisms that are involved in overriding one behavior with another. By combining task switching with antisaccades, this thesis specifically examines the neural mechanisms related to suddenly changing behavior, under conditions where one behavior is easier to perform than the other. The methods utilize on-line eye-tracking in healthy young adults and older adults with, and without, Parkinson’s disease, to develop theories of a role of the BG in executive control, and to search for specific neural correlates of executive control signals in the PFC, premotor cortex and BG using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Together, the conclusions drawn from this thesis point to an important role of the BG in overriding more automatic behavior with behavior that is more difficult to perform. This thesis also suggests that this overriding mechanism occurs through the boosting of cortical executive control signals via net excitatory feedback from the BG.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we directly consider an object tracking problem for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), called track persistence.  Track persistence temporally extends the problem of object tracking by seeking to store and retrieve the entire history of an object.  To provide an initial solution to track persistence, we develop two distinct algorithms.  The first algorithm, update to sink, translates track persistence into a centralized problem.  The second algorithm, a linked list-like algorithm, builds a dynamic data structure as the object traverses the network, and rebuilds the object history distributively upon demand.  We conduct worst case analysis upon both of these algorithms.  Finally, we implement a simulation environment and run a number of tests upon both algorithms.  Track persistence is a very challenging problem, and this thesis contributes a pair of solutions which stand as a basis for future research.</description>

   <description>This thesis is an examination of the role of reason in the thought of the left-leaning writer, publisher, editor and journalist Leonard Woolf.  Examining Woolf’s response to political radicalization and impending international conflict between 1930 and 1940, this discussion contends that Woolf sought to emphasise human thought, reason and individual psychology as a response to interwar anxieties about cultural crisis.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2010-09-14 15:26:49.565</description>
   <description>Background: Street connectivity, an important aspect of the built environment, refers to the directness of links and the density of connections in road networks.  Street connectivity of youth’s neighborhoods may impact upon both physical activity patterns and the occurrence of physical activity injuries in street locations.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The objectives of the two studies comprising this thesis were to examine, among Canadian youth in grades 6 to 10: (1) the relationship between street connectivity and physical activity, and (2) the relationship between street connectivity and physical activity injuries occurring in the street.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: 9,717 youth in grades 6-10 from 188 schools across Canada participated in the 2006 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey.  A street connectivity composite measure was gathered objectively using a geographic information system database, and was based on intersection density, average block length, and connected node ratio in a 5km radius around each school.  Physical activity was measured via students’ self-reported hours of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week outside of school hours.  Injury was measured via students’ self-reports to questions regarding whether they had suffered an injury while playing in the street in the past 12 months.  Multi-level regression analyses were used to examine the relations between street connectivity and both physical activity and injury.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Compared to students living in the highest street connectivity quartile, those in the second (Relative Risk (RR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.35), third (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.13-1.37), and fourth (lowest; RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.09-1.34) quartiles reported considerably higher levels of physical activity outside of school hours.  Conversely, students living in neighbourhoods with low street connectivity reported higher occurrence of physical activity injuries occurring in the street relative to students living in highly connected neighbourhoods (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.47; 95% CI 0.94 -2.31).&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Neighbourhoods with low street connectivity may be conducive to youth physical activity, yet they may also result in an increased risk of injury.  Further, the relationship between street connectivity and physical activity reported in Canadian youth is not consistent with the relationship reported for adult populations.  This variation requires consideration in applied health policy.</description>

   <description>Wireless multi-hop relay systems are the newest amendment to the IEEE 802.16 standard for local and metropolitan area networks, else known as WiMAX. Relay systems come in different flavours, based on their capabilities and have the potential to offer many advantages over the single-hop technology. Upcoming broadband wireless technologies, that utilize multi-hop relays, need good network planning and design in order to achieve their full potential.&#xd;
There are two main types of multi-hop relay stations: transparent, which are not able to transmit control information and non-transparent, which have the capability to transmit such information. This study focuses mainly on non-transparent relay stations due to their complexity and ability to operate in a more than two hop environment. Currently, the latest IEEE amendment provides two different frame structures − single and multi-frame − for utilization in multi-hop relay networks, to allocate bandwidth. &#xd;
The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the two proposed frame structures, in various network scenarios in terms of delay, throughput, rate, and user capacity. In addition, we will discuss some of the issues that need to be considered to cost effectively plan and design a multi-hop relay network. The evaluation methodology that we utilize is in accordance with the Multi-hop Relay System Evaluation Methodology developed by the IEEE 802.16 Broadband Wireless Access Working Group.&#xd;
To evaluate the above frame structures we developed an evaluation model for use in the network simulator 2 (ns2) from University of California Berkeley, by modifying the light WiMAX (LWX) add-on from Taiwan University. Unlike the original LWX module, which supports only transparent relay configurations, our module supports both multi-frame and single frame structures, as well as non-transparent multi-hop relay environments. &#xd;
To our knowledge there is no previous work, which analyzes the performance of the single frame and multi-frame system in multi-hope relay environments using the guidelines from the latest amendment to the standard (IEEE 802.16j-2009). Moreover, there is no publicly available software that will enable the study of such performance. The resulting source code of our work has been made publicly available and can be obtained from our website.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to measure the relationship between the motivation and learning outcomes of incoming exchange students at Queen’s University. The majority of research on study abroad programs measures the learning outcomes of U.S. students abroad in courses and programs designed exclusively for them. What is lacking is research on participants in exchange programs where incoming students study alongside, and are immersed in a similar living environment to, local students.&#xd;
The present study adds to the literature on study abroad by providing information about motivation and learning outcomes resulting from participating in an exchange. Using a pre-test/post-test research design, this study examines how both motivation and learning outcomes vary by gender, program of study, region of origin, duration of study and first language. The Study Abroad Goals Scale was used to measure motivation in the pre-test (n = 182) and the Global Perspectives Inventory (GPI) measured learning outcomes in both the pre- and post-test of incoming exchange students to Queen’s university in the 2009-2010 academic year (n = 98). &#xd;
Results indicate that the strongest motivation of the incoming exchange students was Cross-Cultural, followed by Academic and Personal/Social. Motivation differences were found in each independent variable except for gender indicating that motivation to study on exchange is not uniform among all participants. Findings from the measures of the GPI did not indicate any significant changes between the pre- and post-test. This suggests that participation in an exchange program does not necessarily lead to student development and that program administrators may need to implement proactive learning interventions to enhance the exchange experience for students.</description>

   <description>In this PhD thesis, the preparation of several types of hybrid materials of block copolymer and magnetic nanoparticles is described. The diversified morphologies of nanoaggregates formed by dispersing poly(glyceryl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) tri-block copolymers in block selective solvents will be reported first.  The volume occupied by the core block in these nanoaggregates can be swollen by solvent, and the core block can be sculpted.  The cores can act potentially as the template to grow magnetic nanoparticles. Thus, a potential method for preparing hybrid magnetic materials of block copolymers and magnetic nanoparticles with different morphologies is developed. &#xd;
A one-pot method to synthesize cobalt nanoparticles covered by a polymer shell is then reported.  This is achieved by thermally decomposing dicobalt octacarbonyl in the presence of polymeric multi-dentate ligand poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(acrylic acid). Using a similar method, cobalt nanoparticles covered by poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacryate)-block-poly(acrylic acid) ligand are synthesized. The cobalt nanoparticles fuse into chains for their magnetic dipole-dipole interaction.  The chains are then coated with poly(tert-butyl acrylate)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate). The coated Co chains are further locked by photo-crosslinking the poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate) segments. The as-prepared cobalt nano wires have interesting magnetic response and may be used to build complicated magnetic nano devices.&#xd;
Another hybrid magnetic material is prepared via an oil-in-water emulsion method. The oil phase of the emulsion sphere consists of r-Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticles covered with the poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacryate)-block-poly(acrylic acid) ligand and a poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacryate) homopolymer. It was dispersed in water using a mixture of poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(succinoylglyceryl methacrylate) and poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(glyceryl methacrylate) as the surfactants. The evaporation of the organic solvent left behind solid particles in water. The polymer chains on the surface of the obtained spheres allow the immobilization of biomolecules. Factors affecting the emulsion process are studied systematically. The emulsion spheres are characterized using TEM, AFM, TGA and etc. The emulsion sphere have potential application is immunoassay. The protein binding capacity of the spheres is determined.</description>

   <description>This dissertation contributes to a growing literature on affective forecasting showing that people are often inaccurate when predicting their future emotions, particularly the emotion of regret (Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2003).  In the current program of research I explored the differences in the anticipated and experienced regret of participants who worked (or imagined working) either alone or as part of a group.  In Experiment One I demonstrated that participants anticipated more regret from failing a task when alone than from failing a task that when working as part of a group. I speculated that this occurs because working with a group allows one to blame others for a failure, thus reducing one’s own regret.  In Experiment Two I demonstrated that although participants anticipated more regret from an individual relative to a group failure, the regret they actually experienced is equivalent in these conditions. I hypothesised that this is because the psychological immune system (Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, &amp; Wheatley, 1998) works hard to reduce the regret of the participants who worked alone to levels matching that of the participants who worked in groups.  I also demonstrated that this psychological immune system takes time to reduce regret differences in levels of regret were found between participants in the group and alone conditions when participants reported their regret immediately, but when regret was reported after a delay, these differences were no longer found.  In Experiment Three I ruled out a potential confound by demonstrating that the differences between Experiments One and Two were not due to participants thinking of different time frames while reporting their regret.  In Experiments Four and Five I extended my program of research by investigating whether the anticipated and experienced regret that is caused by failing a task varies depending on whether one is working with in-group or out-group partners.  I found that while participants anticipate more regret from failing a task with an in-group compared to an out-group partner, the regret they ultimately experience is not affected by the group status of their partner.  Implications and future directions are discussed.</description>

   <description>Understanding why, when, and with whom women engage in opportunities for HIV &amp; AIDS education is critical in exploring the extent to which popular education strategies promote transformational learning among women in Malindi, Kenya.  Three central questions animate this research: a) What do rural women who participate in HIV &amp; AIDS popular education programs learn about HIV &amp; AIDS, b) through what range of pedagogical practices and theories does their learning occur, and c) how does this learning contribute to transformative changes that improve women's health, at both individual (e.g., beliefs, behaviour) and communal levels (e.g., group actions)?  Employing a qualitative research design, face-to-face interviews, and document analysis of secondary sources enabled a rich and in-depth exploration of specific learnings and actions among Kenyan women.  Qualitative analysis of eight semi-structured interviews reveals three dimensions of transformative learning among adult women in Malindi, including a) striving towards openness, b) culture of support, and c) connected knowing.  These inter-related themes outline the potential for Kenyan women's HIV &amp; AIDS education to move beyond instrumental, and communicative, to more empowering transformative learning.</description>
