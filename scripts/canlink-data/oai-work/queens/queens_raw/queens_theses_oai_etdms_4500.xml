   <description>Traditional relational database systems are not practical for big data workloads that require scalable architectures for efficient data storage, manipulation, and analysis. Apache Hadoop, one of these big data frameworks, provides distributed storage and processing as well as a central repository for different types of data from different sources. Data integration from various sources is often required before performing analytics. Apache Hive on Hadoop is widely used for this purpose, as well as for data summarization and analysis. It has features such as a SQL-like query language, a Metastore to hold metadata and file formats to support access to various frameworks on Hadoop and beyond. For comprehensive analysis and decision-making, however, a hybrid system is required to integrate Hadoop with traditional relational database management systems in order to access the valuable data stored in relational databases. Current hybrid systems are either expensive proprietary products or require a system to be developed by the user, which requires programming knowledge. In addition these approaches are not sufficiently flexible to be applied to other frameworks.&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose a framework called BINARY (A framework for Big data INtegration for Ad-hoc queRYing). BINARY is a hybrid Software as a Service that provides a web interface supported by a back-end infrastructure for ad-hoc querying, accessing, visualizing and joining data from different data sources, including Relational Database Management Systems and Apache Hive. Our framework uses scalable Hive and HDFS big data storage systems and supports different data sources via back-end resource adapters. There is also a front-end web interface that enables the use of HiveQL to query the data sources.&#xd;
The framework is extendable and allows adding other storage engines (e.g. HBase) and analytics engines (e.g. R) as needed. We used REST software architecture to enable loose connections between the engines and the User Interface programs to facilitate independent updates without affecting the data infrastructure. Our approach is validated with a proof-of-concept prototype implemented on the OpenStack cloud system.</description>

   <description>Communications between nano-devices is an emerging research field in nanotechnology. Molecular Communication (MC), which is a bio-inspired paradigm, is a promising technique for communication in nano-network. In MC, molecules are administered to exchange information among nano-devices. Due to the nature of molecular signals, traditional communication methods can’t be directly applied to the MC framework. The objective of this thesis is to present novel diffusion-based MC methods when multi nano-devices communicate with each other in the same environment. A new channel model and detection technique along with a molecular-based access method, are proposed in here for communication between asynchronous users. &#xd;
In this work, the received molecular signal is modeled as a Gaussian mixture distribution when the MC system undergoes Brownian noise and inter-symbol interference (ISI). This novel approach demonstrates a suitable modeling for diffusion-based MC system. Using the proposed Gaussian mixture model, a simple receiver is designed by minimizing the error probability. To determine an optimum detection threshold, an iterative algorithm is derived which minimizes a linear approximation of the error probability function. Also, a memory-based receiver is proposed to improve the performance of the MC system by considering previously detected symbols in obtaining the threshold value. Numerical evaluations reveal that theoretical analysis of the bit error rate (BER) performance based on the Gaussian mixture model match simulation results very closely. &#xd;
Furthermore, in this thesis, molecular code division multiple access (MCDMA) is proposed to overcome the inter-user interference (IUI) caused by asynchronous users communicating in a shared propagation environment. Based on the selected molecular codes, a chip detection scheme with an adaptable threshold value is developed for the MCDMA system when the proposed Gaussian mixture model is considered. Results indicate that the MCDMA system is a promising approach to reduce interference created by asynchronous nodes in multi-user MC systems. Meanwhile, the receiver is modified by exploiting previously detected chips to eliminate the ISI. The performance evaluations via computer simulations show that the memory-based receiver, which considers previously detected chips in detection procedure, outperforms the memory-less receiver.</description>

   <description>High performance microprocessors are promoting the development of modern electronic devices such as smart phones and tablets. These microprocessors have stricter requirement on the power supplies in terms of efficiency and overall size since power supplies are directly affecting performance of microprocessors. These power supplies are directly built right next to loads and they are called Point-of-Load (POL) power supplies.&#xd;
The conventional Buck converter has been the dominant method for implementing non-isolated DC-DC POL power supplies. With the increasing demand to miniaturize the voltage regulators for computers and telecommunication products, high power density POL converter topologies are highly desirable in satisfying this trend. But the difficulty of increasing power density of Buck converter makes Buck no longer to be a good candidate for modern electronic devices. In this thesis, two topologies are proposed to address this issue.&#xd;
First of all, the Asymmetrical Three-Level (ATL) converter is proposed. ATL features reduced voltage and doubled equivalent operating frequency on the inductor compared with the conventional Buck and three level Buck converter.&#xd;
Secondly, the modified Asymmetrical Three-Level (mATL) converter is proposed for the application of high output current. The two-phase mATL converter has reduced voltage and doubled equivalent operating frequency on each inductor compared with the two-phase Buck converter. Also, two interleaved inductor current cancels each other to reduce output current ripple.&#xd;
Finally, the inherent automatic inductor-current sharing mechanism of mATL converter is demonstrated and studied. Also, a new control scheme, Negative Circulating Control (NCC) scheme is proposed to achieve automatic inductor-current sharing in discontinuous conduction mode. Besides, a new control scheme is proposed to extend the output voltage range of mATL converter.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Cultural Studies) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-19 21:45:21.146</description>
   <description>In the last quarter century, a steadily increasing number of North Americans, when asked their religious affiliation, have self-identified as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR). Resultantly, a wealth of literature on the subject of contemporary spirituality has recently emerged. Some suggest, generally, that we are seeing the emergence of a “progressive spirituality” that is potentially transformative and socially conscious. Conversely, there are scholars who have taken a more critical stance toward this recent cultural development, positing that contemporary spirituality is a byproduct of the self-obsessed culture which saturates the west, or that spirituality, at its worst, is simply a rebranding of religion in order to support consumer culture and the ideology of capitalism. One problem with the majority of this literature is that scholars have tended to offer essentialist or reductionist accounts of spirituality, which rely primarily on a combination of theoretical and textual analysis, ignoring both the lived aspect of spirituality in contemporary society and its variation across generations. This thesis is an attempt to mitigate some of this controversy whilst contributing to this burgeoning scholarly field. I do so by shedding light on contemporary spirituality, as it exists in its lived form. Espousing a lived religion framework, and using the qualitative data I collected from conducting semi-structured interviews with twenty Canadian millennials who consider themselves “spiritual but not religious,” I assess the cogency of the dominant etic accounts of contemporary spirituality in the academic literature. I offer a critical analysis of their normative conclusions in light of the lived accounts of my research participants. Using four core ethics—the ethic of self-responsibility, the ethic of authenticity, the ethic of productivity, and the ethic of self-awareness—pertaining to the shared framework of self-spirituality as focal points of analysis, this thesis looks to flesh out the lived relationship between contemporary spirituality and social justice related attitudes and action among Canadian millennials.</description>

   <description>This study investigates the applicability of seismic stress inversion in a mining environment with active geological structure, in order to map spatiotemporal stress states. First Motion Stress Inversion (MOTSI) (Abers, 2001) software is utilized, whereby this research outlines methods to establish spatiotemporal domains, determine&#xd;
inversion reliability and sensitivity, and explore the applicability and limitations&#xd;
of detecting stress state changes through seismic stress inversion.&#xd;
The application of spatiotemporal discretization to the methodology allows domains to be representative of pseudo-homogeneous stress states, to increase the reliability and resolution of mapped stresses. Geological structures are established as discrete boundaries of inversion domains, and were found to produce unique stress tensors representative of homogeneous stress states that differed from the stress states in adjacent domains. High seismic event frequency is established as a bound between temporal domains and stricter  filters produce more reliable inversions. Stress tensors produced through the inversion method indicate an evolution&#xd;
of the stress path over time. Stress states only influenced by mining are gradual and smooth, whereas in the case of fault-slip, the evolution appears to display sharp changes at the time of the events. A significant limitation of this method is data sparsity. This is directly related to the number of filters applied to the dataset, thus a balance between filter strictness and database size must be considered. This work demonstrates the weak and brittle behaviour of the faults and that interconnected geological structure is significant in the seismic expression of the failure mechanism and can be captured through the inversion method. Through more research, the implementation of this method in real-time may bring insight as to which spatial domains or structures are at risk of fault slip, in addition to mapping the stress state. Overall, through an improved understanding of the stress state adjacent to weak structures, it is expected that seismic stress inversion will lead to greater reliability of stability analysis, consequently improving the design process for deep mines.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Law) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-21 17:27:18.188</description>
   <description>This thesis examines whether the economic benefits of international commerce are or can be equitably distributed between countries through international tax systems. It explores how international tax revenue is presently allocated between nations and considers how such allocations could be made more equitable. The idea that international tax revenues should be equitably shared between countries is implicit in the concept of inter-nation equity. Broadly, the concept proposes that countries should share their international tax base (or revenues) in a manner that is fair to all of the countries concerned. It forms the basis for a theoretical model of the relationships between the international tax system, inter-country distributive justice, and the socioeconomic disparities between countries. However, the distributive justice aspects of the concept as it is currently understood are problematic. This thesis investigates these concerns in both the theory of inter-nation equity and its application in international tax systems. The thesis finds that the current bases on which international tax is allocated do not support systematic redistribution between countries, partly because of a lack of clear distributive justice objectives in the underlying principle of inter-nation equity. To cure this shortcoming, the thesis offers two broad recommendations. First, the concept of inter-nation equity should be expanded to include the element of redistribution as an explicit and integral component. Second, to support such a redistributive element, quantifiable determinants, such as the relative wealth of countries and the respective incomes that they earn from mutual cross-border commerce should be used as the basis for allocating tax between countries. Such changes would encourage countries to share their international tax revenues in a manner that is fair as well as systematically redistributive, rendering the inter-country tax allocation process more equitable.</description>

   <description>Freshwater ecosystems in Ontario are affected by a growing number of multiple stressors, with climate change often acting as a “threat multiplier”. Diatom-based paleolimnological approaches are used to provide the much needed long-term ecological information for embayments and lakes in and around Georgian Bay. In Chapter 2, the relative importance of nutrients and warming on the recent increase in sedimentary Asterionella formosa relative abundances in George Lake by comparing regional air temperature trends, 20 years of annually measured lake water nutrients (total nitrogen, total inorganic nitrogen, and total phosphorus), and long-term regional total inorganic nitrogen deposition data.  Recent increases in A. formosa occur during the warmest period on record, even in the absence of nutrient enrichment. In Chapter 3, sedimentary diatom assemblages from two lakes in Killarney Provincial Park (north of Georgian Bay) are shown to clearly track the acidification of regional lakes around the turn of the 20th century in response to smelting activities in Sudbury, Ontario. Although the Killarney lakes showed signs of chemical recovery (increase in pH), the recent (post-1980s) diatom assemblages are not similar to either pre-acidification or acidification assemblages suggesting factors such as climate warming are partly driving recent diatom assemblage changes, rather than simply chemical recovery. In Chapter 4, diatom responses to shoreline development and climate warming in three embayments from southeastern Georgian Bay, two with shoreline development (impact) and one without (unimpacted). In the early 20th century, compositional changes in diatoms at the two impacted embayments are indicative of a modest increase in nutrient conditions. In the mid to late-20th and early 21st centuries, pronounced shifts towards higher abundances of lightly silicified pennate (Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis) and/or small centric (Cyclotella ocellata, C. comensis, and C. gordonensis) planktonic diatoms at all three embayments were consistent with a response to warming and associated changes in thermal and other physical properties. Collectively, my studies show that diatom assemblages are tracking long-term changes in limnological variables, but with the prevalence of multiple environmental stressors in a warming climate, diatom assemblages are on a new trajectory and therefore unlikely to return to pre-industrial scenarios.</description>

   <description>Champlain Sea clay is a sensitive marine clay deposited within the St. Lawrence lowlands during the later stages of the Wisconsin glaciation. The sensitive clay has been known to transform from a relatively brittle material to a liquid mass when subjected to shear distortion. As a result, large-scale retrogressive landslides are common within natural slopes in Eastern Ontario and Quebec.  Multiple retrogressive failures have been observed along the slopes of the Mud Creek river valley, however, these failures display rather unique behaviors, involving limited retrogressive distances, and episodic retrogressive events. The mechanisms involved with these failures are not yet adequately understood. Therefore, a laboratory testing program was initiated to place the geotechnical properties of the Champlain Sea clay deposits at Mud Creek in context with those of more renowned large-scale retrogressive events. Results of this study indicate that the Mud Creek field site is heavily overconsolidated, and that strength properties at Mud Creek are similar to those of large-scale retrogressive failures. As such, it is concluded that the small heights of the river banks at Mud Creek, in combination with relatively high undrained shear strengths, do not allow for undrained conditions to develop after initial failure events. Therefore, retrogression at Mud Creek can be described as a series of drained failures, the frequency of which is determined by the seasonal shear deformations caused by elevated total heads induced by spring thaws. &#xd;
To understand the groundwater regime at Mud Creek, hydrogeological modelling was conducted on two separate spring melt events. These models successfully match the in-situ field measurements (±30mm) for two separate geometries while maintaining all material properties constant and varying only the magnitude of infiltration. Investigations into potential triggering mechanisms indicated that instances of two rapid snowmelts, separated by less than two weeks, resulted in a worst case scenario for slope stability. This triggering mechanism was observed to be present prior to the retrogressive failure events at Mud Creek in 2012 and 2013.</description>

   <subject>Sieves</subject>
   <subject>Distribution of primes</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-23 13:21:39.438</description>
   <description>This thesis focuses on some of the key sieve theoretic ideas behind recent progress on bounded gaps between the primes. One such idea is the notion of  higher rank sieve weights, first proposed by Atle Selberg and applied successfully to the context of prime k-tuples by J. Maynard and T. Tao. We develop an axiomatic formulation for a general higher rank sieve, in the spirit of Selberg's own treatment of his classical sieve. We apply this theory to an assortment of problems such as almost prime k-tuples and  prime k-tuples in imaginary quadratic fields with class number 1. &#xd;
&#xd;
Another novel idea that was brought to the forefront by the path-breaking work of Yitang Zhang is that of obtaining new equidistribution results for the primes by making the moduli "smooth" or free of large prime factors. We develop a general method to incorporate the technique of smoothing the moduli into the higher rank sieve and apply this to prime k-tuples. &#xd;
&#xd;
In a different vein, the last chapter of the thesis expands upon the well-known parity principle in sieve theory. We show that sufficient "randomness" in the sign of the M\"obius function, combined with another conjecture about the equidistribution of the primes in arithmetic progressions,  can be used to break the parity barrier and yield infinitely many twin primes.</description>

   <description>There exists within the corpus of extant Greek and Roman literature a work by Plutarch, the Apophthegmata Lakonika that has been looked upon dubiously by scholars. However, the scholarly neglect of the Sayings of the Spartans has created another unnecessary barrier to gaining a better understanding of the Spartans. Although heavily influenced by the Spartan mirage, the Apophthegmata Lakonika represents a valuable source of insight into the mindset and personality of the average Spartan. The intent of this study is to examine key selections of the Sayings and comparing them to historical events that either reflect, or contradict, the values expressed in the Sayings. This study will focus on five fundamental areas: patriotism, nerves, obedience, contempt for wealth, and the Spartan relationship with death. The intended approach is to examine several Sayings that discuss each value, and then compare that evidence with the historical record to confirm or deny their authenticity as Spartan traits. By dissecting the Sayings and examining them in this way, we can begin to dissect features of the Spartan mirage that have developed over the course of thousands of years of scholarship. We can begin to divide the fictitious and fallacious aspects of the Spartan mirage from authentic fact, and in doing so gain a new avenue with which to interact with Spartan culture. The implications of such a study are wide-reaching. By affirming the validity of the Apophthegmata Lakonika we can both open it to further examination as well as reinvigorate an otherwise neglected area of scholarly study. The name “Spartan” has always echoed with authority within the ancient tradition – and such an echo deserves its due within academic scholarship, rather than its status as near anathema for much of the latter half of the 20th century.</description>

   <description>This research develops a methodology for three dimensional, multi-stage, large deformation, finite element contact analysis, which considers the effects of thermo-plasticity and austenite decomposition. The developed methodology is applied to the forming process of a transmission clutch hub which is constructed from UHSS 22MnB5 for the purpose of automotive lightweighting. The entire process chain is considered, including the hot stamping process, in which a high temperature blank enters a stamping press with actively cooled tooling. The press then forms the blank and remains closed, so as to cool the part rapidly enough to induce phase transformations in the material. The resulting part increases in strength by up to 250% during this process. This research focuses on simulating the entire multi-stage stamping process including cold formed stages but with the exception of piercing and trimming operations. The clutch hub is currently manufactured from 2.5mm thick HSLA and a transition to 1.5mm thick 22MnB5 is proposed. This would represent a 38% mass reduction if successful. Typically, 22MnB5 has been reserved for structural components, which have substantially less complex geometry than that of a typical transmission clutch hub, thereby increasing the complexity of the problem. Simulations including austenite decomposition were carried out using the non-linear finite element solver LS-DYNA. In order to validate the numerical models, three criteria were evaluated and compared to experimental data: material thickness, lubrication hole geometry, and Vickers hardness. It was found that the thickness distribution of the numerical model accurately represented the thickness distribution of the cold formed stage. The error in thickness estimation was 0.91% for the cold stage. Thickness change during the hot formed stage was only considered at the splines. The final geometry of the lubrication hole presented by the numerical model also closely resembled that of the experimental result: the error between the numerical and experimental model was 1.4% in the major diameter, where the primary stretching occurred. Finally, Vickers hardness values for both models were compared at 11 points distributed along the radial direction and the error was found to be an average of 13.5%.</description>

   <description>Contemporary Western consumer culture frequently promotes monolithic and unrealistic body standards for women. Traditional and mainstream beauty and fashion industries advertise the “ideal” body type as very thin, white, young and able-bodied. Consequently, many issues surrounding body image dissatisfaction and disordered eating in women have often been connected to such exclusive and narrow ideals. This thesis will argue that new media landscapes present new and promising options for women to send and receive alternative and positive knowledge about their bodies. &#xd;
In the first chapter, I outline my personal experiences with disordered eating, in order to provide the reader with insight into the conditions that guide my research, before I review literature regarding disordered eating, the thin ideal and the shift from traditional sources of media to new media landscapes. The body of this thesis surrounds two case studies that work to demonstrate my argument about the possibilities new media presents for women’s body image. In the second chapter, I analyze the first case study, Beauty Redefined, an online media-literacy based brand that highlights conditions and consequences of mainstream beauty ideals and encourages awareness and resistance to them. In the third chapter, I examine the second case study, GabiFresh, a plus size fashion blog by Gabi Gregg that promotes body acceptance and encourages style regardless of size, seemingly in line with fat activism. In the last chapter, I outline possible future research directions, inspiration for a personal project and conclusions about my analysis on the two case studies and new media landscapes. As a feminist, and because of my experiences with disordered eating, I use both feminist media analysis and auto-ethnography as my primary methodologies throughout this piece.</description>

   <description>Given the increasing complexity of engineering systems, difficulties are often met in developing models that describe these systems accurately. If the model is used for the purpose of optimization, the true plant optimum cannot be achieved in the presence of plant-model-mismatch. Extremum-seeking control is a model free real-time optimization technique that is well suited for the optimization of uncertain processes. This work presents a constrained time-varying extremum seeking control approach for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems. An interior point method is used to enforce the constraints. The proposed method has the ability to guarantee feasibility of a closed-loop system during optimization. The transient performance of the technique is compared to that of a constrained extremum-seeking approach in 1 dimension [Mills and Kristic, 2015]. Simulation results presented show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in solving constrained optimization problems within the stated constraints. The proposed technique is employed for the minimization of the unit power consumption of an operational nitrogen liquefier. In this thesis, the steady-state relationship between the manipulated variables, which include feed gas discharge pressure, turbine flow ratio, heat exchanger sub-cooler level set point, and the unit power consumption of the liquefier is investigated. The simulation model is used to estimate the steady-state unit power using varying values of the turbine flow ratio at different operating conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that a small but significant reduction in the unit power of the liquefier can be realized. This study clearly identifies the potential for the use of extremum-seeking control for the minimization of unit-power in real-time.</description>

   <description>Toward the efficient solvolysis of phosphate esters and amides under mild conditions, many small-molecule metal-containing catalysts have been designed to activate the substrate toward metal-mediated nucleophilic addition. However, very few systems have been designed to also employ a metal ion to activate the leaving group (LG) toward departure. To this end, the following studies were undertaken to ascertain the magnitude and mechanism of metal ion-promoted leaving group assistance.&#xd;
&#xd;
The solvolysis of a specially-designed set of phosphate mono-, di-, and triesters, having a Cu(II)-complexed 2-phenanthrolyl group at the ortho-position of a departing phenoxide, was studied in water and ethanol under pH-controlled conditions at 25 °C. A combination of pH/rate profiles, solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect (DKIE) values, and activation parameters were collected and compared to the results in methanol. While a detailed comparison of the activation parameters reveals complex trends due to changes in the reaction medium, the rate-accelerating effects of the Cu(II)-promoted leaving group assistance in all three solvents are substantial, ranging from 10^5 to 10^15 relative to their background reactions.&#xd;
&#xd;
The methanolysis of the Cu(II) complexes of a series of substituted N,N-bis(2-picolyl)benzamides was studied under sspH-controlled conditions at 25 °C. Hammett reaction constants, solvent DKIE values, activation parameters, and computational results describe a mechanism where the metal ion, coordinated to the N,N-bis(2-picolyl)amide unit, delivers a Cu(II)-coordinated methoxide to the carbonyl group in the rate-limiting transition state of the reaction. The metal ion appears to activate the substrate through coordination to the amide nitrogen, activate and deliver the nucleophile, and subsequently assist LG departure. Expanding upon this work revealed a common mechanism for the methanolysis and ethanolysis of the Ni(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II) complexes of &#xd;
N,N-bis(2-picolyl)-p-nitrobenzamide and N,N-bis((1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)methyl)-p-nitrobenzamide. Comparing the rate constants for the attack of alkoxide on the M(II)-complexed 4 nitro-substituted benzamides to those for the uncomplexed forms reveals accelerations ranging from 10^14 to 10^19.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, the palladacycle-promoted methanolysis of a series of thiobenzanilides with different LGs was studied under sspH-controlled conditions at 25 °C. The kinetic data indicate that two mechanisms are operative wherein either one or two catalysts effect cleavage depending on the nature of the LG.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-27 14:03:57.757</description>
   <description>Spectrum estimation is an essential technique for analyzing time series data. A leading method in the field of spectrum estimation is the multitaper method. The multitaper method has been applied to many scientific fields and has led to the development of new methods for detection signals and modeling periodic data. Within these methods there are open problems concerning parameter selection, signal detection rates, and signal estimation. The focus of this thesis is to address these problems by using techniques from statistical learning theory. This thesis presents three theoretical contributions for improving methods related to the multitaper spectrum estimation method: (1) two hypothesis testing procedures for evaluating the choice of time-bandwidth, NW, and number of tapers, K, parameters for the multitaper method, (2) a bootstrapping procedure for improving the signal detection rates for the F-test for line components, and (3) cross-validation, boosting, and bootstrapping methods for improving the performance of the inverse Fourier transform periodic data estimation method resulting from the F-test. We additionally present two applied contributions: (1) a new atrial signal extraction method for electrocardiogram data, and (2) four new methods for analyzing, modeling, and reporting on hockey game play at the Major Junior level.</description>

   <description>Freshwater systems in Boreal regions are potentially threatened by a number of environmental stressors, such as point and non-point source pollutants from industrial development and climate change. In northeast Alberta, industrial activity in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) threatens nearby lakes, and potentially lakes downwind. In the late- 1990’s rapid annual increases in the mining of bitumen occurred, with corresponding increases in emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides. Recent paleolimnological studies have provided indications of increased primary production in a number of lakes in Alberta and northwest Saskatchewan. Several studies in other regions have linked deposition of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to nutrient enrichment of freshwater ecosystems, and a potential increase in primary producers. However, due to regional warming, the degree to which deposition of Nr to lakes downwind of the AOSR influences primary producers remains unknown.&#xd;
I investigated the relative influence of climate change and enhanced Nr deposition on scaled-chrysophyte production in northwest Saskatchewan lakes. To disentangle the influence of the two stressors, a paleolimnological assessment of 16 lakes was undertaken. Reference and impact lakes with respect to Nr deposition were chosen, and nutrient limitation was integrated into the study design to identify lake sensitivity to Nr deposition (N or P or co-limited). Scaled- chrysophyte assemblages were dominated by the taxon Mallomonas crassisquama, and little change occurred in species assemblages since ca 1900. However, recent (post ca 1980) increases in total chrysophyte abundance in cores from both reference and impact sites suggested a regional stressor (i.e. climate) as a driving factor. However, because of the low number of study lakes and small lake environmental gradient, the number of study sites was increased to 26 to further understand chrysophyte response to warming in the region. Breakpoint analysis on scale-&#xd;
ii&#xd;
to-diatom ratio time series indicated that shallower sites responded earlier than deeper sites. A canonical variate analysis also suggested that the magnitude of response is also lake specific, with low nutrient and deeper lakes showing larger increases in chrysophyte abundance. The results from this study suggest that a) widespread changes in chrysophyte populations are occurring in this region likely in response to warming and its effects on the thermal structure of lakes, and b) physical and chemical characteristics of lakes are important in modulating ecological change.</description>

   <description>Nickel catalysts play a growing role in effecting a variety of cross-coupling reactions in which carbon-carbon bonds are formed. Nickel compounds have several advantages over more frequently used palladium analogues, including the ability to activate aliphatic electrophiles and to avoid β-hydrogen elimination by alkyl-metal intermediates. Both Ni(II) and Ni(0) precursors are commonly utilized, with the latter oxidation state often believed to function as the catalytically active species. In recent years, however, a number of Ni(I) compounds have also been reported to behave as apparent catalysts and, since Ni(0) and Ni(I) compounds may be readily interconvertible, it is not always clear which oxidation state forms the actual catalyst in any particular cross-coupling reaction. Ni(0) was synthesised using a zinc reduction and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Ni(I) was produced using comproportionation reaction and analyzed with elemental analysis. This thesis describes an investigation in which we compare Ni(0), Ni(I) and Ni(II) complexes containing phosphine and halide (Cl-, Br-, I-) ligands , in this case 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) for their abilities to effect e.g. Buchwald-Hartwig Amination, Heck-Mizoroki and Suzuki-Miyaura reactions with different types of substrates.</description>

   <description>Immigrants play very important roles in maintaining demographic balance, cultural diversity and the economic prosperity of Canada, but new immigrants face challenges such as unemployment, underemployment, job insecurity, poverty and a poorer quality of life (Jackson, 2005). A significant number of foreign-trained skilled workers are employed in low-skilled service sector jobs in major Canadian cities (Creese &amp; Wiebe, 2009). These workers tend to have elevated mental and physical health problems because of lower self-esteem and job dissatisfaction; extended hours of work with minimum wages; and job insecurity. They are generally sleep-deprived and are more likely to follow unhealthy behaviours and lifestyles. Therefore, the major objective of this thesis was to understand the role of work-related stress, job-dissatisfaction, health behaviours and lifestyle in determining mental and physical health status of immigrants working as taxi drivers, and convenience store or gas station workers in the city of Ottawa, Canada. &#xd;
This thesis used a “sequential explanatory” mixed-methods approach of data collection and analysis (Creswell, 2009). Secondary data from the 2001 and 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and primary survey (n=146) and interview (n=19) data collected in the City of Ottawa in 2014 were analyzed to understand skilled immigrants’ mental and physical health status and their determinants. The findings of the research are organized into four chapters. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to understand the determinants of deteriorating health status of the general immigrant population in Canada and also to understand the predictors of mental and physical health status specific to skilled immigrants working in the city of Ottawa. The interview data were analyzed using a Grounded Theory (GT) approach to understand perceived work-related stress, social status and health status of high-skilled immigrants working in low-skilled jobs. &#xd;
The findings reveal that skilled immigrants working in low-skilled jobs have a higher level of work-related stress, job dissatisfaction, and poor mental and physical health status. The findings contribute to the existing literature on the debates about the Healthy Immigrant Effect (HIE), Healthy Worker Effect (HWE) and broader immigration policy by exploring the health status of skilled immigrants working in low-skilled jobs.</description>

   <description>There is a lack of evidence regarding the types of messages that are effective in combating the growing issue of sedentary behaviour among adults. The purpose of the study presented in this thesis was to test the effectiveness of affective, cognitive, and control messages for improving adults’ attitudes and intentions to take breaks from sitting at home and at work. The study also sought to understand whether a match or a mismatch between message type (affective, cognitive) and participant attitude basis (affective, cognitive) resulted in greater attitude change. &#xd;
Two-hundred and ninety-one working adults were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed a pre-message questionnaire that assessed leisure-time physical activity, sitting time and habit, break frequency, perceived behavioural control (PBC), social norms, intentions, and overall, structural, and meta-cognitive attitudes towards breaks from sitting at home and at work. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three message conditions before completing the post-message questionnaire that reassessed all attitudes, intentions, PBC, and social norms, as well as need for affect and need for cognition. ANCOVAs and repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to explore differences between the conditions and domains, respectively. Regressions were used to test for matching/mismatching effects.&#xd;
Study findings indicate that there was a significant difference between the affective and control conditions on intention change (home; p&lt;0.05), such that participants in the affective condition showed significantly greater intention change (home) compared to participants in the control condition. There were no significant differences between the affective and control conditions on the remaining attitude and intention change variables (ps>0.05), nor any significant differences between the affective and cognitive conditions on any of the attitude and intention change variables (ps>0.05). In addition, there were no significant differences between domains in attitude or intention change (ps>0.05). Finally, regressions revealed a relative matching effect for attitudes (home), such that of participants with an affectively-based attitude, those exposed to an affective message had significantly greater positive attitude change compared to those exposed to a cognitive message (p&lt;0.05), but there was no significant difference in attitude change (home) in response to the different messages in those with cognitively-based attitudes (p>0.05). No effects were found for attitudes (work; p>0.05). Future studies should test the impact of these messages on behaviour.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-28 11:47:20.913</description>
   <description>Mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) framework has been attracting more and more attention since late last century. It can be applied to address various  process systems engineering problems, such as process design and operation, large-scale system scheduling, and supply chain management [19,42]. As a class of the many such problems, integrated design and operation of large-scale energy system is to determine both the network design decisions and the flows in operation to achieve the best expected profit, while meeting the customer demands and product specifications. It is well known that these integrated design and operation problems are nonconvex MINLPs, and therefore inherently difficult for which classical gradient-based optimization methods cannot guarantee an optimal solution. Decomposition-based methods have been used to achieve global optimal solutions for nonconvex MINLPs. One of the popular decomposition-based optimization methods is Benders decomposition. Its extensions, generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) [16] and nonconvex generalized Benders decomposition (NGBD) [27], can guarantee the convergence to a global optimum with mild assumptions.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, our primary goal is to incorporate domain reduction into Benders decomposition-based global optimization methods for a class of large-scale energy systems that are MINLP problems with separable structure, which not only ensures a global optimum but also converges faster than the standard Benders decomposition-based methods and commercial global optimization solvers. The research objective is twofold. One is how to reduce the search domain and feasible region with a minimum amount of computation; to achieve this, the domain reduction methods based on convex nonlinear programming (NLP) relaxations [37] are extended to Benders decomposition-based methods. The other is customization of decomposition-based methods for large-scale energy systems; to demonstrate this, an integrated design and operation of natural gas production network problem that addresses gas flows, pressures and uncertainties is proposed with multi-loop NGBD, a customized Benders decomposition-based method that is faster than the regular method by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

   <description>Sucrose synthase (SUS) is the major sucrolytic enzyme of developing fruits,&#xd;
seeds, and tubers responsible for establishing sink strength while allocating imported&#xd;
photosynthate into specific biosynthetic pathways. While SUS has been implicated in&#xd;
directly channeling imported sucrose into starch, xyloglucan, and cellulose biosynthesis,&#xd;
comparatively little is known about its biochemical properties or role in supporting&#xd;
triacylglycerol biosynthesis in developing oil seeds. This thesis examines SUS in the oil-rich&#xd;
endosperm of developing castor oil seeds (Ricinus communis L.). The dominant SUS&#xd;
isozyme from developing endosperm was purified and identified via LC MS/MS as&#xd;
RcSUS1, one of five predicted SUS isozymes encoded by the castor genome.&#xd;
Immunological studies using phosphosite specific antibodies revealed that RcSUS1 is&#xd;
highly phosphorylated at Ser11 during early seed development. The ~10% of RcSUS1 that&#xd;
associates with microsomal membranes was hypophosphorylated relative to its cytosolic&#xd;
counterpart. However, Ser11 phosphorylation affected neither RcSUS1 microsomal&#xd;
association nor its kinetic properties. Instead, decreased Ser11 phosphorylation preceded a&#xd;
marked decline in RcSUS1 activity and polypeptide levels during seed maturation or&#xd;
following sucrose supply removal, suggesting that it triggers its proteolytic turnover. The&#xd;
Ca2+-dependent protein kinase that catalyzes RcSUS1 Ser11 phosphorylation in the&#xd;
developing endosperm was highly purified, thoroughly characterized, and identified as&#xd;
RcCDPK2. Recombinant RcCDPK2 effectively phosphorylated RcSUS1 and its&#xd;
corresponding dephosphopeptide at Ser11. The SUS interactome of developing castor&#xd;
endosperm was assessed via co-immunopurification with anti-RcSUS1-IgG. A 41-kDa&#xd;
polypeptide that co-immunopurified with RcSUS1 was identified as reversibly glycosylated polypeptide 1 (RcRGP1). RcRGP1 was in vivo phosphorylated at Tyr40,&#xd;
Thr165, and Thr338. It is hypothesized that RcSUS1 forms a metabolon with RcRGP1,&#xd;
channeling UDPG directly into hemicellulose and/or glycoprotein/glycolipid&#xd;
biosynthesis. Sucrolytic activity of RcSUS1 was allosterically inhibited by trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) (I50 ~ 200 μM), the first observation of its kind. In plants, T6P is a key&#xd;
signaling metabolite that acts as both a signal and negative feedback regulator of sucrose&#xd;
levels. Feedback inhibition of RcSUS1 by T6P is hypothesized to help regulate sink&#xd;
strength while playing a role in T6P homeostasis. Collective results of this thesis&#xd;
contribute to our understanding of oil seed SUS while identifying novel mechanisms by&#xd;
which phosphorylation and T6P signaling may control SUS activity.</description>

   <description>Cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots have been synthesized extracellularly by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum when treated with CdSO4 in aqueous conditions. The quantum dots produce an emission range primarily between 450 and 550 nm. Optimization into the production system reveals that quantum dots are more efficiently synthesized when F. oxysporum cultures are grown to stationary phase and exposed to 20% mycelial biomass per volume, a pH of 9, a salt stress concentration of 0.25 M, along with the addition of 15 mM of 3-MPA and 25 mM of NaBH4. Synthesis of quantum dots reached a maximum after approximately 5 days of reaction time (120 h). Investigations into the secondary stress metabolism of F.oxysporum suggest that triggering this pathway leads to a higher output of CdS quantum dots. A water and acetone purification technique shows that CdS quantum dots can be extracted successfully from biologically synthesized quantum dot samples and different ratios of water to acetone show purification of different sized quantum dots. The possible mechanisms for CdS quantum dot formation are discussed.</description>

   <title>Nonlinear Analysis of Directional Motion</title>

   <description>Directional data can be represented as unit vectors. This representation defines a nonlinear geometry, in which directions can be considered as points on the unit sphere.  A consistent analysis of directional data would measure distances, calculate means, and describe variations along the surface of the sphere, rather than deviating from the surface using more common Euclidean measures.&#xd;
&#xd;
Some nonlinear analysis methods developed for statistical shape models use a mapping from a nonlinear geometry to a linear tangent space, where familiar principal component analysis can be applied. In biomechanics, linear principal component analysis has been used to analyze directional motions encoded as high-dimensional points;&#xd;
however, this approach does not account for the spherical structure of these data.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, these concepts are combined in a novel motion analysis method, Nonlinear Analysis of Directional Motion. The method was applied to quasi-elliptical motions in a set of one-parameter simulations; it was also &#xd;
applied to wrist circumduction of healthy subjects. The small-circle model, which fits circles smaller than the diameter of a sphere, was used as the comparative standard. &#xd;
&#xd;
In simulation, the nonlinear method out-performed small-circle fitting using one component; this method also accurately captured the number of parameters of the data. Analyzing wrist circumduction, the method&#xd;
produced a five-parameter model, with lower fitting error than the small-circle model after two components. Nonlinear directional analysis also described differences between clockwise and counter-clockwise senses of circumduction in these healthy subjects.&#xd;
&#xd;
Nonlinear analysis of directional motion was demonstrated to provide an accurate model of circumduction with few parameters. This method may be useful for describing kinematic differences in any mechanism that has variable, multi-axial motion.</description>

   <description>At the time of writing, bargaining in Ontario’s education sector is governed under two regimes; The Putting Students First Act - legislation which imposed Collective Agreements across Ontario, and its successor legislation; The School Boards Collective Bargaining Act – which limits workers’ rights to choose who will represent them, and centralizes the bargaining process for some, while keeping it out of reach from others. &#xd;
This paper examines the constitutionality of each regime under Canadian law having regard for the freedom of association, which is a protected right under Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter), and the jurisprudence interpreting that right.&#xd;
The author concludes that both regimes fail to pass constitutional muster. The Putting Students First Act violates the Charter by setting strict parameters on bargaining outcomes for the education sector, unilaterally changing working conditions during bargaining, and by imposing collective agreements which took away a unions’ ability to strike.&#xd;
The School Boards Collective Bargaining Act violates the Charter by designating which unions can represent workers at the central bargaining table, by excluding small unions from central bargaining, and by denying parties the right to strike over certain types of bargaining disputes</description>

   <description>After the discovery of a series of vases at the bottom of a well system at Caere in an apparent ritual closing, this study sets out to determine whether or not this practice was widespread across Etruria and Latium, and what the practice could possibly mean. A catalogue of 80 wells were collected from archaeological reports and articles published over the past 100 years of wells and cisterns in Etruria and Latium; some very interesting similarities and differences can be noted between them and the Caere well system. It seems that the practice of ritual deposits in wells was indeed done across the two areas. There seems to be some uniformity of wells during the Roman Republican period: most are equipped with footrests, and there seems to be a deposit of vases in varying degrees of completeness at or near the bottom; also, certain types of materials seem to recur in each well like the presence of lead, knucklebones, and writing styli. It seems that the ritual deposits were in some cases used to close off a well or cistern as it is a conduit that exists between the living and the world below, and leaving it exposed could be dangerous to the living population.</description>

   <description>This thesis deals with the subject of convergence detection in underground excavations --- typically mining operations. Traditional methods for convergence monitoring involve operose surveying procedures that produce measurements in low density along a drift. The aim of this thesis is to introduce a novel convergence monitoring solution which extracts typical convergence features from point cloud scans in a drift. These features are extracted by convergence indicators. These indicators are amalgamated using a Bayesian statistical approach to build an inference about whether or not convergence is occurring. This algorithm was tested on simulated as well as actual mining convergence drift scans.</description>

   <description>Aims: To determine the effects of ULD α2-AR antagonists on: i) sensory responses in morphine tolerant and nerve injured rats, ii) chronic morphine and nerve-injury induced spinal gliosis and neuronal activation, iii) morphine conditioned place preference (CPP), a paradigm that assesses the affective or emotional component of pain processing.&#xd;
Methods &amp; Results: In a model of opioid tolerance, ULD atipamezole attenuated the loss of morphine antinociception in pain naïve rats, consistent with the literature. Next, a model of neuropathic pain (chronic constriction injury (CCI)) was employed and changes in responses to mechanical and thermal nociceptive stimuli were tracked over time. This was the first study to show positive effects of ULD α2-AR antagonists in alleviating pain hypersensitivity associated with nerve injury and attenuation of morphine tolerance in neuropathic animals. &#xd;
Using immunohistochemistry, tissue collected from all the animals was labeled to determine if molecular changes correlated with the behavior induced by ULD atipamezole. Morphine and CCI-induced gliosis in the spinal dorsal horn were attenuated in animals chronically administered ULD atipamezole. Neuronal activity inferred by c-Fos cell counts was likewise attenuated in neuropathic animals. Finally, through the use of the CPP paradigm, it was shown ULD atipamezole is neither rewarding nor aversive on its own, but disrupts the development of morphine CPP in CCI animals, but not the sham or pain naïve animals. Currently, experimental evidence suggests a reduction in opioid reward in the neuropathic rats.&#xd;
Conclusion: ULD α2-AR antagonist atipamezole inhibits morphine tolerance and enhances opioid analgesia in pain naïve and chronic pain states, alleviates the mechanical hypersensitivity following nerve injury, inhibits chronic morphine and nerve injury-induced glial and neuronal activation in the spinal dorsal horn, and disrupts opioid reward in chronic pain states.</description>

   <description>Based on findings from the National Household Survey, Statistics Canada (2012) recently released a report indicating that slightly less than one-third of First Nations persons living off reserve (between the ages of 18-44) did not earn their secondary school diploma or equivalent. Given the lack of student voices found in existing studies (Schissel &amp; Wortherspoon, 2003) and because of the concentration of urban Aboriginal persons in Sudbury (Statistics Canada: Aboriginal Conditions in Census Metropolitan Areas, 2005), this study focused on hearing from those voices in that area. Accordingly, this thesis explored how eight urban Aboriginal youth (18-29 years of age) perspectives can illuminate reasons for this problem and suggest some solutions to it.&#xd;
Through the framework of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Tribal Critical Race Theory (TribalCrit), I employ data analysis as a tool useful to further the interests of emancipating marginalized individuals from systems of oppression (e.g., discrimination against one’s gender, race, class, ethnicity, religion, mental/physical ability, and/or other social classifications; McMillan &amp; Schumacher, 2010). CRT works to bare witness to the voices of marginalized groups and individuals on the basis of their race (Willis et al., 2007). Emerging from CRT is TribalCrit (Brayboy, 2005). This theoretical framework extends from a specialized focus on issues of race and is used to expose the workings of colonization on the lives of Aboriginal groups and individuals (Brayboy, 2005). The collection of data occurred in three phases: (a) artistic activity, (b) Sharing Circle, and (c) individual storytelling. Using thematic analysis, I coded the data and created a narrative from the participants’ perspectives. Results of this study illuminate the participants’&#xd;
perceptions on their formal learning journey and their decision to leave school prior to graduation.</description>

   <description>The theory of Markov chains has been applied successfully in several situations, for example in the PageRank algorithm which powers Google search. In this thesis we study the foundations of fuzzy logic and Markov chains before introducing fuzzy Markov chains. &#xd;
&#xd;
Fuzzy Markov chains were introduced in 1970 as an alternative to the usual Markov chains and have some interesting properties that may make them more desirable for some applications. We will consider some of these properties and see how they differ from the usual Markov chains. We will also study an application of fuzzy Markov chains called FuzzRank, a twist on the aforementioned PageRank algorithm used for web search. Finally, we will consider a further generalization of the fuzzy Markov chains where we allow some flexibility in the operations we use during matrix multiplication to compute our results.</description>

   <description>The Railway Ground Hazards Research Project (RGHRP) was developed to study and mitigate geotechnical hazards affecting the Canadian railways. A specific target area for this project is the White Canyon area in southwestern British Columbia, where common rockfall events directly impact the railway corridor and pose a risk to railway operations and safety. Through this project, sequential high resolution LiDAR and photogrammetry datasets were collected in order to develop an understanding of these slope-related hazards.  &#xd;
A common method for slope hazard analysis is the use of rockfall simulation software to assess the hazard potential of a site. The rockfall data collected from the comparison of the scans was modelled using available rockfall simulation software packages, in an attempt to validate the assumed rockfall modelling parameters. Tests with available software packages identified three major limitations. The first concerns the use of coefficient of restitution values to generalize the energetics of rock-slope interaction in rockfall modelling and the inconsistencies associated with this. Second, there are significant limitations in visualization both during model setup and of the results of the models generated, as well as with the integration of these results with other applications.  Finally, these tools are something of a closed environment (a ‘black box’) in that the details of how they produce their results is not modifiable, and in some cases the mode in which they operate is not transparent. &#xd;
In this thesis an attempt to address these issues using the Unity game engine is presented, the goal being to more fundamentally explore rockfall mechanics, and to utilize the high-resolution site data to as great a degree as possible. We demonstrate how these engines can be used to assist an engineer in their decision making process and new ways to handle simulation outputs so that these are easily analyzed and presented. In particular pairing the game engine with new data visualization methods.  The results show the high potential of game engines for use in geotechnical applications and present an exciting opportunity for future work on geotechnical modelling.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-28 21:54:30.638</description>
   <description>A major environmental issue in the mining industry is the acid rock drainage (ARD) produced when sulphidic minerals in the mine wastes are exposed to water and oxygen. The acidity of ARD can solubilize metals and metalloids which negatively impacts surrounding ecosystems, aquatic life, and human health. Pyrite is the most abundant metal sulphide and it is the main mineral that generates ARD from the Red Dog Mine wastes. The Red Dog Mine in Alaska, USA is an open-pit operation that extracts zinc and lead from a high-grade deposit. The high pyrite content of its waste rocks has produced a significant amount of ARD throughout the surrounding area.&#xd;
&#xd;
The main factors in the generation of acid from the Red Dog Mine wastes were investigated. The effect of particle size, wetting and drying cycles, elevated temperature, and type of water were determined using pH, solution potential, and electrical conductivity as initial indicators. It was found that elevated temperature, when combined with continuous shaking, was the most effective in expediting the onset of acid generation. The conditions for acid generation in terms of pH and Eh were determined.&#xd;
&#xd;
Shake flask oxidation tests were conducted to study the dissolution behaviours of lead from galena, zinc from sphalerite, and iron from pyrite during the initial stages of weathering of the Red Dog waste rock. Each metal behaved quite distinctly, with lead dissolving first, followed by zinc and then iron, although there was some overlap in behavior. Lead solubility was initially low and subsequently decreased over time which was attributed to the reduced solubility of lead at high sulphate concentrations. Sphalerite dissolved after galena and the zinc solubility continuously increased with time throughout the test. In the presence of soluble iron, the dissolution rate of sphalerite increased. The zinc concentration in the leachate exhibited a one-to-one correspondence with the sulphate content, indicating that the majority of the sulphate came from sphalerite. Iron was not detected in solution until about 40 days and was present at low concentrations. Experimental conditions and the theoretical model indicated the formation of ferrihydrite Fe(OH)3 at shorter weathering times (and hence low sulphate concentrations) and the formation of jarosite (KFe3+3(OH)6(SO4)2) at longer weathering times (and hence higher sulphate concentrations). &#xd;
&#xd;
The effectiveness of natural phosphate rock (NPR) addition for treatment of the ARD produced from the accelerated oxidation of the Red Dog Mine wastes was investigated using the same shake flask experimental conditions. Although it was found that an application rate of 20% or higher was sufficient to neutralize the ARD, more detailed analysis of the leachates and weathered waste rocks is needed to confirm if there were any reductions in metals leaching and the speciation of any secondary precipitates that may have formed.</description>

   <description>Background and aim: Within the gastrointestinal tract, vagal afferents regulate satiety and food intake via chemical and mechanical mechanisms. Cysteinyl Leukotrienes (CysLTs) are lipid mediators that are believed to regulate food intake and body weight. However, the involvement of vagal afferents in this effect remains to be established. Conversely, Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a satiety and incretin peptide hormone. The effect of obesity on GLP-1 mediated gut-brain signaling has yet to be investigated.&#xd;
Since intestinal vagal afferents’ activity is reduced during obesity, it is intriguing to investigate their responses to GLP-1 in such conditions. Methods: Extracellular recordings were performed on intestinal afferents from normal C57Bl6, low fat fed (LFF), and high fat fed (HFF) mice. To examine the effect on&#xd;
neuronal calcium signaling, calcium-imaging experiments were performed on isolated nodose ganglion neurons. Food intake experiments were conducted using LFF and HFF mice. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were carried out. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed on nodose ganglion neurons from A) normal C57Bl mice to test the effect of CysLTs on membrane excitability, B) LFF and HFF mice to examine GLP-1 effect on membrane excitability during obesity. c-Fos immunohistochemical techniques were performed to measure the level of neuronal activation in the brainstem of both LFF and HFF mice in response to Ex-4. Results: CysLTs increased intestinal afferent firing rate and&#xd;
mechanosensitivity. In single nodose neuron experiments, CysLTs increased excitability. The GLP-1 agonist Ex-4 significantly decreased food intake in LFF but not HFF mice. However, Ex-4 markedly attenuated the rise in blood glucose in both LFF and HFF mice. The observed increase in nerve firing and mechanosensitivity following the application of GLP-1 and Ex-4 was abolished in HFF mice. Cell membrane excitability was significantly increased by Ex-4 in nodose from LFF but not HFF mice. Ex-4 significantly increased the number of activated neurons in the NTS area of LFF mice but not in their HFF&#xd;
counterparts. Conclusion: The previous observations indicate that the role CysLTs play in regulating satiety is likely to be vagally mediated. Also that satiety, but not incretin, effects of GLP-1 are impaired during obesity.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-29 12:10:40.725</description>
   <description>All eukaryotic organisms, single-celled or multi-celled, have linear chromosomes, and all linear chromosomes have telomeres at their ends. All eukaryotes have genes which code for the enzyme telomerase. These entities vary amongst species, but telomeres are always guanine rich tandem repeats of DNA, and telomerase always contains a complimentary strand of RNA. Telomeres are specialized structures at the end of linear chromosomes. Through the formation of t-loops and the binding of shelterin complexes, they make chromosomes structurally and chemically stable. &#xd;
&#xd;
Due to the inability of DNA polymerase to fully replicate a chromosome during mitosis, in a process termed the end replication problem, each replicative event results in a shortened chromosome end. This shortening allows for telomeres to act as an intrinsic mitotic clock, a measure of a cell's generational age. After a fixed number of mitotic cycles, known as the Hayflick limit, a cell enters replicative senescence and ceases to divide.&#xd;
&#xd;
The enzyme telomerase is a reverse transcriptase which enables and catalyzes the lengthening of chromosome ends by \emph{de novo} DNA synthesis. In healthy somatic and germ-line cells telomerase is absent, whereas in stem cells and the large majority of cancerous cells it is present.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we derive deterministic equations of motion from a chemical master equation which describe the behaviour of a cell population. They are a coupled finite set of first-order ordinary differential equations which incorporate mitosis, acute death, stem cell differentiation, telomerase activity, and apoptotic death. Their solutions allow for the derivation of characteristic functions which predict the number of cells, and average telomere length in a population of cells.&#xd;
&#xd;
By modelling the dynamics of telomere shortening due to the end replication problem and telomere elongation via the action of telomerase, we investigate the relationship between aging and cancer. Specifically, we find that if the rate of telomerase is above a critical value it has the effect producing a population with a divergent number of cells. This unrestrained proliferation is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Further, consistent with some experiments, we find that telomerase can lead to shorter average telomere lengths.</description>

   <title>Negligible Effects of Acute Atomoxetine Administration on Visual Working Memory in the Macaque Monkey</title>

   <description>Working memory (WM) is a basic cognitive process central to daily activities including communication and problem solving. This limited capacity system guides future behaviour through the short-term retention of information. &#xd;
The neural basis of WM is thought to lie in the persistent activity of a network of prefrontal cortical neurons. This activity presents itself during the retention interval of behavioural tasks that probe WM and is reported to be influenced by catecholamines. Accordingly, catecholamine reuptake transporter inhibitors enhance neurotransmission of catecholamines and thus, are said to modulate WM performance. Atomoxetine (ATX) selectively inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Evidence of acute ATX effects on WM performance in healthy nonhuman primates or humans is currently lacking. Reports of ATX-induced improvements are equivocal because the majority of studies are sub chronic and the implemented tasks are often inadequate in their measure of WM. &#xd;
Here we tested the acute effects of orally administered ATX on the performance of two female rhesus macaques in a delayed visual sequential comparison (VSC) task with a wide range of doses (0.03 – 3.0 mg/kg). This task reliably assesses both the limited capacity and short time interval of WM by implementing a memory load greater than 2 and a 1s retention interval. It is hypothesized that ATX improves WM performance on the delayed VSC task in a dose- and memory load-dependent manner. &#xd;
Despite the reported contribution of catecholamines on cognition, there were no dose- or memory load-dependent effects observed on delayed VSC task performance following systemic ATX administration. In fact, all changes in performance were within the variability of the control data. While the findings failed to establish a role for catecholamines in WM, a potential modulatory role in motivation was revealed. An increase in task engagement was observed on the task, prompting the implementation of a visual progressive ratio task to further assess the potential motivational effects. These results reveal the need to re-evaluate the notion that catecholamines are capable of modulating WM and direct our attention to their contribution to motivation.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-29 12:16:26.884</description>
   <description>Uranium mineralization of the Quenamari Meseta, Macusani District, SE Peru, is hosted by peraluminous, sillimanite-andalusite-muscovite-biotite rhyolites of the 12.3 - 6.8 Ma Macusani Formation of the Miocene-Pliocene Quenamari Group. The main ore mineral, meta-autunite, (Ca[(UO2)(PO4)]2(H2O)6-8), occurs in fractures in association with weeksite and hydrous Mn- and Fe-mineraloids. The absence of U4+ minerals, as well as any hydrothermal alteration associated with the U ore, strongly suggests that meta-autunite is the primary U mineral. LA-ICP-MS U-Th-Pa geochronology of the meta-autunite revealed that the main ore-forming events occurred at 69 ka, 130 ka and 314-317 ka, and probably at ca. 103-113 ka, 210 ka and 400 ka, all long after the last magmatic activity in the area. The obtained ages unambiguously relate U ore formation to low-temperature Quaternary processes. The δ18O and δ2H values of the mineralizing fluids, inferred from those of the meta-autunite, range from -21.7 ‰ to –12.2 ‰ and from -181 to -123 ‰, respectively, consistent with ore formation from low-temperature meteoric fluids. &#xd;
The timing of ore formation, as well as the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of meta-autunite and host rocks, such as REE patterns and alteration assemblages, suggests that U was leached from the glassy matrix of the rhyolites, transported by meteoric waters and precipitated as meta-autunite. The majority of known deposits are located on the upper walls of active fluvial canyons, which suggests that the geomorphological environment that is now focusing groundwater flow was also favourable for meta-autunite precipitation. Meta-autunite probably precipitated through the mixing of low-temperature fluids and interaction of the uranyl ion with Fe- and Mn-mineraloids.Thus, although the Macusani U deposits are volcanic-hosted, they differ radically from documented magmatic-hydrothermal systems.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-29 14:24:27.663</description>
   <description>Automated assembly machines operate continuously to achieve high production rates. Continuous operation increases the potential for faults, with subsequent machine downtime. Early fault detection can reduce the amount of downtime.  Traditional fault detection methods check for deviations from fixed threshold limits with multiple mechanical, optical and proximity sensors. The goal of this thesis was to develop and validate a machine vision inspection (MVI) system to detect and classify multiple faults using a single camera as a sensor.&#xd;
An industrial automated O-ring assembly machine that places O-rings on to continuously moving plastic carriers at a rate of over 100 assemblies per minute was modified to serve as the test apparatus.  An industrial CCD camera with LED panel lights for illumination was used to acquire videos of the machine’s operation.  A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) allowed for the generation of faults in a controlled fashion.  Three MVI methods, based on from computer vision techniques available in the literature, were developed for this application.  The methods used features extracted from the videos to classify the machine’s condition.  The first method was based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), as originally used for real-time outdoor tracking of moving regions in image sequences.  The second method used an optical flow approach which was originally used for motion estimation in a video.  The third method was based on running average and morphological image processing, originally used for noise filtering in image sequences.  &#xd;
In order to provide a single metric to quantify relative performance, a Machine Vision Performance Index (MVPI) was developed with five measures of performance: accuracy, processing time, speed of response, robustness against noise, and ease of implementation.  On the basis of the calculated MVPI, it was concluded that the GMM-based method is the best of the three methods for this application.  This thesis has two main contributions: 1) validation that MVI can be used to detect and classify multiple faults using a single camera and 2) documentation on how computer vision techniques can be applied to the problem of fault detection and classification in assembly machines.</description>

   <description>This study employs a Bourdieusian theoretical framework to investigate capital building at Skylight—an overnight summer camp for girls seven to fifteen who have experienced trauma and/or abuse. Using participant observation and semi-structured interviews, I explore whether camp can help girls accumulate social and cultural capital, or facilitate habitus transformation. Results suggest that building social capital enables the development of cultural capital, which may aid the girls in their academic and social endeavours even beyond the camp context. Capital building was encouraged by three specific features of Skylight: 1) cohabitation, 2) a single-gender and 3) shared experiences of adversity. The paper closes with a discussion of implications for theory and program implementations.</description>

   <description>A new class of interstitial clusters which present a structure of C15 Laves phase has been theoretically predicted in bcc iron. However, these C15 clusters have never been identified experimentally. In this thesis, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were explored to investigate the stability of perfect C15 Laves phase structures made of iron atoms and with or without point defects, as well as the stability of nano-sized C15 clusters embedded in bcc iron with point defects nearby. In this work, in first-ever simulations, two empirical Fe-Fe potentials were tested and the Ackland-2004 potential was demonstrated to be suitable. Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were used along three axes. For the perfect C15 Laves phase structures, calculations were performed on the total potential energy, temperature dependence of elastic constants and elastic moduli, and process of phase transformation at 300K. For interactions between perfect C15 Laves phase structures and their internal point defects, the formation energies of vacancies and SIAs, phase transformation temperature, and the process of phase transformation at 300K were simulated. Radial distribution function (RDF) calculations were used to check stability and structural changes. For interactions between nano-sized C15 clusters and nearby external point defects, the process of phase transformation at 300K was also simulated. The simulation results suggest that pure C15 Laves phase structure can remain stable up to about 425K. The presence of internal point defects will cause a decrease of phase transformation temperatures to below 260K. With increasing temperatures, perfect C15 Laves phase structures that contain internal point defects will transform into imperfect bcc structures. At 300K, the presence of nearby external vacancies will induce a recombination of the same number of SIAs from nano-sized C15 clusters, therefore possibly eliminating the C15 clusters; nearby external SIAs will induce the nano-sized C15 clusters to rearrange into 1/2&lt;111> loops. As a conclusion, perfect C15 Laves phase structures with internal point defects are likely unstable at the temperatures higher than 260K, thus they may not remain to be observed at room temperature during irradiation.</description>

   <description>The use of lyrical music to aid in the revitalization of Hul’qumi’num’, a dialect spoken on southeastern Vancouver Island, is a strategy that builds on the connections between music and language. These connections are evident in both infant- or child-directed speech and music. In 2008 and 2010, a group of dedicated volunteers wrote and recorded two collections of children’s songs in English and Hul’qumi’num’. This study examined the usefulness of these CDs in the context of how lyrical music aids in second language acquisition.&#xd;
This qualitative study features the perspectives of Hul’qumi’num’ language instructors on their use of the ’Iiyus Siiye’yu Happy Friends CDs with students in School District 79. Data collected from focus groups and individual interviews with Hul’qumi’num’ language instructors and Aboriginal Support teachers, a principal, and two co-creators of the CDs were analyzed using pattern, theme and content analysis. This provided a clearer picture of how the CDs were distributed and how students were exposed to the songs in classrooms. &#xd;
Motivation and comfort levels of language instructors were two themes that emerged and led to an important question: can partially fluent speakers teach Hul’qumi’num’? Hul’qumi’num’ is a dynamic and living language that has experienced substantial changes in the past century and as the number of fluent speakers continues to dwindle, there will continue to be substantial changes to the language. &#xd;
Recommendations arising from this research included the development of&#xd;
1.	An accompanying CD that includes vocabulary lists for each song and verbal instructions to transitioning listeners;&#xd;
2.	Print-based materials that support using the vocabulary from each song;&#xd;
3.	More songs about the teachings, legends, and other stories that share history, geography, and cultural practices with listeners; and, &#xd;
4.	A resource guide that includes physical activities that encourages movement inside and outside classrooms. &#xd;
Future research with classroom teachers is needed to better understand their needs and to ensure appropriate supports are in place so that they can continue to support the promotion and use of Hul’q’umi’num’ in classrooms.</description>

   <description>This thesis reports on a combined solid-state 17O NMR and quantum mechanical study of three acyl-enzyme intermediates: p-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoyl-chymotrypsin (DAB-CHT), trans¬¬-¬o-methoxycinnamoyl-chymotrypsin (oMC-CHT), and trans-p-methoxycinnamoyl-chymotrypsin (pMC-CHT). At pH 7.8, the three acyl-enzyme intermediates were found to undergo hydrolysis (deacylation) with the following rate constants: DAB-CHT, 6.4 ± 0.1 × 10-6; oMC-CHT, 2.8 ± 0.1 × 10-4 s-1; pMC-CHT, 8.5 ± 0.3 × 10-3 s-1. Analysis of solid-state 17O NMR spectra obtained under the magic angle spinning (MAS) condition at 21 T for the three acyl-enzyme intermediates yields the following isotropic chemical shift (δiso), quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ), and asymmetry parameter (ηQ): DAB-CHT, δiso = 316 ± 2 ppm, CQ = 10.0 ± 1 MHz, ηQ = 0.6 ± 0.2; oMC-CHT, δiso = 316 ± 2 ppm, CQ = 9.2 ± 1 MHz, ηQ = 0.6 ± 0.2; and pMC-CHT, δiso = 316 ± 2, CQ = 7.0 ± 0.5 MHz, ηQ = 0.8 ± 0.2. With the aid of quantum mechanical calculations, these 17O NMR parameters were interpreted as to reflect the variations in hydrogen bonding interactions between the carbonyl (C=O) functional group of the acyl moiety and the two NH groups from the protein backbone in the so-called oxyanion hole. This work represents the first use of solid-state 17O NMR spectroscopy to study acyl-enzyme intermediates and demonstrates the great potential of this new technique.</description>

   <description>Non-aqueous dispersion polymerization (NAD) is used to produce submicron sized particles utilized by the solvent-borne automotive coatings industry to prevent crack propagation, improve toughness and reduce energy requirements for drying. Despite its industrial significance, there have been few studies about particle nucleation and other qualities of the semibatch process. The dispersion features high solids (50-60 wt%) of higher molecular weight acrylic polymer, with the polymeric nanoparticles sterically stabilized by low molecular weight dispersant polymer chains anchored to the particle surface either by chemical or physical interaction. &#xd;
The work presented in this thesis investigates three aspects influencing particle formation in the NAD system, i.e., the dispersant type, the multi-component core composition and the dispersant feeding procedure in the starved feed semibatch process. Three categories of unsaturated poly(methacrylate) dispersants are examined, a butyl methacrylate (BMA) based material with grafted vinyl functionality, vinyl-terminated BMA homopolymer macromers, and hydroxyl group functionalized macromers. The macromers provided more effective stabilization than the grafted dispersant, but the addition of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) to the dispersant reduced stability. Average particle size of the dispersion increased with the addition of methyl methacrylate and styrene to the mix of monomers used to produce the particles. The increased effectiveness of the dispersant led to an investigation of reduced dispersant levels, increased monomer loading, and simplified dispersant feeding strategies while producing small particles (&lt;150 nm) and keeping dispersion viscosity low  (&lt;500 cp). The findings are interpreted by considering the relative polarity of the dispersant, core polymer, and solvent mixture in the NAD system.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
This study applies the theoretical framework of neoliberalism, biopolitics, and neoliberal governmentality to the instructional materials found in the Grade 3 Jamaican classroom. This study is phenomenological in nature and serves as a case in point that illustrates how some instructional materials can reflect dominant socio-economic ideology. In particular, my research looks at how neoliberal ideology influences the textbooks that shape the everyday learning experiences of Jamaican students. This work combines neoliberal theory with research on the politics of the textbook to demonstrate how influential learning materials can be and how they are ensconced within socio-economic power relations and dominant modes of thinking. For the purposes of this research the Grade 3 textbook, Macmillan Primary Integrated Studies – Culture was explored through a neoliberal lens. When examined through a neoliberal framework, it was found that the textbook serves as a neoliberal artifact that actively disseminates free market and economically oriented values that coincide with a larger neoliberal discourse. While there is considerable scholarship on both the politics behind instructional materials (Apple, 1993) and neoliberalism and its implications on schooling (Garcia &amp; De Lissovoy, 2013), my work demonstrates that there is congruence between student textbooks and neoliberal ideology. Moreover, this work speaks to scholarship on Foucault and governmentality studies.  My research demonstrates that in its function as a neoliberal artifact, the textbook becomes a technology of power that issues biopolitical controls over the student body with the aim of creating self-governing neoliberal subjects.</description>

   <description>The effects of holes in a geomembrane on leakage through the base liner of a modern municipal solid waste and mine tailings storage facilities was examined.&#xd;
First, the performance of overlapped seams below a geomembrane wrinkle was evaluated for seven geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs; three requiring and four not requiring field-applied supplemental bentonite at the longitudinal seam). For seams parallel to a wrinkle, the performance depended on the width of the seam relative to the wrinkle. With both ends of the seam confined under vertical stress from the deformed wrinkle, there was no evidence of flow along the seam. For seams perpendicular to a wrinkle, it was observed that the availability and distribution of seam bentonite, needle-punching pattern of the GCL, applied vertical stress, and GCL type can all significantly affect the flow along the unstressed section of the seam. With 400 g/m of supplemental bentonite piled along the centre of the seam, the effect of having a wrinkle on flow was largely reduced to a point where the leakage was no larger than that through a single panel of GCL.&#xd;
Second, leakage through geomembrane holes in a mine tailings configuration was examined for three silty-sand tailings and four underliners (underliners ranging from silty-sand to pea gravel). The effect of different tailings, different underliners, different geomembrane type and thickness, different hole sizes, different applied stresses and heads, a nonwoven geotextile cushioning layer, and gap beneath a geomembrane hole (due to a wrinkle or stone on the foundation) on leakage are reported. The hydraulic conductivity of the tailings had largest effect on flow with a maximum measured flow (without piping) of 8.5 lpd for the cases examined. Free-flowing tailings slurry or that migrating under the applied hydraulic gradient filled any gaps beneath the geomembrane hole. There was evidence of fines migration from the tailings, through the hole, and to the underliner or geotextile. Although there was no effect of geomembrane thickness on flow, the 1-mm-thick geomembrane wrinkles were deformed to an extent that the inner sides were in contact at an applied stress of 250kPa, inducing excessive stains in the geomembrane.</description>

   <description>On May 20, 2014, the Iqaluit dump lit itself on fire, burning for 178 days.  ‘Dumpcano’ as it was nicknamed, cannot be seen in isolation: Iqaluit is surrounded by unremediated dump sites, left behind from both the Canadian and American military and passed to a municipality that is overwhelmed with social problems. This thesis will use the infrastructure around waste—there is no recycling or separation of waste in the Territory, and the majority of dumps across Nunavut regularly burn garbage, a practice that’s been discontinued in the rest of the country—to address issues of identity, sovereignty and how the doctrine of Terra Nullius created the circumstances for the institutional neglect that led to the dump fire. This thesis will explore how ideologies, ideas, policies and practices emergent from settler colonial circumstances in Southern Canada were applied to the North in inappropriate ways. This tension around how the imagined image of the North has affected policy is accessible through my discussion of the growth of consumption culture in the North, while at the same time Canadian identity has been shaped by the image of the empty Arctic. While the Inuit of Nunavut were never under the Indian Act, their citizenship was founded not on equality but on the use of their habitation as an expression of Canadian sovereignty, which has grown increasingly relevant as Arctic nations debate who owns the Arctic and the oil beneath, and the Northwest Passage continues to melt. This thesis will explore the toxic legacy in Iqaluit and provide recommendations for Canada’s future.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the discovery and characterization of the first antifreeze protein (AFP) isolated from a fly. The starting point of my research was the observation that when midges emerge from Lake Ontario as adults in early spring they have low levels of antifreeze activity. Here I have isolated, characterized, and modeled the structure of their main AFP. This 79-residue mature midge AFP has a novel sequence of ten-residue tandem repeats, xxCxGxYCxG, which I modeled as is a left-handed disulfide-braced solenoid, with each 10-residue repeat corresponding to one coil of the helix. The fold is similar to a beta-helix, but secondary structure and circular dichroism analyses indicate that this solenoid is too tightly coiled to have beta-structure. The model shows an outward pointing seven-residue stacked Tyr-ladder, which has been confirmed by mutagenesis to serve as its ice-binding site. This is the first example of tyrosines used for ice binding. I have determined that the midge AFP activity is intermediate to the moderately active and hyperactive AFPs typically found in fish and overwintering insects, respectively. The proposed explanation for intermediate activity is that the midge AFP binds to a pyramidal surface midway between the basal and prism planes. The modest sub-zero temperatures that the adult flies encounter has likely driven the evolution of this intermediate activity AFP. I predict that other organisms facing freezing threats of a similar magnitude will also produce AFPs with intermediate activity. I have also contributed to the literature on experimental methods used to assess ice-binding properties of AFPs by publishing a step-by-step protocol for the fluorescence-based ice-plane affinity assay with an instructional video. This technique can be used, as it was here, to determine which planes of ice are bound by fluorescently-labelled AFPs. A second chapter on techniques describes the ab initio and homology-based techniques our lab has used to reliably predict novel ice-binding protein folds.</description>

   <description>The Camposanto of Pisa is an extraordinarily complex and evocative monument, which has captured the imagination of pilgrims, both religious and secular, for centuries. The late Medieval and early Renaissance wall paintings that line the perimeter of the portico surrounding a vast inner courtyard, are unparalleled in early Italian art, not only for their striking variety of composition and narrative complexity, but also for the sheer grandeur of their proportion. However, the passage of time has scarred the structure of the Camposanto and inflicted terrible damage on its wall paintings. This thesis explores the material reality of the Camposanto as experienced over three centuries through the eyes of British travelers. In order to situate the Camposanto mural cycle within an historical and cultural context, the first chapter provides an overview of the construction and decoration of the monument. Notably, Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574), the Italian Humanist often recognized as the father of art history, included numerous descriptions of the Camposanto murals in his highly influential text Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori. Accordingly, the second chapter provides an analysis of Vasari’s descriptions and reflects upon the influence that the Renaissance author may have had upon the subsequent British reception of the Camposanto murals. The third chapter utilizes three centuries of travel writing in order to investigate the aesthetic impact of the Camposanto mural cycle upon British tourists from the seventeenth through to the nineteenth century.</description>

   <description>There has been very little research that has studied the capacities that can be fostered to mitigate the risk&#xd;
for involvement in electronic bullying or victimization and almost no research examining positive electronic&#xd;
behavior. The primary goal of this dissertation was to use the General Aggression Model and Anxious&#xd;
Apprehension Model of Trauma to explore the underlying cognitive, emotional, and self-regulation processes&#xd;
that are related to electronic bullying, victimization, and prosocial behavior. In Study 1, we explored several&#xd;
potential interpretations of the General Aggression Model that would accurately describe the relationship that&#xd;
electronic self-conscious appraisal, cognitive reappraisal, and activational control may have with electronic&#xd;
bullying and victimization. In Study 2, we used the Anxious Apprehension Model of Trauma to explore&#xd;
rejection cognitions as the mediator of the relationships among emotionality (emotionality, shame, state&#xd;
emotion responses, and physiological arousal) and electronic bullying and victimization using structural&#xd;
equation modelling. In addition, we explored the role of rejection cognitions in mediating the relationship of&#xd;
moral disengagement with electronic bullying. In Study 3, we examined predictors of electronic prosocial&#xd;
behavior, such as bullying, victimization, time online, electronic proficiency, electronic self-conscious&#xd;
appraisals, emotionality, and self-regulation. All three studies supported the General Aggression Model as a&#xd;
framework to guide the study of electronic behavior, and suggest the importance of cognitive, emotional, and&#xd;
behavioral means of regulation in shaping electronic behavior. In addition, each study has implications for the&#xd;
development of high quality electronic bullying prevention and intervention research.</description>

   <description>PAWP, a candidate sperm-borne oocyte activating factor, induces oocyte activation and acts upstream of the calcium signalling pathway, however, PAWP’s downstream signalling pathway in oocyte cytoplasm remains to be uncovered. Data from our lab suggested that the interacting partner of PAWP, at least in the frog (Xenopus laevis) model may be YAP, a highly expressed protein in amphibian and mammalian oocytes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to confirm that PAWP’s predominant binding partner in Xenopus laevis oocyte is YAP; to determine if mammalian oocyte activation is also dependent on PAWP-YAP interaction; and to verify that the PAWP-YAP interaction during oocyte activation is dependent on the WWI domain module. By immunohistochemistry, YAP was localized predominantly in the cytosol of metaphase II-arrested Xenopus laevis oocytes, where presumably the PAWP-YAP interaction occurs. Utilizing Far Western blotting, YAP was identified as the predominant binding partner of PAWP, in metaphase II-arrested frog (Xenopus laevis), swine (Sus scrofa) and mouse (mus musculus) oocytes. The specificity of this interaction was then tested on Far Western blotting of mouse ovarian and oocyte cytosolic extracts, by competition with both wild-type and point-mutated recombinant WWI domains derived from YAP. The removal of GST from the wild-type WWI-GST fusion protein was a requirement for effective blockage of WWI module interaction between PAWP and YAP. As expected, the mutated WWI domain was ineffective in inhibiting the PAWP-YAP interaction. To conclude, this study identified YAP as the predominant binding partner of PAWP in both amphibian and mammalian oocytes, and showed this interaction is dependent on the WWI modular interaction. The results allow us to test the functional relevance of this WWI modular interaction during oocyte activation in vivo, in the future.</description>

   <description>The circulating blood exerts a force on the vascular endothelium, termed fluid shear stress (FSS), which directly impacts numerous vascular endothelial cell (VEC) functions. For example, high rates of linear and undisturbed (i.e. laminar) blood flow maintains a protective and quiescent VEC phenotype. Meanwhile, deviations in blood flow, which can occur at vascular branchpoints and large curvatures, create areas of low, and/or oscillatory FSS, and promote a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic and hyperpermeable phenotype. Indeed, it is known that these areas are prone to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Herein, we show that cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D (PDE4D) activity is increased by FSS in human arterial endothelial cells (HAECs) and that this activation regulates the activity of cAMP-effector protein, Exchange Protein-activated by cAMP-1 (EPAC1), in these cells. Importantly, we also show that these events directly and critically impact HAEC responses to FSS, especially when FSS levels are low. Both morphological events induced by FSS, as measured by changes in cell alignment and elongation in the direction of FSS, and the expression of critical FSS-regulated genes, including Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and thrombomodlin (TM), are mediated by EPAC1/PDE4D signaling. At a mechanistic level, we show that EPAC1/PDE4D acts through the vascular endothelial-cadherin (VECAD)/ platelet-cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) mechanosensor to activate downstream signaling though Akt. Given the critical role of PDE4D in mediating these effects, we also investigated the impact of various patterns of FSS on the expression of individual PDE genes in HAECs. Notably, PDE2A was significantly upregulated in response to high, laminar FSS, while PDE3A was upregulated under low, oscillatory FSS conditions only. These data may provide novel therapeutic targets to limit FSS-dependent endothelial cell dysfunction (ECD) and atherosclerotic development.</description>

   <description>In typical theoretical or experimental studies of heat migration in discrete fractures, conduction&#xd;
and thermal dispersion are commonly neglected from the fracture heat transport equation,&#xd;
assuming heat conduction into the matrix is predominant. In this study analytical and numerical&#xd;
models are used to investigate the significance of conduction and thermal dispersion in the plane&#xd;
of the fracture for a point and line sources geometries. The analytical models account for&#xd;
advective, conductive and dispersive heat transport in both the longitudinal and transverse&#xd;
directions in the fracture. The heat transport in the fracture is coupled with a matrix equation in&#xd;
which heat is conducted in the direction perpendicular to the fracture. In the numerical model,&#xd;
the governing heat transport processes are the same as the analytical models; however, the matrix&#xd;
conduction is considered in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Firstly, we demonstrate&#xd;
that longitudinal conduction and dispersion are critical processes that affect heat transport in&#xd;
fractured rock environments, especially for small apertures (eg. 100 μm or less), high flow rate&#xd;
conditions (eg. velocity greater than 50 m/day) and early time (eg. less than 10 days). Secondly,&#xd;
transverse thermal dispersion in the fracture plane is also observed to be an important transport&#xd;
process leading to retardation of the migrating heat front particularly at late time (eg. after 40&#xd;
days of hot water injection). Solutions which neglect dispersion in the transverse direction&#xd;
underestimate the locations of heat fronts at late time. Finally, this study also suggests that the&#xd;
geometry of the heat sources has significant effects on the heat transport in the system. For&#xd;
example, the effects of dispersion in the fracture are observed to decrease when the width of the&#xd;
heat source expands.</description>

   <description>This study explores the curriculum at Queen’s-affiliated medical colleges, specifically The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, Kingston, the Kingston Women’s Medical College, and Queen’s Medical College, from 1881 to 1910, using the textbooks prescribed by these institutions as primary sources. The central question encompasses what factors primarily motivated the curriculum at Queen’s-affiliated medical colleges to change. Within the historiographical scholarship on Queen’s College, this question has not yet been addressed and, to my knowledge, this is the first medical education history to specifically address textbooks as part of a medical school curriculum. During this period, these institutions experienced reorganizational shifts, such as the reunification of Queen’s Medical College with The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, Kingston, as well as the introduction and subsequent exclusion of female students. Within this context, this study examines how the forces of scientific innovation and co-education impacted the curriculum during the period under study, as measured by textbook change, specifically in the courses of obstetrics and gynaecology, the theory and practice of medicine, and surgery. To what degree was curriculum in these courses responsive to scientific inventions and discoveries, changing therapeutic practices, and possible gender biases? From 1881 to 1910, innovations such as x-ray and anaesthesia became commonplace within medical practice. Some technologies gained acceptance in the curriculum, while others fell out of favour. This study tracks these scientific discoveries through the textbooks used at Queen’s-affiliated medical colleges in order to demonstrate how the evolving nature of medicine was represented in the curriculum. To address how gender influenced the curriculum, textbooks from the Kingston Women’s Medical College and The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, Kingston, were compared. For two out of the three examined courses, it was found that sections of textbooks discussing various topics at the Kingston Women’s Medical College contained significantly more detail than their corresponding sections within The Royal College’s textbooks. It was speculated that the instructors preferred to teach their female students through textbooks, rather than lectures.</description>

   <description>The overarching goal of the current dissertation was to examine emotion dynamics in mother-daughter interactions across different positive and negative contexts, and their associations with psychosocial adjustment—relationship quality and internalizing symptoms. This dissertation was informed by theoretical approaches that assert that humans are a fundamentally social species (Beckes &amp; Coan, 2011), and that momentary features of interpersonal dynamics coalesce into broader psychosocial adjustment (e.g., Granic, 2005). Real-time mother-daughter emotion dynamics were examined in three studies. In Study 1, emotional load sharing (i.e., the distribution of the burden of emotional distress among relationship partners) during adolescent social stress was examined as it related to physical and relationship closeness. Dyads were randomly assigned to either have physical contact or no physical contact during the social stress elicitation. Evidence of load sharing was observed among dyads who were in physical contact, independent of relationship quality. However, without physical contact, load sharing was only evident among dyads with higher relationship quality. Thus, emotional load sharing occurred at higher levels of physical and/or relationship closeness in mother-daughter dyads. Study 2 was an examination of individual differences in dyadic socioemotional flexibility—the ability to adjust emotions according to situational demands—across positive and negative emotional contexts. Higher flexibility within emotional contexts, and moderate levels of flexibility across positive and negative emotional contexts, were associated with higher mother-daughter relationship quality and lower maternal internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, and social anxiety). In Study 3, mother-daughter arousal transmission—the extent to which mothers and daughters “pick up” on each others’ physiological arousal—was examined across positive and negative emotional contexts. Daughter-to-mother arousal transmission decreased between a positive context and a negative context but otherwise, daughter-to-mother and mother-to-daughter arousal transmission did not vary across contexts. Contrary to expectations, relationship quality was not associated with arousal transmission. The results, implications, and future directions of the three studies were discussed in relation to three areas: (1) relationship quality in mother-daughter dyads, (2) mother-daughter arousal transmission, and (3) developmental processes.</description>

   <description>Solar heating of potable water has traditionally been accomplished through the use of solar thermal (ST) collectors. With the recent increases in availability and lower cost of photovoltaic (PV) panels, the potential of coupling PV solar arrays to electrically heated domestic hot water (DHW) tanks has been considered. Additionally, innovations in the SDHW industry have led to the creation of photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors, which heat water using both electrical and thermal energy.&#xd;
The current work compared the performance and cost-effectiveness of a traditional solar thermal (ST) DHW system to PV-solar-electric DHW systems and a PV/T DHW system. To accomplish this, a detailed TRNSYS model of the solar hot water systems was created and annual simulations were performed for 250 L/day and 325 L/day loads in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Halifax, and Calgary. It was shown that when considering thermal performance, PV-DHW systems were not competitive when compared to ST-DHW and PVT-DHW systems. As an example, for Toronto the simulated annual solar fractions of PV-DHW systems were approximately 30%, while the ST-DHW and PVT-DHW systems achieved 65% and 71% respectively.&#xd;
	With current manufacturing and system costs, the PV-DHW system was the most cost-effective system for domestic purposes. The capital cost of the PV-DHW systems were approximately $1,923-$2,178 depending on the system configuration, and the ST-DHW and PVT system were estimated to have a capital cost of $2,288 and $2,373 respectively. Although the capital cost of the PVT-DHW system was higher than the other systems, a Present Worth analysis for a 20-year period showed that for a 250 L/day load in Toronto the Present Worth of the PV/T system was approximately $4,597, with PV-DHW systems costing approximately $7,683-$7,816 and the ST-DHW system costing $5,238.</description>

   <description>Performing Pedagogies was a week-long performance and exhibition series I organized that took place in Kingston, Ontario between March 15th - March 20th 2016.  The motivation for this project came from a desire to explore performative modes of experiencing critical, embodied knowledge.  The series featured five performances, a long distance collaboration between thirty-one Queen’s undergraduate students and a Vancouver artist-run free school (The School for Eventual Vacancy), a subsequent exhibition, a panel discussion, and a radical performance pedagogy workshop led by co-artistic director of the international performance art troupe, La Pocha Nostra. Artists featured included Golboo Amani, Basil AlZeri, Caitlin Chaisson, Justin Langlois, Saul Garcia-Lopez, Francisco-Fernando Granados, and Andrew Rabyniuk.  By curating examples of performance art that variously incorporated embodied pedagogical interventions, I examined the processes of performance as pedagogy.  Performing Pedagogies explored interventions into contemporary contours of neoliberal education paradigms through embodied encounters—fostering conversations about the meanings and limitations of knowledge dissemination and education today and posing questions about possibilities for radical pedagogies, embodied knowledge, and counter curricula.</description>

   <title>A Cloud-based Framework for Security Analysis of Browser Extensions</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-05-18 10:21:15.366</description>
   <description>In today's internet world, web browsers are an integral part of our day-to-day activities. Therefore, web browser security is a serious concern for all of us. Browsers can be breached in different ways. Because of the over privileged access, extensions are responsible for many security issues. Browser vendors try to keep safe extensions in their official extension galleries. However, their security control measures are not always effective and adequate. The distribution of unsafe extensions through different social engineering techniques is also a very common practice. Therefore, before installation, users should thoroughly analyze the security of browser extensions. &#xd;
&#xd;
Extensions are not only available for desktop browsers, but many mobile browsers, for example, Firefox for Android and UC browser for Android, are also furnished with extension features. Mobile devices have various resource constraints in terms of computational capabilities, power, network bandwidth, etc. Hence, conventional extension security analysis techniques cannot be efficiently used by end users to examine mobile browser extension security issues. To overcome the inadequacies of the existing approaches, we propose CLOUBEX, a CLOUd-based security analysis framework for both desktop and mobile Browser EXtensions. This framework uses a client-server architecture model. In this framework, compute-intensive security analysis tasks are generally executed in a high-speed computing server hosted in a cloud environment. CLOUBEX is also enriched with a number of essential features, such as client-side analysis, requirements-driven analysis, high performance, and dynamic decision making. &#xd;
&#xd;
At present, the Firefox extension ecosystem is most susceptible to different security attacks. Hence, the framework is implemented for the security analysis of the Firefox desktop and Firefox for Android mobile browser extensions. A static taint analysis is used to identify malicious information flows in the Firefox extensions. In CLOUBEX, there are three analysis modes. A dynamic decision making algorithm assists us to select the best option based on some important parameters, such as the processing speed of a client device and network connection speed. Using the best analysis mode, performance and power consumption are improved significantly. In the future, this framework can be leveraged for the security analysis of other desktop and mobile browser extensions, too.</description>

   <description>‘De Vries-like’ smectic liquid crystals exhibit low layer contraction of approximately 1% on transitions from the SmA to the SmC phase. These materials have received considerable attention as potential solutions for problems affecting liquid crystal displays using surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystals (SSFLC). In SSFLCs, layer contraction of 710% is normally observed during the SmA to SmC phase transition. A study by the Lemieux group has shown that liquid crystals with nanosegregating carbosilane segments exhibit enhanced ‘de Vries-like’ properties through the formation of smectic layers and by lengthening the nanosegregating carbosilane end-groups from monocarbosilane to tricarbosilane. This observed enhancement is assumed to be due to an increase in the cross-section of the free volume in the hydrocarbon sub-layer. To test this hypothesis, it is assumed that dimers with a tricarbosilane linking group have smaller cross-sections on time average. In his thesis, this hypothesis is tested through the characterization of new liquid crystalline monomers (QL39-n) and dimers (QL40-n) with 2-phenylpyrimidine cores and tricarbosilane end-groups and spacers, respectively. The thesis describes the synthesis of two homologous series of liquid crystals and their characterization using a variety of techniques, including polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The results show that the monomers QL39-n form a tilted SmC phase only, whereas the dimers QL40-n form an orthogonal SmA phase. These results are discussed in the context of our hypothesis.</description>

   <description>Quantum-confined systems are one of the most promising ways to enable us to control a material's interactions with light. Nanorods in particular offer the right dimensions for exploring and manipulating the terahertz region of the spectrum. In this thesis, we model excitons confined inside a nanorod using the envelope function approximation. A region-matching transfer matrix method allows us to simulate excitonic states inside arbitrary heterostructures grown along the length of the rod. We apply the method to colloidal CdSe rods 70 nm in length and under 10 nm in diameter, capped with ligands of DDPA and pyridine. We extend past studies on these types of rods by taking into account their dielectric permittivity mismatch. Compared to previous calculations and experimentally measured terahertz absorption, we predict a higher energy main 1S$z$ to 2P$z$ transition peak. This indicates that the rods are likely larger in diameter than previously thought.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also investigate a nanorod with GaAs/Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As coupled double dots. The excitonic transitions were found to be manipulable by varying the strength of an applied electric field.  We employ quasi-static state population distributions to simulate the effects of exciton relaxation from optically active states to dim ground states. A critical value of the applied field, corresponding to the exciton binding energy of ~18 meV, was found to dramatically alter the terahertz absorption due to state mixing. Above this critical field, more nuanced shifts in transition energies were observed, and gain from radiative relaxation to the ground state is predicted.</description>

   <description>The countermanding paradigm was designed to investigate the ability to cancel a prepotent response when a stop signal is presented and allows estimation of the stop signal response time (SSRT), an otherwise unobservable behaviour. Humans exhibit adaptive control of behaviour in the countermanding task, proactively lengthening response time (RT) in expectation of stopping and reactively lengthening RT following stop trials or errors. Human performance changes throughout the lifespan, with longer RT, SSRT and greater emphasis on post-error slowing reported for older compared to younger adults. Inhibition in the task has generally been improved by drugs that increase extracellular norepinephrine. The current thesis examined a novel choice response countermanding task in rats to explore whether rodent countermanding performance is a suitable model for the study of adaptive control of behaviour, lifespan changes in behavioural control and the role of neurotransmitters in these behaviours.&#xd;
Rats reactively adjusted RT in the countermanding task, shortening RT after consecutive correct go trials and lengthening RT following non-cancelled, but not cancelled stop trials, in sessions with a 10 s, but not a 1 s post-error timeout interval. Rats proactively lengthened RT in countermanding task sessions compared to go trial-only sessions. Together, these findings suggest that rats strategically lengthened RT in the countermanding task to improve accuracy and avoid longer, unrewarded timeout intervals. Next, rats exhibited longer RT and relatively conserved post-error slowing, but no significant change in SSRT when tested at 12, compared to 7 months of age, suggesting that rats exhibit changes in countermanding task performance with aging similar to those observed in humans. Finally, acute administration of yohimbine (1.25, 2.5 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg), which putatively increase extracellular norepinephrine and dopamine respectively, resulted in RT shortening, baseline-dependent effects on SSRT, and attenuated adaptive RT adjustments in rats in the case of d-amphetamine. These findings suggest that dopamine and norepinephrine encouraged motivated, reward-seeking behaviour and supported inhibitory control in an inverted-U-like fashion. Taken together, these observations validate the rat countermanding task for further study of the neural correlates and neurotransmitters mediating adaptive control of behaviour and lifespan changes in behavioural control.</description>

   <description>Surveillance studies has been somewhat inattentive to the perspective of the surveilled subject. It is the functioning of the surveillance apparatus, not the relatively inconsequential subject, which has tended to frame the focus of surveillance inquiries; leaving understandings of surveilled subjects’ experiences relatively limited. This research addresses this gap in the literature, exploring ways in which surveillance studies might understand the surveilled subject with greater consistency. Participants (N=47) shared their encounters with and perceptions of surveillance in a specific (Pearson International Airport) and general (everyday life) context through semi-structured interviews. The findings suggest that surveilled subjects’ encounters can be understood with some consistency – characterized by consistent criteria across subjects and contexts, and through a consistent theoretical framework across subjects in a specific context. However, consistency should not be confused with uniformity; encounters with surveillance must also be recognized for the extent to which they are nuanced and situated. For example, as this study also highlights, participants’ perceptions of encounters with surveillance at Pearson International Airport were differentially distributed in relation to identity characteristics (particularly minority status).</description>

   <description>The overarching purpose of this research program was to describe how intervening for academic deficits may be accompanied by changes in mental health. This multi-dimensional, multi-perspective, and iterative research program was developed to report on two distinct but related studies that addressed the same issue: in what ways does the mental health of students change as they transition from being struggling readers to more able readers? To describe the changes, these studies used a number of qualitative research methodologies—focus groups, individual interviews, and ethnographic case studies. Themes that emerged from the focus group and interview data in the first study were used to create a model that guided observations and interview questions in the second study.&#xd;
The first study described what parents, classroom teachers, and two reading instructors of nine previously struggling readers reported as the outcomes of becoming a more proficient reader. Data from this study indicated three broad domains in which change, as perceived by participants, occurred―cognitive/learning, behavioural/social, and psychological/emotional. Within these three domains, six dimensions were identified as having changed as reading improved: (a) academic achievement, (b) attitude, (c) attention, (d) behaviour, (e) mental health, and (f) empowerment. These domains, dimensions, and 15 constituent elements were used to create the model to guide the subsequent study. The purpose of the second study was to validate and refine this model by using an ethnographic case study approach to explore the ways in which the model accounted for the changes in reading and mental health seen in three boys over the months they participated in the intervention. &#xd;
By investigating the relationship between learning to read and mental health, this research aimed to enhance our understanding of how gains in reading may also improve the mental health of struggling readers. The model was found to be robust and a convenient conceptual framework to further our understanding of this relationship. Importantly, gains made in the cognitive/learning domain through an effective reading intervention, offered in a supportive learning environment, were shown to be accompanied by concomitant gains in both the behavioural/social and psychological/emotional domains—all of which enhance student thriving.</description>

   <description>Despite its central role in religious life of the region, the sculptural tradition of the Southern Chilean Chiloé Archipelago, ranging from the 17th century to the present day, has been vastly understudied. Isidoro Vázquez de Acuña’s 1994 volume Santeria de Chiloe: ensayo y catastro remains the only catalogue of Chilote sculpture. Though the author includes photographs of a vast array of works, he does not attempt to place the sculptures within a chronology, or consider their place within the greater Latin American context. My thesis will place this group of works within a chronological and geographical context that reaches from the 16th century to the present day, connected to the artistic traditions of regions as far afield as Paraguay and Lima. I will first consider the works brought to the Archipelago by religious orders – the Jesuits and Franciscans – as well as influences on artistic style and religious culture throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. I will focus in particular on three works generally considered to be from the 17th and 18th centuries – the Virgin of Loreto at Achao, the Saint Michael at Castro, and the Jesus Nazareno of Caguach – using visual analysis and sifting through generations of primary and secondary sources to determine from where and when these sculptures came. With this investigation as a foundation, I will consider how they inspired vernacular sculptural expression and trace ‘family trees’ of vernacular works based on these precedents. Vernacular artistic traditions are often viewed as derivative and lacking in skill, but Chilote sculptors in fact engaged with a variety of outside influences and experimented with different sculptural styles. I will conclude by considering which aspects of these styles Chilote artists chose to incorporate into their own work, alter or exclude, artistic decisions that shed light on the Archipelago’s religious and cultural fabric.</description>

   <description>In May 2013, Angelina Jolie revealed that because she had a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and carried a rare BRCA gene mutation, she had undergone a preventive double mastectomy. Media coverage has been extensive around the world, including in Russia, not an English-language country, where all global news is inevitably filtered by translation. After examining the reactions of Russian mass media and members of the public to Jolie’s disclosure, I consider what transformations have occurred with Jolie’s message in the process of cross-cultural transfer. I explore the mass media portrayal of Jolie’s announcement, laypersons’ immediate and prolonged reactions, and the reflections of patients involved directly in the field of hereditary breast cancer. To my knowledge, this multifaceted and bilingual project is the first conceptualization of Jolie’s story as it has been translated in a different sociocultural environment.&#xd;
I start with examination of offline and online publications that appeared in Russia within two months after Jolie’s announcement. In this part of my analysis, I conceptualize the representation of Jolie’s case in Russian mass media and grasp what sociocultural waves were generated by this case among general lay audiences. Another part of my study contains the results of qualitative in-depth interviews. Eight women with a family history of hereditary breast cancer were recruited to participate in the research. The findings represent Jolie’s case through the eyes of Russian women with the same gene mutation as Jolie. &#xd;
Consolidating my findings, I argue that Jolie’s announcement was misinterpreted and misrepresented by Russian mass media, as well as misunderstood by a considerable part of the media audience. Jolie’s perspective on hereditary breast cancer mostly remained unheard among members of the Russian public. I make suggestions about the reasons for such a phenomenon, and demonstrate how Jolie’s case is implicated in politics, economics, and the culture of contemporary Russia.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2016-05-23 13:05:45.818</description>
   <description>In this thesis, the origin of large-scale structures in hot star winds, believed to be responsible for the presence of discrete absorption components (DACs) in the absorption troughs of ultraviolet resonance lines, is constrained using both observations and numerical simulations. These structures are understood as arising from bright regions on the stellar surface, although their physical cause remains unknown.&#xd;
First, we use high quality circular spectropolarimetric observations of 13 well-studied OB stars to evaluate the potential role of dipolar magnetic fields in producing DACs. We perform longitudinal field measurements and place limits on the field strength using Bayesian inference, assuming that it is dipolar. No magnetic field was detected within this sample. The derived constraints statistically refute any significant dynamical influence from a magnetic dipole on the wind for all of these stars, ruling out such fields as a cause for DACs.&#xd;
Second, we perform numerical simulations using bright spots constrained by broadband optical photometric observations. We calculate hydrodynamical wind models using three sets of spot sizes and strengths. Co-rotating interaction regions are yielded in each model, and radiative transfer shows that the properties of the variations in the UV resonance lines synthesized from these models are consistent with those found in observed UV spectra, establishing the first consistent link between UV spectroscopic line profile variability and photometric variations and thus supporting the bright spot paradigm (BSP).&#xd;
Finally, we develop and apply a phenomenological model to quantify the measurable effects co-rotating bright spots would have on broadband optical photometry and on the profiles of photopheric lines in optical spectra. This model can be used to evaluate the existence of these spots, and, in the event of their detection, characterize them. Furthermore, a tentative spot evolution model is presented. A preliminary analysis of its output, compared to the observed photometric variations of xi Persei, suggests the possible existence of “active longitudes” on the surface of this star.&#xd;
Future work will expand the range of observational diagnostics that can be interpreted within the BSP, and link phenomenology (bright spots) to physical processes (magnetic spots or non-radial pulsations).</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2016-05-24 15:24:38.381</description>
   <description>This thesis uses models of firm-heterogeneity to complete empirical analyses in economic history and agricultural economics.  In Chapter 2, a theoretical model of firm heterogeneity is used to derive a statistic that summarizes the welfare gains from the introduction of a new technology.  The empirical application considers the use of mechanical steam power in the Canadian manufacturing sector during the late nineteenth century. I exploit exogenous variation in geography to estimate several parameters of the model.  My results indicate that the use of steam power resulted in a 15.1 percent increase in firm-level productivity and a 3.0-5.2 percent increase in aggregate welfare.  Chapter 3 considers various policy alternatives to price ceiling legislation in the market for production quotas in the dairy farming sector in Quebec.  I develop a dynamic model of the demand for quotas with farmers that are heterogeneous in their marginal cost of milk production.  The econometric analysis uses farm-level data and estimates a parameter of the theoretical model that is required for the counterfactual experiments.  The results indicate that the price of quotas could be reduced to the ceiling price through a 4.16 percent expansion of the aggregate supply of quotas, or through moderate trade liberalization of Canadian dairy products.  In Chapter 4, I study the relationship between farm-level productivity and participation in the Commercial Export Milk (CEM) program.  I use a difference-in-difference research design with inverse propensity weights to test for causality between participation in the CEM program and total factor productivity (TFP).  I find a positive correlation between participation in the CEM program and TFP, however I find no statistically significant evidence that the CEM program affected TFP.</description>

   <description>The integration of mathematics and science in secondary schools in the 21st century continues to be an important topic of practice and research. The purpose of my research study, which builds on studies by Frykholm and Glasson (2005) and Berlin and White (2010), is to explore the potential constraints and benefits of integrating mathematics and science in Ontario secondary schools based on the perspectives of in-service and pre-service teachers with various math and/or science backgrounds. &#xd;
	A qualitative and quantitative research design with an exploratory approach was used. The qualitative data was collected from a sample of 12 in-service teachers with various math and/or science backgrounds recruited from two school boards in Eastern Ontario. The quantitative and some qualitative data was collected from a sample of 81 pre-service teachers from the Queen’s University Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the in-service teachers while a survey and a focus group was conducted with the pre-service teachers. Once the data was collected, the qualitative data were abductively analyzed. For the quantitative data, descriptive and inferential statistics (one-way ANOVAs and Pearson Chi Square analyses) were calculated to examine perspectives of teachers regardless of teaching background and to compare groups of teachers based on teaching background.	&#xd;
	The findings of this study suggest that in-service and pre-service teachers have a positive attitude towards the integration of math and science and view it as valuable to student learning and success. The pre-service teachers viewed the integration as easy and did not express concerns to this integration. On the other hand, the in-service teachers highlighted concerns and challenges such as resources, scheduling, and time constraints. My results illustrate when teachers perceive it is valuable to integrate math and science and which aspects of the classroom benefit best from the integration. Furthermore, the results highlight barriers and possible solutions to better the integration of math and science. In addition to the benefits and constraints of integration, my results illustrate why some teachers may opt out of integrating math and science and the different strategies teachers have incorporated to integrate math and science in their classroom.</description>

   <description>Aquaculture growth has intensified the need for a diversification of nutritionally appropriate aquafeed ingredients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Spirulina, a blue-green microalgae, and soybean meal as the sole protein sources in grow-out Tilapia diets. We constructed 3 experimental diets with soybean meal and 0,15, 30, and 45% Spirulina (SBM, SP15, SP30, and SP45 respectively) as their main protein sources. We compared these diets to a commercial Tilapia diet (CC). Additionally, to evaluate the benefit of fishmeal inclusion, fishmeal was added (2 and 10%) to the most successful Spirulina containing diet (FM2, FM10). We evaluated these experimental diets based on their physical properties, palatability, growth potential, waste production, and overall cost. No significant differences in growth performance were found between any of the diets. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and total phosphorus (TP) levels in each tank were significantly affected by diet (p&lt;0.05). CC had significantly higher TP than the experimental diets and SP15 had significantly higher TAN than the other diets. Only CC was found to be significantly more palatable than the experimental diets, and Spirulina inclusion was inversely correlated to pellet stability. Lastly, SP15 was the most profitable experimental diet. We recommend eliminating fishmeal from grow-out Tilapia diets in favour of soybean meal and Spirulina. Spirulina should, however, be limited to 15% to avoid the negative effects it has on stability and profitability, and its possible effect on feed intake.</description>

   <description>With the quick advance of web service technologies, end-users can conduct various on-line tasks, such as shopping on-line. Usually, end-users compose a set of services to accomplish a task, and need to enter values to services to invoke the composite services. Quite often, users re-visit websites and use services to perform re-occurring tasks. The users are required to enter the same information into various web services to accomplish such re-occurring tasks. However, repetitively typing the same information into services is a tedious job for end-users. It can negatively impact user experience when an end-user needs to type the re-occurring information repetitively into web services.&#xd;
Recent studies have proposed several approaches to help users fill in values to services automatically. However, prior studies mainly suffer the following drawbacks: (1) limited support of collecting and analyzing user inputs; (2) poor accuracy of filling values to services; (3) not designed for service composition. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, we need maximize the reuse of previous user inputs across services and end-users.&#xd;
In this thesis, we introduce our approaches that prevent end-users from entering the same information into repetitive on-line tasks. More specifically, we improve the process of filling out services in the following 4 aspects: First, we investigate the characteristics of input parameters. We propose an ontology-based approach to automatically categorize parameters and fill values to the categorized input parameters. Second, we propose a comprehensive framework that leverages user contexts and usage patterns into the process of filling values to services. Third, we propose an approach for maximizing the value propagation among services and end-users by linking a set of semantically related parameters together and similar end-users. Last, we propose a ranking-based framework that ranks a list of previous user inputs for an input parameter to save a user from unnecessary data entries. Our framework learns and analyzes interactions of user inputs and input parameters to rank user inputs for input parameters under different contexts.</description>

   <description>The sport of rowing has become more popular in the past decade. While it is a relatively low impact sport, injuries can occur, specifically to the ribs (Karlson K. A., 1998) and more often in female athletes (Hickey, Fricker, &amp; McDonald , 1997). It has been proposed that as the athlete rows, applying a cyclical load to the body, the mid trapezius fatigues and is unable to resist the force produced during the drive phase (Warden S. J., Gutschlag, Wajswelner, &amp; Crossley, 2002). Once this happens, the scapulae are then pulled anterio-laterally which increases the compression force on the ribs, increasing the risk of injury. &#xd;
The rowing motion of 12 female varsity and club rowers was tracked as they completed a fatiguing rowing test on a rowing ergometer. &#xd;
Results showed that the curvature of thoracic spine changed throughout the rowing cycle but did not change with increasing power level. The transverse shoulder angle decreased (the upper back was less straight) as power level increased (R2=-0.69±19), suggesting that the scapula moved anterio-laterally. This may be that as it tired, the mid-trapezius was unable to hold the scapulae in position. The decreasing transverse shoulder angle when the power level is increased indirectly supports the fatiguing of the retractor muscles as a mechanism of injury. It would be valuable to understand the limitations of each athlete and to be able to prescribe the optimal training zone to reduce the risk of injury.</description>

   <description>The control of radioactive backgrounds will be key in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay at the SNO+ experiment. Several aspects of the SNO+ back-grounds have been studied. The SNO+ tellurium purification process may require ultra low background ethanol as a reagent. A low background assay technique for ethanol was developed and used to identify a source of ethanol with measured 238U and 232Th concentrations below 2.8 10^-13 g/g and 10^-14 g/g respectively. It was also determined that at least 99:997% of the ethanol can be removed from the purified tellurium using forced air flow in order to reduce 14C contamination. In addition, a quality-control technique using an oxygen sensor was studied to monitor 222Rn contamination due to air leaking into the SNO+ scintillator during transport. The expected sensitivity of the technique is 0.1mBq/L or better depending on the oxygen sensor used. Finally, the dependence of SNO+ neutrinoless double beta decay sensitivity on internal background levels was studied using Monte Carlo simulation. The half-life limit to neutrinoless double beta decay of 130Te after 3 years of operation was found to be 4.8 1025 years under default conditions.</description>

   <description>Stroke is a prevalent disorder with immense socioeconomic impact. A variety of chronic neurological deficits result from stroke. In particular, sensorimotor deficits are a significant barrier to achieving post-stroke independence. Unfortunately, the majority of pre-clinical studies that show improved outcomes in animal stroke models have failed in clinical trials. Pre-clinical studies using non-human primate (NHP) stroke models prior to initiating human trials are a potential step to improving translation from animal studies to clinical trials. Robotic assessment tools represent a quantitative, reliable, and reproducible means to assess reaching behaviour following stroke in both humans and NHPs. We investigated the use of robotic technology to assess sensorimotor impairments in NHPs following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Two cynomolgus macaques underwent transient MCAO for 90 minutes. Approximately 1.5 years following the procedure these NHPs and two non-stroke control monkeys were trained in a reaching task with both arms in the KINARM exoskeleton. This robot permits elbow and shoulder movements in the horizontal plane. The task required NHPs to make reaching movements from a centrally positioned start target to 1 of 8 peripheral targets uniformly distributed around the first target. We analyzed four movement parameters: reaction time, movement time (MT), initial direction error (IDE), and number of speed maxima to characterize sensorimotor deficiencies. We hypothesized reduced performance in these attributes during a neurobehavioural task with the paretic limb of NHPs following MCAO compared to controls.&#xd;
Reaching movements in the non-affected limbs of control and experimental NHPs showed bell-shaped velocity profiles. In contrast, the reaching movements with the affected limbs were highly variable. We found distinctive patterns in MT, IDE, and number of speed peaks between control and experimental monkeys and between limbs of NHPs with MCAO. NHPs with MCAO demonstrated more speed peaks, longer MTs, and greater IDE in their paretic limb compared to controls. These initial results qualitatively match human stroke subjects’ performance, suggesting that robotic neurobehavioural assessment in NHPs with stroke is feasible and could have translational relevance in subsequent human studies. Further studies will be necessary to replicate and expand on these preliminary findings.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2016-05-29 18:11:34.114</description>
   <description>Over the past few years, logging has evolved from from simple printf statements to&#xd;
more complex and widely used logging libraries. Today logging information is used&#xd;
to support various development activities such as fixing bugs, analyzing the results&#xd;
of load tests, monitoring performance and transferring knowledge. Recent research&#xd;
has examined how to improve logging practices by informing developers what to log&#xd;
and where to log. Furthermore, the strong dependence on logging has led to the&#xd;
development of logging libraries that have reduced the intricacies of logging, which&#xd;
has resulted in an abundance of log information.&#xd;
Two recent challenges have emerged as modern software systems start to treat&#xd;
logging as a core aspect of their software. In particular, 1) infrastructural challenges&#xd;
have emerged due to the plethora of logging libraries available today and 2) processing&#xd;
challenges have emerged due to the large number of log processing tools that ingest&#xd;
logs and produce useful information from them. In this thesis, we explore these two&#xd;
challenges.  We first explore the infrastructural challenges that arise due to the plethora of&#xd;
logging libraries available today. As systems evolve, their logging infrastructure has&#xd;
to evolve (commonly this is done by migrating to new logging libraries). We explore&#xd;
logging library migrations within Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects. We&#xd;
i&#xd;
find that close to 14% of the pro jects within the ASF migrate their logging libraries at&#xd;
least once. For processing challenges, we explore the different factors which can affect the&#xd;
likelihood of a logging statement changing in the future in four open source systems&#xd;
namely ActiveMQ, Camel, Cloudstack and Liferay. Such changes are likely to negatively impact the log processing tools that must be updated to accommodate such&#xd;
changes. We find that 20%-45% of the logging statements within the four systems&#xd;
are changed at least once. We construct random forest classifiers and Cox models&#xd;
to determine the likelihood of both just-introduced and long-lived logging statements&#xd;
changing in the future. We find that file ownership, developer experience, log density&#xd;
and SLOC are important factors in determining the stability of logging statements.</description>

   <description>The literature on niche separation and coexistence between species is large, but there is widespread variation in behavioural strategy between individuals of the same species that has received much less attention. Understanding what maintains this diversity is important because intraspecific behavioural diversity can affect population dynamics and community interactions. Multiple behavioural strategies can arise either as phenotype-dependent ‘conditional strategies’, where phenotypic variation causes individuals to adopt different strategies for optimizing fitness, or as internally-independent ‘alternative strategies’, where multiple fitness peaks exist for individuals and strategic ‘choice’ remains plastic. Though intraspecific variation in stable phenotypes is known to maintain intraspecific behavioural diversity through conditional strategies, when internal conditions are highly plastic or reversible, it is not clear whether individual behaviours are maintained as conditional strategies, or as alternative strategies of equal fitness. In this study, I combine an observational and experimental approach to identify the likely mechanisms maintaining behavioural diversity between hemoglobin-rich and hemoglobin-poor morphs in a natural population of Daphnia pulicaria. In Round Lake, individuals with low hemoglobin migrate daily from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion, whereas individuals with high hemoglobin remain in the hypolimnion. Using high-resolution depth and time sampling, I discovered behavioural diversity both within and among hemoglobin phenotypes. I tested the role of hemoglobin phenotype in maintaining behavioural diversity using automated migration robots that move individuals across the natural environmental gradients in the lake. By measuring the fitness of each morph undergoing either a natural migration behaviour, or the migration of the opposite morph, I found that the fitness of hemoglobin rich and poor morphs in their natural behaviour does not differ, but that Hb-rich individuals can obtain equal fitness from either behaviour, while Hb-poor morphs suffer substantial drops in survivorship in the alternate migration behaviour. Thus, migration behaviour in this system exists as a conditional strategy for some individuals, and as alternative strategies of equal fitness for others. The results of this study suggest that individual limits in the expression of highly flexible internal conditions can reinforce intraspecific behavioural diversity. Few studies have measured the fitness consequences of switching migration strategies and this study provides a rare example in the field.</description>

   <description>The purpose of the current dissertation is to identify the features of effective interventions by exploring the experiences of youth with ASD who participate in such interventions, through two intervention studies (Studies 1 and 2) and one interview study (Study 3).&#xd;
Studies 1 and 2 were designed to support the development of social competence of youth with ASD through Structured Play with LEGO TM (Study 1, 12 youths with ASD, ages 7–12) and Minecraft TM (Study 2, 4 youths with ASD, ages 11–13). Over the course of the sessions, the play of the youth developed from parallel play (children playing alone, without interacting) to co-operative play (playing together with shared objectives). The results of Study 2 showed that rates of initiations and levels of engagement increased from the first session to the final session.&#xd;
In Study 3, 12 youths with ASD (ages 10–14) and at least one of their parents were interviewed to explore what children and their parents want from programs designed to improve social competence, which activities and practices were perceived to promote social competence by the participants, and which factors affected their decisions regarding these programs. The adolescents and parents looked for programs that supported social development and emotional wellbeing, but did not always have access to the programs they would have preferred, with factors such as cost and location reducing their options.&#xd;
Three overarching themes emerged through analysis of the three studies: (a) interests of the youth; (b) structure, both through interactions and instruction; and (c) naturalistic settings. Adolescents generally engage more willingly in interventions that incorporate their&#xd;
interests, such as play with Minecraft TM in Study 2. Additionally, Structured Play and structured instruction were crucial components of providing safe and supportive contexts for the development of social competence. Finally, skills learned in naturalistic settings tend to be applied more successfully in everyday situations. The themes are analysed through the lens of Vygotsky’s (1978) perspectives on learning, play, and development. Implications of the results for practitioners and researchers are discussed.</description>

   <description>Faced with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, I began with the objective of discovering methods for creating art that were still accessible to me. Along the way, I encountered others who had travelled this road before me. Their experiences led me to examine, not only my art, but also my political orientations, my love obligations and my transitioning self. In my varied art pieces, I conjure something from diverse sources and different worldviews, including contemporary feminist performance art and disability cultural theory.&#xd;
&#xd;
My thesis is a project. I make things: puppets, videos and performances, which included the exhibition, Need to be Adored (2014), staged in the digital media lab of the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The exhibition introduced thirteen of my puppets and a thirty-two-minute looped video. Following the exhibition, I put the puppets away and spent two years reading. Finally, taking my inspiration from Carolyn Ellis’s The Autoethnographic I (Ellis 2004), I turned my processes into words. I wrote out my experiences. I created an alternative text of my identity from an able-bodied cis-identified woman into a disabled trans-feminist artist academic.&#xd;
&#xd;
The writing required an uncomfortably intimate examination of my life. Nothing less than complete honesty would allow me to understand my new location. The resulting text is a lyrical and sometimes whimsical flow of consciousness that invites the reader to imagine what it might be like to engage in such a candid review of everything one holds close to one’s heart.&#xd;
&#xd;
Contained within are all my identities. In this text I let some out. This is a story of unsettling. I am working on my art practices, creating a cast of characters from cloth. Puppets. El becomes the exulted main character of a fictional accounting. She uncovers her queer roots and begins to see that she is at the centre of a very strange geography. Her desire to make film is revealed as she re-remembers her childhood through a disability lens.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2016-05-30 12:18:21.402</description>
   <description>Introduction: Current physical activity levels among children and youth are alarmingly low; a mere 7% of children and youth are meeting the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines (Colley et al., 2011), which means that the vast majority of this population is at risk of developing major health problems in adulthood (Janssen &amp; Leblanc, 2010). These high inactivity rates may be related to suboptimal experiences in sport and physical activity stemming from a lack of competence and confidence (Lubans, Morgan, Cliff, Barnett, &amp; Okely, 2010). Developing a foundation of physical literacy can encourage and maintain lifelong physical activity, yet this does not always occur naturally as a part of human growth (Hardman, 2011). An ideal setting to foster the growth and development of physical literacy is physical education class. Physical education class can offer all children and youth an equal opportunity to learn and practice the skills needed to be active for life (Hardman, 2011). Elementary school teachers are responsible for delivering the physical education curriculum, and it is important to understand their will and capacity as the implementing agents of physical literacy development curriculum (McLaughlin, 1987). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the physical literacy component of the 2015 Ontario Health and Physical Education curriculum policy through the eyes of key informants, and to explore the resources available for the implementation of this new policy. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with seven key informants of the curriculum policy development, including two teachers. In tandem with the interviews, a resource inventory and curriculum review were conducted to assess the content and availability of physical literacy resources. All data were analyzed through the lens of Hogwood and Gunn’s (1984) 10 preconditions for policy implementation. Results: Participants discussed how implementation is affected by: accountability, external capacity, internal capacity, awareness and understanding of physical literacy, implementation expertise, and policy climate. Discussion: Participants voiced similar opinions on most issues, and the overall lack of attention given to physical education programs in schools will continue to be a major dilemma when trying to combat such high physical inactivity levels.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes an investigation in which we compare Ni(0), Ni(I) and Ni(II) complexes containing 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) as a phosphine ligand for their abilities to effect three types of cross-coupling reactions: Buchwald-Hartwig Amination, Heck-Mizoroki, and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions with different types of substrates. The Ni(0) complex Ni(dppp)2 is known and we have synthesized it&#xd;
via a new procedure involving zinc reduction of the known NiCl2(dppp) in the presence of an excess of dppp. The Ni(0) complex was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.

   <description>Exergames are digital games with a physical exertion component. Exergames can help motivate fitness in people not inclined toward exercise. However, players of exergames sometimes over-exert, risking adverse health effects. These players must be told to slow down, but doing so may distract them from gameplay and diminish their desire to keep exercising.&#xd;
	In this thesis we apply the concept of nudges—indirect suggestions that gently push people toward a desired behaviour—to keeping exergame players from over-exerting. We describe the effective use of nudges through a set of four design principles: natural integration, comprehension, progression, and multiple channels.&#xd;
	We describe two exergames modified to use nudges to persuade players to slow down, and describe the studies evaluating the use of nudges in these games. PlaneGame shows that nudges can be as effective as an explicit textual display to control player over-exertion. Gekku Race demonstrates that nudges are not necessarily effective when players have a strong incentive to over-exert. However, Gekku Race also shows that, even in high-energy games, the power of nudges can be maintained by adding negative consequences to the nudges. We use the term "shove" to describe a nudge using negative consequences to increase its pressure.&#xd;
	We were concerned that making players slow down would damage their immersion—the feeling of being engaged with a game. However, testing showed no loss of immersion through the use of nudges to reduce exertion.&#xd;
	Players reported that the nudges and shoves motivated them to slow down when they were over-exerting, and fit naturally into the games.</description>

   <description>Light confinement and controlling an optical field has numerous applications in the field of telecommunications for optical signals processing. When the wavelength of the electromagnetic field is on the order of the period of a photonic microstructure, the field undergoes reflection, refraction, and coherent scattering. This produces photonic bandgaps, forbidden frequency regions or spectral stop bands where light cannot exist. Dielectric perturbations that break the perfect periodicity of these structures produce what is analogous to an impurity state in the bandgap of a semiconductor. The defect modes that exist at discrete frequencies within the photonic bandgap are spatially localized about the cavity-defects in the photonic crystal. In this thesis the properties of two tight-binding approximations (TBAs) are investigated in one-dimensional and two-dimensional coupled-cavity photonic crystal structures&#xd;
&#xd;
We require an efficient and simple approach that ensures the continuity of the electromagnetic field across dielectric interfaces in complex structures. In this thesis we develop \textrm{E}&#xd;
 -- and \textrm{D}&#xd;
 --TBAs to calculate the modes in finite 1D and 2D two-defect coupled-cavity photonic crystal structures. In the \textrm{E}&#xd;
 -- and \textrm{D}&#xd;
 --TBAs we expand the coupled-cavity \overrightarrow{E}&#xd;
 --modes in terms of the individual \overrightarrow{E}&#xd;
 -- and \overrightarrow{D}&#xd;
 --modes, respectively. We investigate the dependence of the defect modes, their frequencies and quality factors on the relative placement of the defects in the photonic crystal structures. We then elucidate the differences between the two TBA formulations, and describe the conditions under which these formulations may be more robust when encountering a dielectric perturbation. Our 1D analysis showed that the 1D modes were sensitive to the structure geometry. The antisymmetric \textrm{D}&#xd;
  mode amplitudes show that the \textrm{D}&#xd;
 --TBA did not capture the correct (tangential \overrightarrow{E}&#xd;
 --field) boundary conditions. However, the \textrm{D}&#xd;
 --TBA did not yield significantly poorer results compared to the \textrm{E}&#xd;
 --TBA. Our 2D analysis reveals that the \textrm{E}&#xd;
 -- and \textrm{D}&#xd;
 --TBAs produced nearly identical mode profiles for every structure. Plots of the relative difference between the \textrm{E}&#xd;
  and \textrm{D}&#xd;
  mode amplitudes show that the \textrm{D}&#xd;
 --TBA did capture the correct (normal \overrightarrow{E}&#xd;
 --field) boundary conditions. We found that the 2D TBA CC mode calculations were 125-150 times faster than an FDTD calculation for the same two-defect PCS. Notwithstanding this efficiency, the appropriateness of either TBA was found to depend on the geometry of the structure and the mode(s), i.e. whether or not the mode has a large normal or tangential component.</description>

   <description>This study examined the effect of a spanwise angle of attack gradient on the growth and stability of a dynamic stall vortex in a rotating system. It was found that a spanwise angle of attack gradient induces a corresponding spanwise vorticity gradient, which, in combination with spanwise flow, results in a redistribution of circulation along the blade. Specifically, when modelling the angle of attack gradient experienced by a wind turbine at the 30% span position during a gust event, the spanwise vorticity gradient was aligned such that circulation was transported from areas of high circulation to areas of low circulation, increasing the local dynamic stall vortex&#xd;
growth rate, which corresponds to an increase in the lift coefficient, and a decrease in the local vortex stability at this point. Reversing the relative alignment of the spanwise vorticity gradient and spanwise flow results in circulation transport from&#xd;
areas of low circulation generation to areas of high circulation generation, acting to reduce local circulation and stabilise the vortex. This circulation redistribution behaviour describes a mechanism by which the fluctuating loads on a wind turbine are magnified, which is detrimental to turbine lifetime and performance. Therefore, an understanding of this phenomenon has the potential to facilitate optimised wind turbine design.</description>

   <description>This dissertation includes two studies. Study 1 is a qualitative case study that describes enactment of the main components of a high fidelity Full-Day Early Learning Kindergarten (FDELK) classroom, specifically play-based learning and teacher-ECE collaboration. Study 2 is a quantitative analysis that investigates how effectively the FDELK program promotes school readiness skills, namely self-regulation, literacy, and numeracy, in Kindergarteners. To describe the main components of an FDELK classroom in Study 1, a sub-sample of four high fidelity case study schools were selected from a larger case study sample. Interview data from these schools’ administrators, educators, parents, and community stakeholders were used to describe how the main components of the FDELK program enabled educators to meet the individual needs of students and promote students’ SR development. In Study 2, hierarchical regression analyses of 32,207 students’ self-regulation, literacy, and numeracy outcomes using 2012 Ontario Early Development Instrument (EDI) data revealed essentially no benefit for students participating in the FDELK program when compared to peers in Half-Day or Alternate-Day Kindergarten programs. Being older and female predicted more positive SR and literacy outcomes. Age and gender accounted for limited variance in numeracy outcomes. Results from both studies suggest that the Ontario Ministry of Education should take steps to improve the quality of the FDELK program by incorporating evidence-based guidelines and goals for play, reducing Kindergarten class sizes to more effectively scaffold learning, and revising curriculum expectations to include a greater focus on SR, literacy, and numeracy skills.</description>

   <description>As human populations and resource consumption increase, it is increasingly important to monitor the quality of our environment. While laboratory instruments offer useful information, portable, easy to use sensors would allow environmental analysis to occur on-site, at lower cost, and with minimal operator training. We explore the synthesis, modification, and applications of modified polysiloxane in environmental sensing. Multiple methods of producing modified siloxanes were investigated. Oligomers were formed by using functionalized monomers, producing siloxane materials containing silicon hydride, methyl, and phenyl side chains. Silicon hydride-functionalized oligomers were further modified by hydrosilylation to incorporate methyl ester and naphthyl side chains. Modifications to the siloxane materials were also carried out using post-curing treatments. Methyl ester-functionalized siloxane was incorporated into the surface of a cured poly(dimethylsiloxane) film by siloxane equilibration. The materials containing methyl esters were hydrolyzed to reveal carboxylic acids, which could later be used for covalent protein immobilization. Finally, the siloxane surfaces were modified to incorporate antibodies by covalent, affinity, and adsorption-based attachment. These modifications were characterized by a variety of methods, including contact angle, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dye labels, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The modified siloxane materials were employed in a variety of sensing schemes. Volatile organic compounds were detected using methyl, phenyl, and naphthyl-functionalized materials on a Fabry-Perot interferometer and a refractometer. The Fabry-Perot interferometer was found to detect the analytes upon siloxane extraction by deformation of the Bragg reflectors. The refractometer was used to determine that naphthyl-functionalized siloxanes had elevated refractive indices, rendering these materials more sensitive to some analytes. Antibody-modified siloxanes were used to detect biological analytes through a solid phase microextraction-mediated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (SPME ELISA). The SPME ELISA was found to have higher analyte sensitivity compared to a conventional ELISA system. The detection scheme was used to detect Escherichia coli at 8500 CFU/mL. These results demonstrate the variety of methods that can be used to modify siloxanes and the wide range of applications of modified siloxanes has been demonstrated through chemical and biological sensing schemes.</description>

   <description>Pipelines are one of the safest means to transport crude oil, but are not spill-free. This is of concern in North America, due to the large volumes of crude oil shipped by Canadian producers and the lengthy network of pipelines. Each pipeline crosses many rivers, supporting a wide variety of human activities, and rich aquatic life. However, there is a knowledge gap on the risks of contamination of river beds due to oil spills. This thesis addresses this knowledge gap by focussing on mechanisms that transport water (and contaminants) from the free surface flow to the bed sediments, and vice-versa. &#xd;
	The work focuses on gravel rivers, in which bed sediments are sufficiently permeable that pressure gradients caused by the interactions of flow with topographic elements (gravel bars), or changes in direction induce exchanges of water between the free surface flow and the bed, known as hyporheic flows. &#xd;
	The objectives of the thesis are: to present a new method to visualize and quantify hyporheic flows in laboratory experiments; to conduct a novel series of experiments on hyporheic flow induced by a gravel bar under different free surface flows.&#xd;
	The new method to quantify hyporheic flows rests on injections of a solution of dye and water. The method yielded accurate flow lines, and reasonable estimates of the hyporheic flow velocities. &#xd;
	The present series of experiments was carried out in a 11 m long, 0.39 m wide, and 0.41 m deep tilting flume. The gravel had a mean particle size of 7.7 mm. Different free surface flows were imposed by changing the flume slope and flow depth. Measured hyporheic flows were turbulent. Smaller free surface flow depths resulted in stronger hyporheic flows (higher velocities, and deeper dye penetration into the sediment). &#xd;
	A significant finding is that different free surface flows (different velocities, Reynolds number, etc.) produce similar hyporheic flows as long as the downstream hydraulic gradients are similar. This suggests, that for a specified bar geometry, the characteristics of the hyporheic flows depend on the downstream hydraulic gradients, and not or only minimally on the internal dynamics of the free surface flow.</description>

   <description>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiovascular disease where the heart muscle is partially thickened and blood flow is - potentially fatally - obstructed. It is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death in young people. Electrocardiography (ECG) and Echocardiography (Echo) are the standard tests for identifying HCM and other cardiac abnormalities. The American Heart Association has recommended using a pre-participation questionnaire for young athletes instead of ECG or Echo tests due to considerations of cost and time involved in interpreting the results of these tests by an expert cardiologist. Initially we set out to develop a classifier for automated prediction of young athletes’ heart conditions based on the answers to the questionnaire. Classification results and further in-depth analysis using computational and statistical methods indicated significant shortcomings of the questionnaire in predicting cardiac abnormalities. &#xd;
Automated methods for analyzing ECG signals can help reduce cost and save time in the pre-participation screening process by detecting HCM and other cardiac abnormalities. Therefore, the main goal of this dissertation work is to identify HCM through computational analysis of 12-lead ECG. ECG signals recorded on one or two leads have been analyzed in the past for classifying individual heartbeats into different types of arrhythmia as annotated primarily in the MIT-BIH database. In contrast, we classify complete sequences of 12-lead ECGs to assign patients into two groups: HCM vs. non-HCM. The challenges and issues we address include missing ECG waves in one or more leads and the dimensionality of a large feature-set. We address these by proposing imputation and feature-selection methods. We develop heartbeat-classifiers by employing Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, and propose a method to classify full 12-lead ECGs based on the proportion of heartbeats classified as HCM. The results from our experiments show that the classifiers developed using our methods perform well in identifying HCM. &#xd;
Thus the two contributions of this thesis are the utilization of computational and statistical methods for discovering shortcomings in a current screening procedure and the development of methods to identify HCM through computational analysis of 12-lead ECG signals.</description>

   <description>In Canada, increases in rural development has led to a growing need to effectively manage the resulting municipal and city sewage without the addition of significant cost- and energy- expending infrastructure. Storring Septic Service Limited is a family-owned, licensed wastewater treatment facility located in eastern Ontario. It makes use of a passive waste stabilization pond system to treat and dispose of waste and wastewater in an environmentally responsible manner. Storring Septic, like many other similar small-scale wastewater treatment facilities across Canada, has the potential to act as a sustainable eco-engineered facility that municipalities and service providers could utilize to manage and dispose of their wastewater. However, it is of concern that the substantial inclusion of third party material could be detrimental to the stability and robustness of the pond system. In order to augment the capacity of the current facility, and ensure it remains a self-sustaining system with the capacity to safely accept septage from other sewage haulers, it was hypothesized that pond effluent treatment could be further enhanced through the incorporation of one of three different technology solutions, which would allow the reduction of wastewater quality parameters below existing regulatory effluent discharge limits put in place by Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC). Two of these solutions make use of biofilm technologies in order to enhance the removal of wastewater parameters of interest, and the third utilizes the natural water filtration capabilities of zebra mussels. Pilot-scale testing investigated the effects of each of these technologies on treatment performance under both cold and warm weather operation. This research aimed to understand the important mechanisms behind biological filtration methods in order to choose and optimize the best treatment strategy for full-scale testing and implementation. In doing so, a recommendation matrix was elaborated provided with the potential to be used as a universal operational strategy for wastewater treatment facilities located in environments of similar climate and ecology.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2016-06-09 14:15:08.059</description>
   <description>Stroke is a leading cause of death and permanent disability worldwide, affecting millions of individuals. Traditional clinical scores for assessment of stroke-related impairments are inherently subjective and limited by inter-rater and intra-rater reliability, as well as floor and ceiling effects. In contrast, robotic technologies provide objective, highly repeatable tools for quantification of neurological impairments following stroke.&#xd;
KINARM is an exoskeleton robotic device that provides objective, reliable tools for assessment of sensorimotor, proprioceptive and cognitive brain function by means of a battery of behavioral tasks. As such, KINARM is particularly useful for assessment of neurological impairments following stroke.&#xd;
This thesis introduces a computational framework for assessment of neurological impairments using the data provided by KINARM. This is done by achieving two main objectives. First, to investigate how robotic measurements can be used to estimate current and future abilities to perform daily activities for subjects with stroke. We are able to predict clinical scores related to activities of daily living at present and future time points using a set of robotic biomarkers. The findings of this analysis provide a proof of principle that robotic evaluation can be an effective tool for clinical decision support and target-based rehabilitation therapy.&#xd;
The second main objective of this thesis is to address the emerging problem of long assessment time, which can potentially lead to fatigue when assessing subjects with stroke. To address this issue, we examine two time reduction strategies. The first strategy focuses on task selection, whereby KINARM tasks are arranged in a hierarchical structure so that an earlier task in the assessment procedure can be used to decide whether or not subsequent tasks should be performed. The second strategy focuses on time reduction on the longest two individual KINARM tasks. Both reduction strategies are shown to provide significant time savings, ranging from 30% to 90% using task selection and 50% using individual task reductions, thereby establishing a framework for reduction of assessment time on a broader set of KINARM tasks. All in all, findings of this thesis establish an improved platform for diagnosis and prognosis of stroke using robot-based biomarkers.</description>

   <description>In our daily lives, we often must predict how well we are going to perform in the future based on an evaluation of our current performance and an assessment of how much we will improve with practice. Such predictions can be used to decide whether to invest our time and energy in learning and, if we opt to invest, what rewards we may gain. This thesis investigated whether people are capable of tracking their own learning (i.e. current and future motor ability) and exploiting that information to make decisions related to task reward. In experiment one, participants performed a target aiming task under a visuomotor rotation such that they initially missed the target but gradually improved. After briefly practicing the task, they were asked to select rewards for hits and misses applied to subsequent performance in the task, where selecting a higher reward for hits came at a cost of receiving a lower reward for misses. We found that participants made decisions that were in the direction of optimal and therefore demonstrated knowledge of future task performance. In experiment two, participants learned a novel target aiming task in which they were rewarded for target hits. Every five trials, they could choose a target size which varied inversely with reward value. Although participants’ decisions deviated from optimal, a model suggested that they took into account both past performance, and predicted future performance, when making their decisions. Together, these experiments suggest that people are capable of tracking their own learning and using that information to make sensible decisions related to reward maximization.</description>

   <description>Tetradiids are a group of colonial, tubular fossils that occur globally in Middle to Upper Ordovician strata. Tetradiids were first described as a type of tabulate coral; however, based on their four-fold symmetry, division, and presence of a central-sparry canal, they were recently reinterpreted as a florideophyte rhodophyte algae, a reinterpretation that is tested in this thesis. This study focused on understanding the affinity and taphonomy of this order of fossil. Research was conducted by stratigraphic and petrographic analyses of the Black River Group in the Kingston, Ontario region. Tetradiid occurrences were divided into fragment or colonial, with three morphologies of tetradiids described (Tetradium, Phytopsis and Paratetradium). Morphology is specific to depositional environment, with compact Tetradium consistently within ooid grainstones and open branching Phytopsis and chained Paratetradium consistently within mudstones. Two types of patch reefs were recognized: a Paratetradium bioherm, and a Paratetradium, Phytopsis, stromatolite bioherm. The presence of bioherms implies that tetradiids were capable of hypercalcifying. Preservation styles of tetradiids were investigated, and were compared to brachiopods, echinoderms, mollusks, and ooids. Tetradiids were preferentially preserved as molds and demonstrated complete dissolution of skeletal material. Rare specimens, however, demonstrated preserved horizontal partitions, central plates, and a double wall. Skeletal molds were filled with either calcite spar, mud or encrusted by a cryptomicrobial colony. Both calcitic and aragonitic ooids were discovered. The co-occurrence of aragonitic ooids, aragonitic crytodontids, and the evolution of aragonitic, hypercalcifying tetradiids is interpreted as representing the geochemical favoring of aragonite and HMC in a time of global calcite seas. The geochemical favoring of aragonite is interpreted to be independent to global Mg: Ca ratios, but was the result of increased saturation levels and temperature driven by high atmospheric pCO2. Based on the presence of epitheca, tabulae, septa, and the commonality of growth forms, tetradiids are interpreted as an order of Cnidaria. The evolution of an aragonitic skeleton in tetradiids is interpreted to be the result of de novo acquisition of a skeleton from an unmineralized clade.</description>

   <description>In this thesis I argue that dominant ways of imagining modernity constitute a modern imaginary that carries with it particular expectations concerning modern places, spaces, emotions, and affects as well as expectations concerning the place of religion and enchantment in the modern world. I argue that this modern imaginary and the expectations it entails works to conceal and trivialize supra-rational beliefs and behaviours in scholarship but also in the lives of individuals. I focus on one particular subset of the supra-rational beliefs and behaviours that modern imaginary conceals and trivializes, namely beliefs and behaviours associated with lucky and protective objects. I also focus on the ways the modern imaginary conceals the presence and prevalence of these objects and the beliefs and behaviours they entail in one particular context, namely Montréal, Québec. I argue that these supra-rational beliefs and behaviours constitute a subjunctive mode for understanding and experiencing daily life and describe how the modern imaginary works to discredit this subjunctive register. Finally, I argue that scholars must begin to recognize and examine this subjunctive mode and the playful engagement with half-belief it involves.</description>

   <description>This research explores whether civil society organizations (CSOs) can contribute to more effectively regulating the working conditions of temporary migrant farmworkers in North America. This dissertation unfolds in five parts. The first part of the dissertation sets out the background context. The context includes the political economy of agriculture and temporary migrant labour more broadly. It also includes the political economy of the legal regulations that govern immigration and work relations. The second part of the research builds an analytical model for studying the operation of CSOs active in working with the migrant farmworker population. The purpose of the analytical framework is to make sense of real-world examples by providing categories for analysis and a means to get at the channels of influence that CSOs utilize to achieve their aims. To this end, the model incorporates the insights from three significant bodies of literature—regulatory studies, labour studies, and economic sociology. The third part of the dissertation suggests some key strategic issues that CSOs should consider when intervening to assist migrant farmworkers, and also proposes a series of hypotheses about how CSOs can participate in the regulatory process. The fourth part probes and extends these hypotheses by empirically investigating the operation of three CSOs that are currently active in assisting migrant farm workers in North America: the Agricultural Workers Alliance (Canada), Global Workers’ Justice Alliance (USA), and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (USA). The fifth and final part draws together lessons from the empirical work and concluded that CSOs can fill gaps left by the waning power of actors, such as trade unions and labour inspectorates, as well as act in ways that these traditional actors can not.</description>

   <description>A recently developed novel biomass fuel pellet, the Q’ Pellet, offers significant improvements over conventional white pellets, with characteristics comparable to those of coal. The Q’ Pellet was initially created at bench scale using a proprietary die and punch design, in which the biomass was torrefied in-situ¬ and then compressed. To bring the benefits of the Q’ Pellet to a commercial level, it must be capable of being produced in a continuous process at a competitive cost. &#xd;
A prototype machine was previously constructed in a first effort to assess continuous processing of the Q’ Pellet. The prototype torrefied biomass in a separate, ex-situ reactor and transported it into a rotary compression stage. Upon evaluation, parts of the prototype were found to be unsuccessful and required a redesign of the material transport method as well as the compression mechanism. &#xd;
A process was developed in which material was torrefied ex-situ and extruded in a pre-compression stage. The extruded biomass overcame multiple handling issues that had been experienced with un-densified biomass, facilitating efficient material transport.&#xd;
Biomass was extruded directly into a novel re-designed pelletizing die, which incorporated a removable cap, ejection pin and a die spring to accommodate a repeatable continuous process.  Although after several uses the die required manual intervention due to minor design and manufacturing quality limitations, the system clearly demonstrated the capability of producing the Q’ Pellet in a continuous process.&#xd;
Q’ Pellets produced by the pre-compression method and pelletized in the re-designed die had an average dry basis gross calorific value of 22.04 MJ/kg, pellet durability index of 99.86% and dried to 6.2% of its initial mass following 24 hours submerged in water. This compares well with literature results of 21.29 MJ/kg, 100% pellet durability index and &lt;5% mass increase in a water submersion test. These results indicate that the methods developed herein are capable of producing Q’ Pellets in a continuous process with fuel properties competitive with coal.</description>

   <description>My thesis thinks through the ways Newtonian logics require linear mobility in order to produce narratives of progress. I argue that this linear mobility, and the resulting logics, potentially erases the chaotic and non-linear motions that are required to navigate a colonial landscape. I suggest that these non-linear movements produce important critiques of the seeming stasis of colonial constructs and highlight the ways these logics must appear neutral and scientific in an attempt to conceal the constant and complex adjustments these frameworks require. In order to make room for these complex motions, I develop a quantum intervention. Specifically, I use quantum physics as a metaphor to think through the significance of black life, the double-consciousness ofland, and the intricate motions of sound. In order to put forth this intervention, I look at news coverage of Hurricane Katrina, Du Bois’s characterization of land in Souls of Black Folks, and the aural mobilities of blackness articulated in an academic discussion and interview about post-&#xd;
humanism.</description>

   <description>This dissertation investigates the question: has financial speculation contributed to global food price volatility since the mid 2000s? I problematize the mainstream academic literature on the 2008-2011 food price spikes as being dominated by neoclassical economic perspectives and offer new conceptual and empirical insights into the relationship between financial speculation and food. Presented in three journal style manuscripts, manuscript one uses circuits of capital to conceptualize the link between financial speculators in the global north and populations in the global south. Manuscript two argues that what makes commodity index speculation (aka ‘index funds’ or index swaps) novel is that it provides institutional investors with what Clapp (2014) calls “financial distance” from the biopolitical implications of food speculation. Finally, manuscript three combines Gramsci’s concepts of hegemony and ‘the intellectual’ with the concept of performativity to investigate the ideological role that public intellectuals and the rhetorical actor the market play in the proliferation and governance of commodity index speculation. The first two manuscripts take an empirically mixed method approach by combining regression analysis with discourse analysis, while the third relies on interview data and discourse analysis. The findings show that financial speculation by index swap dealers and hedge funds did indeed significantly contribute to the price volatility of food commodities between June 2006 and December 2014. The results from the interview data affirm these findings. The discourse analysis of the interview data shows that public intellectuals and rhetorical characters such as ‘the market’ play powerful roles in shaping how food speculation is promoted, regulated and normalized. The significance of the findings is three-fold. First, the empirical findings show that a link does exist between financial speculation and food price volatility. Second, the findings indicate that the post-2008 CFTC and the Dodd-Frank reforms are unlikely to reduce financial speculation or the price volatility that it causes. Third, the findings suggest that institutional investors (such as pension funds) should think critically about how they use commodity index speculation as a way of generating financial earnings.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the design of optimal tax systems in dynamic environments. The first essay characterizes the optimal tax system where wages depend on stochastic shocks and work experience. In addition to redistributive and efficiency motives, the taxation of inexperienced workers depends on a second-best requirement that encourages work experience, a social insurance motive and incentive effects. Calibrations using U.S. data yield higher expected optimal marginal income tax rates for experienced workers for most of the inexperienced workers. They confirm that the average marginal income tax rate increases (decreases) with age when shocks and work experience are substitutes (complements). Finally, more variability in experienced workers' earnings prospects leads to increasing tax rates since income taxation acts as a social insurance mechanism.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second essay, the properties of an optimal tax system are investigated in a dynamic private information economy where labor market frictions create unemployment that destroys workers' human capital. A two-skill type model is considered where wages and employment are endogenous. I find that the optimal tax system distorts the first-period wages of all workers below their efficient levels which leads to more employment. The standard no-distortion-at-the-top result no longer holds due to the combination of private information and the destruction of human capital. I show this result analytically under the Maximin social welfare function and confirm it numerically for a general social welfare function. I also investigate the use of a training program and job creation subsidies.&#xd;
&#xd;
The final essay analyzes the optimal linear tax system when there is a population of individuals whose perceptions of savings are linked to their disposable income and their family background through family cultural transmission. Aside from the standard equity/efficiency trade-off, taxes account for the endogeneity of perceptions through two channels. First, taxing labor decreases income, which decreases the perception of savings through time. Second, taxation on savings corrects for the misperceptions of workers and thus savings and labor decisions. Numerical simulations confirm that behavioral issues push labor income taxes upward to finance saving subsidies. Government transfers to individuals are also decreased to finance those same subsidies.</description>

   <description>When closely related species co-occur in sympatry, they face a significant challenge. They must adapt to the same local conditions in their shared environment, which favours the convergent evolution of traits, while simultaneously minimizing the costs of competition for shared resources that typically favours the divergent evolution of traits. Here, we use a comparative sister lineage approach to test how most species have responded to these conflicting selection pressures in sympatry, focusing on a key ecological trait: the bill morphology of birds. If similar bill morphologies incur fitness costs due to species interactions, then we predicted that the bill morphologies of closely related species would differ more in sympatry compared with allopatry. Alternatively, if similar bill morphologies incur fitness benefits due to local adaptation, then we predicted that the bill morphologies would be more similar in sympatry compared with allopatry. We used museum specimens to measure five aspects of bill (maxilla) morphology – depth, length, width, side shape, and bottom shape – in diverse bird species from around the world to test our alternative hypotheses. We found support for both divergent evolution and convergent evolution (or trait retention) in one ecological trait: closely related sympatric species diverged in bill depth, but converged in side shape. These patterns of bill evolution were influenced by the genetic distance between closely related sister taxa and the geographic distance between allopatric lineages. Overall, our results highlight species interactions as an important mechanism for the evolution of some (bill depth), but not all (bill shape), aspects of bill morphology in closely related species in sympatry, and provide strong support for the bill as a key ecological trait that can adapt in different ways to the conflicting challenges of sympatry.</description>

   <description>Thermally driven liquid-desiccant air-conditioners (LDAC) are a proven but still developing technology. LDACs can use a solar thermal system to reduce the operational cost and environmental impact of the system by reducing the amount of fuel (e.g. natural gas, propane, etc.) used to drive the system. LDACs also have a key benefit of being able to store energy in the form of concentrated desiccant storage.  TRNSYS simulations were used to evaluate several different methods of improving the thermal and electrical coefficients of performance (COPt and COPe) and the solar fraction (SF) of a LDAC. The study analyzed a typical June to August cooling season in Toronto, Ontario. Utilizing properly sized, high-efficiency pumps increased the COPe to 3.67, an improvement of 55%. A new design, featuring a heat recovery ventilator on the scavenging-airstream and an energy recovery ventilator on the process-airstream, increased the COPt to 0.58, an improvement of 32%. This also improved the SF slightly to 54%, an increase of 8%. A new TRNSYS TYPE was created to model a stratified desiccant storage tank. Different volumes of desiccant were tested with a range of solar array system sizes. The largest storage tank coupled with the largest solar thermal array showed improvements of 64% in SF, increasing the value to 82%. The COPe was also improved by 17% and the COPt by 9%.  When combining the heat recovery systems and the desiccant storage systems, the simulation results showed a 78% increase in COPe and 30% increase in COPt. A 77% improvement in SF and a 17% increase in total cooling rate were also predicted by the simulation. The total thermal energy consumed was 10% lower and the electrical consumption was 34% lower. The amount of non-renewable energy needed from the natural gas boiler was 77% lower. Comparisons were also made between LDACs and vapour-compression (VC) systems. Dependent on set-up, LDACs provided higher latent cooling rates and reduced electrical power consumption. Negatively, a thermal input was required for the LDAC systems but not for the VC systems.</description>

   <description>Recently, resilience has become a catchall solution for some of the world’s most pressing ecological, economic and social problems. This dissertation analyzes the cultural politics of resilience in Kingston, Jamaica by examining them through their purported universal principles of adaptation and flexibility. On the one hand, mainstream development regimes conceptualize resilience as a necessary and positive attribute of economies, societies and cultures if we are to survive any number of disasters or disturbances. Therefore, in Jamaican cultural and development policy resilience is championed as both a means and an end of development. On the other hand, critics of resilience see the new rollout of resilience projects as deepening neoliberalism, capitalism and new forms of governmentality because resilience projects provide the terrain for new forms of securitization and surveillance practices. These scholars argue that resilience often forecloses the possibilities to resist that which threatens us. However, rather than dismissing resilience as solely a sign of domination and governmentality, this dissertation argues that resilience must be understood as much more ambiguous and complex, rather than within binaries such as subversion vs. neoliberal and resistance vs. resilience. Overly simplistic dualities of this nature have been the dominant approach in the scholarship thus far. This dissertation provides a close analysis of resilience in both multilateral and Jamaican government policy documents, while exploring the historical and contemporary production of resilience in the lives of marginalized populations. Through three sites within Kingston, Jamaica—namely dancehall and street dances, WMW-Jamaica and the activist platform SO((U))L HQ—this dissertation demonstrates that “resilience” is best understood as an ambiguous site of power negotiations, social reproduction and survival in Jamaica today. It is often precisely this ambiguous power of ordinary resilience that is capitalized on and exploited to the detriment of vulnerable groups. At once demonstrating creative negotiation and reproduction of colonial capitalist social relations within the realms of NGO, activist work and cultural production, this dissertation demonstrates the complexity of resilience. Ultimately, this dissertation draws attention to the importance of studying spaces of cultural production in order to understand the power and limits of contemporary policy discourses and political economy. </description>

   <description>This thesis originates from my interest in exploring how minorities are using social media to talk back to mainstream media. This study examines whether hashtags that trend on Twitter may impact how news stories related to minorities are covered in Canadian media. The Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated the niqab was “rooted in a culture that is anti-women” on 10 March 2015. The next day #DressCodePM trended in response to the PM’s niqab remarks. Using network gatekeeping theory, this study examines the types of sources quoted in the media stories published on 10 and 11 March 2015. The study’s goal is to explore whether using tweet quotes leads to the representation of a more diverse range of news sources. The study compares the types of sources quoted in stories that covered Harper’s comments without mentioning #DressCodePM versus stories that mention #DressCodePM. This study also uses Tuen A. van Dijk’s methodology of asking “who is speaking, how often and how prominently?” in order to examine whose voices have been privileged and whose voices have been marginalized in covering the niqab in Canadian media from the 1970s and until the days following the PM’s remarks. Network gatekeeping theory is applied in this study to assess whether the gated gained more power after #DressCodePM trended. The case study’s findings indicates that Caucasian male politicians were predominantly used as news sources in covering stories related to the niqab for the past 38 years in the Globe and Mail. The sourcing pattern of favouring politicians continued in Canadian print and online media on 10 March 2015 following Harper’s niqab comments. However, ordinary Canadian women, including Muslim women, were used more often than politicians as news sources in the stories about #DressCodePM that were published on 11 March 2015. The gated media users were able to gain power and attract Canadian Media’s attention by widely spreading #DressCodePM. This study draws attention to the lack of diversity of sources used in Canadian political news stories, yet this study also shows it is possible for the gated media users to amplify their voices through hashtag activism.</description>

   <title>International Capital Flows and Monetary Policy Spillovers</title>

   <description>This dissertation examines the drivers and implications of international capital flows.&#xd;
The overarching motivation is the observation that countries not at the centre of global financial markets are subject to considerable spillovers from centre countries, notably from their monetary policy. I present new empirical evidence on the determinants of the observed patterns of international capital flows and monetary policy spillovers, and study their effect on both financial markets and the real economy.&#xd;
In Chapter 2 I provide evidence on the determinants of a puzzling negative correlation observed between productivity growth and net capital inflows to developing and emerging market economies (EMEs) since 1980. By disaggregating net capital inflows into their gross components, I show that this negative correlation is explained by capital outflows related to purchases of very liquid assets from the fastest growing countries. My results suggest a desire for international portfolio diversification in liquid assets by fast growing countries is driving much of the original puzzle.&#xd;
In the reminder of my dissertation I pivot to study the foreign characteristics that drive international capital flows and monetary policy spillovers, with a particular focus on the role of unconventional monetary policy in the United States (U.S.). In Chapter 3 I show that a significant portion of the heterogeneity in EMEs' asset price adjustment following the quantitative easing operations by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) during 2008-2014 can be explained by the degree of bilateral capital market frictions between these countries and the U.S. This is true even after accounting for capital controls, exchange rate regimes, and domestic monetary policies.&#xd;
Chapter 4, co-authored with Michal Ksawery Popiel, studies unconventional monetary policy in a small open economy, looking specifically at the case of Canada since the global  financial crisis. We quantify the effect  Canadian unconventional monetary policy shocks had on the real economy, while carefully controlling for and quantifying spillovers from U.S. unconventional monetary policy. Our results indicate that the Bank of Canada's unconventional monetary policy increased Canadian output significantly from 2009-2010, but that spillovers from the Fed's policy were even more important for increasing Canadian output after 2008.</description>

   <description>When ligaments within the wrist are damaged, the resulting loss in range of motion and grip strength can lead to reduced earning potential and restricted ability to perform important activities of daily living. Left untreated, ligament injuries ultimately lead to arthritis and chronic pain. Surgical repair can mitigate these issues but current procedures are often non-anatomic and unable to completely restore the wrist’s complex network of ligaments.  An inability to quantitatively assess wrist function clinically, both before and after surgery, limits the ability to assess the response to clinical intervention.  Previous work has shown that bones within the wrist move in a similar pattern across people, but these patterns remain challenging to predict and model.&#xd;
In an effort to quantify and further develop the understanding of normal carpal mechanics, we performed two studies using 3D in vivo carpal bone motion analysis techniques.  For the first study, we measured wrist laxity and performed CT scans of the wrist to evaluate 3D carpal bone positions.   We found that through mid-range radial-ulnar deviation range of motion the scaphoid and lunate primarily flexed and extended; however, there was a significant relationship between wrist laxity and row-column behaviour.  We also found that there was a significant relationship between scaphoid flexion and active radial deviation range of motion.  For the second study, an analysis was performed on a publicly available database.  We evaluated scapholunate relative motion over a full range of wrist positions, and found that there was a significant amount of variation in the location and orientation of the rotation axis between the two bones.  Together the findings from the two studies illustrate the complexity and subject specificity of normal carpal mechanics, and should provide insights that can guide the development of anatomical wrist ligament repair surgeries that restore normal function.</description>
