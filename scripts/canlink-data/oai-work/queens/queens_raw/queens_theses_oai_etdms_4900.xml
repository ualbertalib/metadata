   <description>Background: The role of common, low to intermediate risk alleles in breast cancer need to be examined due to their relatively high prevalence. Among many cellular pathways, replication has a pivotal role in cell division and frequently targeted during carcinogenesis. Replication is governed by a host of genes involved in a number of different pathways. This study investigates the effects of replication-gene variants in relation to breast cancer and how this relationship is affected by ethnicity, menopausal status and breast tumour subtype. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Data from a case-control study with 997 incident breast cancer cases and 1,050 age frequency matched controls in Vancouver, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario were used. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios between 45 replication gene variants and breast cancer risk, assuming an additive genetic model adjusted for age and centre, presented for Europeans and East Asians separately. Polytomous logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios between each SNP and four breast cancer subtypes defined by hormone receptor status among Europeans. All analyses were stratified by menopausal status. The Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) was used to address multiple comparisons. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Among Europeans, the SNPs in FGFR2, TOX3 and 11q13 loci were associated with breast cancer after controlling for multiple comparisons. Test of heterogeneity showed the SNPs rs1045185, rs4973768, rs672888, rs1219648, rs2420946 among Europeans and rs889312 among East Asians conferred differential risk across the tumour subtypes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Specific SNPs in replication genes were associated with breast cancer, and the risk level differed by tumour subtype defined by ER/PR/Her2 status and ethnicity.</description>

   <description>By virtue of its proximity and richness, the Virgo galaxy cluster is a perfect testing ground to expand our understanding of structure formation in the Universe. Here, we present a comprehensive dynamical catalogue based on 190 Virgo cluster galaxies (VCGs) in the "Spectroscopy and H-band Imaging of the Virgo cluster" (SHIVir) survey, including kinematics and dynamical masses. Spectroscopy collected over a multi-year campaign on 4-8m telescopes was joined with optical and near-infrared imaging to create a cosmologically-representative overview of parameter distributions and scaling relations describing galaxy evolution in a rich cluster environment. The use of long-slit spectroscopy has allowed the extraction and systematic analysis of resolved kinematic profiles: Halpha rotation curves for late-type galaxies (LTGs), and velocity dispersion profiles for early-type galaxies (ETGs). The latter are shown to span a wide range of profile shapes which correlate with structural, morphological, and photometric parameters. A study of the distributions of surface brightnesses and circular velocities for ETGs and LTGs considered separately show them all to be strongly bimodal, hinting at the existence of dynamically unstable modes where the baryon and dark matter fractions may be comparable within the inner regions of galaxies. Both our Tully-Fisher relation for LTGs and Fundamental Plane analysis for ETGs exhibit the smallest scatter when a velocity metric probing the galaxy at larger radii (where the baryonic fraction becomes sub-dominant) is used: rotational velocity measured in the outer disc at the 23.5 i-mag arcsec^{-2} level, and velocity dispersion measured within an aperture of 2 effective radii, respectively. Dynamical estimates for gas-poor and gas-rich VCGs are merged into a joint analysis of the stellar-to-total mass relation (STMR), stellar TFR, and Mass-Size relation. These relations are all found to contain strong bimodalities or dichotomies between the ETG and LTG samples, alluding to a "mixed scenario'' evolutionary sequence between morphological/dynamical classes that involves both quenching and dry mergers. The unmistakable differentiation between these two galaxy classes appears robust against different classification schemes, and supports the notion that they are driven by different evolutionary histories. Future observations using integral field spectroscopy and including lower-mass galaxies should solidify this hypothesis.</description>

   <title>Software for Designing Custom Orbital-Craniofacial Implant Plans</title>

   <description>Purpose: Custom cranio-orbital implants have been shown to achieve better performance than their hand-shaped counterparts by restoring skull anatomy more accurately and by reducing surgery time. Designing a custom implant involves reconstructing a model of the patient's skull using their computed tomography (CT) scan. The healthy side of the skull model, contralateral to the damaged region, can then be used to design an implant plan. Designing implants for areas of thin bone, such as the orbits, is challenging due to poor CT resolution of bone structures. This makes preoperative design time-intensive since thin bone structures in CT data must be manually segmented. The objective of this thesis was to research methods to accurately and efficiently design cranio-orbital implant plans, with a focus on the orbits, and to develop software that integrates these methods. Methods: The software consists of modules that use image and surface restoration approaches to enhance both the quality of CT data and the reconstructed model. It enables users to input CT data, and use tools to output a skull model with restored anatomy. The skull model can then be used to design the implant plan. The software was designed using 3D Slicer, an open-source medical visualization platform. It was tested on CT data from thirteen patients. Results: The average time it took to create a skull model with restored anatomy using our software was 0.33 hours ± 0.04 STD. In comparison, the design time of the manual segmentation method took between 3 and 6 hours. To assess the structural accuracy of the reconstructed models, CT data from the thirteen patients was used to compare the models created using our software with those using the manual method. When registering the skull models together, the difference between each set of skulls was found to be 0.4 mm ± 0.16 STD. Conclusions: We have developed a software to design custom cranio-orbital implant plans, with a focus on thin bone structures. The method described decreases design time, and is of similar accuracy to the manual method.</description>

   <description>Minimal research has explored what comprises a quality physical activity (PA) participation experience, particularly among military Veterans with a physical disability for whom evidence of the benefits of PA is growing. To address this research gap, this dissertation examines quality PA participation among military Veterans with a physical disability.&#xd;
Manuscript 1 explores the views of Veterans with a physical disability regarding what elements constitute a quality PA experience, and how these elements may be fostered. Eighteen Veterans with various physical disabilities and PA experiences participated in interviews. Four quality elements were identified via thematic analysis: group cohesion, challenge, having a role, and independence and choice. A further three factors (the physical and social environments, and program structure) were identified as precursors for a quality experience.&#xd;
Manuscript 2 explores how PA programs for Veterans with a physical disability are delivered, and how these delivery strategies link conceptually to quality participation. Interviews were conducted with program staff from three PA programs for Veterans, and program documentation collected, to develop an understanding of program delivery strategies. Four strategies with potential links to quality participation were identified through thematic analysis: foster social connections, challenge participants, tailor programs and outcomes to match participant needs, and include knowledgeable coaches and instructors. &#xd;
Manuscript 3 evaluates the participation of Veterans with functional impairments in PA events, and examines the relationships among quality precursors, quality elements, and participation outcomes. Results indicate that program participation did not promote long-term increases in PA indicators. However, an indicator of the quality element belongingness mediated the relationship at particular time-points between coach interpersonal skills and three participation outcomes: family integration, PA intentions, and PA planning. These findings suggest that a quality participation experience created by coaches may positively impact the transition to civilian life, and promote efforts to engage in ongoing PA.&#xd;
Overall, this dissertation contributes towards a greater depth in understanding of the experiences of Veterans with a physical disability in PA programs. The findings begin to provide a foundation for researchers and practitioners aiming to create, deliver, and promote quality PA interventions and programming for Veterans with a physical disability.</description>

   <description>Electrical synapses are composed of gap junctions, made from paired hemi-channels that allow for the transfer of current from one neuron to another. Gap junctions mediate electrical transmission in neurons, where they synchronize spiking and promote rapid transmission, thereby influencing the coordination, pattern, and frequency of firing.  In the marine snail, Aplysia calfornica, two clusters of neuroendocrine bag cell neurons use electrical synapses to synchronize a 30-min burst of action potentials, known as the afterdischarge, which releases egg-laying hormone and induces reproduction. In culture, paired bag cell neurons present a junctional conductance that is non-rectifying and largely voltage-independent. During the afterdischarge, PKC is activated, which is known to increase voltage-gated Ca2+ current; yet, little is understood as to how this pathway impacts electrical transmission. The transfer of presynaptic spike-like waveforms (generated in voltage-clamp) to the postsynaptic cell (measured in current-clamp) was monitored with or without PKC activation. It was found that pretreatment with the PKC activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), enhanced junctional conductance between bag cell neurons. Furthermore, in control, presynaptic action potential waveforms mainly evoked postsynaptic electrotonic potentials at both -60 and -40 mV. However, with PKC activation the presynaptic stimulus consistently elicited postsynaptic action potentials from resting potentials of -40 mV, and would occasionally result in firing from repetitive input at -60 mV. Moreover, to assess whether this enhanced electrical transmission genuinely reflects a greater junctional conductance or a change in postsynaptic responsiveness, a fast-phase junctional-like current was applied to single bag cell neurons. Neurons in PMA always fired action potentials in response to current injection as opposed to control, which were less likely to spike. This outcome did not change when the junctional-like current was artificially enhanced in control conditions. Also, in response to fast- and slow-phase electrotonic potential (ETP) waveforms, Ca2+ current was markedly larger in single PMA-treated neurons. These findings suggest that PKC activation may contribute to afterdischarge fidelity by recruiting postsynaptic Ca2+ current to promote synchronous network firing. Finally, Aplysia gap junction genes (innexins) were transfected into mouse N2A cells and characterized. This revealed a biophysical and pharmacological profile similar to native gap junctions.</description>

   <description>By investigating the mechanisms underlying the evolution and the maintenance of local adaptations we can help predict how species will adapt to future environmental change. In this thesis I investigate local adaptation and adaptive potential in thick-billed and common murres (Uria lomvia and U. aalge), two arctic seabirds of international conservation concern. Thanks to the recent development of new genomic methods, I address three major themes that are relevant for both the development of evolutionary theory and conservation: 1) the role of gene flow in the origin and maintenance of adaptation; 2) levels and distribution of standing genetic variation, and their contribution to adaptive potential; and 3) the genomic mechanisms maintaining an adaptive dimorphism within a single interbreeding population. &#xd;
First, I review the literature on genomics of local adaptation with gene flow and find that adaptation can be maintained despite gene flow, that gene flow itself can promote adaptation, and that genetic architecture is important in the origin and maintenance of local adaptations. &#xd;
Second, I genotype genome-wide markers and toll-like receptor genes (TLRs) to investigate local adaptation and adaptive potential in thick-billed murres. Thick-billed murres do not show signatures of local adaptation to their breeding grounds, but outlier loci group birds according to their non-breeding distributions, suggesting that selection and/or demographic connectivity in the winter may explain patterns of differentiation in this species. Genetic variation at TLRs does not decrease with increasing latitude as predicted, but tests of selection and measures of genetic diversity suggest differences in local selective regimes at most genes. Thick-billed murres show high levels of standing genetic variation and their adaptive potential will mostly depend on rate and magnitude of environmental change. &#xd;
Finally, I improve and annotate the assembly of the highly heterozygous genome of the thick-billed murre. Using this assembly as a reference, I perform whole genome analyses to investigate the genomic basis of an adaptive dimorphism in Atlantic common murres. I show for the first time that a 60 kb complex copy number variant in a non-coding region maintains differences in plumage and cold adaptation despite high gene flow.</description>

   <description>Intensification of permafrost disturbances such as active layer detachments (ALDs) and retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) have been observed across the circumpolar Arctic. These features are indicators of unstable conditions stemming from recent climate warming and permafrost degradation. In order to understand the processes interacting to give rise to these features, a multidisciplinary approach is required; i.e., interactions between geomorphology, hydrology, vegetation and ground thermal conditions. The goal of this research is to detect and map permafrost disturbance, predict landscape controls over disturbance and determine approaches for monitoring disturbance, all with the goal of contributing to the mitigation of permafrost hazards. Permafrost disturbance inventories were created by applying semi-automatic change detection techniques to IKONOS satellite imagery collected at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO). These methods provide a means to estimate the spatial distribution of permafrost disturbances for a given area for use as an input in susceptibility modelling. Permafrost disturbance susceptibility models were then developed using generalized additive and generalized linear models (GAM, GLM) fitted to disturbed and undisturbed locations and relevant GIS-derived predictor variables (slope, potential solar radiation, elevation). These models successfully delineated areas across the landscape that were susceptible to disturbances locally and regionally when transferred to an independent validation location. Permafrost disturbance susceptibility models are a first-order assessment of landscape susceptibility and are promising for designing land management strategies for remote permafrost regions. Additionally, geomorphic patterns associated with higher susceptibility provide important knowledge about processes associated with the initiation of disturbances. Permafrost degradation was analyzed at the CBAWO using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR). Active-layer dynamics were interpreted using inter-seasonal and intra-seasonal displacement measurements and highlight the importance of hydroclimatic factors on active layer change.  Collectively, these research approaches contribute to permafrost monitoring and the assessment of landscape-scale vulnerability in order to develop permafrost disturbance mitigation strategies.</description>

   <description>Temperature has profound effects on the neural function and behaviour of insects. When exposed to low temperature, migratory locusts (Locusta migratoria) enter chill coma (neuromuscular paralysis) and can resume normal body functions after returning to normal temperature. Our laboratory has studied phenomena underlying environmental stress-induced comas in locusts and found that they are associated with a sudden loss of K+ homeostasis and also a temporary electrical silence in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanisms underlying chill coma entry and recovery are not well understood, particularly the role of the CNS has not been determined. Here, I investigated neural function during chill coma in the locust by measuring electrical activity in the CNS. As pre-exposure to moderately low temperatures, either chronically (cold acclimation) or acutely (rapid cold hardening; RCH), has been found to improve the insect’s cold tolerance, I also determined cold acclimation and RCH protocols that will improve the locust's cold tolerance and whether these protocols affect neural shutdown during chill coma in the locust. With an implanted thermocouple in the thorax, I determined the temperature associated with a loss of responsiveness (CTmin) in intact male adult locusts. In parallel experiments, I recorded field potential (FP) in the metathoracic ganglion (MTG) in semi-intact preparations to determine the temperature that would induce neural shutdown. I found that acclimation at 10 ˚C and RCH at 4 ˚C reduced chill coma recovery time (CCRT) in intact animal preparations and RCH at 4 ˚C for 4 hours reduced the temperature at neural shutdown in semi-intact preparations. These results suggest that pre-exposure to cold can improve the locust's resistance to chill coma and support the notion that the CNS has a role in determining entry into and exit from chill coma in locusts.</description>

   <description>A distributed network of cortical and subcortical brain regions mediates the control of voluntary behavior, but it is unclear how this complex system may flexibly shift between different behavioral events. This thesis describes the neurophysiological changes in several key nuclei across the brain during flexible behavior, using saccadic eye movements in rhesus macaque monkeys. We examined five nuclei critical for saccade initiation and modulation: the frontal eye field (FEF) in the cerebral cortex, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), caudate nucleus (CD), and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in the basal ganglia (BG), and the superior colliculus (SC) in the midbrain. The first study tested whether a ‘threshold’ theory of how neuronal activity cues saccade initiation is consistent with the flexible control of behavior. The theory suggests there is a fixed level of FEF and SC neuronal activation at which saccades are initiated. Our results provide strong evidence against a fixed saccade threshold in either structure during flexible behavior, and indicate that threshold variability might depend on the level of inhibitory signals applied to the FEF or SC. The next two studies investigated the BG network as a likely candidate to modulate a saccade initiation mechanism, based on strong inhibitory output signals from the BG to the FEF and SC. We investigated the STN and CD (BG input), and the SNr (BG oculomotor output) to examine changes across the BG network. This revealed robust task-contingent shifts in BG signaling (Chapter 3), which uniquely impacted saccade initiation according to behavioral condition (Chapters 3 and 4). The thesis concludes with a published short review of the mechanistic effects of BG deep brain stimulation (Chapter 5), and a general discussion including proof of concept saccade behavioral changes in an MPTP-induced Parkinsonian model (Chapter 6). The studies presented here demonstrate that the conditions for saccade initiation by the FEF and SC vary according to behavioral condition, while simultaneously, large-scale task dependent shifts occur in BG signaling consistent with the observed modulation of FEF and SC activity. Taken together, these describe a mechanistic framework by which the cortico-BG loop may contribute to the flexible control of behavior.</description>

   <description>Regular classroom teachers, who often report that they lack adequate training and resources, increasingly find themselves supporting students with special education needs (Connelly &amp; Graham, 2009). Teachers working in challenging environments can thrive in their role and continue to experience professional growth and passion about their work with students with exceptionalities (Perry, Brenner, Collie, &amp; Hofer, 2015). Thriving is one framework of psychological wellness that can provide insight into the experiences of teachers working with exceptional learners (Spreitzer &amp; Porath, 2014). Chronic stress from occupational demands such as heavy workload and insufficient resources can negatively affect the wellbeing of teachers and lead to poor mental health (Desrumaux et al., 2015). Burnout and compassion fatigue are two constructs of poor mental health that can inform our understanding of teachers’ social and emotional experiences. &#xd;
The purpose of this study was to explore the social and emotional experiences of teachers working with exceptional learners in regular classrooms. The objective of this study was to describe the elements within teachers’ professional roles that they report contribute to their social and emotional experiences understood through the lenses of thriving, burnout, and compassion fatigue. Interviews were conducted with five teachers: one full-time in-service teacher and four teachers who are pursuing graduate studies in education. The theme of thriving emerged as a significant component of the interview with all five participants. All five participants described experiences of vitality and learning as essential to their workplace satisfaction and overall thriving. Although the data from this study did not suggest that participants were experiencing burnout or compassion fatigue, elements of the two constructs did emerge as relevant to the social-emotional experiences of the teachers.</description>

   <description>Proline (Pro) is a unique amino acid that has been examined previously as a potential chiral selector for high-performance liquid chromatography. In recent years, a new class of promising Pro based enantioselective stationary phases has been studied and the longer peptides were found to be competitive with commercial chiral stationary phases (CSPs). &#xd;
Here, we aim to perform a comprehensive examination of a t-butoxycarbonyl- (t-Boc-) terminated monoproline selector. This selector was grafted through an amide linkage to an aminopropyl siloxane-terminated Si (111) wafer and to a silicon atomic force microscopy tip. To ensure a flat, homogeneous overlayer of selectors suitable for force spectrometric measurements, the prepared surfaces were characterized using XPS, AFM and contact angle measurements.&#xd;
Chemical force spectrometry (CFS) has been used to examine the chiral discrimination in our monoproline CSP by measuring the interaction forces between two D- or L-monoproline monolayers in water and in the presence of a series of amino acids in solution to explore the degree to which binding of amino acids impacts self-selectivity. &#xd;
Chemical force titration (CFT) has been used to observe the influence of variations in pH on the binding interaction of proline modified chiral surfaces. Here we aim to explore the connection between side-chain hydrophobicity and differences in the nature of the binding between different ionic forms of amino acids and the t-Boc-Pro interface, and thereby to gain insight into the mechanism of chiral selectivity. &#xd;
The CFS results show several trends for different proline selector/amino acid combinations and indicate that the binding characteristics of amino acid to the proline surface is strongly dependent on the amino acid side chain where hydrophilic side chain amino acids exhibit a selectivity opposite to that seen for those with hydrophobic side chains.&#xd;
The CFT studies also provide valuable insights into interactions between the proline selector and the amino acids under a wide range of pH conditions, indicating that protonated amine groups of alanine and serine are closely involved in the binding mechanism to proline surfaces. On the other hand, the presence of the second carboxylic group in aspartic acid plays an important role while interacting with proline.</description>

   <description>Despite the development of improved performance test protocols by renowned researchers, there are still road networks which experience premature cracking and failure. One area of major concern in asphalt science and technology, especially in cold regions in Canada is thermal (low temperature) cracking. Usually right after winter periods, severe cracks are seen on poorly designed road networks. Quality assurance tests based on improved asphalt performance protocols have been implemented by government agencies to ensure that roads being constructed are at the required standard but asphalt binders that pass these quality assurance tests still crack prematurely. While it would be easy to question the competence of the quality assurance test protocols, it should be noted that performance tests which are being used and were repeated in this study, namely the extended bending beam rheometer (EBBR) test, double edge-notched tension test (DENT), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis have all been verified and proven to successfully predict asphalt pavement behaviour in the field. Hence this study looked to probe and test the quality and authenticity of the asphalt binders being used for road paving. This study covered thermal cracking and physical hardening phenomenon by comparing results from testing asphalt binder samples obtained from the storage ‘tank’ prior to paving (tank samples) and recovered samples for the same contracts with aim of explaining why asphalt binders that have passed quality assurance tests are still prone to fail prematurely.  &#xd;
The study also attempted to find out if the short testing time and automated procedure of torsion bar experiments can replace the established but tedious procedure of the EBBR.&#xd;
In the end, it was discovered that significant differences in performance and composition exist between tank and recovered samples for the same contracts. Torsion bar experimental data also indicated some promise in predicting physical hardening.</description>

   <description>This dissertation presents the results of in-depth qualitative interviews with twenty-three formerly imprisoned men regarding their lived experience with prison conflict and the pain of incarceration. The results suggest that prison is a gendered ‘total institution’ (Goffman 1961). The pains that men experience in prison are uniquely gendered in that the deprivations imposed by incarceration– deprivation of autonomy, liberty, goods and services, heterosexual sex, and security (Sykes 1958) – in the reverse, define idealized masculinity as it is currently socially constructed: self-reliance, independence, toughness or invulnerability, material and economic success, and heterosexual prowess. From these shared deprivations emerges a gendered code of conduct that perpetuates a hierarchy among incarcerated men by constructing violent masculinity as a subcultural norm. The results suggest that the gender code in prison represents a set of rules that create opportunities for men to police each other’s gender performance and make claims to masculine statuses. Because status is inextricably tied to survival in this context, many men feel pressured to perform violent masculinities in prison despite privately subscribing to a non-violent sense of self-concept. The results suggest that violence is an expressive and instrumental resource for men in prison. A gender theory of prison violence, methodological findings, theoretical implications, ethical considerations and the short and long term aftermath of violent prison conflict are discussed.</description>

   <description>Security defects are common in large software systems because of their size and complexity. Although efficient development processes, testing, and maintenance policies are applied to software systems, there are still a large number of vulnerabilities that can remain, despite these measures. &#xd;
&#xd;
Some vulnerabilities stay in a system from one release to the next one because they cannot be easily reproduced through testing. These vulnerabilities endanger the security of the systems. &#xd;
We propose vulnerability classification and prediction frameworks based on vulnerability reproducibility. The frameworks are effective to identify the types and locations of vulnerabilities in the earlier stage, and improve the security of software in the next versions (referred to as releases).&#xd;
&#xd;
We expand an existing concept of software bug classification to vulnerability classification (easily reproducible and hard to reproduce) to develop a classification framework for differentiating between these vulnerabilities based on code fixes and textual reports. We then investigate the potential correlations between the vulnerability categories and the classical software metrics and some other runtime environmental factors of reproducibility to develop a vulnerability prediction framework. &#xd;
&#xd;
The classification and prediction frameworks help developers adopt corresponding mitigation or elimination actions and develop appropriate test cases. Also, the vulnerability prediction framework is of great help for security experts focus their effort on the top-ranked vulnerability-prone files. As a result, the frameworks decrease the number of attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in the next versions of the software.&#xd;
&#xd;
To build the classification and prediction frameworks, different machine learning techniques (C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes) are employed. The effectiveness of the proposed frameworks is assessed based on collected software security defects of Mozilla Firefox.</description>

   <description>A number of supported and un-supported Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) iridium based electrocatalysts for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) were synthesized using a polyol method. The electrocatalysts and the supports were characterized using a wide range of physical and electrochemical characterization methods.  The effect of morphological characteristics of the OER electrocatalyst and the support on the OER activity was studied. The results of this thesis contribute to the existing research to reduce the cost of PEMWE by enhancing the utilization of precious metal for OER electrocatalysis. &#xd;
Iridium electrocatalysts supported on antimony tin oxide (Ir/ATO) were synthesized using the polyol method with two different heating techniques: conventional and microwave-irradiation. It was shown that the physical morphology and electrochemical properties of Ir/ATO synthesized with the two heating methods were comparable. However, the microwave irradiation method was extremely faster than the conventional heating method. &#xd;
Additionally, the effect of heat treatment (calcination temperature) on the morphology and OER activity of Ir/ATO synthesized electrocatalyst with the conventional polyol method. It was found that the iridium electrocatalyst synthesized with the polyol method, consisted of 1-5 nm particles, possessed an amorphous structure, and contained iridium with an average oxidation state of less than +4. Calcining the catalyst at temperatures more than 400 ºC and less than 700ºC: 1) increased the size of the iridium particles to 30 nm, 2) changed the structure of iridium particles from amorphous to crystalline, 3) increased the iridium oxidation state to +4 (IrO2), 4) reduced the electrochemically active surface area by approximately 50%, and 5) reduced the OER activity by approximately 25%; however, it had no significant effect on the physical and chemical morphology of the ATO support. &#xd;
Moreover, potential support metal carbides and oxides including: Tantalum Carbide (TaC), Niobium Oxide (Nb2O5), Niobium Carbide (NbC), Titanium Carbide (TiC), Tungsten Carbide (WC) and Antimony-doped Tin Oxide (ATO, Sb2O5-SnO2), were characterized, and used as support for the iridium OER electrocatalysts. TaC was found to be a promising support, and increasing its surface area by 4% improved the OER performance of the final supported catalyst by approximately 50%.</description>

   <title>Successful Aging with Illness</title>

   <description>In twenty years almost one in four Canadians will be over the age of 65. How successfully these people age will influence their quality of life and contribute to their physical health. Illness and disease are frequent components of aging; however, ‘successful aging’ research normally excludes people with illness. Older people living with illness, even life threatening illness, often self-report a good quality of life and continue to experience psychological well-being and a significant engagement in social life. This dissertation uses a three manuscript approach to examine successful aging among people with illness.&#xd;
The first manuscript employed a scoping review to examine the models used in recent successful aging research, compiling the most frequently used constructs which included: engagement, optimism and/or positive attitude, resilience, spirituality and/or religiosity, self-efficacy and/or self-esteem, and gerotranscendence.&#xd;
The second manuscript utilized data gathered via interviews (online or in person) with people over the age of 65 years living with illness. The majority of these participants reported success in aging; only resilience was predictive in the binomial regression analysis.&#xd;
The third manuscript examined the role of social determinants of health on successful aging. The analysis revealed that disengagement from community-activities showed a significant association with higher self-reported successful aging. The best fitting model for predicting rate of successful aging with illness was a linear combination of participants’ ageism score and community activity score, while controlling for gender and age.&#xd;
When considered together, the results from these three manuscripts suggest that successful aging can be experienced by older adults aging with illness. And that, among these older adults, resilience, community interaction and ageism may all play a part in determining the extent to which aging is experienced as successful. Recommendations include the suggestion that we embrace the idea that people with illness can self-define as successful agers. Further, since some of the associated constructs (e.g. resilience) can be fostered, successful aging could be bolstered by education or programs to build skills along with the usual treatment modalities for the illnesses that co-exist.</description>

   <description>A number of laws in Canada which uphold rights are referred to as quasi-constitutional by the courts in recognition of their special importance. Quasi-constitutional statutes are enacted through the regular legislative process, although they are being interpreted and applied in a fashion which has become remarkably similar to constitutional law, and are therefore having an important affect over other legislation. Quasi-constitutionality has surprisingly received limited scholarly attention, and very few serious attempts at explaining its significance have been made. This dissertation undertakes a comprehensive study of quasi-constitutionality which considers its theoretical basis, its interpretation and legal significance, as well as its similarities to comparable forms of law in other Commonwealth jurisdictions. &#xd;
&#xd;
Part I examines the theoretical basis of quasi-constitutionality and its relationship to the Constitution. As a statutory and common law form of fundamental law, quasi-constitutionality is shown to signify an association with the Canadian Constitution and the foundational principles that underpin it. Part II proceeds to consider the special rules of interpretation applied to quasi-constitutional legislation, the basis of this interpretative approach, and the connection between the interpretation of similar provisions in quasi-constitutional legislation and the Constitution. As a statutory form of fundamental law, quasi-constitutional legislation is given a broad, liberal and purposive interpretation which significantly expands the rights which they protect. The theoretical basis of this approach is found in both the fundamental nature of the rights upheld by quasi-constitutional legislation as well as legislative intent. Part III explores how quasi-constitutional statutes affect the interpretation of regular legislation and how they are used for the purposes of judicial review. Quasi-constitutional legislation has a significant influence over regular statutes in the interpretative exercise, which in some instances results in conflicting statutes being declared inoperable. The basis of this form of judicial review is demonstrated to be rooted in statutory interpretation, and as such it provides an interesting model of rights protection and judicial review that is not conflated to constitutional and judicial supremacy.</description>

   <title>Retro-Neoliberalism: Elite Counter-Protest in Latin America, 1940-1975</title>

   <description>This research challenges the origin story of neoliberalism in Latin America. Drawing on archival data from the Mont Pèlerin Society and the personal archives of leading but neglected figures in the post-war push to rebuild economic liberalism, I present a historical geography of elite counter-protest that both predates and broadens the generally accepted “birth” of neoliberalism in 1970s Chile. Beginning in the 1940s, Latin American elites found common cause with key figures from economic liberalism’s most radical wing: the Austrian School. While existing literature links the onset of neoliberalism in Chile to the Austrian School, particularly with respect to the School’s influence on the early Mont Pèlerin Society, this dissertation is the first comprehensive inquiry to place the Austrian tradition in the ideational and organizational landscape of Latin America. Embracing a new mission that promised to save the soul of Western civilization, Latin America’s retro-neoliberal leaders collaborated with transnational actors to build a network of Austrian-inspired think-tanks and institutes of higher learning in the region. These organizations, in turn, served as recruiting mechanisms to found the Hispanic quarter of the Mont Pèlerin Society, which was dominated not (as might be assumed) by Chileans, but rather by retro-neoliberal elites from Mexico, Argentina, Guatemala, and Venezuela. By 1975, when scholars began analyzing how a run-of-the-mill economics department had been transformed into a bastion of free-market thinking in Chile, an entire neoliberal university was up and running in Guatemala, exposing all students, regardless of discipline, to the Austrian tradition – the crowning achievement of Latin America’s retro-neoliberal network. Investigating, and accounting for, the development and impact of this initiative sheds new light on the neoliberal landscape in Latin America, and raises important questions for the study of neoliberalism more broadly.</description>

   <description>Predictive models of species distributions are important tools for fisheries management. Unfortunately, these predictive models can be difficult to perform on large waterbodies where fish are difficult to detect and exhaustive sampling is not possible. In recent years the development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and new occupancy modelling techniques has improved our ability to predict distributions across landscapes as well as account for imperfect detection.  I surveyed the nearshore fish community at 105 sites between Kingston, Ontario and Rockport, Ontario with the objective of modelling geographic and environmental characteristics associated with littoral fish distributions. Occupancy modelling was performed on Round Goby, Yellow perch, and Lepomis spp. Modelling with geographic and environmental covariates revealed the effect of shoreline exposure on nearshore habitat characteristics and the occupancy of Round Goby. Yellow Perch, and Lepomis spp. occupancy was most strongly associated negatively with distance to a wetland. These results are consistent with past research on large lake systems indicate the importance of wetlands and shoreline exposure in determining the fish community of the littoral zone.  By examining 3 species with varying rates of occupancy and detection, this study was also able to demonstrate the variable utility of occupancy modelling.</description>

   <description>Traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources (TKaGRs) is acknowledged as a valuable resource. Its value draws from economic, social, cultural, and innovative uses. This value places TK at the heart of competing interests as between indigenous peoples who hold it and depend on it for their survival, and profitable industries which seek to exploit it in the global market space.  The latter group seek, inter alia, to advance and maintain their global competitiveness by exploiting TKaGRs leads in their research and development activities connected with modern innovation.  Biopiracy remains an issue of central concern to the developing world and has emerged in this context as a label for the inequity arising from the misappropriation of TKaGRs located in the South by commercial interests usually located in the North.  Significant attention and resources are being channeled at global efforts to design and implement effective protection mechanisms for TKaGRs against the incidence of biopiracy. The emergence and recent entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol offers the latest example of a concluded multilateral effort in this regard. The Nagoya Protocol, adopted on the platform of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), establishes an open-ended international access and benefit sharing (ABS) regime which is comprised of the Protocol as well as several complementary instruments.  By focusing on the trans-regime nature of biopiracy, this thesis argues that the intellectual property (IP) system forms a central part of the problem of biopiracy, and so too to the very efforts to implement solutions, including through the Nagoya Protocol.  The ongoing related work within the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), aimed at developing an international instrument (or a series of instruments) to address the effective protection of TK, constitutes an essential complementary process to the Nagoya Protocol, and, as such, forms a fundamental element within the Nagoya Protocol’s evolving ABS regime-complex.  By adopting a third world approach to international law, this thesis draws central significance from its reconceptualization of biopiracy as a trans-regime concept.  By construing the instrument(s) being negotiated within WIPO as forming a central component part of the Nagoya Protocol, this dissertation’s analysis highlights the importance of third world efforts to secure an IP-based reinforcement to the Protocol for the effective eradication of biopiracy.</description>

   <description>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and substituted phenylamine antioxidants (SPAs) are two chemical groups that have been used in multiple Canadian industrial processes. Despite the production ban of PCBs in North America in 1977, they are still ubiquitous in the environment and in wildlife tissues. Previous studies of fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals have shown that PCBs are toxic and act as endocrine disruptors. In contrast, SPAs, specifically N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (PANA), have received very little attention despite their current use in Canada and their expected environmental releases. The effects of PCB and PANA exposures in reptiles remain unknown thus, juvenile Chelydra serpentina were used in this thesis as a model vertebrate to fill in missing toxicity research gaps due to their importance as an environmental indicator. &#xd;
First, food pellets were spiked at an environmentally relevant concentration of the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (A1254) to model hepatic bioaccumulation (0.45 μg/g A1254 for 31 days) and depuration (clean food for 50 days) of PCBs in turtles. No significant differences in PCB concentrations were observed between the control and treated animals, suggesting that juvenile turtles exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of PCBs can likely detoxify low concentrations of PCBs. Additionally, two dose-response experiments were performed using A1254 or PANA spiked food (0-12.7 μg/g and 0-3,446 μg/g, respectively) to determine hepatic toxicity and bioaccumulation in juvenile C. serpentina. An increase in hepatic cyp1a was observed when exposed to the highest dose of both chemicals: 1) for A1254, induction correlated to the significant increase in hepatic PCB congeners that are known to be metabolized by CYP1A; and 2) for PANA, induction suggested that CYP1A has a potential role in its detoxification. PCBs are known endocrine disruptors, but no significant changes were observed for both thyroid receptors (alpha and beta) or by estrogen and androgen receptors. This lack of response, also noted in the PANA exposure, suggests that C. serpentina is less sensitive to endocrine disruption than other vertebrates. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in cellular stress was not altered in PCB and PANA exposed animals, supporting the resilience of turtles to oxidative stress. This is the first study to demonstrate the toxicity of PCBs and PANA in C. serpentina, demonstrating the turtle’s high tolerance to contamination.</description>

   <title>Efficient algorithms for beacon routing in polygons</title>

   <description>In a paper by Biro et al. [7], a novel twist on guarding in art galleries is introduced. &#xd;
A beacon is a fixed point with an attraction pull that can move points within the polygon. Points move greedily to monotonically decrease their Euclidean distance to the beacon by moving straight towards the beacon or sliding on the edges of the polygon. The beacon attracts a point if the point eventually reaches the beacon. Unlike most variations of the art gallery problem, the beacon attraction has the intriguing property of being asymmetric, leading to separate definitions of attraction region and inverse attraction region. The attraction region of a beacon is the set of points that it attracts. For a given point in the polygon, the inverse attraction region is the set of beacon locations that can attract the point. We first study the characteristics of beacon attraction. We consider the quality of a "successful" beacon attraction and provide an upper bound of $\sqrt{2}$ on the ratio between the length of the beacon trajectory and the length of the geodesic distance in a simple polygon. In addition, we provide an example of a polygon with holes in which this ratio is unbounded. Next we consider the problem of computing the shortest beacon watchtower in a polygonal terrain and present an $O(n \log n)$ time  algorithm to solve this problem. In doing this, we introduce $O(n \log n)$ time algorithms to compute the beacon kernel and the inverse beacon kernel in a monotone polygon. We also prove that  $\Omega(n \log n)$ time is a lower bound for computing the beacon kernel of a monotone polygon. Finally, we study the inverse attraction region of a point in a simple polygon. We present algorithms to efficiently compute the inverse attraction region of a point for simple, monotone, and terrain polygons with respective time complexities $O(n^2)$,  $O(n \log n)$ and $O(n)$. We show that the inverse attraction region of a point in a simple polygon has linear complexity and the problem of computing the inverse attraction region has a lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n)$ in monotone polygons and consequently in simple polygons.</description>

   <title>The Influence of Healed Intrablock Rockmass Structure on the Behaviour of Deep Excavations in Complex Rockmasses</title>

   <description>Conventional rockmass characterization and analysis methods for geotechnical assessment in mining, civil tunnelling, and other excavations consider only the intact rock properties and the discrete fractures that are present and form blocks within rockmasses. Field logging and classification protocols are based on historically useful but highly simplified design techniques, including direct empirical design and empirical strength assessment for simplified ground reaction and support analysis. As modern underground excavations go deeper and enter into more high stress environments with complex excavation geometries and associated stress paths, healed structures within initially intact rock blocks such as sedimentary nodule boundaries and hydrothermal veins, veinlets and stockwork (termed intrablock structure) are having an increasing influence on rockmass behaviour and should be included in modern geotechnical design. Due to the reliance on geotechnical classification methods which predate computer aided analysis, these complexities are ignored in conventional design. Given the comparatively complex, sophisticated and powerful numerical simulation and analysis techniques now practically available to the geotechnical engineer, this research is driven by the need for enhanced characterization of intrablock structure for application to numerical methods. Intrablock structure governs stress-driven behaviour at depth, gravity driven disintegration for large shallow spans, and controls ultimate fragmentation.&#xd;
	This research addresses the characterization of intrablock structure and the understanding of its behaviour at laboratory testing and excavation scales, and presents new methodologies and tools to incorporate intrablock structure into geotechnical design practice. A new field characterization tool, the Composite Geological Strength Index, is used for outcrop or excavation face evaluation and provides direct input to continuum numerical models with implicit rockmass structure. A brittle overbreak estimation tool for complex rockmasses is developed using field observations. New methods to evaluate geometrical and mechanical properties of intrablock structure are developed. Finally, laboratory direct shear testing protocols for interblock structure are critically evaluated and extended to intrablock structure for the purpose of determining input parameters for numerical models with explicit structure.</description>

   <description>International Relations theory would predict that central governments, with their considerable material resources, would be unlikely to face a challenge from a substate government. However, substate governments, and particularly Indigenous governments, are pushing back against central government control in both domestic and international spheres. Indigenous governments are leveraging their local mining sectors to realize their interests and express local identities—interests and identities that may not be congruent with those of the central government. Applying the case study of the resource extraction sector in Canada, this thesis asks: under what conditions are substate governments able to challenge the authority of central governments in the international arena? Canada’s reliance on the global extractive resource sector is a major driver of its international policy preferences, but the increased engagement of Indigenous governments in the sector challenges the control of the federal government. Focusing on the resource extraction sectors in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Ontario, this thesis argues that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between Indigenous governments’ international engagement and their domestic autonomy; both challenge the parameters of state authority. Both force the state to respond to claims of control from multiple sites and to clarify convoluted policy environments. A confluence of factors—including increased Indigenous connections to the globalized economy, new Canadian regulatory frameworks, and recent Supreme Court of Canada cases regarding Indigenous lands—have all altered the space in which Indigenous governments in Canada participate in the resource extraction sector and produce overlapping or multilevel governance structures. This thesis demonstrates that Indigenous international engagement entrenches the authority and political legitimacy manifest in Indigenous governments’ insistence on equitable and horizontal negotiations in Canada’s lucrative resource extraction sector. A cumulative process occurs in which domestic and international expressions of political autonomy reinforce each other, produce further opportunities to express authority in both environments, and trouble the state’s capacity to fully realize its international policy preferences.</description>

   <title>Node-wide Asynchronous Message Progression for Efficient &amp; Scalable Communication in  High Performance Computing</title>

   <description>High Performance Computing (HPC) has served as the enabler for several scientific and engineering accomplishments. Consequently, there has been an ever-increasing demand to create larger and faster high performance systems. To efficiently utilize the HPC resources, parallel applications rely on software that abstract the cluster hardware. Currently, the most prominent software abstraction standard in HPC is the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Parallel applications entail communications to synchronize and to share intermediate results. To minimize the duration of application executions, it is crucial to overlap such communications with the computations.&#xd;
The MPI standard specifies three messaging semantics, namely, point-to-point communication, one-sided communication and collectives. In point-to-point communication, the overlap of large payloads has been a problem and there have been several proposals to address this. Among these approaches, asynchronous message progression is more adoptable because of its ability to deal with a wider range of inefficiencies and its non-reliance on specialized hardware. Traditional asynchronous message progression approaches have relied on either polling or interrupt based threads. The polling based approach is more responsive but is resource-intensive. On the other hand, the interrupt based approach is resource-efficient but is associated with overheads. This thesis proposes a node-wide asynchronous message progression technique that offers the advantages of both polling and interrupt based approaches, while minimizing or eliminating their adverse effects. This approach was found to be scalable, incur negligible overheads, induce the ideal amount of overlap in most scenarios of point-to-point communications and cast a small memory footprint. This technique was found to improve the overlap of certain collectives as well.&#xd;
One-sided MPI communication offers the ability to transfer messages with few or no synchronizations, regardless of the payload size. This scheme promotes overlaps but there are several overlap inhibiting scenarios. This thesis proposes a similar asynchronous message progression technique to address such scenarios. The one-sided implementation was able to achieve overlap in the different inefficient scenarios, with negligible overheads and a small addition to the memory footprint.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the rotational behavior of abstracted small-wind-turbine rotors exposed to a sudden increase in oncoming flow velocity, i.e. a gust. These rotors consisted of blades with aspect ratios characteristic of samara seeds, which are known for their ability to maintain autorotation in unsteady wind. The models were tested in a towing tank using a custom-built experimental rig. The setup was designed and constructed to allow for the measurement of instantaneous angular velocity of a rotor model towed at a prescribed kinematic profile along the tank. The conclusions presented in this thesis are based on the observed trends in effective angle-of-attack distribution, tip speed ratio, angular velocity, and time delay in the rotational response for each of rotors over prescribed gust cases. It was found that the blades with the higher aspect ratio had higher tip speed ratios and responded faster than the blades with a lower aspect ratio. The decrease in instantaneous tip speed ratio during the onset of a prescribed gust correlated with the time delay in each rotor model's rotational response. The time delays were found to increase nonlinearly with decreasing durations over which the simulated gusts occurred.</description>

   <description>This research develops an econometric framework to analyze time series processes with bounds. The framework is general enough that it can incorporate several different kinds of bounding information that constrain continuous-time stochastic processes between discretely-sampled observations. It applies to situations in which the process is known to remain within an interval between observations, by way of either a known constraint or through the observation of extreme realizations of the process. The main statistical technique employs the theory of maximum likelihood estimation. This approach leads to the development of the asymptotic distribution theory for the estimation of the parameters in bounded diffusion models. &#xd;
&#xd;
The results of this analysis present several implications for empirical research. The advantages are realized in the form of efficiency gains, bias reduction and in the flexibility of model specification. A bias arises in the presence of bounding information that is ignored, while it is mitigated within this framework. An efficiency gain arises, in the sense that the statistical methods make use of conditioning information, as revealed by the bounds. Further, the specification of an econometric model can be uncoupled from the restriction to the bounds, leaving the researcher free to model the process near the bound in a way that avoids bias from misspecification. &#xd;
&#xd;
One byproduct of the improvements in model specification is that the more precise model estimation exposes other sources of misspecification. Some processes reveal themselves to be unlikely candidates for a given diffusion model, once the observations are analyzed in combination with the bounding information. A closer inspection of the theoretical foundation behind diffusion models leads to a more general specification of the model. This approach is used to produce a set of algorithms to make the model computationally feasible and more widely applicable.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, the modeling framework is applied to a series of interest rates, which, for several years, have been constrained by the lower bound of zero. The estimates from a series of diffusion models suggest a substantial difference in estimation results between models that ignore bounds and the framework that takes bounding information into consideration.</description>

   <title>Sucrose Bingeing Reduces the Reward Value of Sucrose</title>

   <subject>eating disorder</subject>
   <description>Binge eating occurs primarily on highly palatable food (PF) suggesting that the reward value of food has an important role in this behaviour.  Bingeing also leads to reward dysfunction in rats and humans.  The rewarding effect of binge eating may involve opioid mechanisms as opioid antagonists reduce PF consumption in animals that binge eat and binge eating produces neuroadaptations of opioid receptors in rodents.  We tested this hypothesis by using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm.  First we established a sucrose CPP in male and female Long-Evans rats (n=8 for each group) using 1%, 5%, 15%, or 30% sucrose solution.  Next, rats underwent the sucrose bingeing model in which separate groups of rats (n=8 for each group) received 12hr and 24hr access to 10% sucrose solution and chow, 12hr access to 0.1% saccharin solution and chow, or 12hr access to chow only every day for 28 days.  Immediately following these sessions, rats were conditioned and tested in the CPP paradigm using a 15% sucrose solution.  Finally, we examined whether the sucrose bingeing model altered morphine reward in female rats.  Rats (n=8 for each group) received 12hr and 24hr access to 10% sucrose solution and chow every day for 28 days. Immediately following this access period, rats were conditioned to morphine (6mL/kg) or saline solution in the CPP paradigm and tested for a CPP.  In all experiments, rats drank more sucrose solution than water during conditioning sessions. Male rats did not develop a CPP to any concentration of sucrose solution and females developed a CPP to 15% sucrose solution only.  Following the sucrose bingeing protocol, sucrose CPP was attenuated in male rats that binged on sucrose and in all female rats. Sucrose bingeing in females did not affect the development of a CPP to morphine. These results suggest that sucrose consumption and sucrose CPP are measures of different psychological components of reward.  Furthermore, sucrose bingeing reduces the rewarding effect of sucrose, but not morphine, suggesting that opioid reward is still intact.</description>

   <title>Vortex evolution in the wake of accelerating low-aspect-ratio plates and three-dimensional bodies of revolution</title>

   <description>To find examples of effecient locomotion and manoeuvrability, one need only turn to the elegant solutions natural flyers and swimmers have converged upon. This dissertation is specifically motivated by processes of evolutionary convergence, which have led to the propulsors and body shapes in nature that exhibit strong geometric collapse over diverse scales. These body features are abstracted in the studies presented herein using low-aspect-ratio at plates and a three-dimensional body of revolution (a sphere). The highly-separated vortical wakes that develop during accelerations are systematically characterized as a function of planform shape, aspect ratio, Reynolds number, and initial boundary conditions. To this end, force measurements and time-resolved (planar) particle image velocimetry have been used throughout to quantify the instantaneous forces and vortex evolution in the wake of the bluff  bodies. During rectilinear motions, the wake development for the flat plates is primarily dependent on plate aspect ratio, with edge discontinuities and curvature playing only a secondary role. Furthermore, the axisymmetric case, i.e. the circular plate, shows strong sensitivity to Reynolds number, while this sensitivity quickly diminishes with increasing aspect ratio. For rotational motions, global insensitivity to plate aspect ratio has been observed. For the sphere, it has been shown that accelerations play an important role in the mitigation of flow separation. These results - expounded upon in this dissertation - have begun to shed light on the specific vortex dynamics that may be coopted by flying and swimming species of all shapes and sizes towards efficient locomotion.</description>

   <description>TET2 is a tumor suppressor gene that has been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Inactivating TET2 mutations are common in MDS. These mutations may contribute to early clonal dominance and myeloid transformation, although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Common to the environment of MDS are elevations in cytokines, such as TNFα and IFN-γ.  It was hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ may promote clonal expansion of TET2 mutant progenitors. Adult (10-14 weeks-old) Tet2 wild type (+/+) and Tet2 mutant (-/-) C57BL/6 mice strains were chosen as a model system.  Lineage negative cells (Lin-), enriched for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, were isolated from Tet2 +/+ and -/- bone marrow and cultured in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of TNFα or IFN-γ in methylcellulose colony formation assays and long term cell culture assays, over a period of 12 and 30 days respectively, and their colony growth, cell count, immunophenotype and resistance to apoptosis were examined. Where indicated, serial re-plating was performed. Expression of apoptotic regulators was assessed by qRT-PCR. In the triplicate experiments, starting with equal densities of Tet2 +/+ and -/- Lin- cells, Tet2 -/- Lin- cells displayed increased resistance to cytokine-induced growth suppression and superior colony forming ability over +/+ in the serial re-plating assays under stress of increasing TNFα or IFN γ. Tet2 -/- progenitors also displayed a lower apoptotic index compared to +/+ under stress of increasing TNFα, suggesting increased resistance to TNFα induced apoptosis. Transcriptional data showed low expression of Tnfr1, Fas  and caspase 8, as well as a high expression of Bcl-2 and Iap1 in Tet2 -/-  compared to +/+ under stress of TNFα.  Tet2-/- also showed increased basal expression of endogenous TNFα mRNA compared to +/+. In the human colony growth assay, the clonal growth of TET2 mutant CFU-GM progenitors was enhanced at low TNFα concentrations. Conclusion: Mutations that promote resistance to environmental stem cell stressors are a known mechanism of clonal selection in aplastic anaemia and JAK2-mutant MPN and our findings suggest that this mechanism may be critical to clonal selection and dominance in MDS.</description>

   <title>Salmonella Enterica serovar Typhimurium Infection in Mouse Pregnancy</title>

   <description>Salmonella are Gram-negative, intracellular food-borne pathogens that cause pregnancy&#xd;
complications. In pregnant mice, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.Tm) infection results in&#xd;
placental bacterial replication, inflammation, necrosis, and fetal loss by unknown mechanisms.&#xd;
Necroptosis, or programmed necrosis mediated by RIPK3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3), an&#xd;
inflammatory cell death pathway, is implicated in the pathogenesis of S.Tm in non-pregnant mice. This&#xd;
goal of this thesis was to investigate the role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of S.Tm infection during&#xd;
mouse pregnancy. I hypothesized that elimination of the key necroptotic cell death protein RIPK3 would&#xd;
decrease placental inflammation and trophoblast cell death, and increase conceptus survival compared to&#xd;
controls.&#xd;
Mice expressing a functional Slc11a1 (encodes the natural resistance-associated macrophage&#xd;
protein 1, NRAMP1) gene with or without RIPK3 function (Ripk3-/-Slc11a1+/+ compared to Slc11a1+/+)&#xd;
were infected with 103 S.Tm by tail vein injection on gestational day (GD) 12. Mice were euthanized on&#xd;
GD 14 (48h post-infection) or GD 15 (72h post-infection) and implantation sites (IS) and maternal serum&#xd;
were harvested for analyses.&#xd;
In nearly all challenged mice (except one outlier), S.Tm were detected in most IS within a litter&#xd;
but there was limited immune cell infiltration, placental damage or cell death in Slc11a1 competent mice&#xd;
regardless of Ripk3 gene deletion. Maternal serum cytokine analyses confirmed lack of maternal immune&#xd;
responses to S.Tm infection. IS amongst the litter of a single dam (Ripk3-/-Slc11a1+/+ at 72h postinfection)&#xd;
displayed heavy but not universal placental S.Tm infection of decidual tissues and&#xd;
spongiotrophoblast, associated with elevated maternal serum pro-inflammatory cytokines. S.Tm infection&#xd;
of the fetal yolk sac (YS) was observed in 54.5% of IS from this dam. YS infection was confirmed in&#xd;
archival samples in mice expressing Ripk3 with intact Slc11a1 and in mice lacking functional Slc11a1. In&#xd;
Slc11a1 incompetent mice, S.Tm were detected in placental labyrinthine trophoblast. Based on the&#xd;
available data, this thesis suggests that Ripk3 and necroptosis have no significant roles in either promotion&#xd;
or prevention of progressive Salmonella infection during mouse pregnancy. It also provides pilot data that&#xd;
NRAMP1 controls placental localization and lethality due to YS infection.</description>

   <description>Background: Excess weight places a significant burden on health. Clinical practice guidelines advise healthcare professionals to provide weight management interventions to patients with overweight and obesity. Chiropractic practice may provide a unique opportunity to deliver weight management interventions to those with overweight and obesity. However, little has been done to address overweight and obesity within the chiropractic profession. Identifying the extent of this evidence-practice gap in chiropractic practice is the first step in addressing this issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: This thesis was to assess the clinical practices of weight loss provided by chiropractors. The primary objectives were to 1) determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the adult patient population that sought chiropractic care, 2) describe the frequency and distribution of chiropractor directed weight management intervention, 3) identify associations between chiropractor directed weight management interventions and specific patient-level and chiropractor-level variables, and 4) examine the interaction between patient weight and comorbid conditions and whether chiropractors offered weight management interventions.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Data from the Ontario Chiropractic Observational and Analysis Study was used (N = 42 chiropractors, N = 3523 patient encounters). Multilevel logistic regression was performed. Patient-level as well as chiropractor-level variables were investigated and associations with weight management provided by chiropractors were identified.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: The majority of patients who sought chiropractic were overweight or obese (61.2%). Weight loss was provided to only 5.4% of patients. Chiropractors who graduated between 1995 and 2005 (OR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00 - 0.13) or prior to 1995 (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.42) provided weight management significantly less than chiropractors who graduated between 2005 and 2014. No significant interaction was observed between patient adiposity and comorbid conditions with chiropractors directed weight loss. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: The majority of patients who seek chiropractic care are overweight and obese. Chiropractors are in a unique position to help improve patient health through offering weight management. However, this opportunity has not been fully realized by the chiropractic profession.</description>

   <description>The application of 3D grain-based modelling techniques is investigated in both small and large scale 3DEC models, in order to simulate brittle fracture processes in low-porosity crystalline rock. Mesh dependency in 3D grain-based models (GBMs) is examined through a number of cases to compare Voronoi and tetrahedral grain assemblages. Various methods are used in the generation of tessellations, each with a number of issues and advantages. A number of comparative UCS test simulations capture the distinct failure mechanisms, strength profiles, and progressive damage development using various Voronoi and tetrahedral GBMs. Relative calibration requirements are outlined to generate similar macro-strength and damage profiles for all the models. The results confirmed a number of inherent model behaviors that arise due to mesh dependency. In Voronoi models, inherent tensile failure mechanisms are produced by internal wedging and rotation of Voronoi grains. This results in a combined dependence on frictional and cohesive strength. In tetrahedral models, increased kinematic freedom of grains and an abundance of straight, connected failure pathways causes a preference for shear failure. This results in an inability to develop significant normal stresses causing cohesional strength dependence. In general, Voronoi models require high relative contact tensile strength values, with lower contact stiffness and contact cohesional strength compared to tetrahedral tessellations. Upscaling of 3D GBMs is investigated for both Voronoi and tetrahedral tessellations using a case study from the AECL’s Mine-by-Experiment at the Underground Research Laboratory. An upscaled tetrahedral model was able to reasonably simulate damage development in the roof forming a notch geometry by adjusting the cohesive strength. An upscaled Voronoi model underestimated the damage development in the roof and floor, and overestimated the damage in the side-walls. This was attributed to the discretization resolution limitations.</description>

   <description>Recent developments have made researchers to reconsider Lagrangian measurement techniques as an alternative to their Eulerian counterpart when investigating non-stationary flows. This thesis advances the state-of-the-art of Lagrangian measurement techniques by pursuing three different objectives: (i) developing new Lagrangian measurement techniques for difficult-to-measure, in situ flow environments; (ii) developing new post-processing strategies designed for unstructured Lagrangian data, as well as providing guidelines towards their use; and (iii) presenting the advantages that the Lagrangian framework has over their Eulerian counterpart in various non-stationary flow problems. Towards the first objective, a large-scale particle tracking velocimetry apparatus is designed for atmospheric surface layer measurements. Towards the second objective, two techniques, one for identifying Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) and the other for characterizing entrainment directly from unstructured Lagrangian data, are developed. Finally, towards the third objective, the advantages of Lagrangian-based measurements are showcased in two unsteady flow problems: the atmospheric surface layer, and entrainment in a non-stationary turbulent flow. Through developing new experimental and post-processing strategies for Lagrangian data, and through showcasing the advantages of Lagrangian data in various non-stationary flows, the thesis works to help investigators to more easily adopt Lagrangian-based measurement techniques.</description>

   <title>Protein-triggered Sustained Drug Release Controlled by Aptamers Bound to Oligomer-crosslinked Alginate</title>

   <subject>Bio-responsive drug delivery</subject>
   <subject>Sustained drug delivery</subject>
   <description>Sustained drug release systems provide many advantages over traditional delivery methods such as extending the time in which the drug is found to be within an effective concentration within the therapeutic window, which decreases the frequency of administration of the drug, and increases patient compliance. Research using polyacrylamide crosslinked by oligomers containing an aptamer sequence, has demonstrated a pulsatile release over 50 minutes triggered by a 2 mM target adenosine concentration. This thesis aims to build off this concept by designing a system that delivers in a sustained manner when triggered by micromolar target concentrations reflective of disease in vivo, using macromolecular targets.  For example, the disease wet age related macular degeneration (wet AMD) is associated with increased concentrations of the protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) – a macromolecule. Patients with wet AMD would benefit from the implantation of devices or microspheres that release drugs in a sustained manner in response to local VEGF concentrations.&#xd;
	&#xd;
	In this thesis, we hypothesize that the protein lysozyme, used to demonstrate proof-of-concept, could trigger the increased release of drugs from oligomer-crosslinked alginate. The objectives are to (i) demonstrate sustained release from alginate, (ii) design oligomer crosslinked alginate that degrades in response to lysozyme, and then (iii) use these systems to control the release of FITC-dextran with and without lysozyme. &#xd;
	&#xd;
	A series of control experiments and analyses were used to optimize the crosslinking of alginate by annealed oligomers. The cumulative release of FITC-dextran (MW 20,000) from oligomer crosslinked alginate increased by 3.4 μg when lysozyme (3 μM) was introduced at 48 hours, as opposed to controls which released only 0.2 μg. FITC-loaded alginate microspheres coated by oligomer-crosslinked alginate released 15% more FITC-dextran over 120 hours when placed into 3 μM of lysozyme than without lysozyme. Controls of alginate crosslinked with PEG or control oligomers (without a lysozyme aptamer sequence) had no changes in release with lysozyme.  &#xd;
	&#xd;
	The incorporation of a lysozyme aptamer onto oligomers used to crosslink alginate disks or alginate coatings on microspheres resulted in different diffusion and release of FITC-dextran into PBS with or without lysozyme.  This approach could be adapted for the delivery of drugs to diseases with specific protein profiles such as wet AMD.</description>

   <description>In recent years, the 380V DC and 48V DC distribution systems have been extensively studied for the latest data centers. It is widely believed that the 380V DC system is a very promising candidate because of its lower cable cost compared to the 48V DC system. However, previous studies have not adequately addressed the low reliability issue with the 380V DC systems due to large amount of series connected batteries. In this thesis, a quantitative comparison for the two systems has been presented in terms of efficiency, reliability and cost. A new multi-port DC UPS with both high voltage output and low voltage output is proposed. When utility ac is available, it delivers power to the load through its high voltage output and charges the battery through its low voltage output. When utility ac is off, it boosts the low battery voltage and delivers power to the load form the battery. Thus, the advantages of both systems are combined and the disadvantages of them are avoided. High efficiency is also achieved as only one converter is working in either situation. Details about the design and analysis of the new UPS are presented. &#xd;
For the main AC-DC part of the new UPS, a novel bridgeless three-level single-stage AC-DC converter is proposed. It eliminates the auxiliary circuit for balancing the capacitor voltages and the two bridge rectifier diodes in previous topology. Zero voltage switching, high power factor, and low component stresses are achieved with this topology. Compared to previous topologies, the proposed converter has a lower cost, higher reliability, and higher efficiency. The steady state operation of the converter is analyzed and a decoupled model is proposed for the converter. &#xd;
For the battery side converter as a part of the new UPS, a ZVS bidirectional DC-DC converter based on self-sustained oscillation control is proposed. Frequency control is used to ensure the ZVS operation of all four switches and phase shift control is employed to regulate the converter output power. Detailed analysis of the steady state operation and design of the converter are presented. &#xd;
Theoretical, simulation, and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed concepts.</description>

   <description>The main objective of blasting is to produce optimum fragmentation for downstream processing. Fragmentation is usually considered optimum when the average fragment size is minimum and the fragmentation distribution as uniform as possible. One of the parameters affecting blasting fragmentation is believed to be time delay between holes of the same row. Although one can find a significant number of studies in the literature, which examine the relationship between time delay and fragmentation, their results have been often controversial. The purpose of this work is to increase the level of understanding of how time delay between holes of the same row affects fragmentation.&#xd;
Two series of experiments were conducted for this purpose. The first series involved tests on small scale grout and granite blocks to determine the moment of burden detachment. The instrumentation used for these experiments consisted mainly of strain gauges and piezoelectric sensors. Some experiments were also recorded with a high speed camera. It was concluded that the time of detachment for this specific setup is between 300 and 600 μs.&#xd;
The second series of experiments involved blasting of a 2 meter high granite bench and its purpose was the determination of the hole-to-hole delay that provides optimum fragmentation. The fragmentation results were assessed with image analysis software. Moreover, vibration was measured close to the blast and the experiments were recorded with high speed cameras. The results suggest that fragmentation was optimum when delays between 4 and 6 ms were used for this specific setup. Also, it was found that the moment at which gases first appear to be venting from the face was consistently around 6 ms after detonation.</description>

   <description>Biaryl molecules are widely studied systems that have applications in a broad selection of fields including pharmaceuticals, environmental protection, liquid crystal synthesis, and metal organic framework synthesis. Extra care is required in consideration of the axial chirality they often exhibit. Careful control of axial chirality in biaryl molecules is a blossoming area of study which remains open to fresh interpretation. This study, employing quantum chemical calculations and first principles molecular dynamics simulations, has demonstrated that a mechanochemical scheme may be employed wherein mechanical work introduced by the application of tensile forces and torques can be used to promote enantiomeric excess in a number of axially chiral substituted biaryl molecules. Furthermore, quantitative control over the timescales of biphenyl rotation and chiral purification is offered. Subsequently, a system incorporating Taylor series approximations has been employed to approximate the effects of mechanical work on the potential energy surface, reducing the number of quantum chemical calculations required in order to identify a suitable range of tensile forces and torques in order to achieve enantiomeric excess.</description>

   <description>The Q’Pellet is a spherical, torrefied biomass pellet currently under development. It aims to improve on the shortcomings of commercially available cylindrical white and torrefied pellets. A spreadsheet-based model was developed to allow for techno-economic analysis and simplified life cycle analysis of Q’Pellets, torrefied pellets and white pellets. A case study was developed to compare the production of white, torrefied and Q’Pellet production based on their internal rates of return and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. The case study was based on a commercial scale plant built in Williams Lake BC with product delivery in Rotterdam, Netherlands.&#xd;
Q’Pellets had the highest modelled internal rate of return, at 12.7%, with white pellets at 11.1% and torrefied pellets at 8.0%. The simplified life cycle analysis showed that Q’Pellets had the lowest life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the three products, 6.96 kgCO2eq/GJ, compared to 21.50 kgCO2eq/GJ for white pellets and 10.08 kgCO2eq/GJ for torrefied pellets. At these levels of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, white pellets are above the maximum life cycle emissions to be considered sustainable under EU regulations.&#xd;
Sensitivity analysis was performed on the model by modifying input variables, and showed that white pellets are more sensitive to uncontrollable market variables, especially pellet sale prices, raw biomass prices and transportation costs. Monte Carlo analysis was also performed, which showed that white pellet production is less predictable and more likely to lead to a negative internal rate of return compared to Q’Pellet production.</description>

   <description>The degree of ambiguity of nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) has been studied significantly since at least the 1980s.&#xd;
Roughly speaking, the degree of ambiguity counts the number of accepting computations of an NFA.&#xd;
		&#xd;
To get a more comprehensive understanding of the branching complexity of NFAs, we introduce and study the string path width and depth path width measures.&#xd;
The string path width on a string w counts the number of all accepting and non-accepting computations on w, and the depth path width on an integer l counts the number of all accepting and non-accepting computations of a length l.&#xd;
We focus on cases where these measures are finite, that is, there is some input which has maximal string or depth path width.&#xd;
We give algorithms to decide the finiteness of the string and depth path width of an NFA.&#xd;
The latter algorithm relies on structural properties that characterize NFAs with finite depth path width, and the former is based on existing algorithms to compute the degree of ambiguity.&#xd;
We give upper bounds for the finite string and depth path width of an NFA or a DFA (deterministic finite automaton).&#xd;
		&#xd;
It is well known that acyclic NFAs define exactly the class of finite languages.&#xd;
We consider less restrictive conditions that define the class of nearly acyclic NFAs.&#xd;
An NFA is nearly acyclic if it does not have two cycles where one can be reached from the other.&#xd;
It is shown that the nearly acyclic NFAs are exactly the NFAs with finite depth path width.&#xd;
		&#xd;
We study and introduce variants of existing subregular language families.&#xd;
We establish (non)-inclusion relationships for these new classes, relative to each other and their existing counterparts.&#xd;
Additionally we show that an infinite hierarchy exists within the most powerful new family, generalized word-definite languages.&#xd;
		&#xd;
We examine the structural limitations and give maximal examples of nearly acyclic NFAs.&#xd;
We also show that nearly acyclic NFAs recognize the class of generalized word-definite languages.&#xd;
For nearly acyclic DFAs, we establish a stronger correspondence: they recognize all generalized word-definite languages, and any DFA recognizing a generalized word-definite language must be nearly acyclic.</description>

   <title>Regulation of HC11 Mouse Mammary Epithelial Cell Differentiation by the Rac/Stat3 axis</title>

   <description>Studying cellular differentiation can reveal valuable information underlying the mechanisms that mediate cell fate. The HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell line has long been used as a model to study lactogenic differentiation in vitro. Differentiation of HC11 cells requires the addition of hydrocortisone, insulin, and prolactin, added at confluence. Recently, our lab demonstrated that engagement of E-cadherin in HC11 cells, which is favoured under conditions of confluence, triggers a dramatic increase in the activity of the cRac1, small GTPase, which, in turn, activates Stat3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3). Therefore, we hypothesized that the E-cadherin/Rac/Stat3 axis may play a role in HC11 cell differentiation.&#xd;
&#xd;
My results demonstrate that this pathway positively regulates HC11 mammary epithelial cell differentiation and that it is a key mediator of cell fate. Particularly, the strength of the Rac signal is key for the outcome of the differentiation process; cRac is critically required for differentiation, and at low levels, mutationally activated RacV12 is able to increase differentiation, presumably by reinforcing the E-cadherin/Rac differentiative signal.  However, high RacV12 expression blocked differentiation while inducing neoplastic transformation. On the other hand, despite the fact that Stat3 was also required for differentiation, constitutively active Stat3 expression was found to block differentiation at all levels. &#xd;
&#xd;
In conclusion, hyperactive RacV12 may have opposing functions, depending upon its level of expression.  As a result, a complete Rac inhibition may not be necessary in order to reverse a Rac-driven, neoplastic phenotype in a clinical setting, since the residual, low levels of Rac may be actually promoting cellular differentiation, a finding which could have important therapeutic implications.</description>

   <description>Although tremendous progress has been made in the research and commercialization of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), the development of efficient and stable deep blue OLEDs remains one of the greatest challenges. This thesis describes our approach to achieve highly efficient deep-blue phosphorescent emitters based on cyclometalated Pt(II) compounds bearing 1,2,3-triazole moieties. The influence of different ancillary ligands and the impact of various substituent groups and ligand denticity on phosphorescent emission color, phosphorescent quantum efficiency, excimer emission, thermal and UV stability of these molecules were carefully examined. Their performance in OLED devices has also been evaluated.&#xd;
&#xd;
A series of dimesitylboron(BMes2)-functionalized Pt(II) complexes based on N∧C-chelate phenyl-1,2,3-triazolyl backbones and acetylacetonate, picolinate or pyridyl-1,2,4-triazolyl ancillary ligands have been synthesized and their use as emitters in efficient greenish-blue and white phosphorescent OLED devices were demonstrated. This was the first example of using phenyl-1,2,3-triazoles as the cyclometallating ligand in Pt(II) complexes and revealed that this was a viable approach to achieve bright blue phosphorescent Pt(II) compounds.&#xd;
&#xd;
We then synthesized a class of brightly phosphorescent Pt(II) compounds that contain an NC-chelate phenyl-1,2,3-triazolyl ligand (ptrz) and an NC-chelate pyridyl-1,2,4-triazolyl ligand (pytrz) with different substituent groups.  When the bulky trityl group (Ph3C) was introduced, the thermal stability of the molecule was improved and the excimer emission was reduced. Efficient greenish-blue phosphorescent OLED devices with no excimer emission were successfully fabricated using the Ph3C-contining compounds.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, by using tetradentate or macrocyclic cyclometallating ligands, the photostability of the corresponding Pt(II) complexes was greatly enhanced as they undergo less structural distortion at the excited state. Bright and efficient deep blue OLEDs with high color purity were successfully fabricated using the macrocyclic Pt(II) complex, demonstrating a new route to stable and highly luminescent deep blue Pt(II) emitters.</description>

   <description>The underground storage of used nuclear fuel in Deep Geologic Repositories (DGRs) has been a subject of research in Canada for decades. One important technical aspect of repository design is the accommodation of the mechanical impacts of thermal inputs (heating) from the fuel as it goes through the remainder of its life cycle. Placement room spacing, a major factor in project cost, will be determined by the ability of the host rock to dissipate heat. The thermal conductivity and linear thermal expansion will determine the evolution of the temperature and thermally-induced stress fields. Thermal processes must be well understood to design a successful DGR. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis examines the thermal properties of rocks, how they are influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, mineralogy, porosity, and saturation; and common methods for calculating and/or measuring these properties. A brief overview of thermal and thermally-coupled processes in the context of DGRs demonstrates the degree to which they would impact design, construction, and operation of these critical structures. Several case histories of major in situ heating experiments are reviewed to determine how the lessons learned could be applied to a Canadian Underground Demonstration Facility (UDF).&#xd;
&#xd;
A mineralogy investigation using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) examines samples of the Cobourg Limestone from the Bowmanville and Bruce sites, and demonstrates geographical variability within the Cobourg Formation. The thermal properties of samples from the Bowmanville site are determined. A divided bar apparatus was constructed and used to measure thermal conductivity. The temperature measurement component of the divided bar apparatus was used to measure linear thermal expansion. Finally, the past investigations into the thermal impact of a DGR are reviewed, and the implications of the laboratory testing results on similar analyses are discussed.</description>

   <description>Background: Individuals with a severe psychiatric illness (SPI) are vulnerable to cancer care disparities. The contributions of cancer-related mortality to lower life-expectancy in individuals with an SPI have been understudied.&#xd;
Methods: This thesis investigated the association between an SPI history and colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes in a cohort of patients diagnosed in Ontario between 01/04/2007-31/12/2012 using provincial healthcare data. SPI history was determined using hospitalization, emergency department, and psychiatrist visit data and categorized as ‘no history of mental illness, ‘outpatient SPI history’, and ‘inpatient SPI history’. The thesis was organized around a causal framework, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between an SPI and worse cancer outcomes. The thesis investigated the SPI effect on an unknown cancer stage, non-receipt of surgical resection, non-receipt of adjuvant treatment, and on overall and CRC-specific survival. Multiple log-binomial, logistic, and modified Poisson regression were used to study dichotomous outcomes. Multiple Cox-Proportional hazards, Aalen additive hazards and Fine &amp; Gray sub-distribution hazards regression were used to study time-to-event outcomes. &#xd;
Results: CRC patients with an inpatient SPI history had 1.45 (95% CI: 1.31-1.84) times the risk of an unknown stage cancer at diagnosis, 2.15 times the risk of not receiving surgical resection (95% CI: 1.07-4.33), and 2.07 times the risk of not receiving adjuvant treatment (95% CI: 1.72-2.50), compared to those with no history of mental illness. The outpatient SPI effect was smaller in magnitude and often non-significant. The hazard ratio (HR) of death from any cause was 1.91 times higher for individuals with an inpatient SPI (95% CI: 1.63-2.25) and 1.40 times higher for individuals with an outpatient SPI history (95% CI: 1.22-1.59); the HR of death from CRC was slightly lower and the HR of non-cancer death was higher, than the overall estimates. Some significant effect modification by age, sex and stage at diagnosis was noted; however, the study was not adequately powered to detect interaction. &#xd;
Conclusions: These three studies tell a consistent, cohesive story of cancer outcome inequalities for patients with an SPI across the cancer care trajectory. Future work to understand why these inequalities exist and how to best intervene are necessary.</description>

   <title>Arctic Char Otolith Records of Recent Limnological Change in High Arctic Lakes</title>

   <description>Arctic lakes have been undergoing significant physical and chemical changes in recent years due to climate warming and permafrost thaw. These changes have the potential to impact organisms residing in these environments such as Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) which represent the top predatory fish in Arctic lakes. Otoliths, the inner ear bones of fish, offer a method to monitor these impacts through chemical analysis of their annual rings. However, not only are long-term limnological records in the Arctic limited, but the impacts of climate-driven change on Arctic aquatic ecosystems are not well known. This research investigates a long-term record (2003-16) of the physiochemical properties of two High Arctic lakes at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory on Melville Island, Nunavut. Additionally, 2013 and 2015 otoliths were analyzed to investigate elemental changes associated with limnological and catchment change. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results indicate that both lakes underwent significant chemical change following a catchment permafrost disturbance episode in 2007 that caused widespread slope disturbances and a deep seasonal active layer thaw. Both lakes have seen increased solute loads, most notably a 500% and 300% increase in water column SO42- in the West and East Lakes, respectively. Ionic ratios indicate that the source for the SO42- is compositionally similar to disturbed catchment streams. In addition, the West Lake has seen substantial and sustained increases in turbidity associated with internal subaqueous slumps and similar effects are absent from the East Lake. Hence, the synchronous change in solute loading to the lakes reflects increased contributions from the catchment due to deep active layer development.&#xd;
&#xd;
Otolith analysis reveals an abrupt increase in Mg and a decrease in Ba in fish from both lakes.  Results further show that not only is the otolith chemistry statistically different within each individual fish from beginning to end of life, but also between the two lakes. These chemical changes are thought to reflect differential responses to multiple environmental stressors including the chemical and physical changes in the lakes. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the rapid threshold responses of Arctic lakes and highlights the fact that these physiochemical changes have implications for the whole aquatic ecosystem.</description>

   <title>Working with Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):  Creating the Optimal Intellectual, Social, and Physical Environments</title>
   <creator>Bell, Rachel</creator>
   <subject>ASD Physical Environment</subject>
   <description>The purpose of this master’s project was to examine different issues and strategies on working with students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to create the optimal intellectual, social, and physical environments in regular, inclusive classrooms. Despite the excellent previous research and publications on students with ASD, not enough practical strategies have been focused on students with ASD in Grade 7 and 8 regular classrooms. To address this lack, I created a presentation/workshop and corresponding brochure for Grade 7 and 8 teachers who have little experience working with adolescents with ASD. These resources represent practical strategies these teachers can use. The presentation/workshop has a main focus on the physical environment, and the relation the actual classroom space can have on the academic and social environments for students with ASD. The final chapter looks back on my journey of creating this presentation/workshop to reflect on the progress that has been made for students with ASD, as well as looking forward towards the steps that still need to be taken in Ontario public schools by other teachers and myself to help ensure that all classrooms are inclusive.</description>

   <title>A Numerical Investigation of Stress Path and Rock Mass Damage in Open Pits</title>
   <creator>Duran Del Valle, Felipe</creator>

   <subject>Rock Mass Strength</subject>
   <description>The importance of establishing reliable slope designs becomes critical as the depth of open pits increases. Defining an optimum slope design that maximizes financial return and ore recovery without compromising safety conditions requires a proper evaluation of the stability conditions around the pit, and of the effects of instability on mining operations. Performing this analysis requires a good understanding of the behavior and strength of the rock mass at the slope scale.&#xd;
The use of simplified constitutive models, which overlook the effects of damage accumulation on the mechanical behavior of rock masses, adds to the degree of uncertainty of the results of stability analyses of large rock slopes.&#xd;
In this research, the relationship between damage and stress path is examined by using advanced numerical methods that allow the explicit representation of rock damage. The bonded particle method (BPM) has been used to evaluate the influence of stress path on damage accumulation, and on the strength of intact rock. The analysis of the influence of stress path on damage and strength at rock mass scale has been performed using the synthetic rock mass (SRM). &#xd;
From this analysis, it was possible to correlate the extension strain with the onset of yielding in the SRM sample. This limit was found to be independent of the confinement stress and the stress path followed to load the sample. A series of 3D numerical models were created to explore the correlation between in situ stress, stress path and rock mass damage. The relationship between the onset of yielding and extension strain from SRM modelling was used to define the areas in the pit models that might suffer relaxation induced damage. The extent of the zone where damage can develop has a direct relationship with the magnitude of the in situ horizontal stress. The geometry of the pit has an influence on the distribution of extensional strain around the pit, as the the increased confinement generated by slope curvature reduces the extent of the damage zone in the curved areas of the pit.</description>

   <title>Modification of Nucleotide Excision Repair Activity by 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and Sulforaphane</title>

   <description>The studies described in this thesis investigated the relationship between the DNA repair pathway nucleotide excision repair (NER, which is critical for protecting against carcinogenesis), and two exogenous chemicals, the tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and the nutraceutical sulforaphane.  &#xd;
	NER activity in female A/J mouse liver nuclear extracts decreased by 46% 12 h post NNK treatment and increased by 48% 24 h post NNK. These changes in NER activity were not attributed to alterations in levels of the NER proteins XPC, XPA, XPB and p53.  However, the binding of hepatic XPA and XPB to damaged DNA at both timepoints was increased, while the binding of XPC to damaged DNA was unchanged at 12 h and decreased at 24 h. &#xd;
	A 63% decrease in NER activity in female A/J mouse lung nuclear protein extracts 24 h post NNK treatment was not attributed to changes in levels of XPC, XPA, XPB or p53.  However, the binding of lung XPA and XPB to damaged DNA was decreased and the binding of XPC to damaged DNA was increased at 24 h.   Hence, NNK-induced NER changes are time and organ dependent and are associated with changes in the binding activities, but not the levels, of specific recognition and early excision NER proteins.&#xd;
	 A dose (100 mg/kg) and timepoint (6 h) of maximal effect of sulforaphane on female CD-1 mouse hepatic and pulmonary mRNA levels of two genes regulated by Nrf2, a major signalling pathway of sulforaphane mediated-effects, were found.  A 50% increase in NER activity was observed in liver nuclear extracts 12 h post sulforaphane treatment, while lung NER at 12 h and liver NER at 6 h were not affected by sulforaphane.  The increase in hepatic NER activity at 12 h was not associated with changes in levels of XPC, XPA, XPB or p53 or in the binding of hepatic XPC, XPA and XPB to damaged DNA.  These results suggest that the impact of sulforaphane on repair-associated processes is time and organ dependent and is not associated with changes in the levels or activities of these specific recognition and early excision NER proteins.</description>

   <title>Multiple Receiver Wireless Power Charger for Mobile Electronic Devices in Near Field</title>

   <description>Portable consumer electronics like mobile phones, laptops, tablets and other devices have flooded the markets these days. While providing the convenience of keeping in touch with friends and family at the touch of a button, or performing complex scientific computations of a physical system, these devices have become an essential part of everyone’s day-to-day lives. In order to keep them up and running at all times, they need electrical energy, which in most cases is stored in the batteries of these devices. These batteries have limited storage capacity and lifetime. For these reasons, portable device users have to carry wired chargers all the time which can be an inconvenience and limits accessibility. Hence, there is a need for an alternative method of charging these devices. &#xd;
Wireless power transfer provides a viable solution to the challenges encountered by portable device consumers when using the traditional method of charging batteries.&#xd;
This thesis presents a multiple receiver wireless power transfer system for charging mobile phone batteries. The circuit consists of a transmitter and two receiver systems. A mathematical analysis of the circuit is carried out and simulated to understand its behavior with variation in coupling coefficient and load.  In order to charge the mobile phones without an extra communication module over a wide range of coupling coefficients, a variable frequency control algorithm is used. The transmitter circuit uses the algorithm to track the maximum input power of the system. The output voltage of the receiver circuit is controlled to meet the power requirement of the load as coupling coefficient varies by using a switch capacitor modeled as two back to back connected MOSFETs with their drain-to-source capacitance. &#xd;
The proposed converter circuit topology is simulated and the results are presented. The circuit operates over a wide range of coupling coefficient, with good voltage regulation. Zero voltage switching (ZVS) is achieved at the inverter switches and the power requirement of the mobile phones are met without use of an extra communication module. The resonance frequency of the circuit is 5.7MHZ and it is design to deliver 10W (5V, 2A) each to two mobile phones.</description>

   <title>Advances in the synthesis of indazoles: regioselective C-7 functionalization by directed ortho metalation and progress towards indazole based azaborine compounds</title>

   <description>As one of the fundamental heterocyclic building blocks, indazole and its derivatives have spurred significant research interest and patented applications. In particular, C-7 substituted indazole derivatives are of prime interest due to their significant bioactivities. Azaborine molecules incorporating the B-N structural motif are also of prime interest to chemists and material scientists stemming from their distinctive photophysical properties. The aim of this thesis is to construct new azaborine targets incorporating the indazole framework using Directed ortho Metalation (DoM) reactions as a key step, as well as devise new methods for C-7 functionalization of indazole heterocycles using DoM reactions.&#xd;
&#xd;
Successful N-1 functionalization of indazoles enabled the subsequent Suzuki-Miyaura or Sonogashira cross coupling reactions to prepare C-3 substituted indazoles. Efforts in Directed ortho Metalation (DoM) reactions at the C-3 aryl groups of substituted indazoles towards azaborine targets were unsuccessful. Internal alkyne bearing substituted indazole was subjected to hydroboration conditions but without any conversion to the desired products. C-3 protected Indazoles bearing N- Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) enabled their C-7 functionalization using DoM chemistry, and thereby led to the development of a new general route to these derivatives.</description>

   <description>Shape-Changing Interfaces foresee a future where interactive computing devices will be able to take on shapes that are flexible and robotically actuated, imbued with user interfaces that adjust to physical shape changes of the device hardware. In the past, shape change has been under-utilized as an interaction modality because the shape of electronic devices was always fixed by their rigid electronic components. As advances in flexible electronics and advanced materials pave the way for a new generation of non-planar, deformable, and actuated computer components, it has become possible to consider the effect on interaction design of shape transformation in electronic devices. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we present a number of shape-changing interfaces that move on a spectrum from rigid multi-faceted display surfaces that can be placed in different shape configurations by the user to fully actuated robotic notification systems. To understand how to better design shape-changing interfaces, we investigate flexible user interfaces that support physical manipulation as a means of user input. We report on an empirical study that shows that shape changes can be used for triggering viewport transformations in foldable display devices. We also discuss how thin-film displays can be seamlessly integrated with everyday objects. We then demonstrate how devices with flexible screen real estate afford focus + context functionality. Finally, we show that actuated shape notifications can be used to communicate notifications. &#xd;
&#xd;
When designing shape-changing interfaces, we argue that designers should focus on blending the dynamic qualities of the digital world with the tactile qualities of the physical one, to create interfaces that have the ability to adapt their shape to accommodate for different usages, purposes, and contexts.</description>

   <title>Theory and Modelling of Light-Matter Interactions in Photonic Crystal Cavity Systems Coupled to Quantum Dot Ensembles</title>

   <description>Photonic crystal microcavity quantum dot lasers show promise as high quality-factor, low&#xd;
threshold lasers, that can be integrated on-chip, with tunable room temperature opera-&#xd;
tions. However, such semiconductor microcavity lasers are notoriously difficult to model&#xd;
in a self-consistent way and are primarily modelled by simplified rate equation approxima-&#xd;
tions, typically fit to experimental data, which limits investigations of their optimization&#xd;
and fundamental light-matter interaction processes. Moreover, simple cavity mode optical&#xd;
theory and rate equations have recently been shown to fail in explaining lasing threshold&#xd;
trends in triangular lattice photonic crystal cavities as a function of cavity size, and the&#xd;
potential impact of fabrication disorder is not well understood. In this thesis, we develop&#xd;
a simple but powerful numerical scheme for modelling the quantum dot active layer used&#xd;
for lasing in these photonic crystal cavity structures, as an ensemble of randomly posi-&#xd;
tioned artificial two-level atoms. Each two-level atom is defined by optical Bloch equations&#xd;
solved by a quantum master equation that includes phenomenological pure dephasing and&#xd;
an incoherent pump rate that effectively models a multi-level gain system. Light-matter in-&#xd;
teractions of both passive and lasing structures are analyzed using simulation defined tools&#xd;
and post-simulation Green function techniques. We implement an active layer ensemble&#xd;
of up to 24,000 statistically unique quantum dots in photonic crystal cavity simulations,&#xd;
using a self-consistent finite-difference time-domain method. This method has the distinct&#xd;
advantage of capturing effects such as dipole-dipole coupling and radiative decay, without&#xd;
the need for any phenomenological terms, since the time-domain solution self-consistently&#xd;
captures these effects. Our analysis demonstrates a powerful ability to connect with recent&#xd;
experimental trends, while remaining completely general in its set-up; for example, we do&#xd;
not invoke common approximations such as the rotating-wave or slowly-varying envelope&#xd;
approximations, and solve dynamics with zero a priori knowledge.</description>

   <description>Introduction and Purpose: Poorly managed or unmanaged pain is a problem that affects individuals, entire healthcare systems and societies throughout the world. Although national and international practice guidelines exist for the management of both acute and chronic pain, it remains problematic. Nurses are key contributors to interprofessional pain management teams, and are involved in both the assessment and management of pain. It is important to understand pain knowledge and attitudes amongst nursing students before they enter independent practice. The purpose of this study was to examine final year, pre-registration nursing students’ knowledge and attitudes about the assessment, treatment and management of pain.&#xd;
Methods: Using a cross-sectional, descriptive design, 336 final year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) and Practical Nursing (PN) students were recruited through convenience sampling to complete the Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (KASRP). The KASRP score is calculated by percentage score and 80% or higher is considered a passing score, which indicates adequate knowledge and attitudes towards pain. &#xd;
Results: The mean KASRP score (SD) was 66.7% (9.1). English as participants’ primary language, attending School A, and having prior experience caring for someone in pain were independently associated with a statistically significant increase in mean KASRP scores (p&lt;.05). Major areas of weakness in pain knowledge and attitudes were related to understanding populations at risk of respiratory depression after receiving an opioid, dosage calculations, medication administration and pharmacology. Strengths in knowledge and attitudes involved determining the best judge of an individual’s pain, the reliability of self-report of pain in children, and symptoms of withdrawal from opioid medications.&#xd;
Conclusion: Further research is needed to understand the provincial and national levels of pain knowledge and attitudes of nursing students in other programs in Ontario and Canada. As well, as a follow up study to examine knowledge and attitudes once students have been in practice to determine if further learning occurs in clinical practice.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this project is to design a resource informed by Transformative Learning&#xd;
Theory for teachers of English as a Second Language (ESL), It provides a practical resource for&#xd;
ESL instructors to use in their adult ESL classrooms. There is an abundance of resources for&#xd;
ESL instructors that focuses on language, but limited resources for teachers interested in teaching&#xd;
their ESL learners through the transformative learning lens. Learning another language,&#xd;
especially in immersion programs, is a challenging experience for learners because of the&#xd;
assimilation they experience into the new culture. Using insights from Transformative Learning&#xd;
theory, educators can become more informed of what their learners may experience and what&#xd;
they can offer to facilitate their learning experience. This resource will provide teachers with&#xd;
some essential tools and knowledge to allow them to facilitate their students’ learning experience&#xd;
by incorporating the transformative learning perspective in their teachings. Learning English as&#xd;
a second language in Canada involves more than just the language component and this is what&#xd;
the Transformative Learning Theory encompasses. Six lesson plans were designed for adult ESL&#xd;
classes advanced level with objectives informed by the Transformative Learning Theory. There&#xd;
are also additional practical resources that ESL instructors can use such as rubrics, an annotated&#xd;
bibliography and mobile applications to facilitate Transformative Learning.</description>

   <title>Determination of Potentially Toxic and Essential Elements in Couscous From Arabic Countries Using ICP-MS and ICP-OES</title>
   <creator>Salem, Mabrok</creator>
   <contributor>Beauchemin, Diane</contributor>
   <subject>Food Risk Assessment</subject>
   <description>Couscous, which is made of semolina and flour, constitutes a primary food staple in many Arabic countries (such as Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco), as well as the second most popular dish in France and other parts of the world. It is thus important to ensure its safety for consumption. This thesis looks at both potentially toxic (As, Se, Cd and Al) and essential elements (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Mg, Mo, P, and S) in couscous, using an approach that can be used for realistic risk assessment. The analysis was carried out by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectrometry (OES) and mass spectrometry (MS), which were both used to assess the bio-accessibility of potentially toxic and essential elements in couscous.  An ICP-MS instrument equipped with a collision-reaction interface (CRI) was used to mitigate the impact of polyatomic interferences. Closed vessel digestion was performed for the determination of total concentrations. A conventional batch method, involving artificial saliva, gastric juice and intestinal fluid as extracting agents, was used to provide a good approximation of the bioaccessibility of potentially toxic and essential elements in couscous. The results revealed that the majority of elements were released by gastric juice and then saliva. In contrast, no detectable amount of elements was released by artificial intestinal juice. Both the total and bio-accessible concentrations of elements, which are all at levels making couscous safe for consumption, vary greatly, likely depending on geographic location and perhaps on the several food processing steps.</description>

   <title>Dispossession of Matrimonial Choice in Contemporary India: Examining the Link between Cross-region Marriages, Neoliberal Capitalism, and New Forms of Gender Subordination</title>

   <description>In India, in the mid 1990s, a new form of non-customary marriage emerged on the rural North Indian marriage-scape. Transgressing rules of caste endogamy and marriage within one’s religion, the men, largely drawn from the lower classes of Meo Muslims and the dominant-peasant Hindu castes, travelled long distances across India to seek wives from lower castes, other ethnicities, and/or different religions. This dissertation examines the status of these “cross-region” brides in their conjugal homes. It argues that the spread of the neoliberal market economy in India has led to the hyper-commodification of the female body; intensified gender subordination; eroded women’s bargaining ability around their labour and their bodies; and increased women’s vulnerability to new forms of gender-based violence. The neoliberal accumulative process in India has accentuated the socio-economic inequalities of historically marginalized groups like the Dalits and the Muslims, with the women from these groups being dispossessed differentially due to their gender. This makes them vulnerable to cross-region marriage proposals. &#xd;
&#xd;
The dissertation draws on a four-year-long field-based inquiry conducted in 246 villages, from the four conjugal and natal regions of Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, and West Bengal, to interrogate hegemonic knowledge formations about these brides and their marriages. It analyses how the transgressions of caste, religion, and ethnicity shape the everyday lived experience of the Dalit and Muslim brides. Findings show that, while their bodies are desired for their free productive and reproductive labour, these women are treated as “internal others” by their conjugal families and communities due to their undesired ethnicity, caste, and/or religion. Their othered status in combination with the dispossession of matrimonial choice exposes them to caste discrimination, forcible cultural assimilation, and ethnoracist and religious prejudice within the intimacy of their marriages, and within their conjugal households and villages. This research illustrates that the cross-region brides occupy a contradictory space, as these marriages foreclose their agency, yet provide them the space to challenge established patriarchal norms and power structures through hidden transcripts of everyday acts of resistance.</description>

   <description>Arsenic is a highly toxic element that is becoming an increasingly more prevalent issue for mining and metallurgical operations. Arsenic is an abundant element in the earth’s crust and is commonly associated with metals such as gold, silver, copper, nickel and many others. Arsenic is often oxidized prior to its removal from process streams because the higher oxidation state of arsenic typically offers a more stable solid product. A novel and robust process to oxidize arsenic is activated carbon-catalyzed arsenic oxidation which is a process which uses oxygen, as the only consumable reagent, and activated carbon. &#xd;
The arsenic oxidation mechanism was explored via cyclic voltammetry, zeta potential measurements, X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy, shake tests, batch tests and continuous column tests. It was determined that hydrogen peroxide is formed on the surface of activated carbon and this aids in the oxidation of arsenic. Adsorption of arsenic species on the activated carbon was a large factor in the investigation. Two mechanisms of arsenic oxidation were theorized and it is believed that they occur simultaneously. The first hypothesized reaction pathway is that As (III) is oxidized when it contacts hydrogen peroxide on the activated carbon surface and is then instantly adsorbed as an As (V) compound. The second hypothesized reaction pathway is that As (III) adsorbs onto the surface of activated carbon and is then oxidized by hydrogen peroxide present in close proximity in the solution to the activated carbon surface. Activated alumina was used instead of carbon during a batch test experiment in order to verify that it is the functional groups of carbon that perform the catalytic ability of activated carbon to oxidize arsenic and not the porous nature of its surface. It was concluded that activated alumina had no ability to oxidize arsenic and therefore it is the functional groups on the carbon surface that provide the oxidative capabilities.</description>

   <title>Statistical Methods For Biomarker Threshold Models in Clinical Trials</title>

   <subject>clinical trials</subject>
   <description>In clinical trials, the main objective is to investigate the treatment effects on patients. However, many molecularly targeted drugs or treatments tend to benefit a subset of patients more, identified by a certain biomarker. The cut-point value defining patient subsets is often unknown. For this situation, the ordinary likelihood ratio test cannot be applied for testing treatment-biomarker interaction because of the model irregularities.  &#xd;
&#xd;
We develop a residual bootstrap method to approximate the distribution of a proposed test statistic to test for treatment-biomarker interaction in survival data. Simulation studies show that the residual bootstrap test works well. The proposed method is applied to BIG 1-98 randomized clinical trial of breast cancer with Ki-67 as biomarker to consider the treatment effects on patients in two subsets. We also extend the residual bootstrap method to clustered survival data with an application to data from the I-SPY 1 clinical trial with the estrogen receptor total score as a biomarker.&#xd;
&#xd;
Another research topic of the thesis is deriving the asymptotic distribution of a penalized likelihood ratio test statistic for testing biomarker effect and treatment-biomarker interaction in binary data. The model can be viewed as a mixture of logistic regression models with unknown cut-point for which the regularity conditions of ordinary likelihood methods are not satisfied. We first approximate the indicator function defining biomarker subgroups by a smooth continuous function. To overcome irregularities, we develop a penalized likelihood method, introducing a new idea of using random penalty term. Proposing a new set of regularity conditions helps us to study the properties and limiting distributions of the maximum penalized likelihood estimates of the parameters. We further prove that the penalized likelihood ratio test statistic has an asymptotic $\chi^{2}_{3}$ distribution under the null hypothesis. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed test procedure works well for hypothesis testing. The proposed method is applied to a clinical trial of prostate cancer with the serum pro-static acid phosphatase (AP) as a biomarker.</description>

   <title>Improving Physical Activity Levels among Children through the Use of Before- and After-School Programs</title>
   <creator>Halcovitch, Amber</creator>
   <subject>Physical Activity, Children, Before- and after-school programs</subject>
   <description>Physical activity plays an integral role in child development, with benefits being shown in both mental and physical aspects of growth (Janssen &amp; Leblanc, 2010; Strong et al., 2005). Currently, only 9% of boys and 4% of girls are meeting the recommended guidelines of 60 minutes per day in Canada (Colley et al., 2011). The current efforts of schools in Canada have not provided adequate attention to increasing the levels of children’s physical activity in physical education, daily physical activity, or recess. The current project aims to help improve physical activity levels among children through the use of before- and after-school programs, as such programs are considered a suitable environment to help improve levels of physical activity for children (Canadian Active After School Partnership, 2014) and tend to be already readily accessed by Canadian families (Canadian Active After School Partnership, 2014). By creating easy and accessible recourses for these programs, registered early childhood educators, who may not have equal access to the importance of physical activity, can begin to increase the levels of physical activity in their programs with hopes of helping children achieve their recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity. This project provides such resources based on a thorough review of the research literature.</description>

   <description>The goal of this dissertation was to examine how specific scaffolding strategies could affect executive functioning (EF) performance in preschool aged children, specifically shifting performance as measured by the Dimension Change Card Sort task (DCCS; Zelazo, 2006). In the DCCS, children must sort test cards initially based on one dimension (e.g., shape) and then switch to sort by another dimension (i.e., colour). When asked to switch rules, 3-year-olds tend to perseverate whereas 5-year-olds can shift successfully. Theoretical accounts center on the notion that children have difficulty successfully representing rules that have embedded if-if-then conditional (Bunge &amp; Zelazo, 2006). If this is true, interventions that are designed to make representing the embedded conditional rule less taxing should lead to better performance on post-switch trials of the DCCS. Given that preschool aged children struggle to describe objects in new ways on the basis of different dimensions (Kloo &amp; Perner, 2005), children may perseverate because they have difficulty reconceptualising the stimuli to match with the post-switch sorting parameters. The studies in this dissertation sought to test the hypothesis that DCCS performance could be scaffolded by promoting children’s attention to the multidimensional nature of objects. &#xd;
In Study 1 and 2, brief experimental games were used to scaffold 3-year-old children’s ability to think about the multidimensional nature of objects by both separating and aggregating dimensions. Results showed that promoting multidimensional understanding facilitated DCCS performance relative to controls. Moreover, it seems that this is the case regardless of the nature of the scaffolding dimensions. &#xd;
In Study 3, we included an additional extra-dimensional sorting parameter, order, in an attempt to facilitate performance on a more advanced version of the DCCS in 5-year-olds. Again, children in the experimental condition performed significantly better relative to controls, suggesting that difficulty conceptualizing objects in different ways may be a critical component of shifting performance across the preschool age range.&#xd;
The findings will be discussed with regard to their theoretical implications concerning the nature of EF development more broadly, and shifting more specifically, and their potential to inform research with children who may be at risk for difficulties with shifting.</description>

   <description>This study focused on understanding the nature of a professional learning experience facilitated through the theory and practices of ensemble theatre-making. The study was guided by two questions: How do K-12 teachers characterize their current school-based professional learning? And, how do a group of teachers experience an ensemble approach to professional learning?&#xd;
To answer the first question, a professional learning survey was created and distributed to teachers at a variety of American international schools. The purpose of the survey was to gain insight as to how K-12 teachers characterized their current school-based professional learning. The second question was explored through a professional learning intervention. Over an 18-week period, five middle school teachers participated in professional learning experience guided by the theory and practices of ensemble theatre-making. &#xd;
Descriptive statistics and narrative were used to explain the findings from the survey.  Narrative was used to highlight the importance of context in teacher professional learning. Findings from the survey suggested that schools and teachers have different perceptions as to what constitutes meaningful professional learning, and that teachers see a direct correlation between the documentation/accounting of professional learning and professional advancement. &#xd;
A phenomenological perspective was taken when analyzing the 18-week professional learning intervention. Findings from the ensemble intervention suggested that the nature of learning in ensemble derives from a personal pre-disposition/readiness to learn, and the behaviours of releasing, expressing, and supporting. Further findings suggested that the subjective nature of ensemble-learning provided participants with an authentic learning experience. &#xd;
Key contributions of the research include: (a) language that allows teachers and administrators to describe the nature of accountability and capacity building in either self-directed or institutionally-mandated professional learning initiatives, (b) a framework for a non-technocratic approach to professional learning that acknowledges the complex nature of teaching, and through multiple processes facilitates an understanding of that complexity, and (c) a model that articulates an emergent understanding of the actions and interactions present within the phenomenon of ensemble-learning.&#xd;

   <description>There is growing recognition for the Transformational Leadership (TFL) framework in youth sport. Indeed, theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that coach TFL plays a salient role in promoting developmental outcomes in youth athletes. Nevertheless, research examining the influence of coach leadership behaviours typically relies on self-report measures and inductive analytical techniques, thus providing a limited picture of TFL. It is therefore important to generate baseline descriptive data, revealing the extent to which leadership behaviours are currently being employed by youth sport coaches. Accordingly, the overarching purpose of this study was to provide quantitative descriptions relating to the nature and extent to which youth sport coaches display leadership behaviours across playing contexts (i.e., training and competition).&#xd;
Participants were seven head coaches of youth soccer teams and 73 athletes (Mage = 14.26, SD = 1.27, 40 female). Systematic observation was employed to examine the frequency of coach leadership behaviours. Descriptive data regarding the coaches’ use of leadership revealed that coaches spend more time exhibiting neutral behaviours compared to active leadership (e.g., TFL). This was consistent across training (75.2% neutral) and competition (77.5% neutral). When coaches actively displayed leadership, they frequently displayed TFL behaviours, including individualized consideration (M = 9.29%), inspirational motivation (M = 6.68%), and less frequently, intellectual stimulation (M = 2.95%), and idealized influence (M = 1.5%). Additionally, coaches rarely displayed passive and ineffective leadership. Finally, the results indicate that coaches display similar levels of leadership in both training and completion. These findings provide insight into the leadership behaviours employed by coaches across playing contexts, which can inform future leadership workshops focused on promoting athlete development. These findings hold practical implications, and lend insight into the youth sport coaching and TFL literature.</description>

   <title>Functional  Genomics Indicates a Minor Role for the Purple Acid Phosphatase Isozyme AtPAP17 in Arabidopsis Thaliana Phosphorus Metabolism</title>

   <description>Phosphorus (P) is a crucial plant macronutrient, as it is a constituent of essential biomolecules involved in nearly all major metabolic processes. However, soluble orthophosphate (Pi), the only form of P that roots directly assimilate, is often limiting in most soils. This has prompted the widespread use of unsustainable and polluting Pi-containing fertilizers in agriculture. Plants have evolved a complex variety of biochemical adaptations that facilitate Pi acquisition, utilization, and recycling during nutritional Pi-deficiency. This includes the up-regulation of vacuolar and secreted purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) which catalyze Pi hydrolysis from Pi-monoesters at acidic pH. Of the 29 predicted PAP isozymes encoded by the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, several high molecular weight isozymes, particularly AtPAP26, have been shown to play a key role in scavenging and recycling Pi during nutritional Pi-deprivation or leaf senescence. It has been hypothesized that AtPAP17, a low molecular weight PAP isozyme, also has a crucial function in Arabidopsis Pi metabolism as its transcripts show a marked induction during Pi-starvation or leaf senescence. This thesis uses a reverse genetic approach to examine AtPAP17’s function in Arabidopsis Pi acquisition and use efficiency by taking advantage of the publicly available T-DNA tagged insertional mutagenized populations of Arabidopsis. An anti-AtPAP17 peptide antibody was also raised in rabbits for detecting 35 kDa AtPAP17 polypeptides on immunoblots of Arabidopsis extracts. A null atpap17 allele was identified and characterized that abrogated AtPAP17 expression at both the transcript and protein level. However, loss of AtPAP17 expression did not influence the progression of Arabidopsis leaf senescence nor plant growth during Pi-deprivation relative to wild type (Col-0) controls. A sizable (~40%) decrease in extractable APase activity was only observed when the atpap17-2 mutant was subjected to Pi-deprivation. These results suggest that, contrary to inferences drawn from transcript profiling, AtPAP17 does not play a direct role in Pi scavenging during leaf senescence, and only plays a minor role during Pi-starvation.  As AtPAP17 also exhibits alkaline peroxidase activity, future studies are needed to establish its potential involvement in reactive oxygen species metabolism during Pi stress or leaf senescence.</description>

   <description>The structural, physiochemical, and microbial properties of biofilms, flocs, and granules during the formation and instability of these microbial structures were studied. Specifically, the composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial community dynamics were observed during: (a) formation of granules by modifying the operational conditions for rapid granulation in an integrated fixed-film – sequencing batch reactor (IF - SBR) system, (b) aerobic granule development with transient filamentous bulking, and (c) biofilm sloughing in an IFAS system. The thesis arose from the observations of the dynamic nature in which these structures developed and changed while operating IF - SBR. Biomass from IF - SBR could be differentiated into more and less hydrophobic fractions and the physicochemical properties and changes in EPS were associated with periodic sloughing of the biofilm from IF - SBR carriers. It was found that sloughing did not lead to biomass loss from the bioreactors and the resulting suspended biomass and flocs that had enhanced settleability. &#xd;
Coupling granulation technology with an IFAS system was an interesting development that improved the capacity and efficiency of wastewater treatment. Rapid granulation was observed with oxic/anoxic/oxic conditions in the IF - SBR system where Rhodocyclaceae and Comamonadaceae populations (known for denitrification) were predominant. &#xd;
During granulation, a microbial community was selected with a predominant bacterial group, which produced a protein rich extracellular matrix for formation of compact granules. The lysis of dominant microbial population in aerobic granules resulted in transient granule instability; however, the microbial community was capable of self-remedy to restore the granular structure after an instability phase. &#xd;
In the IFAS system, microcolonies with a higher polysaccharide content and dead cells resulted in biofilm sloughing. It was observed during the study that apparently distinct microbial structures (biofilms, flocs and granules) are pleomorphic microbial aggregates. The Identification of hydrophobic characteristics of bacteria and the extracellular adhesins expressed by the bacteria have a potential to improve our understanding about microbial interaction. The understanding about the microanatomy of biofilms, flocs and granules will facilitate to engineer stable microbial structures.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, optical sensing platforms using the “life, death and rebirth” of a photon are utilised to quantify and characterise chemicals in various samples. In this analogy, the “life” of a photon is characterised by its interactions with the propagation media, since they alter its speed and direction through the refractive index. The “death” of the photon can be observed by its absorption into an analyte, and after this process the “rebirth” of the photon can exist in the form of fluorescence. The instruments described here are based on fundamental optical techniques that were adapted for use with optical waveguides, thus allowing for compact inexpensive instrumentation that is able to characterise samples on-line and within small volumes. Characterising liquids in small volumes reduces both cost and waste, possibly increasing a company’s potential profit.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents a hollow core in-fibre photonic crystal fibre interferometer used to measure the refractive index and polarisability of gas in small volumes down to 1.2 μL. Similarly, a new amplified fibre loop cavity ring-down spectrometer is used to measure liquid alkynes through an overtone absorption band to a detection limit of 19% v/v in volumes of about 1 pL. Another instrument was built based on the well-known fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy method. Fluorescence EEM is shown here to have great versatility in monitoring the kinetics involved in the degradation of complex fluorescent samples such as lubrication oil and liquid scintillators. When EEM spectroscopy is combined with multivariate analysis techniques, including parallel factor analysis, the full advantages of the technique are realised as all the fluorescent chemical components can be measured quantitatively. However, as it takes a long time to acquire a single EEM spectrum using commercial instruments, this method was not capable of conducting real-time on-line measurements. In this thesis we therefore developed a Hadamard-transform EEM spectrometer, which through simultaneous modulation of all excitation wavelengths, was able to acquire full EEM spectra in a fraction of the time. This instrument realises the potential of using EEM spectroscopy in real time — a first step towards the goal of a commercial on-line sensor.</description>

   <description>High-surface-area materials are ideal for recyclable supports and solid phases for heterogeneous catalysis and for chromatography because they allow for a large number of substrate-surface interactions. Such synthetic materials can be precisely tuned in terms of pore size and shape, particle shape, hydrophobicity, and functionality at the surface. Periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials offer the stability of a silicon framework; the functionality of an organic compound, ligand or complex; and the opportunity for all of the aforementioned properties to be highly controlled. Additionally, these materials can have chirality on the molecular or particle scale, through the use of chiral building blocks during their synthesis. In the work described herein, we have shown that molecular chirality can be installed within PMO materials through the use of chiral organic monomers doped into the material bulk phase. The chiral dopants and other functional dopants can be chemically manipulated within the solid-state material, and we have shown that the deprotection of masked biphenol groups yields free diols that can be subsequently modified into new functionalities, such as phosphoric acid residues. By cleaving the chiral auxiliary of the chiral dopants within the solid-state material, we can remove the physical barrier to racemization; and yet, the dopant does not lose its chiral information, even after hydrothermal treatment. This work demonstrates the potential for multifunctional PMOs as heterogeneous catalysts, where selective functionalization of embedded dopants can establish different types of active sites within the material. Lastly, the synthesis of new bulk phase monomers is investigated with the idea that the complimentary quadrupole polarities of perfluorinated and nonfluorinated arenes will facilitate the self-assembly of the bulk and dopant monomers by increasing electrostatic interactions during material synthesis.</description>

   <description>The use of white LED bulbs has increased exponentially in recent years because of their low energy consumption, long life time, high luminous efficacy and environmental friendly features.&#xd;
The illumination LED bulbs require a controlled constant amount of DC current to emit a constant light. Therefore, the LED power supplies (LED drivers) determine the lighting performance. Moreover, it impacts the sales price, daily expense as well as the lifespan of the lamp.&#xd;
Conventional single-stage topologies for grid-connected LED drivers with high power factors (PFs) require large capacitances at the output to limit the low frequency (double line frequency, i.e. 120 Hz) LED current ripple that causes flicker. Electrolytic capacitors are commonly used to reduce this low frequency current ripple at the output. LED bulbs have a long lifespan (>50,000 hours), but the electrolytic capacitor has a short lifespan (5,000 hours). Therefore, using electrolytic capacitors will significantly reduce the lifespan of the entire LED lamp.&#xd;
The basic bipolar ripple cancellation technology has been proposed, using a dc-ac inverter, to cancel the low-frequency ac ripple in the LED current and thus minimizing the output capacitance requirement, enabling the use of long-life film capacitors (>50,000 hours).&#xd;
Furthermore, the improved bipolar ripple cancellation technology with a floating dc-ac power structure is proposed to accommodate the usage of low-voltage-rating dc-ac inverter in variable output voltage LED driver applications. The control scheme to achieve both ripple cancellation and the floating auxiliary capacitor voltage regulation is presented.&#xd;
In the above two ripple cancellation technologies, the voltage sensing control method has been used. A new control method, called current sensing control method, is proposed and implemented to achieve ripple cancellation as well. The method keeps using the floating dc-ac power structure while provides a simple and low-cost control solution, compared to the voltage sensing method.&#xd;
Finally, LLC resonant converter is used as the topology of single-stage high-power LED driver application to improve the efficiency. The design rule of LLC resonant converter working in Power-Factor-Correction mode is proposed and the performance is demonstrated.</description>

   <title>Exploring the Use of Biomechanical Metrics in the Validation of Physical Employment Standards</title>

   <description>Physical Employment Standards (PES) are applied to test candidates’ abilities as required to perform a job safely and efficiently.  Ability in this context refers to capacity (e.g., sufficient strength) and movement competency (e.g., technique). From the perspective of construct validity, physiological, psychophysical, and strength-based metrics are often applied as they reflect important constructs of capacity.  However, objective metrics related to movement competency seem to be lacking in the context of PES. Two types of PES-based tests are commonly applied to assess candidates’ abilities: task predictive tests (TPT), where candidate’s actions are designed to predict job performance, and task simulation tests (TST), where candidate’s actions are directly simulated from the actual job.  The current study explores if the use of movement-based metrics reveals meaningful information about the validity of a TPT relative to a TST. Participants were sixteen former manual materials handling employees. Participants performed a TPT and a TST, where each was designed based on the same underlying job description (box and container lifting tasks). Three-dimensional trunk and upper limb motion, and electromyography (EMG) of the back and shoulders were collected during each test. Joint angles and maximum voluntary isometric contractions were processed from raw motion and EMG data, respectively. Cross-correlation was applied to all data to assess the differences in the movement-based waveforms between the two types of tests. Kinematic and EMG outcomes were generally similar between the tests (R > 0.8) with two exceptions: Trunk flexion/extension angles were the least similar between TPT and TST during container tasks (R &lt; 0.8) compared to other tasks, and EMG at the shoulders were the least similar during the heavier box tasks (R &lt; 0.8) compared to other tasks. The TPT generally elicited similar movement-based patterns compared to the TST, demonstrating construct validity with respect to movement competency. However, the TST required participants to adopt different movement strategies, particularly when the use of actual containers changed the grip demands relative to the TPT. The TPT should consider handle characteristics if the test is being used to assess both capacity and competency with respect to actual job demands.</description>

   <description>Although the human hip is commonly thought to be a ball-and-socket&#xd;
joint, recent 3D studies suggest that the hip translates as well as&#xd;
rotates. This is of interest not only for biomechanics but also&#xd;
clinically, because hip translation may be important to physiotherapy&#xd;
and to computer-assisted surgery for total hip replacement.  Previous&#xd;
3D studies have evaluated hip kinematics as well as morphology by CT,&#xd;
MRI and surgical intervention.  A minimally invasive, inexpensive, and&#xd;
accurate way of measuring hip shape and motion may be useful in basic&#xd;
science and clinical application.  This work used prototype software&#xd;
to quantify planar hip morphology and kinematics from plain 2D&#xd;
radiographs.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ellipses were fit to the articular contours of the femoral head and&#xd;
acetabulum of plain 2D radiographs of arthritic and dysplastic&#xd;
patients.  The prototype software was validated in a study performed&#xd;
by three board-certified orthopedic surgeons. It was found to be&#xd;
efficient and reliable, taking less than one minute to quantify planar&#xd;
hip morphology and having no statistical difference between the&#xd;
observers.&#xd;
&#xd;
The prototype software was used in a clinical study to quantify planar&#xd;
hip kinematics.  Preoperative AP pelvic radiographs were taken of 11&#xd;
THA patients in 4 different positions.  The semi-automated fits&#xd;
detected a mean femoral head translation of 3.42mm, with no&#xd;
discernible directional pattern.  Every one of these arthritic&#xd;
patients exhibited substantial planar hip translation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that hip morphology&#xd;
and kinematics can be quantified from plain 2D radiographs.</description>

   <description>Positioned at the intersection of business, social, and cultural history, this thesis, “Apocalypse at the Doll Counter”: Barbie, Marjie, and the North American Toy Industry, 1959-67, uses a case study of the parallel and intersecting journeys of the American Barbie doll and Canadian Marjie doll to explore Canada’s cultural and economic relationship with the United States primarily in the late 1950s and into the 1960s. The histories of these dolls show how toys were imbued with nationalist and gendered sentiments and values in an era where American cultural and economic power penetrated Canada’s borders; Canadians responded to perceived cultural imperialism with a heightened sense of Canadian nationalism, reflected in wider Canada-US relations in the same period. &#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis further explores the rise of the Barbie doll as it became an iconic piece of plastic that transcended the toy world and was attached with cultural meaning. The cultural meaning and popular image of the Barbie doll was created by the powerful marketing of the doll by Mattel, especially as the company created a wide selection of accessories and companion goods to be purchased alongside the doll. Through Barbie, Mattel revolutionized the toy industry, much to the chagrin of later generations of parents.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, this thesis also use the Barbie/Marjie clash to provide a business history of the North American toy industry. Investigating how the Canadian toy industry approached economic competition with the American toy firms like Mattel, it looks at how the toy industry, more broadly, transitioned from a seasonal to a year-round industry and faced increasing competition at home with the development of American branch plants in Canada. Ultimately, this thesis shows how, despite all the efforts of the Canadian toy industry and the Canadian government, any success was short lived.</description>

   <title>A Paleolimnological Assessment of Eutrophication Trends in the St. Lawrence River Area of Concern Over the Past 70 Years</title>

   <description>Recent surface-water surveys suggest that high nutrient concentrations and nuisance algae remain an issue in the St. Lawrence River Area of Concern (AOC) at Cornwall, Ontario, particularly in the tributaries and nearshore zones of Lake St. Francis (LSF). Although extensive remedial actions have been completed in Cornwall and the surrounding area since its designation as an AOC, activities have primarily targeted the reduction of industrial and municipal pollution to the St. Lawrence River, with much less attention given to eutrophication. It remains unclear whether remedial actions first implemented in the 1990s have resulted in decreases to algal production and compositional changes to algal assemblages in the nearshore zones of LSF. This thesis employs a paleolimnological approach to provide a historical context for the present-day nutrient concentrations in LSF, as well as to determine whether actions associated with the Remedial Action Plan developed for the AOC have influenced algal community composition and concentrations. A sediment core was collected near the north shore of LSF and was examined for changes in the fossil diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages, diatom concentrations, pigment concentrations, organic matter content, and ratios of stable isotopes (δ15N and δ13C). Diatom and pigment concentrations increased in the uppermost intervals of the core, suggesting that overall production has risen in the last few decades. Diatom assemblages were dominated by benthic taxa throughout the core. One significant change to the diatom relative abundances was observed, occurring at a depth corresponding to the late-1950s. Stable isotopes suggested a steady increase in agricultural activity since the mid- to late-20th century and a large input of terrestrial organic material to the aquatic ecosystem circa 1960. It is likely that intensive flooding resulting from the construction of the Moses-Saunders Power Dam upstream of Cornwall led to an influx of organic material from the catchment in the late-1950s, co-occurring with a diatom assemblage shift. The recent increase in algal production is likely attributable to increased nutrient concentrations resulting from intensive agricultural activity in the contributing watersheds. It is unlikely that delisting goals for eutrophication in the AOC will be reached without a drastic change in current practices.</description>

   <description>This thesis examined the relationships between the invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and the economically important recreational fish species, Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). Nesting bass were located in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River prior to the opening of the angling season in 2015. Predator density, offspring development, and predation intensity during simulated catch-and-release angling were measured to determine the risk of combined negative effects from recreational angling and nest predation by Round Gobies. General linear models were used to compared the influence of habitat, temperature and species on each variable. As previously demonstrated, Round Gobies preyed on Smallmouth Bass eggs and larvae when the guarding male was absent from the nest. Largemouth Bass nests were located in areas with very low Round Goby abundance and are likely not experiencing significant predation by Round Gobies. Smallmouth Bass nesting near Lake Ontario are at the highest risk for predation because of slower offspring development in colder water, and prevalent rocky/sandy nesting habitat with high Round Goby abundance. The closed fishing season in 2015 did not protect the majority of Smallmouth Bass from recreational angling over the vulnerable stage of offspring development. Smallmouth Bass recruitment might be limited in these areas from a combination of hyper abundant predators and recreational angling.</description>

   <description>This dissertation reads three Shakespearean comedies, The Comedy of Errors, The Merchant of Venice, and Twelfth Night, through the mutually illuminating perspectives of early modern theories of the passions, mid-twentieth century genre theory, and twenty-first century affect studies. Its goal is to show how Shakespeare derives inspiration from the structure and character types provided by New Comedy, yet evades formulaic simplicity by suffusing the plays with emotionally intense, even traumatic, conflict. By adopting the critical framework of historical phenomenology, and close reading to pay detailed attention to the way that Shakespeare uses language to represent emotional states, this study evaluates how the distinctly early modern psychophysiological paradigm of the embodied passions shapes characters’ understanding of identity as an ecology of mutual influence with the bodies of others and the environment. &#xd;
&#xd;
A major preoccupation of these plays is belonging. Testing Northrop Frye’s postulate that “In fiction, we discovered two main tendencies, a ‘comic’ tendency to integrate the hero with his society, and a tragic tendency to isolate him” (Natural Perspective 54), this study shows how social inclusion and exclusion in these plays are based on the individual’s willingness to understand the management of the passions as a social responsibility. The struggles that Shakespeare’s comic characters face stem from questions of how to know the self and how to integrate that knowledge with social structures that, much of the time, resist or reject the very notion of individual selfhood as we know it today. Sacrifice, self-loss, and self-denial are negative experiences that comic characters must survive through, whether they are ultimately happy or not. While these comedies depict characters navigating and negotiating powerful emotions, it becomes evident that these negotiations take place at a declining rate of success as Shakespeare’s career progresses. This dissertation concludes that Shakespeare’s comedies should not be read as oppositional to his tragedies, but as components of a single continuum that exposes the painful cost of maintaining social unity.</description>

   <title>Paleolimnological Reconstruction of the Environmental Impact of the Deloro Industrial Site on Moira Lake (Ontario)</title>

   <description>Historical industrial activity at Deloro (1866-1961) included both mineral exploration and mineral processing practices which produced over 650,000 m3 of waste material ultimately dumped on site. Previous studies on the Moira River system including examination of surface waters, sediments, and sediment porewaters identified Moira Lake as an affected lacustrine system. The contamination resulted in elevated levels of arsenic (As), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni) in the lake sediments. This study used paleolimnological techniques, including geochemical tools, to evaluate the impact of the metal contamination on the lake system.&#xd;
The data collected showed increased concentrations of As, Co, and Ni with respective concentrations ranging from 50-900mg/kg, 21-1500mg/kg, and 41-1400mg/kg coinciding with the years of operation of Deloro determined via 210Pb dating. The bulk of the sedimentary As occurred as inorganic As(V) with higher As(III) in the deeper sediments and minor occurrences of As(-I) at shallow depths as indicated by XANES. The As was determined to be almost exclusively hosted in iron oxides (98-100%) via SEM-MLA. Under reducing conditions, As bound to iron-oxides may be released as dissolved As via reductive dissolution and diffusion through porewaters. The presence of As(-I) is a potential result of secondary re-precipitation of dissolved As. &#xd;
Increased chlorophyll-a concentrations and a shift in the cladoceran assemblage from one dominated by pelagic Bosminids to one dominated by littoral Chydorids and pelagic Daphniids suggested a response to a regional stressor. The primary and secondary production suggested that, although changes coincided with the onset Deloro, there was another driving factor thought to be nutrient enrichment and/or climate change.</description>

   <title>The Use of Digital Image Correlation and Fiber Optic Sensing to Assess Railway Track Support Performance</title>

   <description>The low subgrade stiffness associated with railway corridors constructed over peat often results in large rail displacement and ground deformations during train passage, leading to accelerated track deterioration and increased risk of derailment. This thesis provides insights into track behaviour using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and fiber optic sensing.&#xd;
&#xd;
To measure track displacement using DIC at sites with soft subgrades a two-camera backsight method was developed to account for the movement of the camera due to ground vibrations. This method was then used to measure track displacement of the ballast crib before and after mass stabilization at a poorly performing section of track. The effectiveness of the mass stabilization was quantified using the trackbed modulus, which provides a method to isolate the improvement of the subgrade from the presence of voids between the rail, sleepers, and ballast. The results indicate that mass stabilization can be an effective rehabilitation strategy.&#xd;
&#xd;
The use of Rayleigh backscatter fiber optic sensing was first validated in the laboratory and then used to measure rail strains and investigate the track behaviour over a 7.5 m long section of track at two different sites. Measurements from a hi-rail vehicle showed that the rail strains can be used to calculate rail curvature, which can then be used to assess the variability of track support. &#xd;
&#xd;
The fiber optic sensing was then used at a second site where the measured rail strains, along with train axle weights, were used to infer the rail seat load–deflection relationships for individual sleepers. These relationships were observed to provide significantly more detailed information than the traditional consideration of the relationship between applied load and rail deflection. &#xd;
&#xd;
The effectiveness of helical screw piles installed at a site with a peat subgrade was assessed based on the axial load carried by several piles instrumented with strain gauges, piezometric data, and track displacement measurements. The results of the analysis show that the piles carried a portion of the train load, however due to the seasonal variation of pore pressures and the limited track displacement data gathered it is not possible to ascertain how effective the piles were at improving the track behaviour.</description>

   <description>An aircraft is an example of sophisticated engineering requiring a high level of understanding, where advanced modelling techniques are used to improve design. This investigation identifies noise and vibration (N&amp;V) as principal metrics. The considered source of N&amp;V is the Turbulent Boundary Layer that causes the aircraft fuselage skin to vibrate, generating noise inside the cabin that dominates the sound field between 100Hz and 5kHz (frequency range of interest, FRoI). &#xd;
New computational methodologies (CM) are proposed to model and predict the vibro-acoustic behaviour of a section of an aircraft fuselage. The methodologies were adapted to incorporate more complex configurations, and materials. To verify these predictions, an atypical acoustic facility was commissioned to establish a new experimental methodology (EM). Several room qualification tests investigated the characteristics of the facility. The stringent criteria defined by these tests, and associated standards, were satisfied. &#xd;
The principal objective of the investigation was to develop a repeatable and reproducible strategy incorporating the complementing methodologies. The principal motivation reviewed the effects of varying thickness, and milled pocket size of the interior surfaces of the fuselage panels on Transmission Loss, TL. An associative formula was developed to account for the differences (damping, distortion, and flanking) between the methodologies. These corrections were all experimentally measured.&#xd;
Across the FRoI, the maximum TL error between the CM and EM for 0.04in, 0063in (milled), for a 0.063in, and 0.09in panels are 4dB, 4dB, 4dB, and 5dB, respectively; the error for the 0.063in and 0.063in (milled) panels with damping material are 9dB and 15dB, respectively. The TL error between the CM and EM across the entire frequency range (20Hz to 20kHz) for all mentioned panels vary as high as 20-25dB, however the frequency-averaged error for the 0.04in, 0.063in (milled), 0.063in, and 0.09in panels are 3dB, 3dB, 2dB, and 0dB, respectively; the frequency-averaged error for the 0.063in panel and 0.063in (milled) panels with damping material are 11dB and 17dB, respectively. &#xd;
In summary, thinner panels demonstrated greater attenuation per unit of weight (despite thicker panels demonstrating greater attenuation). Similarly, the application of damping material on the interior surface of the wall demonstrated greater attenuation but did not improve the attenuation per unit of weight.</description>

   <description>This research conducted herein comprises two phases: experimental and numerical. In the experimental phase, the effect of low temperature and temperature differentials on the static and fatigue behaviour of eight large-scale reinforced concrete beams is examined. Additionally, the accuracy and performance of two novel sensor technologies, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Fibre Optic Strain Sensors (FOS), in monitoring crack widths, deflections and strains in reinforced concrete members are investigated. In the numerical phase, a nonlinear finite element modelling and analysis study is conducted on statically determinate and indeterminate reinforced concrete beams with and without temperature differentials. The results of the static tests showed that the strength, ductility, and cracking load of the beams increased at low temperature. The results also demonstrated that the number, depth, and widths of the cracks decreased at low temperature. The fatigue testing showed that the fatigue life of the reinforced concrete beams improved at low temperature as a result of the higher shear strength and stiffness of the reinforced concrete, the lower number of cracks with smaller widths, and improved fatigue properties of steel (i.e., delayed fatigue crack initiation and reduced fatigue crack growth rate at low temperature). Calibration tests conducted to correct DIC and FOS readings for temperature showed that both DIC and FOS systems are affected by temperature, and that the response of each DIC camera setup is uniquely affected by temperature changes. The DIC and FOS measurements showed that these structural health monitoring techniques produce promising results and are capable of measuring crack widths and strains to a similar level of accuracy as conventional strain gauges. However, the external FOS have the advantage of being able to measure the strains in concrete in compression and give an indication of the strains in the tensile reinforcement. The numerical results showed that the finite element models are capable of predicting the load displacement behaviour (i.e., cracking, yield, and ultimate loads) as well as cracking patterns for statically determinate and indeterminate reinforced concrete beams with and without temperature differentials at room and low temperature. The modelling also showed that indeterminacy (fixed-ends) substantially increases the ultimate strength of the reinforced concrete (up to 110%).</description>

   <description>Introduction: Active transportation to school (ATS) may be a way to increase children’s physical activity (PA) levels and achieve health related benefits, however only 24% of Canadian children use active transportation as a mode to travel to and from school (Gray et al., 2014). A walking-school bus (WSB) is a proposed strategy that can afford students a safe, active method of travel to school (Kearns, Collins, &amp; Neuwelt, 2003). Few studies have examined parental perceptions of a WSB. Given that parents are typically the decision makers in regards to methods of school travel, understanding parent perceived barriers and facilitators to using a WSB is warranted. &#xd;
Purpose: The primary purpose of this thesis study was to explore parental perceptions of a WSB in order to inform an effective messaging and promotional strategy. The secondary purpose was to explore barriers and facilitators related to a WSB/ATS and to explore parent ideas about ways for their children to incorporate active travel into their daily routine.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods:  Parents of students (N=16), from three elementary schools located in Northern Ontario were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, guided by a social marketing approach (Lee &amp; Kotler, 2011). Inductive and deductive analyses were used to identify emerging themes and to explore product, price, promotion and place barriers and/or facilitators related to a WSB. Alternative ATS strategies were compiled.&#xd;
Results: Parents identified the potential for increased levels of PA and positive social interactions as key facilitators of participating in a WSB. Other key facilitators included the opportunity to be supervised while participating in ATS, and promotion of the WSB through electronic platforms such as social media. However, parents expressed concerns regarding the safety of their children and the reliability of adult supervision of the WSB. Concerns related to extreme weather conditions were also present. &#xd;
&#xd;
Discussion: Findings from this study will be used by the North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit to guide WSB interventions and to develop a messaging strategy to promote WSB uptake at the participating schools as a way to enhance ATS among students.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a progressive, low-intensity walking intervention on circulatory and autonomic adaptations in patients with peripheral arterial disease after controlling for potential confounders such as age, sex, ß-blockers and smoking.  Secondary objectives were 1) to determine the effect of the intervention on walking performance and self-report measures and 2) to determine if there were any sex-specific differences that might exist at rest or in response to training. Forty-eight participants (aged 67.81 ± 8.13 years, mean ± standard deviation) with intermittent claudication (ankle-brachial index 0.54 ± 0.18) were randomly assigned to either a walking group (n = 27) who performed a structured walking program, 5 days per week for 12 weeks, or a comparison group (n = 21) who performed usual activities.  Thirty-three (69%) participants (15 comparison group members and 18 walking group members) completed the study.  Circulatory measures (ankle-brachial index, heart rate, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and rate pressure product), autonomic measures (heart rate variability, low frequency power, high frequency power, total power, parasympathetic nervous system indicator and sympathetic nervous system indicator), tests of walking performance (pain-free, functional and maximal walking distance as well as the 6 minute walk test) and self-report measures (the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and Quality of Life Questionnaire were obtained at the beginning (Week 1) and end (Week 12) of the study.  Autonomic function (heart rate variability) improved and overall walking performance increased in members of the walking group. Men and women responded similarly to the training program. These findings suggest that a structured, low-intensity, high frequency walking program is effective in improving HRV, increasing walking performance and daily walking distance.</description>

   <description>This thesis is an investigation of disinfection in wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) as it relates to adequate wastewater treatment and, ultimately source water protection (SWP) in northern, particularly Indigenous, communities. WSPs are considered sustainable utilitarian wastewater treatment technologies that are cost efficient and require minimal operation and maintenance. However, their performance is highly dependent on environmental conditions and disinfection performance, specifically, can be compromised in northern climates. The research is motivated by the following question: are there any simple approaches that could improve WSP disinfection without the need for conversion to a full-scale conventional treatment plant? &#xd;
&#xd;
The first study compared the ability of existing models in predicting cold climate disinfection performance in WSPs by comparing their predictions of mortality rates for fecal coliform bacteria with rates observed in a single-stage WSP in Pond Inlet, NU, during the 2015 treatment season. The results of this study demonstrated that existing models exhibit limitations in representing disinfection performance in Arctic WSPs.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The second study focused on the development of a sunlight-mediated disinfection model for cold climate WSPs. A 2k factorial design was implemented to enable the examination of interaction effects of independent predictor variables related to sunlight-mediated disinfection (pH, dissolved oxygen, depth-averaged irradiance) on the mortality rates of  Escherichia coli ATCC 11229.  A controlled atmosphere chamber (CAC) was designed to control these parameters. Mortality rates between -0.8198-1.1057 h^-1 were observed throughout the experiments. A numerical model was presented and demonstrated a significant fit (p&lt;0.001) to the data collected in the experiment. Temperature was found to have a more complex relationship with disinfection than previously thought, likely affecting both the growth and death rates of E. coli. &#xd;
&#xd;
In addition, the effect of humic substances (HS) concentrations (0 - 30 mg/L) on disinfection performance was investigated. Higher HS concentrations were found to improve disinfection performance when the conditions supporting exogenous photo-oxidation were present. Recent literature has shown that HS concentrations are positively correlated to solids retention time in membrane bioreactor systems which could indicate a similar relationship with hydraulic retention time in WSPs.  Finally, suggestions are made for future WSP configurations to enhance disinfection performance.</description>

   <title>Automated Approaches for Reducing the Execution Time of Performance Tests</title>
   <creator>AlGhamdi, Hammam</creator>
   <contributor>Hassan, Ahmed E.</contributor>
   <subject>Performance Tests, Software Engineering</subject>
   <description>Performance issues are one of the primary causes of failures in today’s large-scale software systems. Hence, performance testing has become an essential software quality assurance tool. However, performance testing faces many challenges. One challenge is determining how long a performance test must run. Performance tests often run for hours or days to uncover performance issues (e.g., memory leaks). However, much of the data that is generated during a performance test is repetitive. Performance testers can stop their performance tests (to reduce the time to market and the costs of performance testing) when the test no longer offers new information about the system’s performance. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose two automated approaches that reduce the execution time of performance tests by measuring the repetitiveness in the performance metrics that are collected during a test.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first approach measures repetitiveness in the values of the performance metric, e.g., CPU utilization, during a performance test. Then, the approach provides a recommendation to stop the test when the generated performance metric values become highly repetitive and the repetitiveness is stabilized (i.e., relatively little new information about the systems’ performance is generated). The second approach also recommends the stopping of a performance test, by measuring the repetitiveness in the inter-metrics relations. Our second approach combines the values of the performance metrics that are generated at a given time into a system state. For instance, a system state can be the combination of a low CPU utilization value and a high response time value. Our second approach recommends a stopping time when the generated system states during a performance test become highly repetitive.&#xd;
&#xd;
We performed experiments on three open source systems (i.e., CloudStore, Pet- Clinic and Dell DVD Store). Our experiments show that our first approach reduces the duration of 24-hour performance tests by up to 75% while capturing more than 91.9% of the collected performance metric values. In addition, our approach recommends a stopping time that is close to the most cost-effective stopping time (i.e., the stopping time that minimizes the duration of a test while maximizing the amount of information about the system’s performance as provided by the performance test). Our second approach was also evaluated using the same set of systems. We find that the second approach saves approximately 70% of the execution time while preserving at least 95% of the collected system states during a 24-hour time period. Our comparison of the two approaches reveals that the second approach recommends the stopping of tests at more cost-effective times, in comparison to our first approach.</description>

   <title>The Reasonable Person in Criminal Law</title>

   <subject>The Reasonable Person</subject>
   <description>The reasonable person standard has permeated the legal sphere as a guideline for determining the appropriate judgment in various situations.  If one is to be justified, he or she must have acted as a reasonable person would have under the same or similar circumstances. While there are advantages to relying on this universal understanding of reasonableness, there are serious doubts about whether or not such a standard is consistent with the demands of justice. The reasonable person is a difficult concept in law because it aims to objectively assess the behaviour of individuals of different backgrounds, different standings in society and different points of view. The problem is that every individual is bound to have their own idea of what it means to be reasonable based on his or her own experience. Judges and jurors thus often end up ascribing particular characteristics to the reasonable person that are derived from an understanding of the society in which they live. The result is a standard that is both inconsistently defined and insensitive to human diversity. In distinguishing reasonableness from mere rationality it is evident that the main defining feature of the reasonable person is that he or she considers their own interests and the interests of others equally. This thesis defends the idea that in order to properly account for variation in individual circumstances, criminal courts ought to define the reasonable person more clearly by reference to an ethic or standard of care similar to the one endorsed in Canadian and UK civil law. Having an ethic of care model of reasonableness as a jurisprudential guide will help prevent judges and jurors from mistakenly relying on average or rational conceptions of reasonable behaviour as well as foster sensitivity to individual differences and needs.</description>

   <title>MagicWand: A Comparison of Gestural Affordances Between Cylindrical and Flat Display Form Factors</title>

   <description>An affordance is the intrinsic ability of an object to allow an action. Affordances are generated by matching the fit of the body under action to the physical shape of the object. For example, a vertical door handle affords pulling, whereas a horizontal flat bar affords pushing to open. Modern smartphones with traditional flat screens offer poor affordances for gestural interactions. E.g., the flat form factor prevents a comfortable grip hindering wrist movements. Moreover, flat displays have a display area that can only be viewed from one side, and the visibility is reduced when the device is rotated. &#xd;
In this thesis, we present MagicWand, a cylindrical display device consisting of two 5.5” Flexible Organic Light-Emitting Diode (FOLED) screens wrapped around a 3D printed body. MagicWand features a smartphone running the Android operating system. Gesture recognition allows the use of the wand movements as a form of input. We were interested in exploring how a cylindrical form factor will offer physical affordances for actions that are quite different from those of a traditional flat form factor of a smartphone. &#xd;
To exhibit interactions with our prototype, an application scenario was developed where MagicWand was used as a game controller that can display a variety of 3D game elements. We believed that the physical affordance of this novel display device could affect the speed with which users learned specific gestures to operate the graphical elements on display. We conducted a user study to compare the guessability of gesture sets between flat and cylindrical device conditions. First, gestures were elicited for invoking common Graphical User Interface tasks in both device conditions, collecting over 100 unique gestures for 29 tasks. Second, a recognition engine was trained to recognize the top gestures for each task, for each device condition. Third, we measured the time it took for participants to discover these top gestures. &#xd;
The results of the study suggest significantly faster discovery of input gestures in the cylindrical condition over the flat device with 20 percent of gestures, specifically those involving tilt.</description>

   <description>This dissertation focuses on a dissident youth group in Turkey which came to national and international attention during the uprisings of May- June 2013 and dissolved two years later.  The Anti-Capitalist Muslims (A-C M) were a meeting ground for individuals from different walks of life but influenced  by the critical, Islamist writings of noted Turkish thinker and author, Ihsan Eliacik. My investigation saw the A-C M as a ground of investigation for understanding the potentiality and challenges of solidarity praxis across what had previously been thought to be historically and politically conflicting political groups. Specifically, it seeks to answer several questions: first, what are the roots of this encounter between Turkish Left and a Social Justice-centered interpretation of Islam? Second, what were the terms upon which this diverse group of individuals coalesced? Third, how did their work together transform their own political understanding? Fourth, what lessons can be drawn from this experiment for the future of political labour in Turkey and elsewhere in the world?&#xd;
	The dissertation is  anchored in a theoretical framework which brings together a broad historical perspective on identity politics and the politics of alliance with reflection on radical labor movements in the Turkish context. In an era in which dissident movements and radical politics both produced and destabilized by the neoliberal trends and re-structuring of state and economy, I argue that the A-C M represents a new type of solidarity/alliance building which are based on transitory political alignments what I call “precarious alliances”.  As a concept, the notion of the precariousness of such transitory coalitions offers both a critique to the existing analysis of the process of making alliances and a re-imagination of the terms upon which individuals unite. I suggest that precarious alliances might serve as more than an analytical tool; indeed, for the A-C M it served as a radical political strategy.  Moreover, in situating, theoretically and contextually, the A-C M experience in a time of greater social mobilization globally, I hope to contribute to the larger debates on solidarity building among youth of diverse ideologies and positionalities.</description>

   <title>Back and Forth: Prediction and Interactive Alignment in Conversation</title>

   <description>On a daily basis, we engage in multiple conversations with others that seem to occur effortlessly. Despite this apparent ease, the cognitive processes involved in conversation are complex. The challenges associated with conversation include comprehending our partner while simultaneously planning our own contributions and ensuring that what we say is appropriate to the conversational context. The paradoxical ease of this cognitively demanding activity suggests that we may employ a specialized mechanism when engaging in conversation. This dissertation investigates two potential processes that may be involved during social interaction: conversational prediction and alignment. Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis investigate the perceptual conditions that are necessary for making predictions during conversation. In particular, we investigate how the availability of information influences how we are able to predict a turn exchange during conversation. We present findings that demonstrate that perceivers can predict upcoming turn exchange behavior between two talkers. Further, we suggest that auditory and visual cues serve distinct roles in the predictive processes involved in conversation. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 investigate behavioral alignment in social interaction. In general, it has been shown that conversing talkers align several aspects of their behavior. Talkers have independently been shown to become similar in linguistic attributes such as the words they use and nonlinguistic attributes such as their movement patterns during an interaction. Here, our findings demonstrate that talkers, in fact, align multiple attributes during a single conversation. In addition, there are relationships between alignment behavior within these attributes; when talkers become similar within one attribute, they are more likely to become similar within another attribute. Further, we show that this alignment behavior is influenced by the relationship between talkers suggesting that social factors play a significant role in our conversational behavior. Taken together, this dissertation demonstrates that prediction and alignment behavior are key features of conversational interaction. In particular, we demonstrate that the informational and social context of a conversation determine how these important processes operate. These findings have important implications for the identification of the specific underlying mechanism that is responsible for ensuring the success of our daily communication.</description>

   <description>The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable biomass feedstocks can reduce our reliance on petroleum resources and help mitigate environmental issues associated with their use. However, many bioprocesses are limited by end-product inhibition, leading to lower product titer and reduced bioreactor productivity. Introducing a carefully selected solid absorbent polymer can reduce end-product inhibition by removing the product as it is formed and enriching it within the polymer phase. To be effective, the polymer must possess (1) a high affinity for the target solute, measured by its partition coefficient (PC), (2) a preference for solute absorption over water uptake, measured by selectivity (α), (3) biocompatibility towards the microorganism, and (4) sufficient physical strength to withstand the high shear bioreactor environment.&#xd;
The present work begins with an evaluation of thermodynamic activity models for a priori polymer phase selection. Accurate PC predictions were demonstrated for a range of target solutes in rubbery, amorphous materials. Further, polymer selection based on PC was shown to favor low molecular weight (MW) materials, whereas higher MW polymer yielded stronger, more solid-like absorbents. Compromises between absorptive and physical properties inherent to unimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD) polymers were mitigated by developing novel bimodal MWD formulations, made from mixing very low MW material (organic solvent or oligomer) with a high MW polymer. Solute absorption was also sensitive towards polymer crystallinity and water uptake; these factors were captured qualitatively by the thermodynamic models but with significantly reduced prediction accuracy.&#xd;
Remarkable improvements in both PC and α for n-butanol and n-octanol were realized by covalently tethering small amounts of imidazolium ionic functionality to a hydrophobic polymer, yielding an ionomer. Further improvements were achieved by preparing high ionic content polyelectrolytes, polymerized from reactive imidazolium ionic liquids (IL). The polyelectrolytes registered excellent PC values for several alcohols (n-butanol, iso-butanol, ethanol) as well as good solute/water selectivity. Importantly, both ionomer and hydrophobic polyelectrolyte formulations substantially eliminated cytotoxicity and water-solubility concerns associated with analogous ILs. These findings advance the state-of-the-art in absorbent materials for bioprocess separations and represent a promising avenue for future partitioning bioreactor research.</description>

   <title>The Structure of Blame and its Relation to the Moral Emotions</title>

   <subject>R. Jay Wallace's conception of blame</subject>
   <description>It is not clear what role emotions play in our conception of blame. In this thesis, I aim to understand the role of the emotions in blame, and the question that I explore can be phrased in the following way: is blame contained in the emotions, or, conversely, are the emotions simply a part of blame? Two further questions are the offshoots of this one: what is involved in blaming others; and why do we have reason to care about the content that is involved in blaming others? I call these the substantive and normative questions of blame, which an account of blame must answer if it is to be satisfactory. &#xd;
To situate this broad question, I will focus on R. Jay Wallace’s account of blame. Wallace’s position is that blame is contained in the emotions. I will argue that Wallace’s account holds too tight a relation to allow for responses to our judgments of blameworthiness. At most, Wallace’s account admits of expressions of blameworthiness. Whether we should regard such expressions as necessary or sufficient to count as blame depends on what can be included in our responses to judgments of blameworthiness. To fill in the content of these responses, I turn to T.M. Scanlon’s conception of blame. I conclude that purely emotional accounts reduce the reasons that we have access to in blaming others, and weakens the normative significance that blame has for us. &#xd;
The structure of the thesis is as follows. In Chapter 2, I provide a reconstruction of Wallace’s reactive account. In Chapter 3, I advance the critical claim that Wallace’s reactive account is essentially nonreactive, since, under his depiction, blame holds too tight a relation. In Chapter 4, I offer a reconstruction of Scanlon’s account of blame. In Chapter 5, I apply our knowledge from both accounts to sketch out what a commitment to either view entails, and to assess the reasons that we have to care about blame proposed by each account. I conclude that Wallace’s account is too thin, and that, on such a view, we lose sight of what is significant about blame.</description>

   <title>Multiuser Transmit and Receive Beamforming for One-dimensional Signalling</title>

   <description>Internet of things (IoT), which enables connectivity of billions of devices to the Internet, is expected to be the next revolution in wireless ecosystem. Due to lack of available spectrum, it is imperative for wireless technologies to reuse spectrum by simultaneously providing service to multiple devices at the same frequency. Existing wireless technologies are designed to support a few simultaneous users with high data rates. The IoT, on the other hand, requires support for many users each having a very low data rate.&#xd;
&#xd;
The main focus of this dissertation is to support, at physical layer, massive deployment of low data rate devices by means of user selection, transmission, and receive techniques.&#xd;
&#xd;
This dissertation proposes user selection algorithms capable of selecting twice as many users as the number of transmit antennas in a broadcast channel by employing the concept of orthogonality in low-pass representation of signals. Moreover, we propose several reliable multiuser receive beamforming techniques, specific to low-cost devices with low data rate one-dimensional signalling by signal processing based on minimization of error probability. This approach leads to introduction of a new metric called signal minus interference to noise ratio (SMINR). Maximization of this metric results in a low-complexity closed-form solution for the beamforming weights of each user with reliable performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
This dissertation also proposes several reliable multiuser transmit precoding techniques, specific to low data rate one-dimensional signalling, that can support more users than the number of transmit antennas by employing minimum-probability-of-error as well as widely-linear based signal processing.&#xd;
The final contribution of this thesis is employing widely linear precoding for simultaneously transferring information and power in wireless broadcast channels.&#xd;
&#xd;
From a more general perspective, this dissertation addresses scenarios where bandwidth is scarce compared to the density of available users and proposes signal processing techniques to enable higher network throughput. In particular, it is shown that grater throughput may be achieved and the number of users can be increased in a multiuser communications system by using either widely linear or minimum probability of error based processing of one-dimensionally modulated signals compared to linear processing of both one-dimensionally and two-dimensionally modulated signals.</description>

   <description>This dissertation explores the history of the dietetic profession in Canada through the lens of a feminist sociology of expertise—a theoretical framework that I develop throughout this dissertation. Dietetics arose from home economics in the early 20th century. Although home economics has been the subject of scholarly inquiry, dietetics has received little attention from historians or from the profession itself. However, unravelling the history of dietetics reveals compelling insights about women’s access to post-secondary education, particularly in the sciences, as well as paid employment throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Moreover, the history of dietetics reveals interesting insights about the competing ontological and epistemological understandings of food, eating, nutrition, health, professions, and expertise. As a female-dominated profession, whose knowledge base has historically been centered on food, this study of dietetics also provides important insights about the relative power and place of women and feminized professions within the health care hierarchy.&#xd;
&#xd;
I conducted oral history interviews with 18 long-serving, Canadian dietitians who had been recognized as leaders in their field at some point in their careers. Each oral history consisted of three, one-hour long interviews that were conducted approximately three days to one week apart. The oral history interviews will be archived for public use in the Esther Clark Wright Archive at Acadia University.&#xd;
&#xd;
Based on the insights of the narrators who participated in my research, I advance several findings related to the shifting knowledge base and identity of the profession, as well as its engagement in social justice advocacy throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.</description>

   <title>School Closures &amp; Community Hubs: Examining Livability in Ontario through School Closures and the Community Hub Framework</title>

   <subject>Livability</subject>
   <description>This report explores the issue of public school closures in Ontario, and the viability of the Province’s recently introduced Community Hub model to address some of the problems associated with school closures. The findings of the research demonstrate there are numerous potential impacts of public school closures, and scholars have framed these impacts of closures negatively. Scholars have argued that schools are key public assets that build community cohesion, and permanent closures of these institutions threaten this cohesion. Similarly, analysis of Ontario newspaper coverage of school closures between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated that the issue was framed predominately negatively, with the most commonly cited concerns being threats to neighbourhood cohesion and social capital. The study found that community hubs offer potential to address some of the impacts raised in the literature and news media, primarily by providing space to uphold social capital, and by preventing neighbourhood decline. At this time, however, a lack of coordinated planning and policy makes the creation of community hubs a difficult and timely process in Ontario. Until other frameworks or more concrete policy exist to support the conversion of school buildings into hubs, saving publicly owned assets for conversion into hubs remains a complex and challenging issue.</description>

   <description>Diastasis recti abdominis (DrA), a separation of the paired rectus abdominis muscles, is associated with reduced abdominal muscle function, post-partum body image complaints, musculoskeletal pain, and possibly urogynecological complaints. The amount of separation present (inter-rectus distance, IRD) is currently considered the key indicator of DrA severity, yet prior to this thesis, facets of its reliability and validity had not been tested, and the relationship between IRD and symptoms was not well understood. Physiotherapists are often consulted by women with DrA, yet treatment efficacy remains unclear. The first three studies investigated the psychometric properties (intra- &amp; inter-rater reliability, criterion-related validity) of ultrasound imaging to measure IRD and demonstrated that consistent IRD measurements from one day to another can be achieved if the rater is kept constant, but reliability is reduced when the rater is variable. When IRD is too large to measure using conventional ultrasound, extended field-of-view techniques may be useful. The fourth study investigated the relationship between IRD and symptom severity in women with DrA and found that IRD was significantly negatively correlated with body image and positively correlated with abdominal pain, but not with lumbopelvic pain, dysfunction nor with urogynecological complaints. The final study, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), served to inform the feasibility and planning of future RCTs to evaluate physiotherapeutic treatment efficacy in DrA management. The recruitment rate was three participants per month. The retention rate was 84%. Intervention adherence rates were ≥ 53%. Positive, clinically meaningful effects in response to physiotherapeutic interventions were observed for body image and trunk flexor strength but not for IRD, pain, or dysfunction. This thesis provides novel information regarding the use of ultrasound imaging in the assessment of DrA and improved understanding of the significance of IRD on symptom presence and severity. This work is the first to report on the feasibility of running an RCT to test physiotherapeutic treatment efficacy in women with post-partum DrA. Before going forward with such an RCT, further pilot work is recommended and includes exploring the potential role of conservative interventions in women with DrA who report higher levels of pain and dysfunction.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate how the regulation of transcriptional coactivators (PGC-1α, LRP130) and protein deacetylases (SIRT1, SIRT3), which are shown to regulate mitochondrial adaptations in cell and animal models, respond to energy stressors in human skeletal muscle. In Chapter 3, we investigated whether changes in fatty acid oxidation known to occur during fasting and exercise occur in concert with changes in SIRT3 mitochondrial localization and expression. We found that 48 hours of fasting and acute endurance exercise modestly decreased SIRT3 mRNA expression but did not alter SIRT3 mitochondrial localization, despite increases in fatty acid oxidation. This suggests that if SIRT3 is involved in the acute regulation of fatty acid oxidation in human skeletal muscle, this is not accomplished by alterations in mitochondrial localization. In Chapter 4, we investigated the impact of a 48-hour fast on the regulation of SIRT1 and GCN5 in human skeletal muscle. In addition, we examined the relationship between SIRT1/GCN5 and the expression of PGC-1α target genes. SIRT1 mRNA expression slightly increased, while GCN5 was unchanged. However, protein content and nuclear localization of SIRT1 and GCN5 did not change, suggesting that, in contrast with previous animal studies, SIRT1 and GCN5 are unaltered in response to fasting in human skeletal muscle. We also found that individual changes in nuclear GCN5 and SIRT1 predicted changes in PGC-1α mRNA expression, but not PDK4, which suggests that SIRT1 and GCN5 may specifically regulate the PGC-1α gene. In Chapter 5, we examined changes in LRP130 gene and protein expression in response to 6 weeks of sprint-interval training (SIT) in human skeletal muscle. We also investigated the relationships between changes in LRP130, SIRT3, and PGC-1α expression in response to exercise. We found that expression of these proteins was unaltered following 2 and 6 weeks of SIT, although there were significant positive relationships between changes in LRP130, PGC-1α, and SIRT3 protein content. These results suggest that the regulation of these proteins may be coordinated in human skeletal muscle. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that physiological models derived from cells and animals do not always directly translate to human physiology.</description>

   <description>Using the setting where auditors of foreign companies cross-listed on U.S. stock exchanges are subject to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection after July 19, 2004, I examine the impact of PCAOB international inspections and audit profession development (APD) on audit quality.  I hypothesize and find that PCAOB inspection access in a country is associated with a decrease in total accruals.  In countries with higher levels of APD, the first PCAOB inspections conducted in a country are associated with an incremental decrease in total and abnormal accruals.  In countries with lower levels of APD, total and abnormal accruals are incrementally smaller (less income-increasing) for the firms that have been inspected relative to the firms that are not inspected, consistent with my prediction.  The results of the going concern analysis indicate that for distressed companies in countries with low APD, the propensity to issue a going concern opinion is significantly higher after PCAOB inspection access is granted.  Contrary to my prediction, however, the propensity to issue a going concern opinion is incrementally lower for the firms that have been inspected relative to the firms that are not inspected, in low APD countries.  However, overall, the propensity to issue a going concern opinion is higher after PCAOB inspection access, the commencement of PCAOB inspections in a country, and being the inspected audit firm, as compared to the pre-PCAOB inspection access period, for distressed companies in countries with low APD.  The international inspection issue has received much regulatory attention.  The PCAOB has claimed that U.S. investors “are deprived of the potential benefits of PCAOB inspections” of the auditors in jurisdictions where PCAOB inspections are not permitted (PCAOB, 2011b).  The findings in my study provide some evidence that PCAOB international inspections are associated with one of these potential benefits, increased audit quality.</description>

   <title>Applying Statistical Process Control to Automate the Analysis of Performance Load Tests</title>

   <subject>Software Performance</subject>
   <subject>Performance Regression</subject>
   <description>Avoiding performance regressions is very important in the evolution of ultra-large software systems. Even the addition of an extra field or control statement can degrade the performance of the software system considerably as the impact of such simple changes is multiplied by the millions of user requests that are processed simultaneously. Performance testers conduct performance load tests and analyze the results of such tests, before every new deployment, to ensure that there are no performance regressions. However, such an analysis is challenging because each test run produces a large amount of performance counter (e.g., CPU and memory readings) data. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose approaches based on a statistical process control technique, called control charts, to automatically identify and determine the causes of performance regressions. We conduct case studies on three different software systems to evaluate our proposed approaches. The results show that our approaches can determine if a new test run has performance regressions. Compared to existing approaches, our approaches can detect performance regressions accurately in most of our case studies.</description>

   <title>The Role of TET2 in Macrophage Differentiation and Polarization</title>

   <description>The epigenetic regulator Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), leading to DNA demethylation. Inactivating TET2 mutations are common in myeloid cancers such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Little is known about the role of TET2 in disease-relevant monocytes/macrophages (MΦs). Therefore, our goals for this project were to characterize Tet expression during normal murine MΦ differentiation and polarization, examine the effect of Tet2-deficiency on broader MΦ polarization gene signatures, and determine the translatability of our murine findings to human MDS/CMML.&#xd;
In this thesis, we characterized the expression of Tet2 in murine MΦ differentiation and polarization. Using murine bone marrow-derived MΦs (BMMΦ), we observed that Tet2 was highly expressed in differentiated MΦs. Interestingly, differentiation-associated gene expression was not altered in Tet2-knockout BMMΦs and peritoneal MΦs (PMΦs), suggesting that Tet2 is dispensable for MΦ development. MΦ response to polarizing stimuli was then explored. Tet2 transcript levels increase early in the LPS response. The NFκB inhibitor compound BAY11-7082 was shown to abolish LPS-mediated Tet2 induction, indicating that this gene is NFκB-responsive. &#xd;
Exploring Tet2-deficiency, we characterized the phenotype of Tet2-knockout MΦs using NanoString gene expression analysis. Constitutive expression of LPS-induced genes was observed in resting state Tet2-deficient PMΦs. In particular, we noted increased Il1β and Il6, as well as the anti-inflammatory gene Arginase 1 (Arg1), in resting Tet2-deficient PMΦs and in LPS-treated Tet2-knockout BMMΦs. These results implicated Tet2 loss in the establishment of aberrant inflammation, raising the question of whether TET2-mutant MΦs participate in altering the immune microenvironment.&#xd;
Assessing immune dysregulation in TET2-mutant cells, we assayed IL1β and IL6 mRNA expression in human MDS/CMML patient samples as well as MDS/CMML-derived human MΦs. While levels of both targets were variable, some TET2-mutant cells had high IL6 expression. We also assessed ARG1 expression in MDS/CMML BM biopsies using immunohistochemical analysis. TET2 and/or DNMT3A mutations were correlated with high ARG1 staining, providing a link between ARG1 overexpression and TET2 mutations in humans. Overall, the work presented in this thesis provides a novel connection that ties TET2 lesions to the development of an inflammatory MDS/CMML local microenvironment.</description>

   <description>Opioid receptors are the sites of action for morphine and most other clinically-used opioid drugs. Abundant evidence now demonstrates that different opioid receptor types can physically associate to form heteromers. Owing to their constituent monomers’ involvement in analgesia, mu/delta opioid receptor (M/DOR) heteromers have been a particular focus of attention. Understandings of the physiological relevance of M/DOR formation remain limited in large part due to the reliance of existing M/DOR findings upon contrived heterologous systems. This thesis investigated the physiological relevance of M/DOR generation following prolonged MOR activation.&#xd;
&#xd;
To address M/DOR in endogenous tissues, suitable model systems and experimental tools were established. This included a viable dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron primary culture model, antisera specifically directed against M/DOR, a quantitative immunofluorescence colocalizational analysis method, and a floxed-Stop, FLAG-tagged DOR conditional knock-in mouse model. The development and implementation of such techniques make it possible to conduct experiments addressing the nature of M/DOR heteromers in systems with compelling physiological relevance.&#xd;
&#xd;
Seeking to both reinforce and extend existing findings from heterologous systems, it was first necessary to demonstrate the existence of M/DOR heteromers. Using antibodies directed against M/DOR itself as well as constituent monomers, M/DOR heteromers were identified in endogenous tissues and demonstrated to increase in abundance following prolonged mu opioid receptor (MOR) activation by morphine.&#xd;
&#xd;
The next experiments addressed an aspect of the functional consequences of M/DOR formation in endogenous tissues by investigating the post-internalization trafficking of delta opioid receptor (DOR) in conditions of augmented M/DOR formation. These experiments identified perturbations to DOR trafficking consistent with incorporation into a M/DOR species with probabilistic post-internalisation trafficking behaviour intermediate to that of either constituent and responsive to both MOR and DOR agonists in a manner subject to blockade by DOR antagonist.&#xd;
&#xd;
These studies provide concurrent evidence of the existence and functionality of physiologically-relevant M/DOR heteromers in endogenous tissues.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the withdrawal capacity of self-tapping screws (STS) inserted parallel-to-grain. An experimental study was conducted with 100 screws tested in total. The experimental program includes two main test series. First, withdrawal testing was conducted on screws with a diameter of 10 mm with varying embedment depths, timber density and moisture content. Strains in the screws were monitored to detect if yielding was occurring. The withdrawal resistance increase as the embedment depth increased until the screws began yielding and eventually reaching their ultimate tension capacity. The ultimate tensile capacity was consistently reached at an embedment depth of 240 mm in dry Douglas Fir, 280 mm in wet Douglas Fir and 320 mm in dry Eastern White Pine. Second, withdrawal tests were conducted on screws with a diameter of 12mm and a constant embedment depth of 280 mm with varying timber density and moisture content. Increases in moisture decreased the withdrawal resistance. The average withdrawal resistance of screws in Douglas Fir showed to more susceptible to changes in moisture content when compared to Eastern White Pine. For both screw diameters, control specimens were tested to determine the tensile capacity of the screws on their own.  The data from all the withdrawal tests was compared to three withdrawal equations: the CSA O86 equation for lag screws, the CCMC 13677-R Report equation for STSs, and the ETA-11/0196 equation for STS. In its un-factored form, the CSA O86 equation for lag screws was the best at predicting withdrawal resistance of the STSs inserted parallel-to-grain.</description>

   <description>The relationship between social and material well-being and a good state of health is not spurious. This relationship has been regarded to be a significant explanatory factor in understanding the existence of health disparities between groups of people. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently created its own tool for measuring social and health inequities called the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART). Unlike most other Area-Based Deprivation Indices (ABDIs), the Urban HEART includes indicators for physical environment and infrastructure, population health, and governance and civic engagement. In this way, the tool stands out as a sui generis ABDI that expands the traditional model of how social and health inequities are measured. The Centre for Research in Inner City Health has since adapted the tool to fit the context of Canada’s largest city: Toronto, Ontario. This study will apply the Urban HEART@Toronto methodology in a medium-size city in Canada: Kingston, Ontario. The intention is to not only map out the social and health inequities within the city, but to critically investigate the methodology’s effectiveness and suitability in a medium-size city context, as compared with other ABDIs. With this information, the research will be able to speak to whether or not the Urban HEART@Toronto methodology is a more valuable tool for measuring social and health inequities than the alternatives.</description>

   <description>The mechanisms by which dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is involved in incentive learning produced by rewarding stimuli remain unclear. Recently, Wnt signalling has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Functional interactions between Wnt and dopamine (DA) signalling has been demonstrated using in vitro and tissue physiology approaches, however there remains a lack of in vivo research into the involvement of Wnt in DA-mediated learning in behaving animals. The present study assessed the role of Wnt signalling in DA-mediated incentive learning using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. I hypothesized that inhibition of Wnt with intra-NAc microinjections of the Wnt palmitoylation inhibitor IWP-2 will dose-dependently block the acquisition and expression of amphetamine (AMPH)-induced CPP in rats. Intra-NAc IWP-2 (0.001, 0.05, 1.0 but not 0.0001 μg/0.5 μl/side) prior to conditioning with AMPH (20.0 μg/0.5 μl/side) blocked acquisition of CPP. Intra-NAc IWP-2 (0.05, 0.5, 1.0 but not 0.001 μg/0.5 μl/side) during test following conditioning with AMPH blocked expression but at a higher dose than was need to block acquisition. Sensitization of locomotor activity to AMPH was observed during conditioning and this effect was blocked in groups given IWP-2 prior to AMPH. However, intra-NAc IWP-2 during conditioning did not block the locomotor stimulant effects of AMPH. These results implicate Wnt in DA-mediated incentive learning and suggest that Wnt signalling may be more important for the acquisition of CPP than for its expression. Mechanisms by which Wnt and DA signalling pathways interact to influence DA-mediated reward-related learning remain to be elucidated.</description>

   <description>This dissertation draws from certain recent accounts of action, action explanation and reasons to illuminate our conceptions of practical reasoning, fallibility, expertise, virtues, advising, and practical intelligence. My thesis is that, in the course of her ongoing acting, an agent can respond to evaluative features by deliberately adjusting her acting, and that this represents a form of practical reasoning that casts significant light on the nature of action, the practice of advising, and on the prospects for Aristotelian naturalism more generally. The majority of the dissertation is devoted to articulating and defending this idea.&#xd;
&#xd;
I proceed by first describing Michael Thompson’s, John McDowell’s, and Jonathan Dancy’s work in action theory, thus providing context and introducing central ideas. Chapter Two responds to Bernard Williams’s concerns about the role of virtues in first-personal deliberation by defending a novel, but controversial, conception of practical reasoning. Chapter Three asks and answers the question of how we should understand the nature of the evaluative features and our responsiveness to them in exercises of practical intelligence, and supports the general account of knowledge of goodness developed by those who claim goodness is attributive. Chapter Four defends the positions that practical reasoning can conclude in acting and can take the form of fully absorbed acting, replying to Joseph Raz, John Broome, and Hubert Dreyfus’ arguments to the contrary. Chapter Five examines how, in a way analogous to testimony, giving advice can convey practical knowledge and argues that advising’s greater action-guiding potential lies in the cultivation of understanding and practical intelligence. Chapter Six presents and criticizes Judith Thomson’s views on how evaluative features inform practical reasoning and advising, contrasting her in-respects-similar positions with this dissertation. The work concludes by considering McDowell and Williams’ objections to Aristotelian naturalism and reflecting on how the dissertation’s achievements might change one’s assessment of the position.</description>
