   <description>KIT receptor (CD117) is a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for homeostasis of mast cells (MCs) in tissues and recruitment to sites of inflammation and tumors in response to its ligand Stem cell factor (SCF). Gain of function mutations in KIT (e.g. D816V) are frequently observed in systemic mastocytosis and other cancer types. Src Homology 2 domain containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2 or PTPN11) is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that promotes cell proliferation, survival and motility in multiple pathways and cell types. To study SHP2 function in MCs, we generated novel MC-specific Shp2 knock-out (KO) mice (MC-shp2 KO). These mice had reduced numbers of MCs in skin and peritoneum, and defective contact hypersensitivity responses compared to control mice, consistent with SHP2 promoting MC homeostasis.  Using an inducible SHP2 KO bone marrow-derived MC (BMMC) culture model, we found that SHP2 KO cells were prone to apoptosis and had no MC repopulating activity in vivo. Mechanistically, SHP2 enhanced ERK activation and downregulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bim.  SHP2 KO BMMCs also had defects in chemotaxis towards SCF, due to impaired activation of a Lyn/Vav/Rac pathway in SHP2 KO BMMCs. This correlated with defects in cell spreading, and F-actin polymerization in response to SCF. Treatment of BMMCs with a SHP2 inhibitor (II-B08) also led to reduced chemotaxis, consistent with SHP2 phosphatase activity being required for KIT-induced chemotaxis. Lastly, we tested whether SHP2 regulates oncogenic KIT signaling using a P815 mouse mastocytoma model. Stable silencing of SHP2 in P815 cells led to reduced cell growth and survival in vitro, and less aggressive systemic mastocytosis development in syngeneic mice. Overall, these studies identify SHP2 as a key node in SCF/KIT and oncogenic KIT pathways, and as a potential therapeutic target in several human diseases.</description>

   <description>To meet the very high data rate requirements for wireless Internet and multimedia services, cooperative systems with multiple antennas have been proposed for future generation wireless systems.&#xd;
In this thesis, we focus on multiple antennas at the source, relay and destination. We study both downlink and uplink cooperative systems with single antenna relays. For downlink systems, the optimal precoder to minimize the sum transmit power subject to quality of service (QoS) constraints with fixed relay weights is derived. We also study the optimization of relay weights with a fixed precoder. An iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the precoder and relay weights.&#xd;
The performance of the downlink system with imperfect CSI as well as multiple receive antennas is also studied. For the uplink system, we similarly derive the optimum receiver as in the downlink with fixed relay weights. The optimization of relay weights for a fixed receiver is then studied. An iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the receiver and relay weights in the uplink. Systems with imperfect channel estimation are also considered.&#xd;
The study of cooperative MIMO systems is then extended to a multi-cell scenario. In particular, two scenarios are studied. In the first, the cells coordinate their beamformers to find the most suitable cell to serve a specific user. In the second, each base station selectively transmits to a fixed group of users, and the cells coordinate to suppress mutual interference.&#xd;
Finally, our investigation culminates with a study of an uplink cooperative system equipped with multi-antenna relays under a capacity maximization criterion. The specific scheme that users access the base station through a single multi-antenna relay are studied. Iterative capacity maximization algorithm are proposed and shown to converge to local maxima. Numerical results are presented to highlight that the algorithms are able to come close to these bounds after only a few iterations.</description>

   <description>Deal or no deal? Hold ‘em or fold ‘em? Buy, hold or sell? When faced with uncertainty, a wise decision-maker evaluates each option and chooses the one they deem most valuable. Scientists studying decision making processes have spent much theoretical and experimental effort formalizing a framework that captures how decision makers can maximize the amount of subjective value they accrue from such decisions. This thesis tested two hypotheses. The first was that subjective value guides our simplest and most common of motor actions similar to how it guides more deliberative economic decisions. The second was that subjective value is allocated across pre-motor regions of the brain to make our actions more efficient.  To accomplish these goals, I adapted a paradigm used by behavioural economists for use in neurophysiological experiments in non-human primates. In our task, monkeys repeatedly make quick, orienting eye movements, known as saccades, to targets, which they learned through experience, had different values.  In support of the hypothesis that subjective value influences simple motor actions, the speed with which monkeys responded, known as saccadic reaction time (SRT), and their saccadic choices to valued targets were highly correlated and therefore both acted as a behavioural measures of subjective value. Two complimentary results support the hypothesis that subjective value influences activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SCi) – a well-studied brain region important to the planning and execution of saccades - to produce efficient actions.  First, when saccades were elicited with microstimulation, we found that the timing and spatial allocation of pre-saccadic activity in the SC was shaped by subjective value.  Second, the baseline preparatory activity and transient visual activity of SCi neurons prior to saccade generation was also influenced by subjective value.  Our results can be incorporated into existing models of SC functioning that use dynamic neural field theory. I suggest that saccades of higher subjective value will result in higher activation of their associated neural field such that they will be more likely and more quickly selected.   In summary, this thesis demonstrates that subjective value influences neural mechanisms, not only for deliberative decision making, but also for the efficient selection of simple motor actions.</description>

   <title>The Price of Loyalty: A Gendered Analysis of Consumer Surveillance</title>

   <description>Consumer surveillance, seen in the social sorting capabilities of loyalty marketing, is gendered. Using Canadian examples, gender is added to the existing literature on social sorting in relation to class (Burrows and Gane 2006; Parker, Uprichard and Burrows 2007) and racial or ethnic background (Gandy 1993; 1996; 2006a; 2006b; 2010; 2011). The prevalence of loyalty programs in Canada raises some significant issues regarding social sorting, as they tend to allocate unequal life chances and choices based on certain aspects of individuals’ profiles, allowing retailers to focus their efforts and resources toward their most desirable clientele. It is important to consider the role that gender plays in loyalty marketing in order to understand how being labelled a ‘man’ or a ‘woman’ can influence how one’s personal information is categorized and utilized by companies. As these programs use data mining and social sorting techniques to attract preferred customers, men and women are targeted in different ways by different loyalty marketing schemes, depending on the perceived value of their digitized profiles. The findings of the 2006 Globalization of Personal Data survey are interrogated for a background analysis of gender and loyalty. A statistical analysis of the Canadian responses investigates whether membership rates and popular attitudes about loyalty programs vary significantly between different demographic groups.</description>

   <title>Assessing strategies for managing drug resistance in treatment of infectious disease: insights from queueing theory</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-02 15:23:55.906</description>
   <description>Antimicrobials have been instrumental in the treatment of infectious disease: responsible for worldwide infection control and reductions in disease-induced morbidity, and mortality. However, in every case where new chemotherapeutic agents have been introduced, resistance to them has eventually evolved. Principally, the current strategy for dealing with this problem is to invest heavily in drug development, with the hope that new drugs become available before all existing drugs lose their efficacy. Instead of focusing on the ‘development side’ of the problem, another possible strategy is to invest in methods of slowing evolution of resistance.&#xd;
We use a novel application of queueing theory to demonstrate that, when comparing equivalent changes in drug development versus evolution management, the latter has a much greater effect on ensuring a continued supply of effective antimicrobial agents. Our results therefore call for a reappraisal of the current emphasis on enhancing drug development as a means of managing resistance.</description>

   <description>There is compelling evidence for the effectiveness of home-based occupational therapy and physiotherapy rehabilitation for community dwelling elderly who may struggle with basic activities and the functions of daily living and mobility.  Nonetheless, an estimated 2% of home care’s elderly clients receive these therapies. Ontario’s home care data indicates that 78% of clients that could benefit from these specific therapies are not receiving them.&#xd;
The study examined a subset of elderly clients receiving home care following a hospital discharge during 2009-2010. The aim of this study was to: understand the difference between those home care clients who received occupational therapy or physiotherapy and those who did not; and determine if receiving these therapies impacted the utilization of hospital emergency departments and inpatient admissions. A retrospective cohort design and multivariate and survival analysis of hospital and home care administrative data structured the study. &#xd;
Results suggest that home-based rehabilitation is offered to a minority of the home care population. Distinct client characteristics and process variables significantly associated with the increased likelihood of receiving home-based occupational and physical therapies included: clients who were older, females, admitted to home care from hospital inpatient units, assessed as non-acute for clinical and service needs and required more home making support and assistance with activities of daily living. &#xd;
	Almost one quarter of the total sample returned to hospital. Visits to emergency departments accounted for the greater part of hospital utilization and primarily for sub-acute general symptoms and signs, post-procedural complications, infections or acute episodes from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal failure. Slightly over half of the clients returning to hospital did not receive home-based rehabilitation. &#xd;
Clients who received occupational therapy returned to the hospital sooner following their home care admission whereas clients receiving physiotherapy spent the longest time before rehospitalizing. The majority of the clients receiving occupational therapy were admitted to home care having just resolved sub-acute conditions or symptoms, many of which are known to influence functional and physical decline. Moreover, analysis of process variables indicated that the wait time for a referral to occupational therapy was two times longer compared to physiotherapy. These same clients also waited, on average, over one month before an occupational therapist’s first visit. &#xd;
The need to discriminate who receives home-based rehabilitation is essential to understanding how specific therapies contribute to improving systems outcomes. This study is the first examination that focuses specifically on home-based occupational therapy and physiotherapy rehabilitation and the client characteristics and process variables associated with receiving/not receiving these therapies and the impact these factors have on the time-to-rehospitalization.</description>

   <description>In Western cultures, social significations are associated with body weight and shape (Woolf, 1990, as cited by Malson, 1998). Thinness is especially valued and especially for women and girls. As a result, many teenage girls aim to be thinner.  This thesis examines five blogs on the website LiveJournal that are written by teenage girls who perceive themselves as overweight and who use blogs to talk about their attempts to lose weight. All five of these girls say that they practice at least one extreme method of weight loss and all of them have dangerously low weight loss goals. Two research questions motivated this study: 1) how do teenage girls who perceive themselves as overweight use blogs in their journeys to lose weight? 2) Can LiveJournal, or any other personal blogging site, provide a useful source for researchers so that they can learn about eating disorders in girls’ own words? The blogs provided a tool by which I could discover first-hand experiences of teenage girls who are trying to lose weight. Essentially, the blogs were used as both the data and the mean by which the data was collected. My results suggest that girls rarely discuss their weight loss practices with family or friends and thus their blogs provide a space where they can share their experiences and receive support and encouragement from other members of their online community who will not judge or stigmatize them. The results of this study are useful for social science researchers in two ways. First, the results provide important information pertaining to first-personal narratives about body image, weight loss and the practice of extreme methods of weight loss by teenage girls who perceive themselves as overweight. Second, the results provide useful information for social researchers seeking to use blog research for their projects. This project highlights the benefits of blog research and provides a sort of how-to for future researchers hoping to use the method.</description>

   <description>We study stochastic stability for a class of agreement dynamics and define two forms&#xd;
of agreement which we call stochastic agreement and stochastic absolute agreement.&#xd;
We identify conditions for a broad class of random, possibly state-dependent agreement processes to achieve stochastic agreement. We take the approach of applying Lyapunov drift criteria to study the behaviour of such processes. We generalize some results in the literature to the noisy and state-dependent case.</description>

   <description>Elucidating the process by which an animal can transduce a brief signal into a predictable set of behaviours has important implications for understanding brain function.  I explored the transition from quiescence to repetitive activity in the bag cell neurons of Aplysia californica.  Using both cultured neurons and intact ganglia, I demonstrated the involvement of cholinergic transmission in this marked change to excitability. &#xd;
The bag cell neurons are a group of 200-400 electrically-coupled neuroendocrine cells that initiate a set of prescribed reproductive behaviours, culminating in deposition of an egg mass.  This fixed action pattern, lasting ~1 h, follows a brief (≤10-sec) stimulus from an afferent input to the bag cell neuron cluster, which causes these previously silent neurons to continuously fire for ~30 min.  Central to the maintenance of this increased excitability, are the elevation of various second messenger pathways that modulate multiple ion channels.  As such, the initiating stimulus for afterdischarge generation was thought to involve metabotropic receptors.  However, I report that an acetylcholine-gated ionotropic current triggers the afterdischarge, as well as two, distinct nicotinic responses that participate in excitability: one associated with channel opening and the other through the inhibition of K+ currents. &#xd;
My data suggest that the interplay between inward Ca2+ and cation currents, and outward K+ channels, regulated by intracellular messengers protein kinase C (PKC) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), respectively, set the baseline level of excitability prior to cholinergic activation.  I also observed, distinct negative-feedback mechanisms on the acetylcholine ionotropic current.  First, an increase in cAMP inhibits the cholinergic current shortly after the start of the afterdischarge, and once the afterdischarge is fully underway, dephosphorylation by a Src family tyrosine kinase further inhibits the channel.  In addition, FMRFamide, an afterdischarge suppressor, appears to directly block the cholinergic channel. &#xd;
By exploring both canonical and non-canonical cholinergic roles in the afterdischarge, I have determined that complex signalling pathways can be reduced to a single variable, provided that the necessary precursors are in place.  Furthermore, based on post-synaptic receptor composition and regulation, my work indicates the potential for profound diversity in cholinergic pathways.</description>

   <description>This study, contextualized within the critical debate on Shakespearean dramatic character, examines how the “character effect”— or the audience’s impression of a character’s ontological reality— is produced. Approaching character from the perspective of linguistic pragmatics, I contend that character effects are produced by the counterpoint between characters’ pragmatic use of language and the allegorical meanings that underpin characters’ utterances in a theatrical context. These allegorical meanings, which Shakespeare conveys through his characters to the audience, dialogically interact with characters’ textually or historically scripted roles and converge with their speech to create the impression that characters control language and have extra-textual lives of their own. I thus demonstrate that the interiority ascribed to character is a function of its anteriority. Following the introductory chapter, which lays out the critical history of Shakespearean character and a pragmatic methodology, each of the remaining chapters explores the particular speech habits of a complex and larger-than-life Shakespearean character who is also a self-conscious user of language. Chapter 2 examines how Falstaff’s conversational implicatures produce the character effect of his vitality. Chapter 3 looks at how Cleopatra’s performative use of report creates her sexual charisma. Chapter 4 focuses on how Henry V’s rhetorical argumentation works to create the effect of his moral ambivalence.</description>

   <description>Program evaluation is a form of systematic inquiry designed to meet the needs of those who are working on or who are responsible for a program. One challenge faced by the field of evaluation is responding to the increasing complexity of social programing and diverse informational needs. Methodological innovation is a trait of the field of program evaluation that provides opportunity for responding to challenge faced by the field. Evaluation orientations that rely on qualitative methodologies, which seek to describe, to understand or to interpret complex phenomena are potential sites for arts-informed inquiry. Arts-informed inquiry draws from creative strategies in the arts, where art is produced for the sake of inquiry. Accordingly, through this research I adopt dual roles of evaluator and researcher, to gather empirical evidence about the power of integrating arts-informed inquiry into frameworks for evaluation. In this research, I document how arts-informed inquiry draws from artistic processes to broaden perceptions, make meaningful contributions, and expand evaluator skills. Specifically, the potential for arts-informed inquiry in evaluation is investigated by conducting an evaluation of one program, in one school district. Analysis of this two-phase process occurred by applying a heuristic of three groupings of key concepts within the field of evaluation: methods, values and use. In doing so, I provide a detailed description of the potential for arts-informed inquiry within one program evaluation. This study provides a transparent account of the inquiry process to document the implications for undertaking arts-informed inquiry in program evaluation. In addition, there are theoretical implications for the field of evaluation when they consider the process and representations shaped by inclusion of arts-informed inquiry.</description>

   <description>The Prairie Creek Mine, NWT, is a non-producing Zn-Pb-Ag mine located within the Mackenzie Mountains. The 320 km2 area is surrounded by the Nahanni National Park Reserve, and is found approximately 40 km upstream of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Geochemical characterization of weathered material in the area is useful from both an exploration geochemistry and environmental geochemistry perspective. This investigation attempted to characterize geochemical and mineralogical controls on metal mobility in natural and manufactured environments. Surface waters and sediments were sampled, analyzed, and interpreted. Detailed mineralogical analyses were also performed, including SEM, XRD, and synchrotron-based µXRF and µXRD. &#xd;
Prairie Creek contains sulphide and supergene mineralization hosted in carbonate rocks, which supply the area with a high pH, as well as a wealth of alkalinity and buffering capacity. This study aims to provide some insight as to the geochemical and mineralogical controls on the weathering processes which may enhance or inhibit mobility of metals downstream of known mineralization. Results show that the metals are found in much higher concentration in the stream sediments than in the stream waters. Pb and Zn show the highest concentrations, and Zn appears to be more mobile than Pb. Based on water versus sediment chemistry, it may be possible to differentiate between mineralization types. Dissolution textures and alteration of detrital grains indicates that chemical weathering does occur within the streams and releases metals to the aqueous environment, though they are likely quickly attenuated through adsorption or co-precipitation.&#xd;
The mine site hosts a historic ore stockpile and waste rock pile, established in the early 1980’s. Geochemical characterization of the reactions occurring within these piles and of the mineralogical controls on metal mobility can contribute to the mitigation of risk from leachate. Metal concentrations are variable and do not support a trend, which indicates that metal mobility within these piles may be attributed to micro-environments. There appears to be a trend in increasing alkalinity and decreasing sulphate towards the bottom of the piles.&#xd;
Therefore, metals appear to have limited mobility in the studied environments, although small scale chemical reactions are occurring which may release and attenuate metals.&#xd;

   <description>Individuals experiencing a mental illness are often stigmatized. Children also stigmatize those who experience a mental illness. There is national interest in reducing the negative effects of stigma, especially in children. Unfortunately, children anti-stigma interventions are being used without being empirically tested for their effectiveness. A goal of the Opening Minds Anti-stigma initiative of the Mental Health Commission of Canada is to identify programs and resources that have been empirically tested and found to be effective in reducing stigma. This study was funded by the Opening Minds Initiative of the Mental Health Commission of Canada to: First, investigate the effectiveness of providing children ages 11-14 with mental illness education using a storybook in order to reduce their mental illness stigma; and, second, to examine children’s perceptions of the anti-stigma book used to provide the education.&#xd;
A quasi-experimental design was used to test the effectiveness of the mental illness educational storybook in reducing mental illness stigma. The Youth Opinion Survey for Stereotype and Social Distance measurement was used to obtain baseline information before the education was provided. A pre-test, post-test process was used.&#xd;
Several qualitative questions, embedded in the post-test questionnaire, were provided to the children participating with an opportunity to use their own words to describe what they thought about mental illness before and after the education, what they learned from the educational storybook and whether or not they liked the education they received. &#xd;
	The results show that the exposure to an educational storybook about children mental illness stigma was effective in reducing the percentage of negative responses at post-test. The participants used less negative words to describe someone “with a mental illness”. An improvement in the overall scores at post-test was seen for both stereotype and social distance.&#xd;
	After the study was completed, the feasibility of conducting a study of this type was evaluated. Recommendations for the possibility of using this method for future studies are included.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-03 00:36:53.142</description>
   <description>This thesis applies concepts and techniques in geography in order to contribute to our understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with the transition toward renewable energy.  The work is best understood as the sum of two parts.  In the first part, the methodological and philosophical underpinnings of the field of energy geography are explored in order to situate the research in the broader constellation of geographical practices surrounding energy.  I make the case that energy transitions are not merely shifts in energy supply but are also simultaneously fundamental shifts in prevailing spatial relations, so that energy transition management is best conceived as a spatial strategy with emphasis on regional level land-energy planning.  In the second part of the thesis, I aim to provide decision support in favour of this spatial strategy.  This begins in Chapter 4 with a comprehensive critical review of how GIScience and remote sensing has been applied in RE assessments and spatial planning.  The next three chapters engage key gaps in this literature and are the analytical contributions of the thesis.  The focus of the research is on biomass and solar energy in (eastern) Ontario.  In Chapter 5 I develop geographically explicit supply-cost curves for forestry and agricultural biomass and assess the relative merits of a mixed biomass feedstock stream.  In Chapter 6 I recognize and address the issue that developers of dedicated bioenergy crops and ground-mount solar PV systems prefer the same type of land.  Land-energy trade-offs are modeled and their implications in the context of incentivizing RE development are discussed.  In Chapter 7 I explore ways in which targeted facility siting can capture ancillary benefits related to RE production.  I argue that focusing on the benefits as well as the costs of system siting is critical to linking developer and public interests.  Ontario’s feed-in tariff program is evaluated in the light of this claim.  Chapter 8 concludes with a summary of key findings and describes the ways in which this thesis can be used as a platform upon which a broader research program can be raised.</description>

   <description>Lady Health Workers (LHWs) are community health workers who work under the Pakistani government’s National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Health Care, and provide basic medication, contraceptives, and nutrition and prenatal advice to expectant mothers. LHWs are a pivotal bridge between mothers, especially those who live in traditional households, and medical practitioners and policymakers. Several studies indicate that LHWs have been instrumental in decreasing maternal and infant mortality rates, lowering the incidence of tuberculosis in urban and rural populations, and treating depression among patients.  In addition, they conduct vaccination campaigns including the WHO-supervised polio campaign. &#xd;
Since 2007 tensions have emerged between LHWs and the government regarding pay and working conditions. The LHWs have staged sit-ins, demonstrations as well as a march to the capital to highlight their plight and demand better working conditions from the government. This has resulted in disruptions in vaccination and awareness campaigns. Reports suggest that a higher morale amongst workers translates to higher productivity and more effective work results. Thus, understanding the issues affecting LHWs is essential to a more productive health care work force. By analyzing the dynamics underpinning the relationship between LHWs, the Pakistani government, and the community, policymakers can obtain a better understanding of how the intersecting influences of gender, culture and spaces impact the implementation of health care policies. This analysis could also shed light on the issue of worker retention in the medical field. &#xd;
Drawing from a series of semi-structured interviews conducted over a four-month period in the Pakistani city of Karachi, I analyse how LHWs view their work in relation to gender, agency, self-worth and human security in an urban setting. In addition, I locate the workers’ experiences within neocolonial and postcolonial systems. &#xd;
Findings indicate that while LHWs are extremely devoted to their work, a lack of security, compounded by irregular pay and gender discrimination, has contributed to low morale. The masculine and hierarchal systems LHWs operate within have contributed to the workers’ struggle to be recognised professionally.  In addition, international development organisations’ agendas and government policies have had unintended and often negative consequences on LHWs’ morale and experiences.</description>

   <description>Total weekly moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) accumulated in different patterns has not been well studied: it is not yet known whether sporadic MVPA (periods of &lt;10 consecutive minutes) or whether the weekly frequency of MVPA is associated with health benefits in adults. For this reason, the physical activity guidelines recommend that adults aged 18 to 64 years accumulate at least 150 minutes of MVPA per week in bouts of at least 10 minutes. The overall objective of this thesis was therefore to study the relationships between different patterns of MVPA and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) – a clustering of risk factors that increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adults.&#xd;
Both manuscripts in this thesis used data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), a nationally-representative sample of Canadians. The MetS was determined from direct physical measurements and blood samples, while physical activity levels were assessed by accelerometers (also known as activity monitors). Complex statistical models were used to determine the relationship between patterns of MVPA and the MetS.&#xd;
The first study assessed whether bouted MVPA was associated with lower odds for MetS than an equal volume of sporadic MVPA. Results showed that both bouted and sporadic MVPA were equally related to the MetS; even small bursts of sporadic MVPA &lt;3 minutes in length were meaningful when predicting the MetS. The second study evaluated whether more frequent weekly MVPA was associated with lower odds for the MetS in physically active adults. Among those who were considered physically active, there was no difference in the odds of the MetS between those who were infrequently or frequently active. Together, the results of this thesis suggest that the pattern in which weekly MVPA is accumulated is unimportant, provided that sufficient energy is expended.</description>

   <description>This thesis involves three essays that explore the theory and application of econometric analysis to labour market interventions.  One essay is methodological, and two essays are applications.  The first essay contributes to the literature on inference with data sets containing within-cluster correlation.  The essay highlights a problem with current practices when the number of clusters is 11 or fewer.  Current practices can result in p-values that are not point identified but are instead p-value intervals. The chapter provides Monte Carlo evidence to support a proposed solution to this problem.  &#xd;
The second essay analyzes a labour market intervention within Canada--the Youth Hires program--which aimed to reduce youth unemployment.  We find evidence that the program was able to increase employment among the targeted group.  However, the impacts are only present for males, and we find evidence of displacement effects amongst the non-targeted group. The third essay examines a set of Graduate Retention Programs that several Canadian provinces offer.  These programs are aimed at mitigating future skill shortages.  Once the solution proposed in the first essay is applied, I find little evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in attracting or retaining recent graduates.</description>

   <description>Deficient trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling are associated with pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR). Using a model in which pregnant Wistar rats are given daily, low-dose, injections of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 – 40 µg/kg) on gestational days (GD) 13.5 – 16.5, our group has shown that abnormal maternal inflammation is causally linked to shallow trophoblast invasion, deficient spiral artery remodeling, and altered utero-placental hemodynamics leading to FGR/PE; these alterations were shown to be mediated by TNF-a. The present research evaluated certain consequences of decreased placental perfusion; this was accomplished by examining placental alterations indicative of decreased placental perfusion. Additionally, the role of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was determined as a potential therapeutic to prevent the consequences of decreased placental perfusion. Results indicated that dams experiencing heightened maternal inflammation showed significantly greater expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and nitrotyrosine, both of which are markers of decreased perfusion and oxidative/nitrosative stress. Contrary to expectations, inflammation did not appear to affect nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, as revealed by a lack of change in placental or plasma levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). However, continuous transdermal administration of GTN (25 µg/hr) on GD 12.5 – 16.5 prevented the accumulation of HIF-1a and nitrotyrosine in placentas from LPS-treated rats. These results support the concept that maternal inflammation contributes to placental hypoxia and oxidative/nitrosative stress. Additionally, they indicate that GTN has potential applications in the treatment and/or prevention of pregnancy complications associated with abnormal maternal inflammation.</description>

   <subject>Euro, Italy, Europe,</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-08 17:05:52.57</description>
   <description>The present work utilizes both quantitative and qualitative techniques to extract the cognitive and affective elements of national identity from political discourse. However, a focus on national identity tends to depict the group as undifferentiated, obscuring the significant diversity which exists within the political community, at least in terms of how political objects are interpreted. Accordingly, another objective of this work is to investigate the diversity of interpretative schemes among different classes of individuals in the same political community. Another key argument is that discourses obscure undesirable political realities, domestic and international, at least temporarily. Apropos this thesis, the euro was sold by some elements of the ruling class in miraculous terms, as some sort of ‘savior’ that would solve all of Italy’s problems. This obscured the fact that only Italians, and not the euro, could lead to the real and sustained political and economic modernization that Italians desire. In the international sphere, the euro was sold as a policy that would help end Italy’s marginalization in Europe of second-class status (compared to the first-class status enjoyed by Germany, France, and the UK). This obscured the fact that the determinants of status in the international system are rooted in other variables, most of which have little to do with whether a country adopts a common currency like the euro. The case study to explore the validity of these arguments is the European Monetary Union (EMU), specifically, the links between national politics and EMU. Two countries were selected: Italy, which initially wholeheartedly supported EMU, and the UK, which overwhelmingly rejected the common currency from its inception in 1999.</description>

   <description>Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in Canadian women. Aggressive BCs (e.g. triple-negative subtype; TN) present a clinical challenge as defined biomarkers, particularly those indicative of unique cancer-associated signaling pathways, are needed to improve prognostication and prediction of therapeutic response. Overexpression of Src and its substrates, Ezrin and Tks5, have been associated with poor prognosis in many cancers. We have previously shown that Ezrin regulates proteolytic-independent invasion, while others have shown that Tks5 is associated with proteolytic-dependent invasion. Thus, expression of Ezrin versus Tks5 in BC cases may represent different invasion modalities. Additionally, immunofluorescence (IF)-based technologies may provide a more quantitative and objective approach for analysis of biomarker expression and subcellular compartmentalization compared to immunohistochemistry (IHC). In this study, I hypothesize that expression and subcellular localization of Src, Ezrin and Tks5, have improved prognostic significance in BCs, compared to current clinico-pathological parameters. To assess this, I optimized an IF-based automated quantification analysis (AQUA) system to measure subcellular expression in a 63-patient BC cohort and tested associations with clinico-pathological data. This thesis presents that: 1) Expression of Src and Ezrin increased, but that of Tks5 decreased in breast tumours compared to normal breast. 2) Src and Ezrin localized to the apical regions of normal breast epithelia but shifted to the cytoplasm in breast tumours. Tks5 exhibited a granular basal expression in normal breast epithelia, and is weakly expressed in tumour cellular compartments. 3) In our 63-patient cohort, Src and Ezrin had significant correlations with multiple clinico-pathological parameters, including TN status and lymphovascular invasion. 4) Clinico-pathological associations with IF-based AQUA scoring are directly comparable to conventional manual IHC scoring. Our study supports the role of Src and Ezrin as potential prognostic biomarkers for BC.</description>

   <description>Pain is a remarkably complex and a multifaceted process, involving the interaction between physiological and psychological factors in unique ways. Among many other factors, the size of the affected surface area contributes to the pain experience, altering one’s pain perception. Spatial summation is the term used to describe this phenomenon, and is characterized by an increase in pain perception, or a decrease in pain threshold, when the affected surface area is increased. This project investigated the neuronal processes underlying spatial summation of heat sensations in healthy female volunteers, by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the central nervous system. The first study of this project involved increasing the surface area of skin stimulated by manipulating the number of thermal probes delivering thermal stimulation, which was delivered just below participants’ measured pain threshold. Surface area was increased on one hand and across two hands to determine the extent of spatial summation, and furthermore, to determine the effect on neural activity in the spinal cord and brainstem. The second study of this project involved increasing the surface area of skin stimulated by a noxious heat stimulus and its effect on pain perception and corresponding neural activity in the spinal cord, brainstem, and brain. Results from this project suggest that the central mechanisms contributing to the spatial summation of heat sensations involve many of many of the brainstem and brain regions involved in processing the emotional, motivational, and cognitive aspects of pain. Therefore, increasing the surface area of stimulation may alter pain perception by influencing the affective dimension of the sensation, rather than the sensory/discriminatory component. The combination of such structures may interact in a unique way to protect the body from potential, or further damage, by increasing the perception of pain through emotional, motivational and cognitive mechanisms.</description>

   <description>The majority of Canadian youth are not obtaining the recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity. These low activity levels may be partially explained by students’ physical self-efficacy in that cross-sectional research demonstrates a correlation between physical self-efficacy and children’s physical activity; however, school interventions focused on this relationship show limited success. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, the purpose of this two-phase mixed method study was to better understand the relationship between Grade 5/6 students’ physical self-efficacy and physical activity levels. In Phase 1 of the study, 243 students from a rural British Columbia school district completed a questionnaire on their physical self-efficacy and free-time physical activity. Results from this survey were analyzed using ANOVA to examine differences in free-time physical activity between groups based on physical self-efficacy, transport to school, access to facilities, and gender. Physical self-efficacy was found to be the only factor to demonstrate significant differences with high self-efficacious students generally participating in more free-time physical activity than low self-efficacious students. &#xd;
For Phase 2 of this study, 10 participants indicating high physical activity levels, .50 SD above the mean, half demonstrating low physical self-efficacy and half demonstrating high physical self-efficacy, were selected for individual interviews to examine rationales for being active. Analysis of these qualitative data revealed similarities and differences between the high and low physical self-efficacy groups in three motivational themes: sources of self-efficacy; sources of pleasure; and personal priorities and ideologies. These findings highlight the complexity of physical activity participation in youth and provide support for interventions that encourage physical self-efficacy enhancement and outcome-expectancy attainment.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-12 13:48:59.849</description>
   <description>This thesis deals with the Shannon-theoretic fundamental limits of channel coding for&#xd;
single-user channels with memory and feedback and for multi-user channels with side information. We first consider the feedback capacity of a class of symmetric channels with memory modelled as  nite-state Markov channels. The symmetry yields the existence of a hidden Markov noise process that facilitates the channel description as a function of input and noise, where the function satisfies a desirable invertibility property. We show that feedback does not increase capacity for such class of finite-state channels and that both their non-feedback and feedback capacities are achieved by an independent and uniformly distributed input. As a result, the capacity is given as a difference of output and noise entropy rates, where the output is also a hidden Markov process; hence, capacity can be approximated via well known algorithms.&#xd;
We then consider the memoryless state-dependent multiple-access channel (MAC) where the encoders and the decoder are provided with various degrees of asymmetric noisy channel state information (CSI). For the case where the encoders observe causal, asymmetric noisy CSI and the decoder observes complete CSI, inner and outer bounds to the capacity region, which are tight for the sum-rate capacity, are provided. Next, single-letter characterizations for the channel capacity regions under each of the following settings are established: (a) the CSI at the encoders are non-causal and asymmetric deterministic functions of the CSI at the decoder (b) the encoders observe asymmetric noisy CSI with asymmetric delays and the decoder observes complete CSI; (c) a degraded message set scenario with asymmetric noisy CSI at the encoders and complete and/or noisy CSI at the decoder.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, we consider the above state-dependent MAC model and identify what is required to be provided to the receiver in order to get a tight converse for the sum-rate capacity. Inspired by the coding schemes of the lossless CEO problem as well as of a recently proposed achievable region, we provide an inner bound which demonstrates the rate required to transmit this information to the receiver.</description>

   <title>On the Optimality of the Hamming Metric for Decoding Block Codes over Binary Additive Noise Channels</title>

   <description>Most of the basic concepts of algebraic coding theory are derived for the memoryless binary symmetric channel. These concepts do not necessarily hold for time-varying channels or for channels with memory. However, errors in real-life channels seem to occur in bursts rather than independently, suggesting that these channels exhibit some statistical dependence or memory. Nonetheless, the same algebraic codes are still commonly used in current communication systems that employ interleaving to spread channel error bursts over the set of received codewords to make the channel appear memoryless to the block decoder. This method suffers from immediate shortcomings as it fails to exploit the channel’s memory while adding delay to the system. We study optimal maximum likelihood block decoding of binary codes sent over several binary additive channels with infinite and finite memory. We derive conditions on general binary codes and channels parameters under which maximum likelihood and minimum distance decoding are equivalent. The channels considered in this work are the infinite and finite memory Polya contagion channels, the queue-based channel, and the Gilbert-Elliott channel. We also present results on the optimality of classical perfect and quasi-perfect codes when used over the aforementioned channels under maximum likelihood decoding.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-17 15:46:54.442</description>
   <description>This dissertation adds to the literature on least squares model averaging by studying and extending current least squares model averaging techniques. The first chapter reviews existing literature and discusses the contributions of this dissertation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second chapter proposes a new estimator for least squares model averaging. A model average estimator is a weighted average of common estimates obtained from a set of models. I propose computing weights by minimizing a model average prediction criterion (MAPC). I prove that the MAPC estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible mean squared error. For statistical inference, I derive asymptotic tests on the average coefficients for the "core" regressors. These regressors are of primary interest to researchers and are included in every approximation model.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter Three, two empirical applications for the MAPC method are conducted. I revisit the economic growth models in Barro (1991) in the first application. My results provide significant evidence to support Barro's (1991) findings. In the second application, I revisit the work by Durlauf, Kourtellos and Tan (2008) (hereafter DKT). Many of my results are consistent with DKT's findings and some of my results provide an alternative explanation to those outlined by DKT.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the fourth chapter, I propose using the model averaging method to construct optimal instruments for IV estimation when there are many potential instrument sets. The empirical weights are computed by minimizing the model averaging IV (MAIV) criterion through convex optimization. I propose a new loss function to evaluate the performance of the estimator. I prove that the instrument set obtained by the MAIV estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible value of the loss function.&#xd;
&#xd;
The fifth chapter develops a new forecast combination method based on MAPC. The empirical weights are obtained through a convex optimization of MAPC. I prove that with stationary observations, the MAPC estimator is asymptotically optimal for forecast combination in that it achieves the lowest possible one-step-ahead second-order mean squared forecast error (MSFE). I also show that MAPC is asymptotically equivalent to the in-sample mean squared error (MSE) and MSFE.</description>

   <description>The Ontario Clean Water Act (2006) mandated that eight and two municipal drinking water intakes in the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority (CRCA) and the Ganaraska River Source Protection Agency (GRSPA) jurisdictions respectively, be protected from contaminants released into the surrounding waters through the delineation of Intake Protection Zones (IPZs).&#xd;
Toward these objectives, the Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM) was applied to simulate the hydrodynamics and contaminant transport in the eastern Lake Ontario and upper St. Lawrence River. Model hydrodynamics were comprehensively validated against field data collected during April-October, 2006. The flow was found to be predominantly wind induced in the southwestern lacustrine portion of the domain and hydraulically driven in the northeastern riverine portion with storm events resulting in river flow reversals. The modeled surface currents were applied to delineate IPZs surrounding the drinking water intakes. Passive tracers were simulated as surrogates for combined sewer outflows, tributary flows, municipal/wastewater and industrial discharges identified by CRCA as threats to drinking water intakes. Wind was found to be the most dominant forcing to transport contaminants, both in the Kingston Basin and the St. Lawrence River, whereas the St. Lawrence River outflow was found to influence the transport of contaminants along the river. &#xd;
The hydrodynamics and contaminant transport in the near-shore region of Lake Ontario, from Port Hope to Cobourg was also simulated using ELCOM and the results were comprehensively validated against field data collected during April-September, 2010. Upwelling and downwelling events caused by south-westerly and north-easterly winds were found to be the predominant hydrodynamic process. These events generated barotropic geostrophic alongshore currents or ‘coastal jets’ of ~20 cm s-1. Discharges from river plumes and sewage treatment plants were simulated as tracer releases. &#xd;
The tracer concentrations were primarily influenced by the close proximity of the intakes to the effluent release points, the volume and direction of the discharge from the intakes and the physical processes driving the flow dynamics.</description>

   <description>Flame propagation through a channel equipped with obstacles was studied experimentally. Two types of obstacle geometries were investigated, i.e., wall-mounted cross-flow cylinders and fence-type obstacles mounted on the top and bottom channel surfaces. The motivation for this research is its applications to both high-speed propulsion and industrial explosion safety. &#xd;
&#xd;
The effect of obstacle distribution and blockage ratio on flame acceleration was investigated in a 2.54cm x 7.6cm “narrow” channel with wall-mounted cross-flow cylindrical obstacles. The cylinders were arranged in a “staggered” or “inline” pattern, with blockage ratios of 0.5 and 0.67. Schlieren images were used to study the flame shape and its leading edge velocity for a range of fuel-air mixtures compositions. It was determined that initial flame propagation occurs faster in higher blockage ratios due to the higher frequency perturbation to the flow. Flame acceleration led to different quasi-steady flame and detonation propagation regimes. In general, higher final steady flame velocities were reached in the lower blockage ratios, and detonation limits were found to be influenced by the geometry.&#xd;
&#xd;
The influence of channel width on flame acceleration was also determined using fence-type obstacles with a single blockage ratio. Experiments were performed in a 2.54cm x 7.6cm and 7.6cm x 7.6cm channel. Schlieren images were again used to study the flame shape and to obtain leading edge velocity. The flame tip was found to have a parabolic profile across the channel width for the narrower channel and flatter profile in the wider channel. It was determined that the channel width has a weak effect on the flame velocity down the channel length. As such, flame acceleration was initially only slightly more pronounced in the narrow channel before the reverse became true later in the wide channel.</description>

   <description>Patients with schizophrenia are normally treated with one of several antipsychotic medications that differ from one another in the areas of the brain they affect including the dorsal striatum, a subcortical section of the forebrain, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), located in the anterior part of the frontal lobes.  Two different tests of implicit memory, the probabilistic classification learning (PCL) and the Iowa gambling task (IGT), have been shown to rely on the dorsal striatum and the PFC, respectively. Studies have previously shown that patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics that affect the dorsal striatum (e.g., risperidone), have altered performance on the PCL, and those treated with antipsychotics that affect the PFC (e.g., clozapine), have altered performance on the IGT.  We tested the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine would have a poorer performance on the IGT, but not the PCL, when compared with controls. This study aimed to clarify conflicting results from prior experiments observing the effects of olanzapine on implicit memory in people with schizophrenia. We also hypothesized that performance of patients taking aripiprazole would be comparable to those taking risperidone, or an FGA; however, we were unable to recruit a sufficient amount of participants to test this hypothesis. Patients with schizophrenia, a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown in relation between thoughts, emotion, and behavior, treated with olanzapine were recruited through local psychiatric clinics or using a newspaper ad.  Administration of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) preceded a brief questionnaire of demographic information.  Participants were tested on the PCL and the IGT using a personal computer.  Results revealed poorer performance on both the MMSE and BPRS for patients when compared with controls. Patients taking olanzapine were impaired in learning the PCL but not the IGT when compared with controls. Results suggest that olanzapine acts on the PFC to augment IGT performance but further studies are needed.</description>

   <description>Walking pigeons display a characteristic behaviour: head-bobbing. Head-bobbing consists of two phases, the hold phase during which the head is kept stable in space, and the thrust phase during which the head is quickly moved forward. But why do pigeons and so many other birds head-bob? Two theories have been developed to answer this question. First, head-bobbing may have a visual function, namely object detection during the hold phase and depth perception during the thrust phase. Second, head-bobbing may have the biomechanical function of increasing the stability. &#xd;
The present study aimed to gain further insight into why pigeons head-bob. A gait cycle analysis of walking pigeons revealed that the hold phase starts at a specific point in the gait cycle and is not dependent on the walking speed. The point in the gait cycle at which the hold phase starts indicates a potential increase in stability during the single stance phase, as it leads to a longer period of time during which the center of mass is above the base of support. The end of the hold phase, however, is dependent on the walking speed, specifically the step length for a given walking speed. I found that the thrust phase duration is constant for all walking speeds and the distance the head travels during that time is equal to the step length. With increasing walking speed the head moves faster during the thrust phase and the hold phase duration is decreased leading to a higher head-bobbing frequency. With fast enough walking speed the hold phase is eventually eliminated, marking the transition point from walking with head-bobbing to fast walking without head-bobbing. The exact velocity of this transition point was predicted for each individual and was dependent on the maximal step length of each pigeon. All head-bobbing parameters could be described with the step-frequency, the thrust phase duration, and the maximal step length, indicating that head-bobbing behavior is individual for every pigeon and depends on its body size.</description>

   <description>Over the past several decades abdominal obesity and physical inactivity have increased at an alarming pace. Since both are related to adverse health risk it is important to determine their independent influence. It is well established that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF, the ability to perform physical activity) and physical activity (PA) are negatively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors (commonly obtained risk factors for disease, e.g: TG, HDL, etc.). In other words, the higher a person’s levels of PA and fitness, the lower that person’s likelihood of developing cardiometabolic risk factors. Abdominal obesity is positively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors which means the more abdominally obese a person is, the more prone that person is to develop cardiometabolic risk factors. However, it is unknown whether PA influences cardiometabolic risk factors independent of fitness level and/or abdominal obesity. My study objective was to examine whether PA is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors independent of cardiorespiratory fitness and/or abdominal obesity in inactive abdominally obese women.&#xd;
The study enrolled 141 inactive abdominally obese women. PA, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cardiometabolic risk profile were measured in all participants. A novel feature of this study was the use of the accelerometer to objectively measure PA and to divide exercise into different levels of intensity, such as: low PA, moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), etc. My findings revealed that abdominal obesity was positively associated with cardiometabolic risk independent of PA or CRF.  I also observed that CRF was inversely related to cardiometabolic risk independent of PA or abdominal obesity. MVPA explained cardiometabolic risk factors by itself, but with insulin resistance measurements (2-hour glucose, and homeostasis model of assessment) this relationship was abolished when abdominal obesity and CRF were also taken into consideration. &#xd;
The findings of this study provide further support for the recommendation that waist circumference and CRF be included as routine measures screening for cardiometabolic risk factors in inactive obese women. Our findings also support the suggestion that even modest amounts of daily MVPA that are below the recommended threshold of 30 minutes/day convey health benefit.</description>

   <description>The development, maintenance, and survival of neurons depend on the function of neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF).  One population of neurons that rely heavily on NGF for axonal growth and survival is the postganglionic sympathetic neurons.  Trauma or disease resulting in injury to the peripheral nervous system causes an increase in the levels of this neurotrophin.  This augmentation promotes the collateral sprouting of postganglionic sympathetic axons into those tissues having elevated levels of NGF.  Often, NGF-induced sympathetic sprouting occurs in tissues that are normally innervated by these fibers however, high levels of NGF can also promote sprouting of axons into tissues that are normally devoid of sympathetic fibers, such as the sensory ganglia.  When postganglionic sympathetic axons grow into the environment of sensory ganglia, they can converge and wrap around a subset of somata (i.e., cell bodies) belonging to primary sensory neurons.  This phenomenon, referred to as sympathosensory plexuses is observed in adult mice and rats following peripheral nerve injury, and is also seen in adult transgenic mice that ectopically over express NGF.  &#xd;
	The overall aim for this project is to examine the morphological and neurochemical features, as well as the overall consequence of sympathosensory plexuses in nerve-injured adult mice and in adult transgenic mice that over express NGF.  We hope that this novel information will add to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the formation of sympathosensory plexuses that occur following injury.</description>

   <description>Altered glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer and can be used to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. This thesis shows a comprehensive study of glycosylation on a variety of human prostate cell lines.  Cell surface glycans were analyzed using lectins and antibodies. Glycans were also released from glycoproteins, purified and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The enzymatic activities and expression levels of glycosyltransferases responsible for the syntheses of N- and O-glycans have been determined and correlated with glycan structures. We found that prostate cells are capable of synthesizing complex N-glycans and core 1 based O-glycans, and that each cell line has characteristic glycosylation pathways. Elevated levels of truncated O-glycans including sialyl-T and di-sialyl-T antigens were detected in prostate cancer cell lines. Complex O-glycans without sialic acid residues constituted the major O-glycans in normal prostate cells, but sialyl-T antigens were prevalent in the most aggressive prostate cancer cells derived from bone metastasis (PC-3). The expression and activity of sialyltransferase ST3Gal-I, responsible for the synthesis of sialyl-T antigens, were up-regulated in PC-3 cells, providing a mechanism for sialyl-T expression. Forced down-regulation of ST3Gal-I by RNA interfering technology as well as neuraminidase treatments of cells were employed to modify cellular glycosylation, and indicated a critical role of sialic acid in the regulation of apoptosis. These observations facilitate the identification of prostate cancer markers and help to understand the importance of glycans in cancer progression.&#xd;
To elucidate mechanisms of glycosylation and develop glycosyltransferase inhibitors, we characterized recombinant soluble human Gal- and GlcNAc-transferases that synthesize O-glycan cores 1 to 4, critical for the overall structures of O-glycans. The biochemical properties and substrate specificities of these enzymes were determined using synthetic acceptor substrate analogs. These collective results were used to develop novel glycosyltransferase inhibitors, including acceptor substrate analogs and bivalent imidazolium salts. These compounds inhibited selected glycosyltransferases, and thus have the potential to modify cellular glycans for functional studies. Glycosyltransferase inhibitors could also be used in biotechnology and in therapeutic applications to increase the apoptotic potential of prostate cancer cells.</description>

   <description>As traffic demand on bridges increases, loading cycles on critical components will increase, reducing their service life. Modular bridge expansion joints, which are imperative to allowing the bridge superstructure to move, are susceptible to fatigue damage at their field splice.  These splices are used to connect segments of the total joint, during staged construction.  Current splice designs are either bolted or welded connections, which allow stress concentrations to induce pre-mature fatigue failure.  This thesis examines the use of a hybrid FRP/steel design under fatigue loading for use as a splice detail.&#xd;
&#xd;
The splice detail consists of steel plates bolted to steel beam webs and CFRP pultruded plates adhesively bonded to the underside of the steel beam flanges.  Two different moduli of CFRP were examined: Normal Modulus and Ultra High Modulus.  Two beams of each modulus were tested under static conditions and six under constant amplitude fatigue loading.  A testing rig was used to simulate similar bending moments experienced in bridge joints.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the static tests, slippage of the web plates caused considerable stiffness loss and the slippage load varied drastically between CFRP moduli.  For the fatigue tests, the intention was to reach two million cycles at the different constant load ranges.  Stiffness degradation was noticed during the fatigue process, and was likely due to bolt pre-tension loss and/or plastic deformation of the adhesive.  Specimens that reached two million cycles were monotonically loaded to failure.  Once the CFRP had failed, a secondary mechanism was observed for reserve load capacity. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Simple beam mechanics were used to create prediction models for the initial spliced beam stiffness and peak CFRP load.  Flexural and shear deformations of the spliced system were considered for beam stiffness. For the CFRP failure load prediction, a design peak strain in the CFRP was used to account for shear lag effects in the material and variability of the splice detail.  While the model was inaccurate for beam stiffness, it provided a good approximate of the peak CFRP load.  Based on the presented test data, the Normal Modulus CFRP hybrid splice detail showed better fatigue performance than conventional steel connection details.</description>

   <description>Purpose: Ultrasound is prevalent in image-guided therapy as a safe, inexpensive,&#xd;
and widely available imaging modality. However, extensive training in interpreting&#xd;
ultrasound images is essential for successful procedures. An open-source ultrasound&#xd;
image simulator was developed to facilitate the training of ultrasound-guided spinal&#xd;
intervention procedures, thereby eliminating the need for an ultrasound machine from&#xd;
the phantom-based training environment. Methods: Anatomical structures and surgical&#xd;
tools are converted to surface meshes for data compression. Anatomical data&#xd;
is converted from segmented volumetric images, while the geometry of surgical tools&#xd;
is available as a surface mesh. The pose of the objects are either constants or live&#xd;
measurements from a pose tracking device. Intersection points between the surface&#xd;
models and the ultrasound scan lines are determined with a binary space partitioning&#xd;
tree. The scan lines are divided into segments and filled with grey values determined&#xd;
by an intensity calculation accounting for material properties, reflection, and attenuation&#xd;
parameters defined in a configuration file. The scan lines are then converted to&#xd;
a regular brightness-mode ultrasound image. Results: The simulator was tested in a&#xd;
tracked ultrasound imaging system, with a mock transducer tracked by an Ascension&#xd;
TrakStar electromagnetic tracker, on a spine phantom. A mesh model of the spine&#xd;
was created from CT. The simulated ultrasound images were generated at a speed&#xd;
of 50 frames per second, and a resolution of 820 x 616 pixels on a PC with a 3.4&#xd;
GHz processor. A human subject trial was conducted to compare the learning performance of novice trainees with real and simulated ultrasound in the localization of&#xd;
the facet joints of a spine phantom. With 22 participants split into two equal groups&#xd;
and each participant localizing 6 facet joints, there was no statistical difference in the&#xd;
performance of the two groups, indicating that simulated ultrasound could indeed&#xd;
replace the real ultrasound in phantom-based ultrasonography training for spinal&#xd;
interventions. Conclusion: The ultrasound simulator was implemented and integrated&#xd;
into the open-source Public Library for Ultrasound (www.plustoolkit.org) and&#xd;
SlicerIGT (www.SlicerIGT.org) toolkits</description>

   <description>Asymmetry of weight-bearing and impaired ability to maintain centre of pressure in midline contribute to an increased fall risk during sit-to-stand in people with stroke. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of constraint-induced movement strategies on affected limb weight-bearing and measures of balance in people with stroke.  Four studies were conducted to achieve this objective.  Study one and two investigated the methodology for describing sit-to-stand performance in people with stroke and reliability of measures of sit-to-stand performance. Findings from study one demonstrated that methods for describing sit-to-stand performance in healthy adults are not feasible in people with stroke and established a method for describing sit-to-stand performance in subsequent studies. Findings from the second study demonstrated within and between day reliability of temporal, weight-bearing and displacement measures of sit-to-stand performance in both groups. &#xd;
The third study of this thesis described impairments of sit-to-stand performance in people with stroke when compared with healthy age and sex matched adults. The findings confirmed results from previous studies and further described sit-to-stand performance by demonstrating a shift in the frontal plane centre of pressure and centre of mass position toward the unaffected limb at seat-off in people with stroke.  The final study investigated the effect of three constraint-induced movement strategies on sit-to-stand performance in people with stroke. The results demonstrated increased affected limb weight-bearing and a shift of the centre of pressure and centre of mass toward midline with all of the strategies.  Only two of the strategies altered centre of pressure and centre of mass displacement in the sagittal plane.  &#xd;
Findings from this body of research provide new information regarding the methodology of describing sit-to-stand performance in people with stroke and the reliability of measures of sit-to-stand performance. The results also provide an advanced understanding of sit-to-stand performance in people with stroke and the effect of constraint-induced movement strategies on sit-to-stand performance.  Additional research using constraint-induced movement strategies in a randomized controlled trial will inform clinical practice and may reduce the fall risk in people with stroke.</description>

   <description>Many higher education institutions in Canada are enrolling international graduate students as part of their internationalization strategy. However, once international graduate students arrive at their host institution, they often experience tensions in the classroom. There is a lack of critical examination concerning how these students are treated once they are admitted (Lee, 2007b). Much of the existing research frames international students as having to acclimate to their institution rather than examining the institutional structures in place to support these students. There is a paucity of studies that explores the relationship between international graduate students, university administrators, and policymakers in the context of internationalization. This qualitative study sought to extend the research on internationalization and the academic experiences of international students in Canada by examining: (1) The classroom experiences of international graduate students at a higher education institution in relation to internationalization; (2) University administrators’ understandings of international graduate students’ classroom experiences in relation to internationalization; (3) Existing university policies and initiatives that address the classroom experiences of international graduate students in relation to internationalization; and (4) The relationship between university policies, administrators’ understandings of international graduate students’ classroom experiences, and international graduate students’ actual experiences in relation to internationalization. This study used a grounded theory approach. An expanded critical race theory lens was used to illuminate students’ experiences. Overall, a disjunction was found between the policies and reports, university administrators’ understanding of international graduate students’ experiences in the classroom and international graduate students’ actual experiences. Four key findings emerged from the interview data and document analysis, which were reflected across the data sets: (1) Lack of inclusive practices within the classroom environment; (2) Absence of international perspectives and content within the curriculum and pedagogy; (3) Language and accent discrimination; and (4) Lack of initiatives to create a welcoming and inclusive campus climate. This study will add to the literature on international graduate students and extend existing theories on this population. It will also expand future research on organizational factors that influence international graduate students’ academic experiences.</description>

   <description>In this thesis I investigate the economic determinants and consequences of corporate governance (broadly defined) in Canadian “comply or explain” governance disclosure regime. I find that the quality of governance in firms varies in the cross-section and is associated with firm value as economic theory suggests. Furthermore, I find the effectiveness of board and audit committee has a strong impact on the auditor-client management relationship in their negotiation over financial reporting. Such relationships then influence financial reporting quality and audit fees. Overall, my results support that the theorized advantages of “comply or explain” allow firms greater flexibility in tailoring their governance practice to their specific circumstances. Such tailored governance practice is more efficient and cost-effective and serves the interests of shareholders by 1) improving firm value; 2) constraining managerial opportunism; and 3) improving audit quality without incurring higher audit fees.</description>

   <description>Triangle meshes have been widely used in many fields such as digital archives, computer-assisted design and in the game industry. The topic we are particularly interested is triangle mesh compression for fossil models. This thesis explores the research area of triangle mesh compression and implements a good compressor for our data set. The compressor is mainly based on a previously proposed algorithm, Edgebreaker, with modifications and improvements. The details of the implementation and our improvements are described in detail in this thesis.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-27 20:26:30.206</description>
   <description>The benefits of human milk are well-known, as human milk provides optimal nutrition in facilitating the growth, health, and development of infants and children.  There are circumstances when a mother’s breast milk may be unavailable due to maternal illness, insufficient milk supply, contraindications, or geographical barriers (Dempsey &amp; Miletin, 2010).  Global recommendations support the use of donor human milk in situations where a mother’s own breast milk is unavailable (World Health Organization, 2009).  Due to the limited supply, the pasteurized product is allocated to high risk infants within the hospitalized setting (Human Milk Bank Association of North America, 2008).  Based on the allocation priorities, many individuals are unable to access donor human milk.  &#xd;
In response to the growing demands for donor human milk, Internet based organizations have facilitated peer to peer human milk sharing.  Given the fact that sharing human milk has been practiced as a covert activity, there is a lack of prevalence data (Thorley, 2008).  To date, minimal research has examined this phenomenon.  &#xd;
The purpose of this study was to explore the description of sharing human milk utilizing an online commerce-free approach. &#xd;
Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 13 research participants and analyzed using an inductive approach to qualitative content analysis.  Qualitative content analysis was selected based on the recognition of the importance of obtaining a rich description when exploring this phenomenon.  &#xd;
Outcomes generated from the research study resulted in emerging concepts and categories.  The concepts from the data analysis consisted of the following: commitment to human milk; virtual nature of relationships; and making the private public.  The identified categories include: 1) infant feeding practices; 2) experience with sharing human milk; 3) selection of donors or recipients; 4) relationships among donors and recipients sharing human milk; 5) shared doctrine; 6) use of the Internet to share human milk; and 7) informing health care professionals and others regarding sharing human milk.  	&#xd;
Findings generated from this study provide an increase in understanding of this phenomenon.  The cultivated knowledge will assist health care professionals in working in partnership with families to ensure optimal outcomes.</description>

   <description>In recent years, International Relations scholars have begun to consider migration as an explanatory variable, recognizing its potential role in contributing to the outbreak of violent conflict. Despite the theoretical and empirical contributions resulting from this scholarship, the growing literature privileges a narrow category of migrants – involuntary migrants – failing to capture the role of the millions of voluntary migrants that might be part of the migration-conflict nexus. While some efforts have been made to explore the broader relationship between migration and security, this work focuses on developed countries, national security, and international migration. In short, this has led to the development of a new research agenda that bears little relevance to the African context (and other developing regions) where internal security and internal migration are much more prominent issues.&#xd;
This dissertation addresses these gaps by examining the migration-conflict nexus in the cocoa regions in two West African countries − Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. These countries are excellent candidates for comparative analysis as both have a great deal in common in terms of their natural resources, geographies, cultures and relations to the world market. These countries also provide fertile ground for comparison as although they share similar migration histories, there have been fundamentally different outcomes in terms of migration-producing conflict. Whereas there have been violent outbreaks of conflict targeting migrants in Côte d’Ivoire leading to a protracted civil war, instances of violent conflict in Ghana’s cocoa growing regions are rare.&#xd;
By analyzing and contrasting the different migration-conflict trajectories across these cases, the dissertation develops an empirically-informed model for explaining migration-conflict dynamics in Africa and beyond. While the findings highlight the need to take migration seriously as a security issue in its own right, they also reveal the critical role of the following intervening variables in influencing the diverging outcomes: differences in state-society relations; diverging land tenure regimes; variations in state capacity and exogenous shocks; and contrasting experiences with autochthony discourses. Notwithstanding the empirical focus on migration-conflict dynamics in the Ivoirian and Ghanaian cocoa regions, the model developed herein provides important insights beyond these regional contexts.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-30 10:41:50.321</description>
   <description>Background: The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified diesel exhaust as a carcinogen, and specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as probable carcinogens. Urban air pollution is one source of PAH exposure. These facts provided motivation to pursue three thesis objectives: 1) to critically review environmental inequity research in Canada and methods used in previous studies; 2) to determine associations between socio-demographic factors and residential traffic exposure; and, 3) to assess correlations between two PAH biomarkers and their relationship with a newer geographic information system (GIS) method (a proxy of PAH exposure measurement), and explore determinants of these two PAH biomarkers.&#xd;
Methods: The first objective was achieved through an extensive and critical literature review. The second and third objectives were achieved through conducting a cross-sectional study in Montreal where 107 female and 93 male volunteers completed a questionnaire and provided a urine sample for measurement of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronide (1-OHPG). GIS-based distance-weighted traffic density (DWTD) at participants’ residences and time- and distance-weighted traffic density (TDWTD) for all participants’ locations in the 48 hours before urine collection were calculated.&#xd;
Results: Participants with lower household income and unemployment/student status were more likely to be exposed to higher traffic density at their residence. DWTD was related to self-reported living within 100 meters of highway/major roads. Detection rates for the two biomarkers were over 95%, and females have higher 1-OHP and 1-OHPG levels (exp β: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.17 to 2.09; exp β: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.11, respectively) than males. Smoking in the 48-hour period before urine collection significantly predicted levels of biomarkers, and among non-smokers barbecued/grilled meat consumption was implicated in increases in 1-OHP.&#xd;
Conclusions: Those with lower household income and unemployment/student status experienced increased traffic exposure, while education, marital status and ethnicity were not associated with traffic exposure. While higher levels among females and an interaction with sex needs further study, PAH biomarkers are useful in capturing recent PAH exposure from smoking, and barbecued/grilled meat consumption. PAH biomarkers can be easily used in epidemiologic studies to assess general population exposures.</description>

   <description>I conducted two studies to explore cultural differences between Chinese and European Canadians in considering opportunity cost while making purchase decisions.  In Study 1, participants (121 Euro-Canadians and 119 Chinese) read a scenario in which they would decide whether to buy a single product (e.g., a backpack) or not.  Participants were randomly assigned to either a condition in which opportunity cost information was made salient or a control condition in which opportunity cost was not mentioned.  I found that participants in the opportunity cost salient condition displayed a higher level of opportunity cost consideration than did participants in the control condition.  When individual differences in the habit of considering opportunity cost and spending habits were controlled for, Chinese participants’ purchase decisions revealed a higher degree of opportunity cost consideration than those of European Canadians.  Chinese were also more likely to mention opportunity cost thoughts than did European Canadians while making the decision.  In Study 2, participants chose one of two laptops to buy (one was cheaper but had less memory than the other).  The results demonstrated that Chinese living in Canada displayed a higher degree of opportunity cost consideration by opting more often for the cheaper laptop, than did European Canadians.  However, the culture main effect was confounded by cultural differences in family income.  Study 2 also replicated the results of Study 1 that Chinese were also more likely to mention opportunity cost thoughts than European Canadians while making the decision.  Although inconclusive, these results suggest that opportunity cost consideration varies, at least to some extent, across cultures.  Implications of the current research for consumer behavior and directions for future research are discussed.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, three radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) were digitally assisted for varying signal power, frequency or both.  Performance paramters were 'optimized' in the sense of obtaining the best performance improvement possible through the methods used.  The digital assist method used a lookup table (LUT) of optimal bias points measured through extensive sweeps and linear interpolation to determine the optimal bias point of the chip between measured points.&#xd;
&#xd;
A Gilbert Cell was fabricated in 0.13 μm CMOS.  Transistor gate bias voltages were swept with input power to find the optimal bias voltages for intermodulation distortion (IMD) performance.  A power detector was on-chip for the digital assist.  Linear interpolation was used to optimize biases for any input power between initially measured points.  Whereas distortion generally increases with input power, the digitally assisted device reduced the distortion of large signals.  The IIP3 was 2.83 dBm from -3.11 dBm, and the P1dB was -3.33 dBm from -12.06 dBm.  The RF bandwidth was measured as 1 to 12 GHz and DC power consumption varied from 2.06 to 3.27 mW.&#xd;
&#xd;
A noise cancelling low noise amplifier (LNA) was designed and fabricated in 0.13 μm CMOS.  A feedback capacitor was used to boost the gain of the input transistor for lower DC power and better S11.  An on-chip frequency detector was implemented for the digital assist.  The gain rolled off gradually from 1 GHz until the 3 dB cutoff at 7 GHz.  The average noise figure was 4.1 dB and less than 5 dB across the band.  With digital assist, the gain curve was flattened at about 15 dB with to a broader 8 GHz bandwidth without negatively affecting the noise figure.  The S11 was below -12 dB.&#xd;
&#xd;
A power amplifier (PA) previously designed in 0.8 μm Gallium Nitride (GaN) used third order IMD cancellation by derivative superposition effective at a fixed frequency and output power.  Digital assist eliminated the extreme sensitivity to variations.  Digital assist and bilinear interpolation maintained a 10 dB improvement in OIP3 over the entire 1 to 6 GHz band for varying output power between 21 and 24 dBm.</description>

   <description>Early pregnancy is characterized by complex interactions between blood vessels, leukocytes, and conceptus-derived trophoblasts within the gestational uterus. Uterine Natural Killer (uNK) cells become the most abundant leukocyte during decidualization and produce a wide array of angiogenic factors, yet little is known regarding their early pregnancy functions. To characterize the role(s) of uNK cells, whole mount in situ immunohistochemistry of live early implant sites was performed.&#xd;
	A timecourse examination of murine early pregnancy (virgin, and gd4.5-9.5) implantation sites was performed. Comparison of Gd6.5, 8.5 and 9.5 implant sites from BALB/c+/+ controls (BALB/c) and BALB/c-Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- (alymphoid) identified anomalies that result from the absence of lymphocytes. In alymphoid decidua basalis, mesometrial angiogenesis was widespread but pruning of nascent vessels within alymphoid decidua basalis was deficient. As early gestation progressed, vessels of alymphoid decidua basalis showed no evidence for remodeling. Alymphoid implantation sites showed ~24h delay in uterine lumen closure and embryonic development. &#xd;
To determine if uNK cells would normalize the anomalies observed in alymphoid implantation sites, adoptive cell transfer of NK+ B- T- marrow to alymphoid mice was performed. All of the above anomalies were reversed by adoptive transfer of NK+B-T- marrow. &#xd;
	My results suggest that uNK cells support vascular growth and development which ensures the decidua can support the growing conceptus early in pregnancy prior to formation and function of the placenta. Human decidual NK cells may fill similar roles and be important targets for strategies designed to correct intra-uterine growth restriction.</description>

   <description>E2A is a transcription factor that plays a particularly critical role in lymphopoiesis. The chromosomal translocation 1;19, disrupts the E2A gene and results in the expression of the fusion oncoprotein E2A-PBX1, which is implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Both E2A and E2A-PBX1 contain two activation domains, AD1 and AD2, which comprise conserved ΦxxΦΦ motifs where Φ denotes a hydrophobic amino acid. These domains function to recruit transcriptional co-activators and repressors, including the histone acetyl transferase CREB binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300. The PCET motif within E2A AD1 interacts with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, the disruption of which abrogates the transcriptional activation by E2A and the transformative properties of E2A-PBX1. The generation of a peptide-based inhibitor targeting the PCET:KIX interaction would serve useful in further assessing the role of E2A and E2A-PBX1 in lymphopoiesis and leukemogenesis. An interaction between E2A AD2 and the KIX domain has also been recently identified, and the TAZ domains of CBP/p300 have been shown to interact with several transcription factors that contain ΦxxΦΦ motifs. Thus the design of an inhibitor of the E2A:CBP/p300 interaction requires the full complement of interactions between E2A and the various domains of CBP/p300 to be elucidated. Here, we have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine that AD2 interacts with KIX at the same site as PCET, which indicates that the E2A:KIX interaction can be disrupted by targeting a single binding site. Using an iterative synthetic peptide microarray approach, a peptide with the sequence DKELQDLLDFSLQY was derived from PCET to interact with KIX with higher affinity than the wild type sequence. This peptide now serves as a lead molecule for further development as an inhibitor of the E2A:CBP/p300 interaction. Fluorescence anisotropy, peptide microarray technology, and isothermal titration calorimetry were employed to characterize interactions between both TAZ domains of CBP/p300 and the PCET motif and AD2 of E2A. Alanine substitution of residues within PCET demonstrated that the ΦxxΦΦ motif is a key mediator of these interactions, analogous to the PCET:KIX interaction. These findings now inform future work to establish possible physiological roles for the E2A:TAZ1 and E2A:TAZ2 interactions.</description>

   <description>TAZ (Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) is a WW-domain containing protein recently identified as a downstream component of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway and mediator of biologically important processes (mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, embryonic stem cell renewal, mechanotransduction). Recently, loss of LATS1/2, a negative regulator of TAZ, has been observed in ~50% of breast cancers. However, whether and how TAZ is also involved in breast cancer has not been investigated. Therefore, this study explores the cellular functions of TAZ in breast cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms.&#xd;
	The cellular functions of TAZ were investigated using overexpression studies in an immortalized mammary epithelial cell line (MCF10A). Compared to control vector-only expressing cells (MCF10A-WPI) TAZ overexpression (MCF10A-TAZ) promotes enhanced cell proliferation, cell migration and cell-ECM adhesion, induces transformation and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and confers resistance to chemotherapeutics (paclitaxel, cisplatin). Together, these findings strongly suggest TAZ functions as an oncogene in the development, progression and drug resistance of breast cancer.&#xd;
	As a transcriptional co-activator, TAZ likely mediates these cellular functions through the transcriptional activation of downstream genes. By screening a 44K human genome microarray we have identified and characterized Cyr61 and CTGF, mediators of paclitaxel resistance, and BMP4, a regulator of cell migration. Through stable shRNA-mediated knockdown, we show that loss of Cyr61/CTGF expression in MCF10A-TAZ cells can rescue TAZ-induced paclitaxel resistance. Similarly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of BMP4 can significantly attenuate TAZ-induced cell migration. Therefore, these findings demonstrate that Cyr61/CTGF and BMP4 are functionally significant mediators of TAZ-induced paclitaxel resistance and cell migration, respectively. The clinical relevance of our in vitro findings were also validated by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays containing human breast cancer samples. TAZ levels were highly expressed in 66.6% of clinical samples further suggesting TAZ may be an important oncogene in breast cancer.&#xd;
	Our study has characterized TAZ as an oncogene in breast cancer and elucidated two novel mechanisms underlying paclitaxel resistance and cell migration. These findings highlight the importance of TAZ during the development, progression and drug resistance of breast cancers and the potential use of TAZ as a therapeutic target to treat TAZ-expressing breast cancers.</description>

   <description>This dissertation investigates how Dissenting writers, among them Samuel Annesley and Richard Baxter, influenced the religious thought of Daniel Defoe. Though some critics, most notably G. A. Starr and J. Paul Hunter, have positioned Defoe within a broad "Puritan" tradition, his religious ideas are more properly understood within the specific circumstances of post-Restoration England, as the unique pressures engendered by the Interregnum impelled many Dissenting writers to privilege "Practical Religion" over abstract theology. The aversion to "doubtfull disputations" that Defoe inherits from this discourse informs not only the modes of argument Defoe employs, but also the genres through which he engages with theological questions. Throughout his writing, however, his attachment to Biblical typology, which is informed by his dependence on the Bible as a stable locus of indisputable “plainness,” comes into conflict with his political tenets, as Scripture provides no firm precedent for the mode of contractual kingship introduced by the Glorious Revolution. At first seeking to mute the incongruities between "Hebrew times" and "modern" circumstances, Defoe is eventually impelled to reconceptualise typology, formulating a theory that both acknowledges the authority of the Bible while allowing William, and the mode of contractual kingship he represents, to surpass Scriptural types. This attitude towards typology fundamentally underpins the narrative of Robinson Crusoe (1719), which systematically repudiates Biblical narratives. Rather than adhering to prefigurative Biblical patterns, the novel is built on a series of divergences, first personal and then political, from Scriptural models. Anchored in his specific geographic and economic circumstances, Crusoe’s conversion is markedly distanced from Biblical types, represented as a process unique to his situation, rather than an iteration of an existing pattern. Ultimately, this dissertation contends that Defoe’s religious thought, specifically his commitment to "Practical Religion" and the typological hermeneutic this discourse underpins, is fundamentally informed by his relationship with post-Restoration Dissent.</description>

   <description>Microorganisms are monitored as a key indicator of water quality.  Measurement of “total viable organisms” (TVO, similar to “heterotrophic plate count”, HPC) is used to indicate the general hygiene level of the water, and is often used to assess water treatment.  Automated, instrumental TVO detection in water samples using an enzyme reaction method shortens the detection time compared to conventional HPC methods. A method that can detect TVO without interference in water samples by monitoring enzyme activities through fluorescent signals in small custom sample cells was developed. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this method, fluorogenic substrates were cleaved by specific enzymes to make fluorescent products, which then partitioned into a non-polar siloxane polymer film on the bottom of the sample cell. A miniature spectrometer monitored fluorescence in the polymer to give a present/absent result for bacteria. There is no interference from sample color and turbidity because the light never passes through the sample matrix.&#xd;
&#xd;
Eight substrates that can be converted by six different enzymes were characterized. These had fluorescent products coupled to glucose, glucuronic acid, galactose, phosphate, sulfate and alanine. Four different products were produced, providing detection of some enzymes simultaneously but independently, depending on the substrates chosen. Candidate fluorescent products were first tested with different siloxane polymers and two dimethyl-siloxane polymers were identified to detect all the products separately.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Fifteen laboratory bacteria strains (including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were added individually to a substrate solution containing minimal nutrients and incubated.  All bacteria types were successfully detected by at least one substrate, with most detected by several substrates.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Sterility of water samples from lake water, treated lake water and tap water were tested with those eight substrates separately or in combination. The lake water had the highest bacteria level and included coliforms and possibly E. coli. Treated lake water and tap water were E. coli and coliforms free, and were safe for drinking. Treated lake water had higher TVO levels than tap water, indicating a lower hygiene level. The results of combined substrate tests matched the corresponding single substrate tests, suggesting specific bacteria strains can be distinguished in a single test.</description>

   <description>Recent empirical evidence suggests that we have entered a new period of courtship known as the hookup era. Contemporary research which explores hooking up has confirmed the prevalence of this dating script, particularly within post-secondary institutions. The relevant literature has focused on a variety of important issues including the conceptual meaning of hooking up and the identification of potential correlates and consequences of these behaviours. Despite this increase in scholarly interest, several problems remain unaddressed. Principal among these is the way(s) in which young women mediate the self-perceived risks involved in the sexual exchange known as the hookup, so as to facilitate their participation in this culture. The current paper examines the controversy that is female hookup participation by investigating the risks – and subsequent negotiation of these risks – which women face in the hookup culture. Specifically, this paper makes use of detailed qualitative data gathered from a sample of female undergraduate students at a medium-sized Canadian university, in order to uncover the social processes by which female proponents of the hookup culture account for their actions to themselves and to others, in this the seemingly risky courtship script.</description>

   <description>Schools develop organizational cultures of their own; these cultures establish traditions and norms that guide everyday life in schools.  The purpose of this case study was to examine teachers’ and administrators’ perceptions of how a positive school culture has been shaped, maintained, and sustained over the past four decades at one midsized Catholic high school in Southeastern Ontario. The qualitative research design combined document analysis and qualitative interviewing with the aim to establish a greater understanding of the school’s history. The interviews were conducted with current and former teachers and administrators who have worked at the school between 1970 and 2013.  By looking at this school as a case study, I have attempted to gain a deeper insight to the subjective experiences that different teachers and administrators have had with the school over the course of its recent history, and have thereby developed an understanding of the motivations and actions undertaken to both preserve and change the school’s normative structure over the course of time.                 The results of the study indicate that the school has been able to maintain and sustain a positive culture over the past forty years.  The findings have determined the school’s cultural manifestations at each of the three levels of organizational culture, and recognize the fundamental importance of the role of selected stakeholders in projecting, and reflecting the existing culture in order to preserve core underlying assumptions in the process of adaptation to internal and external changes.  The school’s long-standing history, tradition of excellence, and strong focus on Catholic education and “educating the whole person” have allowed for the establishment of a close community network within the school.  From an ecological perspective (recognizing schools as living systems) these networks, supported by strong leadership, have served to sustain the healthy elements of the school’s culture allowing it to evolve over time.</description>

   <description>Mobile apps (or apps) are software applications developed to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, among other devices. The number of apps has grown tremendously since Apple opened the first app store in 2008. For example, in March of 2009 the Google Play app store (formerly known as Android Market) had only 2,300 apps, and by mid of 2013 there were more than 800,000 apps. Given the accelerated rate of growth in the number of apps, new software engineering challenges have emerged in order to help ease the software development practices of app developers. In this thesis we examine three examples of these challenges, namely code reuse in mobile apps, app ratings, and the use of ad libraries within apps. We carry out our case studies on thousands of Android apps from the Google Play market.&#xd;
&#xd;
We find that code reuse in mobile apps is considerably higher than in desktop/server apps. However, identical copies of mobile apps are rare. We find that the current ratings system is not able to capture the dynamics of the evolving nature of apps. Thus, we were able to show the need for a more elaborate rating system for the apps. Finally, we observe that a considerable number of free-to-download apps are dependant on ads for their revenue. Our findings suggest that "ad maintenance" is a tough challenge that developers of mobile apps have to face.</description>

   <description>Orthographically-projected biological motion point-light displays generally contain no information about their in-depth orientation, yet observers consistently prefer the facing-the-viewer (FTV) interpretation (Vanrie, Dekeyser and Verfaillie, 2004). This bias has been attributed to the social relevance of such stimuli (Brooks et al., 2008) although local stimulus properties appear to influence the bias (Schouten, Troje and Verfaillie, 2011). In the present study we investigated the cause of the FTV bias. In Experiment 1 we compared FTV bias for various configurations of stick-figures and depth ambiguous human silhouettes. The FTV bias was not present for silhouettes, but was strongly elicited for most stick-figures. We concluded that local attitude assignments for intrinsic structures of stick-figures are subject to inferences about the flexion of body surfaces, and that a visual bias that assumes surfaces to be convex drives the FTV bias. In Experiment 2 we manipulated silhouettes to permit local attitude assignments by using point-lights on emphasized flexion points. As predicted, the inclusion of intrinsic structures produced FTV bias for silhouettes. The results help to unify various findings regarding the FTV bias. We conclude that the FTV bias emerges during the 2 ½-D sketch stage of visual processing (Marr and Nishihara, 1978).</description>

   <description>This paper will examine contemporary North American yoga, specifically the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Center in Toronto, using theoretical frameworks taken from the work of Michel Foucault. Drawing on his work in Discipline and Punish, it will look at yoga as a modern “carceral” institution. Using Foucault’s analysis in Madness and Civilizaition, this paper will explore how yoga intersects, is some ways, with madness. The underlying argument is that yoga and madness, as discourses, are both based upon institutional disciplining of pre-discursive experiences. This paper contends that the pre-discursive “sources” of experience should not be seen as unified points of origin, but as an underlying “difference”, or capacity to be otherwise. This “difference” points to multiple, undifferentiated, mutual sources of yoga and madness.</description>

   <description>Happiness should be a fundamental aim of education. This philosophical assertion raises the practical question of how teachers generate happiness in their classroom programs while operating under the current paradigm of educational accountability. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the perspectives of early primary teachers, students, and parents on what makes a happy classroom. Data were collected through interviews of 12 teachers from public, independent, Waldorf, Froebel, and Montessori schools; over 72 hours of observation in eight early primary classrooms; interviews with 23 students (ages 3 to 8), drawing and photography with 64 students (ages 3 to 8); 66 parent surveys, and eight teacher exit interviews. Four cycles of analysis, including descriptive and conceptual approaches, resulted in the identification of five core conditions of happy classrooms: (a) relational pedagogy, (b) embodied learning, (c) pedagogical thoughtfulness (d) an ethos of happiness, and (e) an ethos of possibility. These five conditions were supported by 17 facets, which describe practical and conceptual ways to support pedagogical thinking and decision-making about children’s happiness in the complex worlds of busy classrooms. Five of the facets are spotlighted: (a) kids need to play, (b) stepping in stepping out, (c) sounds shape feelings and experience, (d) rhythms and routines, and (e) romancing children into delight. In addition, student and parent participants identified that play, positive friendships, time outdoors, experiences involving the arts, and experiences of positive feelings make children happy at school and when they are learning. The discussion centers on the role of teachers in establishing the tone of happy classrooms, considers the notion of strong pedagogy, discusses the generation of happiness in early primary classrooms in the form of lessons to be learned from different pedagogical traditions, and argues that, above all, children’s interests, needs, and development should be a teacher’s first point of consideration for all decisions about instruction and learning in the classroom. The discussion concludes with implications for teaching professionals and offers suggestions for future research.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-02 22:32:53.067</description>
   <description>The goal of the current research was to investigate the impact of lying on self-control depletion. I hypothesised that lying would require more self-control than would truth telling. In Study 1, participants were assigned one of two topics, a favourite movie or a personal problem, about which they lied or told the truth in counterbalanced order on camera for two minutes. Following the first video in which they either told the truth or lied, participants completed an anagram task that served as the measure of self-control depletion. I found that participants in the movie condition did not differ as a function of lying or telling the truth although the means were in the expected direction. Also, contrary to my predictions, participants who lied about a personal problem were significantly less depleted than were participants who told the truth about their personal problem. In Study 2, participants were assigned to either deny or confess possession of an object in two interviews, but they actually possessed the object in only one interview creating the lie versus truth-telling manipulations. After both interviews, participants’ reaction times were recorded for the Stroop task, which served as the measure of ego- depletion. I did not find a significant difference between participants who lied first versus participants who told the truth first. Furthermore, participants assigned to deny versus confess to possessing the object did not differ on the Stroop task reaction times. Possible explanations for why the results did not support the hypothesis that lying is ego- depleting are discussed.</description>

   <description>This thesis puts forth an ethnographic, social constructionist account of tattoo shops with the aim of examining how heavily tattooed individuals negotiate positive social meaning in a constructed society. This research assumes that heavily tattooed individuals may be viewed as deviant, which can create problems associated with labeling and stigma. Consequently, these individuals need to develop ways to cope, and can do this by seeking out the company of like-minded people who can help them define away stigma. The central focus of this research will be on the social structures of the space (tattoo shops) and the individuals who visit it - more specifically on their interactions, conversations and experiences. Data were collected from both participant observation and semi-structured open ended interviews with participants. The results from this study demonstrate that tattoo shops are environments that can be interpreted as ‘new third places.’</description>

   <description>The objective of this research is to design an efficient and flexible implementation of parallel matrix multiplication for FPGA devices by&#xd;
analyzing the computation and studying its design space. In order to adapt to the FPGA platform, the design employs blocking&#xd;
and parallelization. Blocked matrix multiplication enables processing arbitrarily large matrices using limited memory capacity, and reduces the bandwidth requirements across the device boundaries by reusing available elements. Exploiting the inherent parallelism in the matrix multiplication computation improves the performance and utilizes the available reconfigurable FPGA resources.&#xd;
&#xd;
The design is constructed by identifying the main design decisions and evaluating the alternatives for each one. The considered design decisions include the scheduling of block transfers, the scheduling of arithmetic operations in a block multiplication, the extent to which the parallelism is exploited, determining the block sizes and shapes, and the use of double buffers for storing matrix blocks. The choices offered by each decision are evaluated analytically in terms of their performance and utilization of FPGA resources. Based on this analysis, a detailed, flexible design that accommodates various alternative design choices is described. The design is optimized for matrices of floating-point elements, and for the FPGA target platform. Prior work is analyzed based on the considered design choices in order&#xd;
to identify the similarities and the differences.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed design is implemented using the VHDL hardware description language. The implementation is used to verify the correctness of the design and to confirm the analysis of the design decisions. Correctness is verified both by simulation using the ModelSim logic simulator, and in hardware through compiling the implementation using the Altera Quartus II CAD software and testing it on the Altera DE4 board, featuring a Stratix IV EP4SGX530C2 FPGA device. The implementation supports a range of parameters to facilitate the experimental evaluation of design choices.&#xd;
&#xd;
Experimental results show that the design scales linearly with respect to the consumed resources. Although increasing the system size reduces the maximum operating frequency, it also increases the parallelism, resulting in a higher performance. For instance, with 8 floating-point arithmetic units, the system runs at 320 MHz, which corresponds to a performance of 4 GFLOPS, whereas with 64 arithmetic units, it runs at 160 MHz, which corresponds to a performance of 16 GFLOPS. It is also shown that using a transfer schedule based on inner products reduces the transfer time by up to 50% compared to other schedules. Although using square blocks minimizes the number of required block multiplications, other non-square blocks minimize the transfer time, resulting in better total times.</description>

   <description>Objective: To develop modular software to assess angular impulse and to determine the effect of a reduced dataset on the net angular impulse acting at the L5/S1 joint.&#xd;
Background. With the prevalence and incidence of lower back pain increasing annually, accurate assessment of physical job demands is needed. Many lab based approaches exist to measure the moments acting on the lower back, but require advanced and sensitive testing equipment. Of the methodologies currently used in industrial settings, most require significant contributions of time or money to be implemented. There is a need for cost and time effective methods to record a worker’s kinematic data over their whole shift.  &#xd;
Methods: Twelve participants performed 12 consecutive lifts under five lifting conditions: SQ00 (squat 0kg); SQ04 (squat 4kg); SQ10 (squat 10kg); FP04 (fast squat 4kg); ST04 (stoop 4kg). Kinematic data of the upper limbs, head, and trunk was recorded with external load data and kinetic analysis was performed by implementing an extension of the Hof (1992) method called the lined-segment engine (LSE) to calculate the angular impulse (N•m•s) acting on the L5/S1 joint.  &#xd;
Results: The LSE was sensitive to changes in load, lifting speed, and lifting posture (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in dynamic, quasi-static, or static models when calculating angular impulse, but there was a difference in the L5/S1 angular impulse when the upper limbs were removed from the dynamic LSE model (p &lt; 0.05). &#xd;
Conclusion: The LSE requires further refinement, but could be a generic approach to kinetic calculations. A scaled no-arms model for calculating the angular impulse acting on the low back could be used to assess field based lifting studies with 5.8% error.</description>

   <description>The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) is a highly utilized open source medical imaging library. Written in C++, ITK provides chiefly the functionality to register, segment, and filter medical images. Although extremely powerful, ITK has a very steep learning curve for users with little or no background in programming. It was for this reason that SimITK was developed. SimITK wraps ITK into the model driven engineering environment Simulink, a part of the Matlab development suite. The first released version of SimITK was a proof of concept, and demonstrated that ITK could be wrapped successfully in Simulink. Very few segmentation and registration functions were available and the system was based on ITK version 3 with a semi-automatic wrapping procedure.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis a new version of SimITK is presented that includes thirty-seven image filter, twelve optimizer, and nineteen transform classes from ITK version 4 which are successfully wrapped and tested. These classes were chosen to represent a broad range of usability (in the case of the filters) and to allow for greater flexibility when creating registration pipelines by having more options for optimizers, transforms, and metrics. Many usability improvements were also implemented for the registration pipeline, including providing the user with the metric value while executing a registration model and allowing the output image size to be specified for certain filters. In order for SimITK to transition to a usable research tool, several usability improvements were needed. These included transitioning from wrapping ITK version 3 to ITK version 4, fully automating the wrapping process, and usability modifications to the registration pipeline including a metric value output. &#xd;
&#xd;
These implementations of an automated wrapping procedure for ITK version 4, and improved usability of the registration pipeline have propelled SimITK on a path towards a usable research tool. The author will be creating a release of these changes, updating installation documentation, and updating tutorials which are available at www.SimITKVTK.com</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-08 21:15:41.691</description>
   <description>Background: Little is known about how abnormal communication from someone with schizophrenia is perceived by those interacting with the individual. The N400 event-related potential (ERP) is an index of how difficult it is to process incongruent words and is sensitive to context about the identity of the speaker. Knowledge of an individual’s diagnosis provides such context, and responses to a diagnosis have typically been examined from a stigma framework.&#xd;
Purpose: The current study aimed to examine the effect of context regarding the speaker, on the N400 ERP in the listener in response to speech that contained schizophrenia-associated communication abnormalities, and the relationship between the N400 and stigma.&#xd;
Methods: 73 first year undergraduate students listened to segments of conversation between two people while continuous EEG was recorded. Participants were told that the responder in the conversation was either a university student, had a stroke, had schizophrenia (and had recovered), or had schizophrenia (and symptoms were emphasized). The last word of the response in the conversation was varied to be a typical ending, a word approximation, or a neologism.&#xd;
Results: A significant N400 was observed over centro-parietal electrode sites in response to word approximations and neologisms when participants were told that the responder was a university student, but not in the other conditions. The amplitude of the N400 was significantly greater in response to neologisms than in response to word approximations. Participants also rated that they would be more likely to continue speaking to someone using typical words, than word approximations, and in both cases, more like than someone using neologisms. There was no significant relationship between the amplitude of the N400 and any of the stigma measures. &#xd;
Discussion: Telling participants either about the functional symptoms of schizophrenia, the diagnosis, or both resulted in a significantly reduced N400. This suggests a processing bias in which knowledge of either the symptoms or diagnosis of schizophrenia reduces the difficulty of integrating atypical speech. This does not appear to be a result of stigmatizing attitudes per se, but may be the result of an expectancy for someone with schizophrenia to communicate in abnormal ways.</description>

   <title>FOSTERING TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING FOR GRADE 3 STUDENTS PREPARING FOR EQAO EXAMINATIONS</title>
   <creator>Sheahan, Erin</creator>
   <subject>Transformative learning</subject>
   <subject>Reflective practice</subject>
   <description>All Grade 3 students in Ontario are required to write standardized examinations in June that test their abilities in both language and mathematics. Test results from the 2011- 2012 academic year of testing by the Educational Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) of Ontario indicated that my students were weakest at explaining their thinking when solving word problems in mathematics. I made it a personal teaching goal to model to students how to be more reflective about their learning in hopes that it would increase their ability to state their chosen strategies and become more thorough when providing their solutions.&#xd;
Transformative learning involves experiencing a deep, structural shift in the basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions (Maxwell, 2002, p. 18). Mezirow (1997, p. 7) describes transformative learning in these terms:&#xd;
We transform our frames of reference through critical reflection on the assumptions upon which our interpretations, beliefs, and habits of mind or points of view are based. We can become critically reflective of the assumptions we or others make when we learn to solve problems instrumentally or when we are involved in communicative learning.&#xd;
Following Mezirow’s definition that transformative learning is “a process by which previously uncritically assimilated assumptions, beliefs, values, and perspectives are questioned and thereby become more open, permeable, and better validated” (Cranton, 2006, p. 2), I argue that transformative learning can be achieved in some meaningful way for any type of learner at any age. Some suggest that transformative learning, which involves reflective practice and critical thinking, can only be achieved by adult learners. I believe that efforts to foster transformative learning for young learners are possible and should be developed in language that children can understand easily.&#xd;
In order to foster transformative learning for my students, I designed five phases to collect data to monitor student progress throughout the Grade 3 math curriculum. Each phase focused on specific strategies where I attempted to ignite my students’ critical thinking abilities. In search of evidence that transformative learning was taking place, I was guided by Mezirow’s 10 phases placed alongside my students’ mathematics responses and my qualitative notes on student dialogue.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-07 15:42:26.205</description>
   <description>A new background subtraction algorithm is proposed based on using a subspace&#xd;
model. The key components of the algorithm include a novel method for initializing&#xd;
the subspace and a robust update framework for continuously learning and improving&#xd;
the model. Unlike traditional subspace techniques the proposed approach does not&#xd;
require supervised or lengthy training data upfront, but instead is bootstrapped using&#xd;
a single background frame and exploiting spatial information in place of temporal&#xd;
data to generate pixel statistics for the model. The update framework allows for&#xd;
intelligently updating the model and re-initialization if required as determined by the&#xd;
algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed subspace algorithm out&#xd;
performed traditional subspace approaches and was comparable to and sometimes&#xd;
better than leading standard pixel-based techniques on several standard background&#xd;
subtraction data sets.</description>

   <description>It is a well-known fact that entering the teaching profession can be a challenge for nearly anyone (Kronowitz, 2004). Recently, the discussion has shifted to looking at strategies to assist the new teachers in making the transition (Portner, 2005; Sweeny, 2008), with an attempt in the province of Ontario through the implementation of a provincially mandated New Teacher Induction Program (NTIP) legislated 2006. Yet, since programs like Ontario’s NTIP are still fairly new, concerns exist as to the effectiveness and ideal structure of induction programs (Glassford &amp; Salinitri, 2007; Tait, 2005; Cherubini, 2009; Robinson, 1998; Johnson &amp; Kardos, 2010), with little recognition of the role of school culture only peripherally addressed within induction literature. Therefore, the intent of this study was to examine the experiences of new teachers who have previously completed the Ontario NTIP program in order to understand the impact of induction programs on the process of new teacher socialization. In order to carry out this study, a combination of document analysis and individual interviews was used. The findings reveal an emphasis upon evaluation within the program documents, unclear roles, the absence of school culture, and little information to ensure proper implementation of the program. Three themes emerged from the interviews. First, the participating new teachers identified the need for support beyond the first year of teaching. Secondly, there seemed to be a general confusion about NTIP with regards to elements, outcomes, and roles among the participants. Finally, responses indicated that mentoring was important for a teacher to feel comfortable in his or her role. Implications of this research extend to the design and long-term support specifically needed for new teachers, establishing the need for direct consideration of school culture and teaching context upon a new teachers’ transition. This research suggests that NTIP documentation be revised to consider all elements more appropriately and for school boards and schools to recognize the role of a new teacher within the environment, and attempt to establish a mentoring culture.</description>

   <description>Observers frequently make inferences of what consumers are like based on the products they use. The general view in social cognition is that the consumption behavior of others is taken at face value, where observers do not question the image being portrayed by product users. This assumption persists even though it is well known that consumers use products to manage the images they create. This dissertation aims to enrich our understanding of this issue by arguing that, under certain conditions, observers will make the inference that consumers use products to deliberately try to create certain impressions (i.e., perceptions as being phony, fake, or a poseur).  Specifically, these inferences will undermine the impression, creating more negative attitudes towards the consumer. In fact, this dissertation argues that this inference can also play an important role in consumer decision making, impacting product evaluations directly (i.e., when consumers avoid products because they are concerned that others will infer they are impression managing). Five experiments examined elements of the product, the target, the situation, and the observer themselves to better understand the causes and effects of inferences of impression management. Taken as a whole, this dissertation highlights the central roles of the product’s contribution towards the target’s appearance, the attractiveness of their appearance, product functionality and feelings of observer threat in shaping impression management inferences. In doing so, it contributes to the impression management and impression formation literatures, both in marketing and more broadly, by offering an organizing theoretical framework for understanding the bases of impression management judgments.</description>

   <description>The human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming α-subunits of the Kv11.1 channel that is responsible for the cardiac rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), which plays a critical role in cardiac repolarization. Dysfunction of hERG causes long QT syndrome (LQTS), a cardiac electrical disorder that can lead to severe cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (Mitcheson et al., 2000a; Roden, 2004; Maier et al., 2006; Misner et al., 2012). The overall function of hERG channels is dependent on the channel density at the plasma membrane as well as proper channel gating. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that degradation of hERG protein in the lysosome is regulated by ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2-mediated monoubiquitination (Sun et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2012). However, whether the internalized hERG proteins can be recycled back to the plasma membrane remains to be determined.&#xd;
     In the present study, we investigated the regulatory effects of various Rabs on hERG channels using Western blot analysis, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), whole-cell patch clamp and immunofluorescence microscopy. The data revealed that, among hERG, human Kv1.5 (cardiac ultra-rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel), and human EAG (ether-à-go-go gene) potassium channels, Rab4 selectively decreased the mature hERG protein expression on the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, Rab4 did not directly target the internalized hERG protein for recycling. Instead, Rab4 increased the expression level of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (Neural Precursor Cell-expressed Developmentally Downregulated Protein 4-2), which has been shown to mediate hERG ubiquitination and degradation (Guo et al., 2012). Nedd4-2 binding site mutations ∆1073 (binding site is removed) and Y1078A (binding site is modified) in hERG completely abolished the effect of Rab4. It has been shown that Nedd4-2 undergoes self-ubiquitination after targeting substrates (Bruce et al., 2008). My data further demonstrated that Rab4 decreased the degradation rate of Nedd4-2 and increased the rate of recycling. The increased Nedd4-2 then decreases hERG expression at the plasma membrane by targeting the PY-motif in the C-terminus of hERG channels.&#xd;
     In summary, the present study showed that Rab4 decreases the expression and function of hERG potassium channels on the plasma membrane through enhancing the recycling of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2.</description>

   <description> The  rapidly  activating  delayed  rectifier  potassium   channel  (IKr)  encoded  by  the  human  ether-­a-­go-­go  related  gene  (hERG)  is  a  crucial   component  of cardiac  repolarization  of  the  action  potential.  The   gating  kinetics  of  the  channel  and  the  number  of  channels  on  the  membrane  determine  the   degree  of  current  flowing  through  hERG  channels.  Membrane  channel  density  is  directly   related  to  a  balance  between  protein  trafficking  and  degradation.  While  hERG  channel   trafficking  has  been  studied  in  the  past  decade,  recently  our  lab  and  others  have  made  new   discoveries  regarding  hERG  degradation.  These  studies  show  that  Neural  Down  Regulated   Gene  4  subtype  2  (Nedd4-­‐2)  is  the  ligase  that  covalently  attaches  ubiquitin  to  the  hERG   channel  and  facilitates  degradation  (Albesa  et  al.,  2011;Guo  et  al.,  2012).  Given  these   findings,  my  goal/objective  was  to  study  the  molecular  mechanisms  that  control  the   destructive  effects  of  Nedd4-­‐2  on  the  hERG  channel.  In  the  present  study,  I  demonstrated   that  overexpression  of  the  stress-­‐responsive  serum-­‐  and  glucocorticoid-­‐inducible  kinase   (SGK)  isoforms  SGK1  and  SGK3  increase  the  current  and  expression  level  of  the  membrane-­‐ localized  mature  proteins  of  hERG  channels  stably  expressed  in  HEK  293  (hERG-­‐HEK)  cells.   I  have  found  that  the  overexpression  of  SGK1  and  SGK3  increased  Nedd4-­‐2   phosphorylation,  which  is  known  to  inhibit  Nedd4-­‐2  activity.  Furthermore,  the  synthetic   glucocorticoid,  dexamethasone,  increased  the  current  and  abundance  of  mature  ERG   proteins  in  both  hERG-­‐HEK  cells  and  neonatal  rat  cardiac  myocytes  through  the   enhancement  of  SGK1  but  not  SGK3  expression.  Additionally,  disruption  of  Rab11  proteins   led  to  a  complete  elimination  of  SGK-­‐mediated  increase  in  hERG  expression.  These  results   indicate  that  SGK  enhances  the  expression  level  of  mature  hERG  channels  by  inhibiting   Nedd4-­‐2  as  well  as  by  promoting  Rab11-­‐mediated  hERG  recycling.</description>

   <title>Undoing Addiction: The Biopolitics of Social Suffering in Contemporary Canadian Fiction</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-09 16:42:38.782</description>
   <description>Biomedical and popular discourses for understanding addiction persistently essentialize behaviors labelled “addictive” as signifying individual dysfunction and aberrance; the Canadian novels examined in this study expose how such dominant interpretive discourses strategically obfuscate the role of systemic inequalities in producing and replicating social suffering, which becomes stigmatized as “addiction.” By evoking and subverting dominant tropes of addiction narratives, these novels attest to the ways that such tropes work to sustain class, gender, and racial inequalities through a sacrificial disavowal of those who call attention to the inevitable human costs of disciplinary power. This study therefore tracks the ways in which selected Canadian addiction narratives challenge the pathologizing nature of dominant literary and cultural discourses of addiction, foreground the logic of sacrifice those discourses demand, and denaturalize the biopolitical circuitry in which those discourses appear. Undoing Addiction ultimately proposes that an emergent genre of Canadian writing about addiction conditions a new cultural literacy—one that fosters alternative interpretations of addiction that account for and struggle against the systemic inequalities by which addiction is engendered and sustained.</description>

   <description>In the present study, the researcher examined the motivational variables of students within the Ontario Secondary School system, where groups based on course stream, LD status, gender, and achievement level were compared. This research was partially exploratory, where the researcher aimed to validate existing research on gender, LD status, and achievement, as well as to examine how motivational variables relate to course stream. Past research has shown that endorsing an entity theory of intelligence, having a preference for performance goals, attributing success to ability rather than effort, and having low confidence in one’s ability to self-regulate are all associated with lower achievement, and with the presence of a learning disability (e.g., Baird, Scott, Dearing &amp; Hamill, 2009).&#xd;
A total of 243 secondary school students (127 male, 116 female) from one rural school in Ontario participated in this study. The participants completed a 28-item questionnaire made up of several subscales, including the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (Dweck, 1999), the Learning vs. Performance Goal Preference Scale (Dweck, 1999), the Effort Attribution Scale (Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988), and the Self-Efficacy for Self-Regulated Learning Scale (Zimmerman et al., 1992). Regarding stream, an independent t-test revealed that students in the university English course had significantly more confidence in their ability to self-regulate than their peers in the college English course. A MANOVA revealed that individuals who had received a mid-term English grade of A (80-100%), regardless of stream, had significantly more confidence their ability to self-regulate than students who received lower grades. Finally, an independent t-test revealed that participants with a learning disability were more concerned with their personal growth than their performance when compared to participants without a learning disability. No differences in motivational variables were found between males and females. These findings suggest that educators and parents should place more emphasis on helping students to develop confidence in their self-regulatory abilities, as this appears to be an important variable in students’ achievement, as well as related to the academic stream in which they are enrolled.</description>

   <description>In this thesis I undertake a study of Canadian municipal open data initiatives in order to assess the current state of the programs and to gauge the role(s) that these initiatives may play in regards to improving public engagement in local government issues.  After an initial literature review, I adopt two separate approaches.  The first approach involves the creation of an inventory and evaluation of the contents of all twenty three (23) Canadian municipal open data catalogues in existence during the summer of 2012.  The second approach involves asking questions of key informants in the field through the execution of nineteen (19) semi-structured interviews with open data experts from both government and civic realms in ten (10) case study cities across the country.&#xd;
The results of the research illustrate the major differences and similarities between the structure, output, and roles of open data initiatives in various Canadian cities.  The data provided by these programs mostly consists of politically neutral geographic data, though there are a few exceptions.  I find two major program structures in Canadian cities: (1) The first type of open data program is created and operates within a specific municipal department and the (2) second type of program operates across a number of departments.  Each approach has its own benefits and challenges.  The open data initiatives across Canadian cities also appear to have different approaches to public engagement.  Several cities have developed strong collaborative relationships with local open data advocates which are explored in some detail.  Larger themes about the current state of open data, its current and future role, and the challenges faced by operators and users, are also described in this thesis.   I conclude with some recommendations for improving municipal open data initiatives in the future.</description>

   <title>Essays on Rollover Risk, Bank Loans, and Financial Regulation</title>

   <subject>Rollover risk</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-12 14:59:23.32</description>
   <description>My dissertation consists of three chapters that address the issues of rollover risk, shareholders' risk taking, and financial regulation, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first chapter surveys the literature on rollover risk, the q theory of investment, and the dynamics of capital&#xd;
structure. When the market liquidity shocks intensify, equity holders' rollover losses become substantial, which&#xd;
amplifies the agency conflict between creditors and equity holders. The marginal value of liquidity plays an important&#xd;
role in determining corporate cash management, financing, hedging, payout and investment policies, especially when the&#xd;
level of internal cash is extremely low. All these variables are endogenous, as a result of which they together&#xd;
characterize a firm's optimal capital structure.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
The second chapter focuses on rollover risk in the context of corporate finance. In this chapter, I identify a special&#xd;
channel (the long-term debt maturity structure) through which the credit crisis of 2008 affected corporate investment.&#xd;
I provide empirical evidence of shareholders' risk-shifting behavior in the investment decisions by exploiting the real&#xd;
effects of ex-ante heterogeneity of long-term debt maturity structure. The first hypothesis, which examines the&#xd;
relationship between financial frictions and risk-shifting behavior. The second hypothesis, which studies the&#xd;
effectiveness of debt covenants in mitigating agency conflicts.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
 In the third chapter, I investigates the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve Bank's Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) in restoring the stability of large and complex financial institutions.&#xd;
 Using hand-collected data from the Federal Reserve Board, I evaluate the consequences of the Fed's intervention in the short-term credit market.&#xd;
  I first show that (recipient) banks with access to the Commercial Paper Funding Facility earned significantly higher abnormal returns than those without this access.&#xd;
  Second, my empirical findings indicate that liquidity backstop facilitated lending from recipient banks to their relationship borrowers.&#xd;

   <description>The topic of Markov Random Fields (MRFs) has been well studied in the past, and has found practical use in various image processing, and machine learning applications.  Where coding is concerned, MRF specific schemes have been largely unexplored.  In this thesis, an overview is given of recent developments and challenges in the lossless coding of MRFs.  Specifically, we concentrate on difficulties caused by computational intractability due to the partition function of the MRF.  One proposed solution to this problem is to segment the MRF with a cutset, and encode the components separately.  Using this method, arithmetic coding is possible via the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm.  We consider two cases of the BP algorithm:  MRFs with only simple cliques, and MRFs with complex cliques.  In the latter case, we study a minimum radius condition requirement for ensuring that all cliques are accounted for during coding.  This condition also simplifies the process of conditioning on observed sites.  Finally, using these results, we develop a systematic procedure of clustering and choosing cutsets.</description>

   <description>This study was conducted to investigate the extent to which affectionate physical contact (i.e., cuddling) affects preschoolers’ and parents’ abilities to engage in theory-of-mind reasoning. We explored the hypothesis that if affectionate contact affected theory-of-mind, then preschoolers and parents who cuddled would outperform those who did not. To test this hypothesis, we recruited 44 preschool aged children (3.8-4.6-year-olds) and their primary caregivers. We found that children who cuddled with their primary caregiver during a storybook reading task performed significantly better on theory-of-mind tasks compared to children who did not receive a cuddle. Importantly, our findings support the contention that affectionate contact affected children’s performance on theory-of-mind related tasks specifically, but not performance on executive functioning or non-mental representation tasks. &#xd;
A secondary goal of this study was to explore whether any effects of affectionate contact would be mediated by functional polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). Although we were unable to obtain a sample size that was sufficient to directly test this hypothesis, we found that parents homozygous for the G allele at rs2254298 were significantly better at decoding the affective mental states of others compared to those who carried at least one A allele. Thus, our results support the hypotheses that affectionate contact promotes children’s theory-of-mind reasoning abilities and that adult’s mental state decoding skills can be predicted by allelic variations on the OXTR gene. This study offers preliminary support for the role of affectionate contact and, separately, the oxytocinergic system on tasks related to theory-of-mind reasoning. These claims are discussed with respect to possible alternative explanations for our findings, as well as future directions to directly test the extent to which such experiential and psychobiological factors can affect theory-of-mind reasoning.</description>

   <description>Krumhansl (1990) has proposed that our sense of tonality is based, in part, on the perception and internal representation of the hierarchies of pitch class salience in music. It has further been proposed that regularities in pitch patterns may be acquired through statistical learning. To further explore this proposal, we conducted two experiments in which musically untrained participants were exposed to tone sequences generated from one of two pitch profiles: Lydian or Hypophrygian. Tone sequences were randomly generated from event frequency profiles computed by Huron and Veltman (2006), with frequencies converted to probability of occurrence. Exposure trials consisted of 100 sequences generated from one mode for half the participants and from the other mode for the remaining participants. Sequences generated from the unexposed mode appeared in test trials only. Following the exposure trials, testing involved pairing exposed and unexposed tone sequences at each of three levels of distinctiveness. Versions of the tone sequences were constructed to be more or less distinctive following an algorithm described by Smith &amp; Schmuckler (2004). In Experiment 1, participants were asked to record which pair member they preferred and in Experiment 2, participants were asked to record which pair member was more familiar. In both experiments, both groups received the same test pairs. Results of Experiment 1 indicated no preference for any tone sequence type. However, results of Experiment 2 revealed participants had acquired knowledge of the exposed pitch distribution, and were able to generalize to the more distinctive level. The findings support those of Loui, Wessel, and Hudson Kam (2010) in terms of a dissociation between recognition and preference. We suggest this may be due to methodology, stimulus-type and participant strategy. The findings also support Krumhansl (1990), as salient pitches appear to be important in the recognition of pitch probability profiles.</description>

   <description>Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes behavioural, growth and central nervous system deficits in the offspring, termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Our lab has previously shown that structured saccadic eye movement tasks probe executive functioning and can be used to measure cognitive dysfunction in children with an FASD, because performance of these tasks reflects the structural integrity of brain areas shown to be vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. Recently developed portable electroencephalographic (EEG) devices record brain activity using a single dry-sensor electrode. Our objectives were: 1) to assess attention and working memory via a delayed memory-guided saccadic eye movement task of varying mnemonic load and 2) to explore the use of a portable single-channel EEG recording device in measuring differences in frontal lobe activity in children with FASD during the performance of this eye movement task. Methods: A total of 18 children with an FASD diagnosis and 19 typically developing control children performed a memory-guided saccadic eye movement task with one, two or three target stimuli. During the task, frontal lobe EEG was recorded using the Neurosky Mindwave Mobile® portable recording device. &#xd;
Results: In the delayed, memory-guided task when two or three target stimuli were required to be held in working memory, children with an FASD performed the task correctly less often than children in the control group. During task performance, children with FASD exhibited a reduction in theta frequency band power, and in alpha frequency band power only at higher mnemonic loads, suggesting that children with FASD recruited more cognitive resources to complete the task. &#xd;
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that a portable EEG recording device can be used to assist in the recognition of underlying neural mechanisms of executive functioning deficits in children with FASD. Portable devices offer greater user comfort than typical EEG recording equipment as well as flexibility for use outside the laboratory. This could greatly facilitate the study of children with FASD, and other groups who may be less tolerant of typical laboratory environments.</description>

   <title>Functional Interrogation of microRNA-375 in Merkel Cell Carcinoma</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Pathology &amp; Molecular Medicine) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-15 09:59:09.832</description>
   <description>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but highly aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous cancer whose molecular biology is poorly characterized. Our broad research objective is to identify microRNAs (miRNA) that are biologically and/or clinically important in MCC. While attempting to establish an MCC-specific miRNA signature, we observed that microRNA-375 was the most highly expressed miRNA in primary MCC tumours relative to normal skin – an observation that I propose reflects miR-375’s specific association with neuroendocrine (NE) and secretory subpopulations within normal tissues. &#xd;
	Here, I report that miR-375 is strikingly elevated in a range of NE tumour types compared with tissue-matched cancers of non-neuroendocrine origin. Furthermore, I show that miR-375 is expressed abundantly in a subset of MCC cell lines that possess the biochemical and immunohistochemical characteristics of NE cells, but is silenced in cell lines that fail to retain these markers. I demonstrate that the enforced expression of miR-375 induces a NE gene expression signature – a phenomenon that is mechanistically driven by the post-transcriptional repression of multiple Notch pathway components by miR-375. This work identifies the Notch pathway as a novel mechanistic link between the association of miR-375 and a NE cell fate, provides new insights into the cellular ancestry of MCC, and suggests that miR-375 could facilitate clinicopathological diagnosis of MCC and other NE tumours as a novel biomarker.&#xd;
	 miR-375 is silenced in “variant” MCC cell lines, and inversely correlates with cell doubling time and overall aggressiveness. Therefore, despite its high expression in most MCC tumours, I propose that miR-375 is an endogenous tumour suppressor. I show that the enforced expression of miR-375 inhibits cell viability, impairs cell migration and invasion, can oppose survival under stress, and represses the AKT pro-survival signaling pathway. Only siRNA-mediated inhibition of Notch2 and Recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ) phenocopied the effects of miR-375 overexpression. Because variant (miR-375low) cell lines originate from more aggressive tumours in both MCC and small cell lung carcinoma, I postulate that miR-375 silencing occurs in a subset of MCC patients and might predispose them to a highly virulent clinical course through the disinhibition of Notch signaling.</description>

   <title>Optimization of Batteries for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-16 15:19:20.333</description>
   <description>This thesis presents a method to quickly determine the optimal battery for an electric vehicle given a set of vehicle characteristics and desired performance metrics. The model is based on four independent design variables: cell count, cell capacity, state-of-charge window, and battery chemistry. Performance is measured in seven categories: cost, all-electric range, maximum speed, acceleration, battery lifetime, lifetime greenhouse gas emissions, and charging time. The performance of each battery is weighted according to a user-defined objective function to determine its overall fitness.&#xd;
The model is informed by a series of battery tests performed on scaled-down battery samples. Seven battery chemistries were tested for capacity at different discharge rates, maximum output power at different charge levels, and performance in a real-world automotive duty cycle. The results of these tests enable a prediction of the performance of the battery in an automobile. Testing was performed at both room temperature and low temperature to investigate the effects of battery temperature on operation.&#xd;
The testing highlighted differences in behavior between lithium, nickel, and lead based batteries. Battery performance decreased with temperature across all samples with the largest effect on nickel-based chemistries. Output power also decreased with lead acid batteries being the least affected by temperature. Lithium-ion batteries were found to be highly efficient (>95%) under a vehicular duty cycle; nickel and lead batteries have greater losses.&#xd;
Low temperatures hindered battery performance and resulted in accelerated failure in several samples. Lead acid, lead tin, and lithium nickel alloy batteries were unable to complete the low temperature testing regime without losing significant capacity and power capability. This is a concern for their applicability in electric vehicles intended for cold climates which have to maintain battery temperature during long periods of inactivity.&#xd;
Three sample optimizations were performed: a compact car, a, truck, and a sports car. The compact car benefits from increased battery capacity despite the associated higher cost. The truck returned the smallest possible battery of each chemistry, indicating that electrification is not advisable. The sports car optimization resulted in the largest possible battery, indicating large performance from increased electrification. These results mirror the current state of the electric vehicle market.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I will examine how objects are given narrative voices by memorial museum curators, and how these narrative qualities facilitate ethical and critical relations between museumgoers and traumatic histories. My two main points of contention arise out of these questions: 1. What does it mean for an object to be a witness in the context of trauma? 2. What might the material dimensions of witnessing accomplish in regards to museumgoers understanding of and ability to respond to their memorial museum experience? Instead of being silent witnesses to the past, I propose that objects can become contact points of ethical engagement and understanding when it concerns traumatic events in history. The ability and necessity of seeing objects as more than mere things to be manipulated by language and curatorial framing is crucial in cases of trauma, as they can become portals that can help overcome the “constitutive failure of linguistic representation in the post-Holocaust, post-Hiroshima, post-Vietnam era” (Leys, p. 267f). This thesis will contribute to the theoretical and museological conversation concerning objects and their representation in the aftermath of trauma, with an emphasis on interobjectivity as a tool to combat consumptive empathy. Stressing the dialogic and relational functions of material witnesses will underscore the ultimate responsibility of the museumgoer to take on the role of secondary witness, a position that is perhaps fraught with unclear obligations, but is nevertheless crucial in the transmission of difficult histories.</description>

   <description>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are injuries that often require surgery and physical therapy. Previous research have shown that patients after ACL reconstruction develop a compensatory mechanism called quadriceps avoidance where the use of the quadriceps is avoided and greater knee flexion is demonstrated during gait. Quadriceps avoidance is considered to be an abnormal movement pattern that can have negative effects after ACL reconstruction especially when it is adopted for a long time. While quadriceps avoidance has been well documented in gait, it has not been researched much in more strenuous functional movements such as the forward lunge that often comprise physical activity.&#xd;
The knowledge about the quadriceps avoidance characteristics that an ACL reconstruction brings about during functional movement is limited; thus not much is known regarding the long-term functional outcomes of ACL reconstruction. Thus, the main purpose of this investigation was to quantitatively examine the quadriceps avoidance characteristics of an ACLR group during four phases of a forward lunge by comparing them to the same characteristics of a healthy control group and the uninvolved group.&#xd;
Nineteen participants (13 healthy control, 6 ACLR) were recruited for this study. Reflective motion capture markers were attached to participants who completed 10 repetitions of the forward lunge onto a force platform with each leg alternating leading legs with their arms across their chest. Using marker and force platform data, the moments about the knee in three dimensions were computed. There were no differences between control and ACLR participants in any of the knee moment outcome measures in any of the four phases along the sagittal, frontal, and transverse anatomical planes that were investigated (p > 0.05). No differences in knee moments indicate that ACLR limbs exhibited a level of quadriceps avoidance that was not different than the level exhibited by healthy control or uninvolved limbs when lunging forward. These findings suggest that current treatment methods are able to restore normal quadriceps avoidance characteristics and the injury risk posed by these characteristics to ACLR individuals are no greater than the risk posed to healthy individuals when participating in full physical activity after surgery.</description>

   <description>Spine needle injections are widely applied to alleviate pain and to remove nerve sensation through anesthesia. Current treatment is performed either blindly having no image guidance or using fluoroscopy or computed tomography (CT). Both CT and fluoroscopy guidance expose patients to ionizing radiation. Alternatively, ultrasound (US) guidance for spine needle procedures is becoming more prevalent since US is a non-ionizing and more accessible image modality. An inherent challenge to US imaging of the spine is the acoustic shadows created by the bony structures of the vertebra limiting visibility.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is challenging to use US as the sole imaging modality for intraoperative guidance of spine needle injections. However, it is possible to enhance the anatomical information through a preoperative diagnostic CT. To achieve this, image registration between the CT and the US images is proposed in this thesis. Image registration integrates the anatomical information from the CT with the US images. The aligned CT augments anatomical visualization for the clinician during spinal interventions.   &#xd;
&#xd;
To align the preoperative CT and intraoperative US, a novel registration pipeline is presented that involves automatic global and multi-vertebrae registration. The registration pipeline is composed of two distinct phases: preoperative and intraoperative. Preoperatively, artificial spring points are selected between adjacent vertebrae. Intraoperatively, the lumbar spine is first aligned between the CT and US followed by a multi-vertebrae registration. The artificial springs are used to constrain the movement of the individually transformed vertebrae to ensure the optimal alignment is a pose of the lumbar spine that is physically possible. &#xd;
&#xd;
Validation of the algorithm is performed on five clinical patient datasets. A protocol for US data collection was created to eliminate variability in the quality of acquired US images. The registration pipeline was able to register the datasets from initial misalignments of up to 25 mm with a mean TRE of 1.17 mm. From these results, it is evident that the proposed registration pipeline offers a robust registration between clinical CT and US data.</description>

   <description>Municipalities are experiencing a growing water management challenge as a result of population growth in water-dependent communities. The rising cost of potable water, in addition to limits placed on stormwater discharges, provide opportunities for the wide-scale implementation of stormwater reuse. This thesis presents a feasibility analysis of a novel site-level stormwater reuse concept for commercial developments in Canada. Historical rainfall data and SWMM 5.0 were used to evaluate the hydrologic potential of the reuse system to replace potable water for end-use demands of toilet flushing and garden irrigation on single- and multi-tenant commercial sites. Performance criteria were used to evaluate: (i) the volume and percent potable water replaced with reclaimed stormwater, (ii) the volume and frequency of potable water ‘top-ups’ to the reclaimed stormwater storage facility, and (iii) the volume and frequency of overflows in the reclaimed stormwater storage facility. A discounted payback method was used to determine the length of time (in years) required for annual water savings to equal the initial capital investment of the stormwater reuse system. The analysis was performed from the perspective of the private landowner in six Canadian locations, including Vancouver, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Quebec City. The methodology and results presented is intended to provide insight to landowners and municipal bodies on the potential of site-level stormwater reuse to aid large-scale adaption and implementation. The results suggest that regions with high average annual rainfall depths produce high potable water replacement rates ranging from 64% to 99% while cities that experience seasonal arid conditions and lower average annual rainfall depths achieve lower potable water replacement rates in the range of 30% and 83%. The test locations of Vancouver and Quebec achieved longer payback periods of 10 years to 26 years due to the relative low cost of potable water. The Saskatoon and Regina locations produced shorter payback periods ranging from 3 to 6 years due to the higher potable water prices. Toronto was found to have relatively short payback periods ranging from 4 to 5 years on account of its high potable water replacement rates and high potable water prices.</description>

   <description>The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is part of an integrative network that functions to restore homeostasis following injury and infection. The SNS provides negative feedback control over inflammation through the secretion of catecholamines from postganglionic sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells (ACCs). Central autonomic structures receive information regarding the inflammatory status of the body and reflexively modulate SNS activity. Evidence suggests that inflammation and infection can also directly regulate ACC function. However, the precise alterations in ACC function that occur in response to regional inflammation, systemic inflammation and exposure to bacterial products have yet to be fully characterized. The present thesis was therefore performed to test the hypothesis that gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic inflammation modulate ACC Ca2+ signaling, and that ACCs possess the ability to directly detect microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs).&#xd;
     Ca2+ signaling was assessed in single ACCs isolated from control mice and mice with GI or systemic inflammation using Ca2+ imaging and perforated patch clamp electrophysiology. Acute and chronic GI inflammation consistently reduced high-K+-stimulated Ca2+ transients in ACCs through an inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ current. In contrast, systemic inflammation significantly enhanced high-K+-stimulated Ca2+ transients and catecholamine secretion through an increase in Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Incubation of control ACCs in serum obtained from mice with systemic inflammation produced a similar increase in Ca2+ signaling, suggesting that circulating mediators play an important role in this response.&#xd;
     To determine whether ACCs can directly detect MAMPs, Ca2+ signaling, excitability and neurotransmitter release were assessed in control ACCs and ACCs incubated in media containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Unlike GI and systemic inflammation, LPS did not affect ACC Ca2+ signaling. However, LPS dose- and time-dependently hyperpolarized ACC resting membrane potential and enhanced large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ currents. Consistent with membrane hyperpolarization, LPS reduced ACC excitability and inhibited neuropeptide Y release. These effects were mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB.&#xd;
     In summary, GI and systemic inflammation produce opposite effects on ACC Ca2+ signaling through distinct mechanisms, and ACCs can directly detect MAMPs. These findings extend our knowledge of the complex integration performed by the immune system-nervous system network during health and disease.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-20 20:46:56.897</description>
   <description>An accurate determination of muscle force is desired in many applications in different fields such as ergonomics, sports medicine, prosthetics, human-robot interaction and medical rehabilitation. Since individual muscle forces cannot be directly measured, force estimation using recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals has been extensively studied. This usually involves interpretation and analysis of the recorded EMG to estimate the underlying neuromuscular activity which is related to the force produced by the muscle. Although invasive needle electrode EMG recordings have provided substantial information about neuromuscular activity at the motor unit (MU) level, there is a risk of discomfort, injury and infection. Thus, non-invasive methods are preferred and surface EMG (SEMG) recording is widely used. However, physiological and non-physiological factors, including phase cancelation, tissue filtering, cross-talk from other muscles and non-optimal electrode placement, affect the accuracy of SEMG-based force estimation. In addition, the relative movement of the muscle bulk and the innervation zone (IZ) with respect to the electrode attached to the skin are two major challenges to overcome in force estimation during dynamic contractions.&#xd;
&#xd;
The objective of this work is to improve the accuracy of SEMG-based force estimation under static conditions, and devise methods that can be applied to force estimation under dynamic conditions. To achieve this objective, a novel calibration technique is proposed, which corrects for variations in the SEMG with changing joint angle. In addition, a modeling technique, namely parallel cascade identification (PCI) that can deal with non-linearities and dynamics in the SEMG-force relationship is applied to the force estimation problem. Finally, a novel integrated sensor  that senses both SEMG and surface muscle pressure (SMP) is developed and the two signal modalities are used as input to a force prediction model.&#xd;
&#xd;
The experimental results show significant improvement in force prediction using data calibrated with the proposed calibration method, compared to using non-calibrated data. Joint angle dependency and the sensitivity to the location of the sensor in the SEMG-force relationship is reduced with calibration. The SEMG-force estimation error, averaged over all subjects, is reduced by 44\% for PCI modeling compared to another modeling technique (fast orthogonal search) applied to the same dataset. Significantly improved force estimation results are also achieved for dynamic contractions when joint angle based calibration and PCI are combined. Using SMP in addition to SEMG leads to significantly better force estimation compared to using only SEMG signals.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed methods have the potential to be combined and used to obtain better force estimation in more complicated dynamic contractions and for applications such as improved control of remote robotic systems or powered prosthetic limbs.</description>

   <description>To better manage deteriorating infrastructure, quantitative data about the performance of infrastructure assets is required. Rayleigh based distributed fibre optic strain sensing (FOS) is a technology that has the potential to offer this type of data and unlike traditional strain sensors it can measure the strain along the full length of the structure.  &#xd;
	A series of experiments were undertaken to develop installation techniques and evaluate sensor accuracy for typical civil engineering materials: steel, concrete and reinforced concrete. The results of these experiments showed that the choice of sensing fibre and adhesive was dependent on the material being monitored. When the sensing fibre and adhesive are chosen correctly, the Rayleigh system can provide the same accuracy as a strain gauge for steel and concrete, and useful measurements can be obtained even in areas of concrete cracking.&#xd;
	The FOS technique was utilized to determine whether distributed strain measurements could be used to detect and quantify localized deterioration of the steel reinforcement (localized area reductions of 0-30%) at service loads. A series of specimens was tested, the sensing system was able to detect the presence of localized deterioration with embedded nylon and polyimide fibres, but the nylon fibre cannot quantify large strain gradients due to slip within the sensing fibre. The strain profiles gave insights to the failure mechanism occurring in the reinforced concrete specimens. The strain profiles for both test series indicated that the tension reinforcement was acting as a tension tie and the strain profiles suggested the presence of compressive struts indicative of an arching mechanism in the specimens.&#xd;
	The Black River bridge in Madoc, Ontario was instrumented with fibre optics sensors to determine whether the use of FOS is both practical and beneficial for reinforced concrete bridge assessment when compared to conventional instrumentation. The FOS showed reasonably good agreement with conventional sensors. The fibre optic strain results are used to calculate curvature, slope and displacement but careful consideration of the boundary conditions is required. The results from the fibre optic sensors can be used to show the bridge load distribution and give insights into the support conditions of the beams.</description>

   <description>PakB is a p21-activated kinase that phosphorylates and activates class I myosins in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. PakB co-localizes with myosin-I to actin-rich regions of the cell, including macropinocytic cups and the leading edge of migrating cells. Here we show that the cellular localization of PakB depends on the N-terminal region which contains an actin filament binding module and two proline-rich motifs that  interact with the SH3 domain of actin-binding protein 1 (dAbp1).  dAbp1 co-localized with PakB to actin-rich sites, but in PakBˉ (PakB null) cells dAbp1 adopted a diffuse cytosolic distribution. Overexpression of dAbp1 in PakBˉ cells produced SH3 domain-dependent defects in early development, cell polarization and chemotaxis. We conclude that PakB plays a critical role in regulating the cellular functions of the dAbp1 SH3 domain.&#xd;
PakBˉ cells exhibited a disrupted cortical actin layer and were extremely sensitive to external stresses induced by compression and electroporation. PakBˉ cells showed severe chemotaxis defects when forced to migrate under agarose.  The defects were rescued by expression of full-length PakB but not an N-terminal fragment of PakB. The results suggest that loss of PakB kinase activity is responsible for the cortical defects. Immunoblot analysis showed that phosphorylation of MyoD at the TEDS site was significantly reduced in PakBˉ cells.  We propose that activation of myosin-I motor activity by PakB plays a critical role in stabilizing the cortical actin cytoskeleton.&#xd;
D. discoideum myosin-II heavy chain kinase A (MHCK-A) is a member of the alpha-kinase family.  Competition experiments with Mant-ADP showed that MHCK-A bound ATP with Ki values of 18 and 160 µM in the presence and absence of Mg2+, respectively.  ADP and AMP bound 3-fold and 9-fold more weakly than ATP, respectively. The results show that Mg2+ and the nucleotide phosphoryl groups substantially contribute to binding. Mutations of residues in the Pi-pocket and N/D-loop reduced the binding affinity for MgATP, showing that both regulatory sites are coupled to the active site.  Phosphorylation of SPOT peptide arrays with MHCK-A revealed a consensus sequence of T-φ/K-φ/K-K/R and showed also phosphorylation of non-Thr-containing peptides.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores processes of social movement organizing in response to the neoliberal restructuring of public services in South Africa. Through a case study of an alliance of municipal workers and community activists collaborating to contest public service commercialization in Cape Town, this thesis examines the limits and possibilities of contemporary efforts to build labour community alliances.&#xd;
In many parts of the world, particularly Latin America, broad coalitions including community organizations and labour unions have formed to defend public services and propose alternatives to market delivery. Despite widespread discontent, rising levels of poverty, increasing inequality and the success of anti-privatization coalitions elsewhere in the world, a sustained and successful movement has not emerged in South Africa. &#xd;
Situated in the debates within social geography on South African neoliberalism and those in the labour and social movement literature on labour-community alliances, this thesis argues that several factors serve to frustrate coalition formation in the present. These include the organizational and institutional complexities and heterogeneity of partner organizations, the fragmenting effect of a diverse and problematic socio-cultural context, and the disabling political economy of South Africa at the fore of which is the enduring hegemonic project of the ANC.&#xd;
Highly interrelated, these factors ultimately continue to thwart attempts to build a social movement to effectively challenge and move beyond the neoliberal restructuring of public services in Cape Town. However, this thesis argues that openings and spaces for the emergence of labour-community alliances and deep coalitions do exist, and concludes that the outlook for the emergence of transformative movements in Cape Town is not so bleak as the complexity and fragmentation of the present may suggest.</description>

   <description>Water utilities are facing pressure to continue to provide high-quality potable water in an increasingly energy constrained world; managing the ageing infrastructure that exists in many countries is a challenge in and of itself, but recently this has been coupled with political and public attention to the environmental impacts of the distribution system. Utility managers need to take a holistic approach to decision-making in order to determine all of the impacts of their plans.&#xd;
&#xd;
The intention of this thesis is to present a set of considerations for utility planners and managers to provide clarity to the trade-offs associated with any pipe replacement decision. This research has examined the energy relationships between operational energy reduction and the embodied energy tied to replacing deteriorated pipes in water distribution networks. These relationships were investigated through the development and application of a life-cycle energy analysis (LCEA) for three different pipe replacement schedules developed with the intent to reduce leakage in the system. The results showed that the embodied energy for pipe replacement is significant even when compared against the large amount of energy required to operate a large-scale water utility. The annual operational energy savings of between 8.9 and 9.6 million kWh achieved by 2070 through pipe replacement comes at a cost; 0.88-2.05 million kWh/mile for replacement with ductile iron pipes with diameters of 6” to 16” respectively. This imbalance resulted in a maximum energy payback period of 17.6 years for the most aggressive replacement plan in the first decade. Some of the assumptions that were used to complete the LCEA were investigated through a sensitivity analysis; specific factors that were numerically queried in this chapter include the break rate forecasting method, pumping efficiency, the leakage duration and the flow rate per leakage event.&#xd;
&#xd;
Accurate accounting of energy requirements for pipe replacement will become even more important as energy and financial constraints continue to increase for most water utilities, this thesis provides guidance on some of the complex relationships that need to be considered.</description>

   <title>Improving the Left Degree Distribution of Fountain Codes in the Finite-Length Regime</title>

   <description>Fountain codes were introduced to provide higher reliability, lower complexities, and&#xd;
more scalability for networks such as the Internet. In this thesis, we study Luby-&#xd;
Transform (LT) codes which are the  realization of Fountain codes. In the LT&#xd;
codes, a sparse random factor graph is dynamically generated on both the encoder&#xd;
and decoder sides of the communications channel. The graph is generated from an&#xd;
ensemble degree distribution. The LT codes are also known as rateless codes, in the&#xd;
sense that they can generate potentially limitless codeword symbols from original data&#xd;
and self-adjust to channels with different erasure probabilities. LT Codes also have a&#xd;
very low encoding and decoding complexities when comparing with some traditional&#xd;
block codes, e.g., Reed Solomon (RS) codes and Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC)&#xd;
codes. Therefore, LT Codes are suitable for many different kinds of applications such&#xd;
as broadcast transmission. LT codes achieve the capacity of the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) asymptotically and universally. For  finite lengths, the search is continued to  nd codes closer to the capacity limits at even lower encoding and decoding complexities. Most previous work on single-layer Fountain coding targets the design via the right degree distribution. The left degree distribution of an LT code is left as Poisson to protect the universality. For finite lengths, this is no longer an issue; thus, we focus on the design of better codes for the BEC and noisy channels as well at practical lengths.&#xd;
We propose two encoding schemes for BEC and noisy channels by shaping the left&#xd;
degree distribution. Our left degree shaping provides codes outperforming regular LT&#xd;
code and all other competing schemes in the literature. For instance, at a bit error&#xd;
rate of 10_{-7} and k = 256, our scheme provides a realized rate of 0.6 which is 23.5% higher than Sorensen et al.'s scheme over BEC. In addition, over noisy channels&#xd;
our proposed scheme achieves an improvement of 14% in the released rates at k = 100&#xd;
and 30 Belief Propagation (BP) iterations.</description>

   <description>Attention is a cognitive process essential to daily function.  As attention encompasses an extremely broad array of cognitive subprocesses, there remains much to be discovered about the brain regions related to attention with neuroimaging.  This thesis presents two studies that used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural activity associated with different forms of attentional control.  &#xd;
In the first study, we scanned healthy young adults while they performed the Stroop task, which measures selective attention, to investigate neural responses underlying unanticipated conflict detection.  We found several regions across the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes that became more active during states of unanticipated conflicts, relative to states of anticipated conflicts.  These regions included the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus.  Activity in these regions has previously been associated with attentional processes such as conflict detection, attention, orientation, and oddball detection.   Our results therefore suggest that widespread areas of the cortex serve several cognitive processes involved in successfully monitoring and responding to unanticipated conflicts.  &#xd;
In the second study, we tested young and cognitively healthy older adults with the Stroop task to determine whether aging affects the neural mechanisms underlying attentional lapses, defined as relatively longer response times.  Like previous studies in young adults, we found regions in the default mode network exhibited greater activity as reaction time to stimuli increased.  Attentional lapses were also preceded by decreased activity in regions related to attention, including the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices.  Most importantly, young adults showed greater positive reaction time-modulated activity in default mode areas, while older adults exhibited greater positive reaction time-modulated activity in more prefrontal areas.  Our results suggest that the neural correlates of attentional lapses change with healthy aging, reinforcing the idea of functional plasticity to maintain high cognitive function throughout the lifespan.</description>

   <description>Cobalt-60 (Co-60) units played an integral role in radiation therapy from the mid-1950s to the 1970s.  Although they continue to be used to treat cancer in some parts of the world, their role has been significantly reduced due to the invention of medical linear accelerators. A number of groups have indicated a strong potential for Co-60 units in modern radiation therapy. The Medical Physics group at the Cancer Center of the Southeastern Ontario and Queen’s University has shown the feasibility of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) via simple conformal treatment planning and dose delivery using a Co-60 unit.&#xd;
In this thesis, initial Co-60 tomotherapy planning investigations on simple uniform phantoms are extended to actual clinical cases based on patient CT data. The planning is based on radiation dose data from a clinical Co-60 unit fitted with a multileaf collimator (MLC) and modeled in the EGSnrc Monte Carlo system. An in house treatment planning program is used to calculate IMRT dose distributions.  Conformal delivery in a single slice on a uniform phantom based on sequentially delivered pencil beams is verified by Gafchromic film. Volumetric dose distributions for Co-60 serial tomotherapy are then generated for typical clinical sites that had been treated at our clinic by conventional 6MV IMRT using Varian Eclipse treatment plans. The Co-60 treatment plans are compared with the clinical IMRT plans using conventional matrices such as dose volume histograms (DVH). Dose delivery based on simultaneously opened MLC leaves is also explored and a novel MLC segmentation method is proposed.  In order to increase efficiency of dose calculations, a novel convolution based fluence model for treatment planning is also proposed.&#xd;
The ion chamber measurements showed that the Monte Carlo modeling of the beam data under the MIMiC MLC is accurate. The film measurements from the uniform phantom irradiations confirm that IMRT plans from our in-house treatment planning system are deliverable. Comparing the Co-60 dose distributions and DVHs to the IMRT plans from the clinic indicates that Co-60 is able to provide similar dose conformality to targets and dose sparing to critical organs.  The results of the novel MLC segmentation algorithm and the photon fluence model proposed in this work compared well with the Monte Carlo calculations.&#xd;
In summary, the investigations presented in this thesis confirm that Co-60 tomotherapy is indeed capable of providing state-of-the-art conformal dose delivery. We have shown that the perceived beam limitations often identified with Co 60 (e.g., lower penetration, source size artifacts under small field collimation, and larger penumbra) are negligible when using intensity modulated techniques.</description>

   <description>If the goal of teaching introductory physics is to help every student have successful learning experiences, then we need to answer at least two key questions to achieve this goal. First, what instructional strategies will promote equitable success for students? And second, how can we prepare instructors to use these teaching strategies effectively? Prior research demonstrates a persistent gender gap in introductory physics; however, we find that physics identity mediates the impact of gender on both conceptual understanding  and  retention in physics programs. Therefore, we apply Wenger's framework of identity development in communities of practice to hypothesize that collaborative, community-building instructional strategies can promote equity by enabling women's identification with physics. Through meta-analysis of results from 26 courses, we find trends in three different models of equity that support this hypothesis. To address our second question, we apply a similar community-based model to  TA professional development. We find that teaching communities of practice can yield statistically significant improvements in TAs' identification as physics educators and make qualitative changes to TAs' teaching approaches.</description>

   <description>Through an examination of Robertson Davies’s The Deptford Trilogy, this thesis analyses the influence of the international Theosophical movement (with close attention to the Toronto Theosophical Society) and psychoanalysis to the moral world presented in these three Davies novels. Chapter One outlines the context of nineteenth-century Western belief in Theosophy, the most powerful occult movement in the world at the time, with special attention to Toronto as the center for Theosophy in Canada. Chapter Two looks at the occult influence of psychoanalysis, specifically Freud’s uncanny, in Fifth Business, Jung’s theory of individuation in The Manticore and Davies’s growing understanding of Gnosticism in World of Wonders. This second chapter is supported with reference to Davies’s personal library, now housed at the W.D. Jordan Special Collections and Music Library at Queen’s University. I conclude by arguing, with evidence from the novels, that Davies was aware of and influenced by the teachings of the Theosophical Society, which along with his study of Jung, brought him into sympathy with modern Gnosticism. I present evidence that Davies placed numerous hidden references to occult themes within The Deptford Trilogy for the enlightened reader to discover, and that these references offer a new perspective on Davies analysis not yet part of the critical record.</description>

   <description>Participation in a combination of adult-led and peer-led activities appears to lead to favourable outcomes in sport (Côté, Erickson, &amp; Abernethy, 2013). However, very little is known regarding the potential differences in how youth experience these distinct activities. Thus, the purpose of this project was to investigate the subjective and objective experiences of the same individuals across adult-led and peer-led sport activities. Recreational male soccer players (n = 27; Mean Age = 10.11) were examined using direct observation and experience rating scales in an effort to shed light on the impact that adult-led and peer-led sport activities have on the same athletes. The results clearly illustrated that the experiences of youth across these two activities are very different. In the adult-led activities, youth experienced high levels of effort and concentration, and spent more time being physically or mentally engaged. However, antisocial behaviours were also more frequent in the adult-led activities. Meanwhile, youth experienced high rates of prosocial behaviours, sport-related communication, as well as general communication during the peer-led activities. These findings suggest that rather than one approach being comparatively superior to the other, both adult-led and peer-led sport activities have the potential to yield unique benefits towards children’s experiences in sport. The results from the present study may have important practical implications if sport programs can utilize the benefits of both adult-led and peer-led activities to offer youth a sport experience which combines the best of both worlds.</description>

   <description>Conventional fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) require polymers such as epoxies that are not biodegradable, which have a significant impact on the environment. The first phase of the thesis aims at replacing conventional polymers with sustainable bio-polymers. The tensile mechanical properties of glass-FRP (GFRP) laminates using two types of organic furfuryl alcohol bio-resins extracted from renewable resources, such as corncobs, were investigated. Results are compared to control specimens fabricated using conventional epoxy resin. It was shown that by careful selection of viscosity of bio-resin, and type and dosage of catalyst, similar mechanical properties to epoxy-GFRP can be achieved.&#xd;
The second and third phases consisted of durability testing of the bio-resin GFRP. A total of 160 tension coupons and 81 unconfined and confined concrete cylinders wrapped with bio-resin-GFRP were studied. Conditioning was achieved by immersion of the specimens in saline solutions with 3% salt concentration, at 23, 40 and 55 degrees Celcius, for up to 300 days. Specimens were compared to epoxy-GFRP specimens aged in the same environment. Deterioration was quantified by tensile testing of the coupons and compression testing of the cylinders at various stages of exposure. The bio-resin-GFRP showed 33% less tensile strength retention than the epoxy-GFRP. The epoxy-GFRP and bio-resin-GFRP wrapped cylinders had the same un-aged confined axial compressive strength (fcc’), essentially a strengthening ratio (fcc’/fc’) of 2.24. After 300 days, the (fcc’/fc’) ratio retentions for the bio-resin-GFRP was 73% at all temperatures. Using the Arrhenius model, it was predicted that 61% retention in tensile strength of the bio-resin-GFRP and 65% retention of the compressive strength of wrapped cylinders would occur after 100 years in an environment with a mean annual temperatures of 10 degrees Celcius.</description>

   <description>The present research examined cultural differences between Euro-Canadians and Chinese in threat perception in competitive settings. Based on past cultural psychological research on self and thinking, we predicted that, compared to Chinese, Euro-Canadians would perceive greater correspondence between public appearances and reality – inferring an opponent as competent and threatening if he or she appears competent. As predicted, Euro Canadians perceived greater threat than did Chinese in an opponent who appeared competent or domineering, whereas Chinese perceived greater threat than Euro Canadians in an opponent who appeared non-distinct or ordinary (Studies 1 to 4). Consistent with my predictions, these cultural differences were partially mediated by perceived unpredictability associated with different appearances (Study 3) and fully mediated by the more general beliefs that appearances can be unreliable reflections of reality (Study 4). The results have important implications for judgment and decision making in competitions.</description>

   <description>Sex dimorphism in the prevalence, onset, development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well recognized.  Sex-specific differences in adaptation to cardiac pathological progressions such as cardiac hypertrophy (CH), and the extent to which they are attributable to sex hormones requires further delineation.  The objective of this dissertation was to determine which cardiac vasoactive systems are responsible for sex-specific differences in CH modulation using the atrial natriuretic peptide gene-disrupted (ANP-/-) mouse model.  First, sex-specific differences in the expression of the cardiac natriuretic peptide (NP) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) systems were evaluated.  Next, the influence of 17β-Estradiol (E2) on the expression and signaling of the cardiac NP and NOS systems was determined in ovariectomized (OVX) female ANP+/+ and ANP-/- mice.  Finally, sex-specific differences in cardiac adaptation to Angiotensin II (ANGII) pressure overload were elucidated in male and intact female ANP+/+ and ANP-/- mice.  These studies revealed that males predominantly use the NP system and females predominantly use the NOS system.  Sex-specific differences in the cardiac NOS system were further enhanced by E2 in OVX female ANP+/+ and ANP-/- mice.  In the female ANP-/- mouse, E2 was found to signal through the NOS system to significantly increase plasma cGMP.  Finally, male and female differences were demonstrated in the sex-specific patterns of cardiac vasoactive gene system expression and development of cardiac dysfunction in response to ANGII treatment. Sex dimorphism was observed in the expression of BNP and NPR-A in male and female ANP-/- mice treated with ANGII.  Female ANP+/+ and ANP-/- ANGII-treated mice exhibited elevated E/E’ ratios that were not found to the same extent in genotype matched ANGII-treated male mice, demonstrating that female mice developed ANGII-mediated mild left ventricle diastolic dysfunction. Based on the results of this dissertation, we conclude that sex-specific differences do indeed exist in the cardiac adaptation to pathological stresses.  These data support the understanding that a progression towards sex-specific CVD treatments is warranted, with a particular emphasis on the potential benefits of female-specific targeting of the cardiac NOS system.</description>

   <description>Screening is the first step in identifying and treating alcohol-related problems among the senior population. This study was designed with two purposes. The first was to cross-validate the Senior Alcohol Misuse Indicator (SAMI) with two commonly used screening tools - the CAGE and the Shortened Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test – Geriatric version (SMAST-G). The second purpose was to examine the feasibility of using these tools within a front-line health care worker’s clinical protocol. The effectiveness of each screening tool was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for each screening tool with a sample of seniors recruited from clinical and community sources (N=87). Participants were classified into different types of drinker with a structured clinical interview (i.e., the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV and a medical history, including medication list). Seven problem drinkers, 36 at-risk drinkers, 25 non-problem drinkers, and 19 non-drinkers were identified. Among the three screening tools, the SAMI had the highest sensitivity (83.72%) in identifying at-risk drinkers and problems drinkers and best overall performance with the greatest AUROC (0.710), whereas the SMAST-G had the highest specificity (95.45%) in ruling out an alcohol-related problem among participants classified as non-problem drinkers and non-drinkers. Six outreach mental health care workers tested each screening tool at least three times with their senior clientele and rated each tool on a number of characteristics. An ANOVA and post-hoc analyses using the Least Significant Difference (LSD) compared these ratings among the three screening tools. The SMAST-G and CAGE were cited as the easiest to score (p=0.002), while the SMAST-G was cited as the screening tool providing the most clinical information (p=0.047) and the most comprehensive (p=0.019) of the three tools. These results point to the overall effectiveness of the SAMI and the user-friendliness of the SMAST-G as appropriate screening tools for identifying alcohol-related problems among the senior population. Future studies may further examine these two screening tools among as-yet-untested clinical populations (i.e., geriatric mental health outreach patients, cognitively impaired, collateral informants) and how to improve screening tool usage among health care providers.</description>

   <description>Mineral Liberation Analyzer (MLA) is an automated mineralogical system originally developed to characterize ore and mill feeds for the metallurgical processing industry. Its ability to quantitatively characterize solid and particulate material, including whole rock thin sections, waste rock, tailings, soil, and sediments, has led to increasing applications in other industries. The software uses back-scatter electron imagery and energy dispersive X-ray analysis to analyze each particle’s shape, size, and mineralogical information. Energy dispersive X-ray data are compared to a user-generated Mineral Reference Library consisting of known phases and corresponding EDS spectra to classify each particle. MLA is used in this study to provide quantitative assessments of mining-related environmental samples to answer questions regarding mineralogical controls on bioaccessibility, metal leaching/acid rock drainage potential, and anthropogenic influence.&#xd;
Six tailings samples from the New Calumet Mine in Quebec, Canada, were analyzed using MLA. Gastric Pb bioaccessibility testing and total metal content performed on these samples indicated that Pb bioaccessibility in the &lt;250 micron size fraction was not directly correlated with the total Pb concentration. This suggested that there were mineralogical and/or physical controls on bioaccessibility. MLA was used to quantify the relative proportions of cerussite, a highly bioaccessible Pb carbonate, and galena, a lower bioaccessibility Pb sulfide. Liberation and particle size were also analyzed as controls on bioaccessibility. Sample GD-VEG1 (highest bioaccessibility) has the highest ratio of cerussite to galena, the smallest particle size, and the most liberated Pb-bearing particles. &#xd;
The New Calumet tailings were also analyzed using static testing, a suite of laboratory tests used by environmental scientists and mine operators to operationally define acid rock drainage and metal leaching potential. Modal mineralogy obtained from MLA analysis was used to calculate neutralization potential (NP) and acid potential (AP), taking into account the presence of iron carbonate minerals and iron-bearing sulfides other than pyrite. Results are within several units of those obtained by static testing. &#xd;
Two Ni-impacted soil samples collected from the region of Kalgoorlie, Australia were characterized using MLA. Previous studies had focused on bioaccessibility and sequential extraction testing and minor mineralogical work. Preliminary XANES characterization conflicted with mineralogy predicted from sequential extraction and EMPA and MLA were used to quantitatively characterize major Ni-bearing phases and resolve previous discrepancies.</description>

   <description>There is a need for chemical sensors for monitoring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air.  Acute and chronic inhalation of toxic VOCs can cause adverse health effects in humans, so monitoring these analytes is important for ensuring that their concentrations are maintained below maximum permissible levels.  Chemical sensors using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to extract VOCs with partial selectivity, coupled with label-free optical detection methods based on refractive index, can overcome the limitations of conventional VOC detection methods.  A variety of tunable and high refractive index PDMS materials were developed by incorporating a range of titanium and zirconium concentrations (2.5 – 30 mol % and 2.5 – 15 mol %, respectively) using a simple sol-gel synthesis and by incorporating a range of titanium concentrations (2.5 – 10 mol %) into naphthyl-functionalized PDMS.  These materials ranged in refractive index from 1.4023 ± 0.0002 to 1.5663 ± 0.0001 at 635 nm and 1.3942 ± 0.0003 to 1.5510 ± 0.0007 at 1550 nm.  The ability to use tunable refractive index PDMS films to differentiate between m-xylene and cyclohexane was demonstrated by monitoring changes in refractive index and thickness following absorption of these analytes using a refractometer at 1550 nm.  The sensitivity of the refractive index response to an analyte using a particular PDMS film was dependent upon the difference between the refractive index of the analyte and film, as well as the film-air partition coefficient of the analyte.  The detection limits for m-xylene and cyclohexane were 81 ppm and 4940 ppm, respectively, using PDMS-titanium-oxo nanocomposites with 5 and 10 mol % Ti, respectively.  A simple planar waveguide sensor with an input grating coupler was developed to monitor changes in refractive index of the cladding through shifts in peak resonance wavelength.  Using high refractive index PDMS materials as the waveguide core, we monitored changes in refractive index arising from absorption of VOCs into the grating.  Here, the sensitivity of the waveguide response was dependent upon the difference in refractive index of the analyte and polymer, as well as the film-air partition coefficient of the analyte.  The detection limits for m-xylene and cyclohexane were 1980 ppm and 18000 ppm, respectively.</description>
