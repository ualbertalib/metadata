   <description>The aim of this dissertation is to explore public health surveillance from a surveillance studies perspective.  The public health system in Ontario, Canada, provides an ideal setting for such exploration, especially because of initiatives that have been undertaken in the wake of the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  Post-SARS, local public health practice in Ontario has been increasingly overtaken by a system-wide imperative that seeks to transform surveillance through investment in large-scale, information technology (IT).  By critiquing the dominant conception of information in social scientific, public health and medical care discourse, and by exploring the increasing integration of large-scale IT into public health surveillance practice, this dissertation considers the uncertain trade-offs involved in the contemporary movement towards large-scale, IT-mediated public health surveillance systems.  The theoretical framework that guides this line of inquiry emerges out of a Deleuzian-Latourian tradition in surveillance studies.  This framework foregrounds the material assemblages, the network of people, machines, microbes, maladies, organizations, and so on, that make public health surveillance possible.  Material assemblages tend to be submerged from view, even marginalized, by large-scale, IT-mediated surveillance systems.  Such systems strive to immaterialize information.  They are organized according to an immaterial conception of information.  This arrangement fosters the marginalization of the material dimensions of information.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In order to empirically specify the heterogeneity of the marginalized material assemblages that make public health surveillance possible, 64 semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with public health professionals and patients.  The main findings of this dissertation are explained using the example of communicable-disease surveillance, and particularly HIV/AIDS surveillance.  These findings highlight the systemic nature of marginalization that accompanies the increasing automation of public health surveillance.  They suggest the need to question whether large-scale, IT-mediated surveillance is optimally configured, not merely for the challenges posed by disease, but also for the broader provision of public health services.</description>

   <description>In recent years, mobile communications have become affordable and popular. High cellular capacity in terms of number of users and data-rates is in need. As the available frequency spectrums for mobile communications are limited, the utilization of the radio resources to achieve high capacity without imposing high equipment cost is of utmost importance. Recently, multi-hop cellular networks (MCNs) were introduced. These networks have the potential of enhancing the cell capacity and extending the cell coverage at low extra cost. However, in a cellular network, the cell or system capacity is inversely related to the cell size. In MCNs, the cell size, the network density and topology affect the coverage of source nodes and the total demands that can be served and, thus, the system throughput. Although the cell size is an important factor, it has not been exploited for maximizing throughput. Another major issue in MCNs is the increase in packet delay because multi-hopping is involved. High packet delay affects quality of service provisioning in these networks.&#xd;
  &#xd;
In this thesis, we propose the Optimal Cell Size (OCS) and the Optimal Channel Assignment (OCA) schemes to address the cell size and packet delay issues for a time division duplex (TDD) wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) MCN. OCS finds the optimal cell sizes to provide an optimal balance of cell capacity and coverage to maximize the system throughput, whereas OCA assigns channels optimally in order to minimize packet relaying delay. Like many optimized schemes, OCS and OCA are computationally expensive and may not be suitable for large real-time problems. Hence, we also propose heuristics for solving the problems. For the cell size problem, we propose two heuristics: Smallest Cell Size First (SCSF) and Highest Throughput Cell Size First (HTCSF). For the channel assignment problem, we propose the Minimum Slot Waiting First (MSWF) heuristic. Simulation results show that OCS achieves high throughput compared to that of conventional (single-hop) cellular networks and OCA achieves low packet delay in MCNs. Results also show that the heuristics, SCSF, HTCSF and MSWF, provide good results compared to the optimal ones provided by OCS and OCA, respectively.</description>

   <description>The ecotone between aspen parkland and mixed-grass prairie in mid-eastern Alberta is a climatically-sensitive area that has been subject to periods of enhanced aridity occurring at multi-decadal to centennial-scale cycles throughout much of the last 6000 years.  To assess the ecotonal response to changes in effective moisture, as inferred by diatom-inferred salinity, temporal variations in pollen and charcoal preserved in a sediment core from Chauvin Lake were analyzed over several diatom-inferred moisture-cycles from c. 5,400 to 3,300 YBP.  Changes in landscape vegetation were inferred by variation in both the percent relative abundance and influx rates of pollen taxa found in a sediment core from Chauvin Lake.  Variation in sediment charcoal accumulation rates for both total charcoal and morphotypes, as well as the percent relative abundance of charcoal morphotypes, were used to infer changes in landscape fire regimes during these aridity cycles. One-way ANOVAs were used to determine significant differences in average accumulation rates or relative abundances between the arid and more mesic periods.  Changes in the relative abundance of Cyperaceae and Ambrosia pollen between wet and dry periods suggests a shift in the spatial arrangement of vegetation, and a decrease in the sediment influx of most taxa, suggests a decrease in production of landscape vegetation during periods of aridity.  Charcoal morphotype analysis, especially variation in Type M, Type D and Type B, suggests fewer, more intense fires during periods of drought.  Lack of change in total charcoal may be related to increased secondary sedimentation of charcoal during periods of drought due to increased soil erosion.  This study suggests that the spatial arrangement and production of landscape vegetation is dependent on climate, and fire prevalence decreases during periods of drought due to reduced fuel availability.</description>

   <description>Capacity planning is crucial for successful development of enterprise applications. Capacity planning activities are most consequential during the verification and maintenance phases of Software Development Life Cycle. During the verification phase, analysts need to execute a large number of performance tests to build accurate performance models. Performance models help customers in capacity planning for their deployments. To build valid performance models, the performance tests must be redone for every release or build of an application. This is a time-consuming and error-prone manual process, which needs tools and techniques to speed up the process. In the maintenance phase, when customers run into performance and capacity related issues after deployment, they commonly engage the vendor of the application for troubleshooting and fine tuning of the troubled deployments. At the end of the engagement, analysts create engagement report, which contain valuable information about the observed symptoms, attempted workarounds, identified problems, and the final solutions. Engagement reports are stored in a customer engagement repository. While information stored in the engagement reports is valuable in helping analysts with future engagements, no systematic techniques exist to retrieve relevant reports from such a repository.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis we present a framework for the systematic and automated building of capacity calculators during software verification phase.  Then, we present a technique to retrieve relevant reports from a customer engagement repository. Our technique helps analyst fix performance and capacity related issues in the maintenance phase by providing easy access to information from relevant reports. We demonstrate our contributions with case studies on an open-source benchmarking application and an enterprise application.</description>

   <title>Hamster Oviductin Enhances Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Sperm Proteins During Capacitation</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-30 15:38:54.594</description>
   <description>Capacitation is essential for fertilization of ovulated oocytes. Capacitation is correlated with activation of a signal transduction pathway leading to protein tyrosine phosphorylation, an essential prerequisite for fertilization. Oviductin has been shown to bind to the acrosomal cap and the equatorial segment region of the sperm head.  In light of findings reported in previous studies, we hypothesized that estrus stage-specific oviductin (EOV) enhances tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunofluorescent detection by light and confocal microscopy and immunogold labeling by electron microscopy and surface replica techniques were used to localize tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to the equatorial segment region and midpiece after incubation in medium in the presence or absence of EOV.   In the presence of EOV, an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in the equatorial segment region was observed as early as 5 minutes after incubation. On prolonging incubation in medium containing EOV immunostaining further increased, indicative of increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins as capacitation proceeds. Regardless of the presence or absence of EOV, phosphotyrosine expression was observed along the tail, specifically at the midpiece. However, this reactivity was enhanced in the presence of EOV. Western blot analysis of NP-40 extractable and non-extractable sperm proteins confirmed these observations. NP-40 extractable sperm proteins (25, 37, 44kDa) and non-extractable sperm proteins (70, 83, 90kDa) showed increased intensity when sperm were capacitated in the presence of EOV after 5-, 60-, 120- and 180-minutes of capacitation. Mass spectrophotometric analysis identified enolase, ATP-specific succinyl CoA, succinate CoA ligase, zona pellucida binding protein, heat shock protein 90, aconitase and hexokinase as proteins that undergo enhancement in tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of EOV. The proteins identified are known to be involved in specific functions including cellular metabolism, molecular chaperoning and normal sperm development. In summary, the present investigation has provided new evidence showing that sperm capacitated in vitro in the presence of EOV display an enhanced expression of tyrosine phosphorylation compared to sperm incubated in capacitating medium alone. These results indicate that inclusion of oviductin in media used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) may improve success rates of IVF by enhancing the signaling pathways involved in sperm capacitation.</description>

   <description>High density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes are normally used as part of a composite liner for waste containment facilities such as municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and heap leach pads. Field conditions, which include physical stresses on the geomembrane, elevated operating temperatures, and contact with leachate constituents, have the potential to affect the service life of the HDPE geomembranes. This thesis examined the long-term performance of different HDPE geomembranes based on both conventional laboratory accelerated immersion tests and simulated landfill liner tests. A 1.5mm HDPE geomembrane was immersed in different synthetic leachates at different temperatures in order to evaluate the effects of leachate chemical constituents on the depletion of antioxidants. The results showed that a basic leachate with trace metals, surfactant, and a reducing agent was the most appropriate for evaluating the potential degradation of HDPE geomembranes. A similar immersion test was performed to evaluate the effects of thickness on the ageing of HDPE geomembranes. Three commercially available HDPE geomembranes having nominal thicknesses of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5mm were immersed in a synthetic leachate at four different temperatures in this experiment. The results showed that a thicker geomembrane may have a longer service life if other things are similar. The depletion of antioxidants from a 1.5mm thick HDPE geomembrane was examined by conducting accelerated ageing tests at 55, 70, and 85oC under simulated landfill liner conditions. The results showed that the antioxidant depletion rate was consistently lower for the simulated landfill liner tests compared to the leachate immersion tests. The effectiveness of the aged HDPE geomembrane on the migration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was examined by conducting diffusion and partitioning tests using both unaged and aged HDPE geomembranes. The results showed that the ageing of HDPE geomembranes did not increase diffusive migration of organic contaminants, provided that the geomembrane remained intact. A new method was developed to estimate the service life of the HDPE geomembrane based on the landfill liner temperature history. The service lives of the HDPE geomembranes were calculated to be between 20 and 4700 years, depending on the geomembrane type, exposure conditions, and the time-temperature history examined.</description>

   <description>Multihop Cellular Networks (MCNs) form combined wireless paradigm that carries the advantages of both traditional cellular networks and wireless multihop relay. Cellular networks depend on a fixed infrastructure to provide wide area coverage for users with high mobility profile. Multihop relay networks depend on wireless devices inside the network to relay signals through multiple hops from source to destination. MCNs were proposed to overcome inherent drawbacks in cellular networks like congestion and dead spots. These gains build on the characteristics of multihop relay that result in increased capacity, decrease energy depletion and virtually extended coverage. But while these gains have been widely accepted and advocated, they have not been verified in rigor. A realistic need therefore exists to quantify these gains in order to realize more capable network management functionalities for this new paradigm.&#xd;
In this thesis, we present an analytical framework for MCNs. We quantify the capacity and energy consumption in MCNs, while considering various call distributions, network loads and transmission power. We apply our framework to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular networks, which are very dependent on interference levels in their performance. Our results show that capacity can be increased in CDMA cellular networks using multihop relay by increasing either the number of simultaneous calls or data rates. We also demonstrate that consumed energy is decreased in MCNs, especially in environments with high path loss. We validate that multihop relay is most rewarding when calls tend to originate near cell borders. Beyond verifying basic claims, we explore other potential gains of MCNs. We investigate the viability of congestion relief and load balancing and substantiate the benefits for congested cells neighbored by lightly loaded cells. Load balancing has also been shown to increase data rates and fairness in user allocations. Lastly, we explore enabling multimedia applications in MCNs and study the application of data rate adaptations given multiple classes of service.&#xd;
A key advantage of our work is that, while applied to CDMA in this thesis, the presented analytical framework can be extended to other technologies. The framework also accommodates both mobile and fixed network relay elements, expanding its applicability to next generation cellular networks.</description>

   <description>Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a human plasma zymogen that acts as a molecular link between the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades. TAFI can be activated by thrombin and plasmin but the reaction is enhanced significantly when thrombin is in a complex with the endothelial cofactor thrombomodulin (TM). The in vitro properties of TAFI have been extensively characterized. Activated TAFI (TAFIa) is a thermally unstable enzyme that attenuates fibrinolysis by catalyzing the removal of basic residues from partially degraded fibrin. The in vivo role of the TAFI pathway, however, is poorly defined and very little is known about the role of different activators in regulating the TAFI pathway. In the present study, we have constructed and characterized various TAFI mutants that are resistant to activation by specific activators. Based on peptide sequence studies, these mutants were constructed by altering key amino acid residues surrounding the scissile R92-A93 bond. We measured the thermal stabilities of all our mutants and found them to be similar to wild type TAFI. We have identified that the TAFI mutants P91S, R92K, and S90P are impaired in activation by thrombin or thrombin-TM, thrombin alone, and thrombin alone or plasmin, respectively. The TAFI mutants A93V and S94V were predicted to be resistant to activation by plasmin but this was not observed. The triple mutant, DVV was not activated by any of the aforementioned activators. Finally, we have used in vitro fibrin clot lysis assays to evaluate the antifibrinolytic potential of our variants and were able to correlate their effectiveness with their respective activation kinetics. In summary, we have developed activation resistant TAFI variants that can potentially be used to explore the role of the TAFI pathway in vivo.</description>

   <description>Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) protect marine teleosts from freezing in icy seawater by binding to nascent ice crystals and preventing their growth.  It has been suggested that the gene dosage for AFPs in fish reflects the degree of exposure to harsh winter climates.  The starry flounder, _Platichthys stellatus_, has been chosen to examine this relationship because it inhabits a range of the Pacific coast from California to the Arctic.  This flatfish is presumed to produce type I AFP, which is an alanine-rich, amphipathic alpha-helix.&#xd;
&#xd;
	Genomic DNA from four starry flounder was Southern blotted and probed with a cDNA of a winter flounder liver AFP.  The hybridization signal was consistent with a gene family of approximately 40 copies.  Blots of DNA from other starry flounder indicate that California fish have far fewer gene copies whereas Alaska fish have far more. 	This analysis is complicated by the fact that there are three different type I AFP isoforms.  The first is expressed in the liver and secreted into circulation, the second is a larger hyperactive dimer also thought to be expressed in the liver, and the third is expressed in peripheral tissues.  To evaluate the contribution of these latter two isoforms to the overall gene signal on Southern blots, hybridization probes for the three isoforms were isolated from starry flounder DNA by genomic cloning.  Two clones revealed linkage of genes for different isoforms, and this was confirmed by genomic Southern blotting, where hybridization patterns indicated that the majority of genes were present in tandem repeats.&#xd;
&#xd;
	The sequence and diversity of all three isoforms was sampled in the starry flounder genome by PCR.  All coding sequences derived for the skin and liver isoforms were consistent with the proposed structure-function relationships for this AFP, where the flat hydrophobic side of the helix is conserved for ice binding.  There was greater sequence diversity in the skin and hyperactive isoforms than in the liver isoform, suggesting that the latter evolved recently from one of the other two.  The genomic PCR primers are currently being used to sample isoform diversity in related right-eyed flounders to test this hypothesis.</description>

   <title>Design and Fabrication of a Nanocantilever for High-Speed Force Microscopy</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-30 14:18:19.893</description>
   <description>The atomic force microscope (AFM) has become an important tool in many fields ranging from materials science to biology.  The central component of the AFM is a probe consisting of a soft cantilever to which a sharp tip is attached.  By scanning the probe over the surface of a sample and measuring small deflections of the cantilever, atomic resolution images can be obtained for both conducting and non-conducting samples.  Unfortunately, the scan speed of conventional AFM is limited such that several minutes are required to obtain a high-quality image.  If the scan speed of the AFM could be increased to allow for dynamic imaging, it could be used for many new applications in materials science, life science and process control.&#xd;
&#xd;
Much of the current work toward high-speed AFM has involved improvements to scanners and electronics.  Innovative scanner design and control has resulted in operational frequencies up to 1 MHz while specialized electronics has pushed the feedback bandwidth up to 100 MHz.  To realize the full potential of these systems, a cantilever with a resonance frequency much greater than 100 MHz is required.  Unfortunately, current microfabrication techniques used to produce AFM cantilevers limits the fundamental resonance frequency to several MHz.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of this project was to miniaturize a cantilever into the nanometer regime allowing for increased resonance frequencies.  Three modeling methods were used to design a 200 MHz silicon nitride cantilever suitable for integration into an atomic resolution, frequency-modulation AFM.  A process was developed to fabricate the cantilever coupled to an atomic point contact (APC) displacement detector.  The cantilever mask and APC electrodes were defined through electron-beam lithography and double-angle evaporation.  The cantilever pattern was transferred to the nitride layer through focused ion beam milling; a subsequent wet etch into the underlying Si substrate suspended the structure.  Then, using an active feedback system, electromigration was used to form the APC at 77 K and 10E-6 Torr.  Progress was also made toward measuring cantilever motion with the APC displacement detector through microwave reflectometry.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study is to explore how secondary school students construct meanings for environmentalism. The study participants consisted of grade twelve students from a rural eastern Ontario secondary school. The questions guiding this research are: a) in what ways do these students develop an understanding of environmentalism; b) what factors influence these students' decisions to take, or to not take, senior level elective Environmental Education courses as part of their secondary school curriculum; and c) what are students’ perception of Environmental Education and the current curriculum in secondary schools. Using a critical theory approach, this qualitative study employed two different methodological approaches: a survey, in the form of a questionnaire, and focus groups.  &#xd;
Eighty-five grade twelve students participated in this study, eleven of which were also involved in three different focus group interviews. The survey was used to explore the general knowledge base and attitudes of these students towards environmentalism. The survey was conducted in May 2008, and the focus groups were conducted in June of the same year. Results were analyzed to identify, describe and compare the attitudes of students, and how they form meanings for environmentalism. Five themes emerged from the analysis of data generated from the surveys and the focus groups. Those themes were: students’ definitions of environmentalism; students’ perceptions regarding Canadian environmental concerns and these concerns within a global context; where and what students are learning about the environment; students’ perceptions of the current curriculum; and students’ attitudes, lifestyle and choices they make as a result. &#xd;
The most significant finding was not only the apparent lack of direction these students perceive themselves to be receiving regarding Environmental Education in the secondary context, which in some cases leads to a deficiency in understanding and concern, but also their noting the prevalence of media as a source of information about environmentally-related issues. Suggestions for future research on other salient aspects of Environmental Education are offered to shed further light on this issue.</description>

   <description>Game theory outlines optimal response strategies during mixed-strategy competitions in which available actions are selected probabilistically.  The neural processes involved in choosing individual strategic actions, however, remain poorly understood.  Here, actions need to be selected (1) in the absence of sensory instruction or reward cues and (2) independent of previous events.  This thesis examines the neural processes involved in action selection during mixed-strategy competition.  To do so, we both measured and manipulated presaccadic activity in the primate superior colliculus (SC), a structure involved in the generation of orienting saccadic eye movements, during a strategic game.    &#xd;
The first study tested whether the SC is involved in choosing saccades under strategic conditions. Monkeys were free to choose either of two saccade targets as they competed against a computer opponent during the mixed-strategy game ‘matching-pennies’. The accuracy with which pre-saccadic SC activity predicted upcoming choice gradually increased in the time leading up to the saccade. Probing the SC with supra-threshold stimulation demonstrated that these evolving signals were functionally involved in preparing strategic saccades. Finally, sub-threshold stimulation of the SC increased the likelihood that contralateral saccades were selected. &#xd;
In the second study, we compared the influence of previous actions and rewards on updating premotor activity in the SC in the strategic condition where eliciting stochastic responses was optimal and in a non-strategic condition where stochastic responses were also elicited but through explicit instruction.  To avoid exploitation by opponents during mixed-strategy competitions one should select behaviors unpredictably, that is, independent of previous choices and their outcomes.   The iterative updating of neural processes involved in selecting actions to produce mixed-strategy behaviors, however, remain poorly understood  In both tasks, premotor activity and behavior were shaped by past actions and rewards with more recent events exerting the largest influence.  Importantly, these sequential effects were attenuated under strategic conditions suggesting that updating of selection processes is not entirely automatic but can be tailored to different decision-making contexts.  Together our results highlight the active role played by the brain in choosing strategic actions.</description>

   <description>In Canada, 20% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions result from burning fossil fuels to heat homes, buildings, and water. Solar thermal technologies convert the sun’s energy into emission-free heat. The Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC) in Okotoks, Alberta uses a Central Solar Heating Plant (CSHP) with Seasonal Storage to achieve an astounding annual reduction of 89 % in fossil fuel consumption and more than 5 tonnes in GHG emissions per home.  &#xd;
	This thesis examines: (1) the role for solar thermal technologies in Canada; and (2) what social, economical, and environmental factors are critical to the implementation and ultimate success of the DLSC. The former was examined through a literature review and the latter through a qualitative case study. Data was collected from published articles, media reports, conference proceedings, and in-person interviews in Okotoks.  &#xd;
	International markets have shown strong solar thermal growth, yet Canada lags significantly despite its powerful solar resources and readily available technology. Europe has demonstrated that strong policies with ambitious targets have a critical role in the implementation of solar technologies. A review of recent public opinion polls demonstrates Canadians value the environment and would favour such policy developments.&#xd;
	The case study sought to understand the roles and motivations of the municipality, home builder group, and homeowners. The municipality exhibited tremendous leadership when it embarked on a path towards sustainability that included controlled growth based on ecological limitations and investment in solar thermal technology for municipal buildings. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities was instrumental in exposing Okotoks and the home builder group to the CSHP successes in Europe. The flexibility and innovation of the home builder group provided conventionally-styled homes, which were able to seamlessly incorporate the technologies of the DLSC.&#xd;
	For the homeowners, critical components of the success of the project included: a means to participate in environmental change, increased community cohesion due to aligned values; and price stability for their heating costs. Additionally, all of the homeowners interviewed stated that they would be willing to pay extra to support the technology, which indicates that future projects may require less subsidization.</description>

   <description>There has been considerable interest over the past decade in the preparation and applications of copolymers of ethylene with functionalized polar olefins. Such copolymers are expected to exhibit a variety of potentially very useful properties such as paintability, adhesion to polar surfaces, and miscibility with polar polymers such as polyesters and polyamides, but there are limitations associated with producing copolymers of ethylene with polar monomers via Ziegler-Natta processes. Many classes of Ziegler-Natta catalysts, especially those of the early transition metals (Ti and Zr), are highly oxophilic and hence are poisoned by functionalities such as -OH groups. This problem can in principle be alleviated by implementing the use of protecting groups such as –OSiMe3, which has previously been shown to be an effective masking agent both for steric reasons and because O-Si π bonding decreases the Lewis basicity of the ether oxygen atom. One can also utilize late transition metal catalyst systems, which are generally less Lewis acidic and therefore less susceptible to poisoning by functional groups.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis the results of an investigation of the copolymerization of ethylene with CH2=CH(CH2)nOSiMe3 (n = 1, 2, 8) will be presented. We have been using MAO activated dibromo[1,4-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthenediimine]nickel(II) (D) as catalyst, as this system is known to produce reasonably linear polyethylene and hence may be expected to produce essentially LLDPE containing –(CH2)nOSiMe3 branches. The latter can be hydrolyzed to give polar –(CH2)nOH branches.</description>

   <description>In an attempt to illustrate that the developed world has obligations to alleviate severe poverty, Thomas Pogge created a theory driven by human rights to focus on negative rights and duties of the avoidance of harm.  His theory of global justice is developed on a minimalist account of what it means to harm.  For him, the violation of the negative duty not to harm constitutes an injustice.  This injustice is enacted against the citizens of developing nations by the global institutional order.  Citizens of the developed world are perpetuating injustice by harming individuals through the imposition of a global order that avoidably causes human rights deficits without due compensation or reform to policies.  &#xd;
      &#xd;
   Many critics take issue with his definition of harm as focused on negative rights, as well as find his theory of causation troublesome.  His critics largely object to his assertion that the developed world causally contributes to severe poverty.  Critiques of Pogge attempt to demonstrate that it is not the case that the developed world is causally responsible for severe poverty. In doing so, some make reference to domestic factors within developing nations, which they claim Pogge largely neglects.  Others argue that the current global institutional order benefits developing nations.  Furthermore, some of his critics engage with the normative demands that follow from his argument.  They claim he has a minimal definition of harm and injustice that leads to unmanageable maximal obligations.  Conversely, there are claims his argument leads to normative demands that are insufficient in redressing injustices.  &#xd;
&#xd;
   I argue that Pogge’s theory of global justice has developed the foundation necessary to motivate affluent nations to establish a minimally just global institutional order that avoids the perpetuation of avoidable human rights violations.  This foundation elucidates and establishes, through the global institutional order, an overarching causal relationship between the world’s affluent nations and the severely poor.  This relationship, despite critiques, is essential in order to illustrate that developed world citizens do indeed contribute to severe poverty and so must take action to establish a minimally just institutional order.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2009-02-05 10:18:13.476</description>
   <description>This thesis is concerned with various aspects of stationary and nonstationary time series analysis.  In the nonstationary case, we study estimation of the Wold-Cram'er evolutionary spectrum, which is a time-dependent analogue of the spectrum of a stationary process.  Existing estimators of the Wold-Cram'er evolutionary spectrum suffer from several problems, including bias in boundary regions of the time-frequency plane, poor frequency resolution, and an inability to handle the presence of purely harmonic frequencies.  We propose techniques to handle all three of these problems.&#xd;
&#xd;
We propose a new estimator of the Wold-Cram'er evolutionary spectrum    &#xd;
(the BCMTFSE) which mitigates the first problem. Our estimator is based on an extrapolation of the Wold-Cram'er evolutionary spectrum in time, using an estimate of its time derivative. We apply our estimator to a set of simulated nonstationary processes with known Wold-Cram'er evolutionary spectra to demonstrate its performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also propose an estimator of the Wold-Cram'er evolutionary spectrum,  &#xd;
valid for uniformly modulated processes (UMPs). This estimator mitigates the second problem, by exploiting the structure of UMPs to improve the frequency resolution of the BCMTFSE. We apply this estimator to a simulated UMP with known Wold-Cram'er evolutionary spectrum.&#xd;
&#xd;
To deal with the third problem, one can detect and remove purely harmonic  frequencies before applying the BCMTFSE.  Doing so requires a consideration of the aliasing problem. We propose a frequency-domain technique to detect and unalias aliased frequencies in bivariate time series, based on the observation that aliasing manifests as nonlinearity in the  &#xd;
phase of the complex coherency between a stationary process and a time-delayed version of itself.  To illustrate this ``unaliasing'' technique, we apply it to simulated data and a real-world example of solar noon flux data.</description>

   <description>Four contributions to the multitaper method of applied spectrum estimation&#xd;
 are presented.  These are a generalization of the multitaper&#xd;
 method of spectrum estimation to time-series possessing irregularly&#xd;
 spaced samples, a robust spectrum estimate suitable for cyclostationary,&#xd;
 or quasi cyclostationary time-series, an improvement over&#xd;
 the standard, multitaper spectrum estimates&#xd;
 using quadratic inverse theory, &#xd;
and finally a method of scan-free spectrum estimation&#xd;
 using a rotational shear-interferometer.  Each of these topics forms a chapter in this thesis.</description>

   <description>The Ediacara biota is a cosmopolitan assemblage of the first macroscopic multicellular soft-bodied fossil organisms (Late Neoproterozoic, 575 – 542 Ma).  The Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland preserves entire communities composed of hundreds of organisms in their natural life positions on decameter- to hectometer-scale bedding plane surfaces as impressions under a layer of ash.  The communities are dominated by rangeomorphs, an extinct taxon with modular construction and fractal architecture.  &#xd;
	Bradgatia, a multibranched rangeomorph initially studied from 7 specimens from England, is represented by >200 specimens from 8 surfaces on the Avalon Peninsula.  The Bradgatia petalage is a radial array of up to eight rangeomorph petals with four visible orders of rangeomorph branching.  The petalage changes throughout ontogeny from juvenile I- or V-shaped organisms to larger U-shaped specimens to the largest and oldest O-shaped specimens.  Counts of the number of petals within each taphomorph suggest that a constant number of petals was maintained throughout ontogeny.  There is no significant variation in the number of frondlets with petal length suggesting that petals maintained a constant number of secondary branches throughout ontogeny.  &#xd;
	Culmofrondis new genus and species is a rangeomorph frond known from a single surface within the Mistaken Point Formation.  It is constructed from non-rangeomorph primary branches which are subdivided by rangeomorph secondary and tertiary branches.  The zigzagging central midline and non-rangeomorph primary branches are typical of Charnia-type branching whereas its rangeomorph secondary branches and flexible primary branches are typical of Rangea-type branching.  &#xd;
	Both Bradgatia and Culmofrondis were basally attached to the ocean floor by holdfasts suggesting they were sessile, epifaunal benthic organisms.  Both were oriented parallel to contour current direction and display decreasing preservation distally along specimens.  Additionally, Bradgatia overlies spindles and discs and Culmofrondis possesses a long stem further supporting an epifaunal suspension feeding lifestyle.  Bradgatia’s multiple petals and lack of a stem would have maximized the surface area available for suspension feeding whereas the elevated petalodium of Culmofrondis would have accessed nutrients in a zone higher in the water column with lower competition.</description>

   <title>Speciation and mobility of Antimony and Arsenic in mine waste and the aqueous environment in the region of the Giant mine, Yellowknife, Canada</title>

   <description>Antimony is a potential human and ecosystem health risk, yet large gaps in the existing knowledge of the geochemical behaviour of Sb persist. At the Giant mine, an abandoned gold mine about to undergo remediation, Sb is elevated in mine waste and in downstream pond and stream sediments that have been impacted by mine waste. Gold at the Giant Mine, Yellowknife NT, is refractory, hosted in arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and pyrite (FeS2), and associated with stibnite (Sb2S3) and Sb-sulfosalts. The gold was liberated by roasting the ore which produced two arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb)-rich waste streams: calcine and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) residue. The roaster-derived As and Sb host phases, maghemite and hematite, are found in sediment, and are undergoing post-depositional transformations. &#xd;
Bulk and micro- X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) methods, and synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) and micro-X-ray diffraction (μXRD), were employed to characterize the Sb-host phases and determine the solid-phase speciation of Sb in mine waste and sediment. Antimony in mine waste is largely associated with roaster-derived maghemite and is hosted as Sb(III) and Sb(V). The bulk and μXANES analyses indicate a more prominent Sb(III) composition in the ESP residue, compared to the calcine. In the surficial and deeper sediment Sb(III) and Sb(V) bound to oxygen are present, as well as Sb(III) bound to sulfur in the deeper sediment. The presence of the Sb(III) bound to sulfur phase in the deeper sediment implies that Sb associated with the roaster oxides is destabilized, but subsequently precipitates as, or adsorbs onto, a sulfide. Furthermore, the preferential attenuation of the Sb(III) species likely accounts for the dominance of Sb(V) in pore-water at all three sites, and at all depths. Co-existing with the sulfur-bound Sb phases in the deeper, relatively reducing sediment, is a compositionally significant, and finely disseminated Sb(V) bound to oxygen phase. &#xd;
Antimony and As are often assumed to exhibit similar geochemical behaviour. This study offered an opportunity to compare the mobility of As and Sb since both are elevated in concentration in the environment and in mine waste. Arsenic and Sb exhibit similar geochemical behaviour in the upper 2cm, but the higher affinity of As for sorption sites results in dissimilar distribution in pore-water. Both elements undergo post-depositional reduction resulting in an increase in the mobility of As, and attenuation of Sb. Aquatic horsetails (Equisetum fluviatile) present in Baker Creek significantly reduces the mobility of both elements.</description>

   <description>Aging, characterized by a time-dependent functional decline, eventually results in the death of an organism.  Unfortunately, this complex biological phenomenon is poorly understood.  In order to dissect the molecular changes associated with aging, the identification and molecular characterization of the genes that regulate this universal process is absolutely necessary.  The expectation is that the isolated genes potentially have human homologues and can be experimentally analyzed in Drosophila melanogaster in order to determine basic function.&#xd;
In an attempt to find candidate genes that may influence aging, the enhancer trap technique was utilized to identify age-related regulatory elements.  The genomic regions surrounding the insertion site of the enhancer trap lines have the potential to be regulated by the characterized enhancer.  A previous screen determined the temporal pattern of 180 enhancers trap lines, known as DJ lines.  Many of these lines demonstrated an expression pattern that was associated with age.  Several of the genes within the nearby genomic regions of six sequenced DJ lines, DJ695, DJ710, DJ849, DJ767, DJ761 and DJ694, were chosen for transcript quantification.&#xd;
Prior to gene quantification, reverse transcription, an essential step in the experimental procedure, was assessed for the error it incorporated into quantification.  Specifically, an exogenous molecule was used to ensure that unsuccessful reverse transcription reactions had the potential to be identified and, soon after, discarded.  This was achieved through the use of a spike RNA molecule, Luciferase.  Luciferase was shown to be a diagnostic tool that can be used in determining reverse transcription efficiency.  Eight genes were chosen from the aforementioned DJ lines and quantitative PCR revealed that the natural regulation of some genes were comparable to the, previously obtained, expression pattern of the enhancer trap line.  Although the expression of other genes did not correlate to that of the enhancer trap lines, all genes exhibited expression patterns that were age-associated.  The known functions of these candidate genes and the relevant homologues are discussed.  These findings validate the use of the enhancer trap technique in the identification of candidate genes involved in the aging process.</description>

   <description>Surgical scheduling is complicated by naturally occurring, and human-induced variability in the demand for surgical services. We used time series methods to detect, model and forecast these behaviors in surgical demand time series to help improve the scheduling of scarce surgical resources.&#xd;
&#xd;
With institutional approval, we studied 47,752 surgeries undertaken at a large academic medical center over a six-year time frame. Each daily sample in this time series represented the aggregate total hours of surgeries worked on a given day. Linear terms such as periodic cycles, trends, and serial correlations explained approximately 80 percent of the variance in the raw data. We used a moving variance filter to help explain away a large share of the heteroscedastic behavior mainly attributable to surgical activities on specific US holidays, which we defined as holiday variance.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the course of this research, we made a thoughtful attempt to understand the time series structure within our surgical demand data. We also laid a foundation, for further development, of two time series techniques, the multiwindow variance filter and cyclostatogram that can be applied not only to surgical demand time series, but also to other time series problems from other disciplines. We believe that understanding the non-stationarity, in surgical demand time series, may be an important initial step in helping health care managers save critical health care dollars.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-02-10 14:41:03.975</description>
   <description>A model-based methodology for risk-based decision-making of water treatment and disinfection strategies that deal with the management of trihalomethanes (THMs) has been developed. Trihalomethanes (THMs) are by-products of chlorination for drinking water and have been characterized as possible and probable human carcinogens. Among THMs, bromodichloromethane (BDCM) has a much stronger association with stillbirths and neural tube defects than the other THMs species. &#xd;
The parameters affecting formation of THMs and BDCM were identified through multivariate statistical analysis of the Ontario Drinking Water Surveillance Program database and by reviewing publications. Formation of THMs is affected by chlorine dose, dissolved organic carbon, pH, temperature and reaction time; these parameters along with bromide ions have effects on brominated THMs formation in drinking water. &#xd;
Two models for predicting formation of THMs and BDCM in drinking water have been developed. Controlled experimental investigations were performed in laboratory following statistical design of the experiments using synthetic water samples. Using statistically significant parameters, models have been developed. The adequacies of the models were tested using appropriate statistical diagnostics and validation experiments. &#xd;
The models have been integrated into a risk-based decision making framework. Formation of THMs and BDCM were estimated by importing water quality and operational parameters into these models. The costs, technical feasibility and performances of different treatment and disinfection options were determined. Through the incorporation of multiple criteria (human health risk, cost, technical feasibility and disinfection performance), different treatment and disinfection strategies were evaluated and compared. A fuzzy logic stochastic approach has been utilized for the evaluation and tradeoff studies among different criteria. &#xd;
Overall, this thesis has continued to improve the environmental decision making process. The results of this thesis have provided a clearer understanding of parameters influencing THMs and BDCM formation in a complex environmental scenario. This thesis has presented a comprehensive approach to better control water quality and associated operational parameters through the use of predictive models and to perform decision making following a holistic approach. The results of this thesis will also assist in critical decision making for possible upgrading of water supply systems, analyzing uncertainty and complying with the regulatory limitations.</description>

   <description>Calpains are intracellular enzymes that merge cysteine protease and calcium sensing activities together in one molecule. They respond to Ca2+ signals and modify the activity of their targets by selective proteolysis. Calpains are involved in normal cellular process like cell migration and apoptosis. The over-activation of calpain due to disturbances in Ca2+ homeostasis or inactivation due to mutations, contribute to diseases like ischemic injury and muscular dystrophy.&#xd;
	The classical calpains 1 and 2 are heterodimeric enzymes containing a large (80 kDa) subunit and a small subunit (28 kDa). Dimerization occurs through the 5th EF-hand of penta-EF-hand (PEF) domains present in both large and small subunits. In this study, I have used structural genomics approaches to explore the PEF and C2-like regulatory domains of some of the other 12 human calpain isoforms.  I have shown that recombinant PEF domain of skeletal muscle-specific calpain 3 exists as a stable homodimer when produced alone. Modelling studies suggest that there would be no barriers for dimerization of the full-length enzyme through the PEF domains which would place the protease cores at opposite ends of the dimer. Co-expression studies using small subunit were performed with PEF domains of calpains 1, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13. A differential tagging system was devised to differentiate heterodimers from homodimers. The PEF domains of calpains 1, 3, 9 and 13 co-expressed with the small subunit, while the others failed to express.  The PEF domains of calpains 1 and 9 formed heterodimers. Conversely, the PEF domain of calpain 3 formed a homodimer and that of calpain 13 predominantly formed a homodimer with a small amount of heterodimer. Homodimerization of calpains implies they are less-likely to be inhibited by the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin.  &#xd;
C2-like regulatory domains of calpains 5-13 were also studied. The structure of the distal C2-like domain of calpain 7 was solved. It is markedly different from canonical C2 domains and may not bind Ca2+.</description>

   <title>Stress responses in an outbred, wild-derived hamster, Phodopus campbelli: Individuality in the cortisol response to acute restraint stress and the absence of strong association with behavioural responses to acute restraint</title>

   <description>Glucocorticoid reactivity is often used as a biomarker of emotional stress status in animals and man. Likewise, behavioural responses of individuals to standardized stresses are also widely used to assess the magnitude of perceived stress. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that widely used physiological measures and widely used behavioural measures yield similar, or even correlated, results. The current study provides an explicit test of the relationship between the two approaches. &#xd;
Dwarf hamsters (Phodopus campbelli) were subjected to a standardized, on-back restraint in a socially subordinate position and had plasma samples drawn under brief, home-cage, isoflurane anesthesia to quantify cortisol before and after the acute stress. Individual responses were transformed into parameters describing the absolute change in cortisol, the proportional changes in cortisol, and the overall exposure to cortisol across stress and recovery. There was exceptional individual variability in cortisol responses to the standardized stressor, including monotonic declines, and cluster analysis failed to effectively partition between-individual variation by sex, age, or housing conditions, for any parameter. &#xd;
Next, physiological measures, and a battery of behavioural tests routinely used to assess, anxiety, stress, and emotionality differences, as well as resistance to capture and intruder aggression, were combined in an expanded population including individuals from genetic lines selected to increase or decrease cortisol concentration. In general, dwarf hamsters showed less neophobia than is typical of laboratory mice and rats (e.g. animals quickly dropped from the elevated plus maze). In addition, results were combined to create behavioural indices by orienting each test score relative to an emotionality continuum and combining tests based on, a priori, expectations of similarity. Multivariate regression failed to detect covariation between physiological and behavioural measures, despite the large number of parameters describing those responses.&#xd;
Although the experimental design did not include replication, or comparison of physiological responses to different stressors, it was clear that behavioural and physiological responses were neither interchangeable nor statistically associated. Thus, results challenge widespread assumptions about the interaction between the glucocorticoid response to stress, and the manifestation of that stress through alterations in behaviour. Additional research exploring physiology-behaviour associations in genetically diverse populations is warranted.</description>

   <title>Seeking Stability Amid Deep Division: Consociationalism and Centripetalism in Comparative Perspective</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2009-02-12 12:11:51.013</description>
   <description>For the design of power-sharing practices in deeply divided places, there are two main macro-political strategies: consociationalism, developed and defended by Arend Lijphart, and centripetalism, associated with the work of Donald L. Horowitz. In this thesis, I consider the academic debate between advocates of the two approaches and consider the extent to which either model represents a successful tool of ethnic conflict management. Two broad questions are asked: can centripetalism promote political stability in deeply divided places? Can consociationalism? I address these questions by engaging a comparative case analysis of six deeply divided places, three of which have adopted centripetal institutions (Fiji, Sri Lanka, and Nigeria’s Second Republic) and three of which have adopted consociational institutions (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, and Northern Ireland). &#xd;
I present three central arguments in the thesis. First, centripetalism should not be recommended as a strategy of conflict management in deeply divided places.  Its track record in such places reveals serious weaknesses.  Indeed, it has tended to promote instability and exacerbate division rather than promote moderation. Second, consociationalism is better able to promote stability in deeply divided places. Third, consociationalism’s prospects of promoting stability are further enhanced when it is implemented in a revised and expanded form, labelled here as “comprehensive consociation.” This type of power-sharing addresses issues that go beyond concern with just political institutions, such as security sector reform, property restitution, and the return of refugees. These are the type of issues that are most likely to promote political instability if left unresolved. Failure to deal with such issues, I argue, is likely to make it more difficult for elites to agree to share power, or to maintain such arrangements.</description>

   <description>Multidrug resistance protein (MRP)1, a member of the ABCC branch of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, can confer resistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents.  In addition to the core functional unit of ABC transporters that consists of two membrane spanning domains (MSD) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD), MRP1 contains a third MSD (MSD0) resulting in the following arrangement: NH2-MSD-(MSD-NBD)2.  In lieu of high-resolution structural information for MRP1, cysteine scanning mutagenesis (CSM) was applied to MRP1 and involves the development of a functional template devoid of cysteines into which paired cysteines can be introduced.  Previous attempts to create a functional, cys-less template of MRP1 demonstrated that cysteines in MSD0 were structurally and functional important (1;2).  However, given that MRP1 lacking MSD0 remains functional, a partially functional, cys-less MRP1 lacking this domain has been expressed in yeast (3-5).  Given these results, with the ultimate goal of applying CSM to MRP1 in its entirety, we investigated the endogenous cysteines within MSD0 and co-expressed MRP1 half-molecules and validated these potential CSM templates by transport and ATP binding/hydrolysis assays.  Mutation of cysteines within the core of MRP1 had detrimental effects on MRP1 transport activity and further mutation of cysteines by domain revealed that wild-type activity was retained in an MSD0-less MRP1 dual lacking cysteines in both NBDs.  This construct was used for introduction of cysteines on juxtaposed faces of the NBD1:NBD2 heterodimer at positions 775 and 1329; comparable residues in the related Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR/ABCC7) have been suggested to be evolutionarily coupled and joined by a hydrogen bond, maintained in structures of related proteins (6). Unfortunately, functional assays revealed that introduction of cysteines at these positions greatly reduced transport activity of MRP1 and diminished trapping of nucleotide at both NBDs.  Finally, alanine substitution of the seven cysteines in MSD0 was not without effect and cellular trafficking assays, co-expression studies and SDS-PAGE analysis suggested an altered conformation of this domain.  In addition, a disulfide pair of Cys7 and Cys32 was suggested by these experiments in MSD0 and further supported by examination of these mutants in full-length MRP1.</description>

   <description>Walleye are an important recreational and commercial fish species that are distributed over an expansive geographic range across North America. However, its palatable white flesh and appeal to anglers have lead to declines in natural populations throughout Canada and the United States. These declines have prompted the idea that aquaculture may serve as a means of satisfying consumer demands and decreasing pressure on wild stocks. While culture programs exist for walleye, little is known about the growth physiology of walleye in a culture system. The goals of this thesis, therefore, were to develop a molecular marker that could be used to rapidly assess growth in juvenile walleye, and to make improvements to culture practices that will optimize growth. &#xd;
To begin, we examined the relationship between growth and the expression of the myosin heavy chain gene (MyHC) in the white muscle of juvenile walleye. The coding region of MyHC from the fast skeletal muscle of walleye was amplified using a full length cDNA. Growth was then characterized using traditional measurements of growth (length, weight and condition factor), as well as MyHC protein concentration and MyHC mRNA levels. Both MyHC mRNA and protein expression were highly correlated with faster growth in juvenile walleye. Over shorter time scales, the MyHC mRNA marker was sensitive enough to detect impacts of fasting that could not be detected using traditional measurements of growth.&#xd;
Next, MyHC mRNA quantification was applied to an aquaculture setting. Feed training is an important bottleneck during juvenile walleye culture that often leads to mortalities and cannibalism. These experiments showed that the brief fasting period during the diet switch from plankton to commercial pellet feed caused a significant decrease in MyHC mRNA levels. Furthermore, the success of feed training in terms of survivorship and growth potential increased significantly for larger fish.&#xd;
The final section of this thesis examined how acute and chronic temperature exposure impacted MyHC mRNA and protein expression. Results showed that the nature of the heat stress can significantly affect the MyHC response. These findings are important as the temperature stresses induced in these studies are common during the summer months in southern Ontario.</description>

   <description>Sixteenth-century England witnessed both unprecedented generic experimentation in the recording of spectacle and a shift in strategies of sovereign representation and subject formation: it is the central objective of this dissertation to argue for the reciprocal implication of these two phenomena. Henry VII, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth I used performance to legitimate their authority. Aristocratic and civic identities, in turn, were modelled on sovereign identity, which was disseminated through narratives in civic entries, tournaments, public progresses, and courtly pageantry. This dissertation investigates the relationship between ritualized social dramas (a marriage, birth, and coronation) and the mechanisms behind the recording and dissemination of these performances in courtly and civic texts in England from 1501 to 1559. Focussing on The Receyt of the Ladie Kateryne (London 1501), The Great Tournament Roll of Westminster (Westminster 1511), and The Quenes Maiesties Passage (London 1559), this project attempts to understand the role performance texts played in developing conceptions of social identity. Specifically, this dissertation seeks to demonstrate that a number of new hybrid genres emerged in Tudor England to record ritualized social dramas. I argue that each of the texts under scrutiny stands out as a unique record of performance as their authors use unprecedented narrative strategies to invest their accounts with “liveness,” situating the reader as a “spectator” of the sovereign within a performative context. An important objective of these hybrid genres was to control the audience/reader’s response to the symbology of performance. Each monarch attempted to influence social and political identities through courtly performance; however, the challenges of governing differed among reigns. While Henry VII struggled against charges of illegitimacy, Henry VIII had to consolidate the loyalties of his nobles, and Elizabeth I came to the throne amidst religious turmoil and anxieties about female rule. Strategies for the performance and recording of sovereign authority shifted, therefore, to account for the changes in England’s political structure. By examining how performance is textualized in these new genres, I attempt to expose the tensions animating the relationships among the monarch, his/her nobility, and the civic authorities.</description>

   <description>The Caenorhabditis elegans Eph RTK, VAB-1, has known roles in neuronal and epidermal morphogenesis as well as oocyte maturation through interaction with its ephrin ligands. In humans, Eph receptors are involved in nervous and vascular system development and have been implicated in cancer formation and progression. DAF-18, a C. elegans ortholog of the human tumour suppressor gene, PTEN, has been identified as an interacting partner with the Eph RTK, VAB-1.  Mutations in human PTEN have been associated with numerous cancers and in the worm, DAF-18 is a well studied member of the DAF-2/Insulin receptor-like signaling pathway which has roles in dauer formation, thermotolerance and adult longevity.  Our lab has previously shown that VAB-1/EphR binds DAF-18. To further investigate the significance of this interaction as well as offer additional function to the proteins involved, I have shown that VAB-1/EphR is a negative regulator of DAF-18/PTEN at the protein level. Western blotting reveals that endogenous expression of DAF-18/PTEN is low in wild-type animals and expression is increased in a vab-1/ephR mutant. Additionally, VAB-1/EphR and DAF-18/PTEN are expressed in head neurons, oocytes and the germline precursor cells, Z2/Z3. vab-1/ephR mutants show increases longevity and sensitivity to dauer conditions which is consistent with increased DAF-18/PTEN activity. Lastly, daf-18(ok480) is able to suppress the oocyte maturation phenotype and increased MAPK expression displayed by vab-1(dx31) animals, providing genetic evidence of an interaction. By identifying the tissues where these proteins are co-expressed and substantiating the interaction with multiple analyses, novel roles may be proposed for each: VAB-1/EphR in DAF-2/Insulin signaling and DAF-18/PTEN in oocyte maturation downstream of VAB-1/EphR signaling.  This work provides further understanding of how an organism coordinates complex developmental processes and reiterates the notion that cellular signaling is a complex network of interacting players. As many signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved, my research in C. elegans may provide a mechanism on how Eph RTKs and PTEN are regulated in more complex organisms, including humans.</description>

   <description>As our reliance on the Internet continues to grow, the need for secure, reliable networks also increases. Using a modified genetic algorithm and a switch-based neural network model, this thesis outlines the creation of a powerful intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of detecting network attacks.&#xd;
&#xd;
    The new genetic algorithm is tested against traditional and other modified genetic algorithms using common benchmark functions, and is found to produce better results in less time, and with less human interaction. The IDS is tested using the standard benchmark data collection for intrusion detection: the DARPA 98 KDD99 set. Results are found to be comparable to those achieved using ant colony optimization, and superior to those obtained with support vector machines and other genetic algorithms.</description>

   <description>Successful tracking of a mobile target with a sensor network requires effective answers to the challenges of uncertainty in the measured data, small latency in acquiring and reporting the tracking information, and compliance with the stringent constraints imposed by the scarce resources available on each sensor node: limited available power, restricted availability of the inter-node communication links, relatively moderate computational power.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis introduces the architecture of a hierarchical, self-organizing, two-tier, mission-specific sensor network, composed of sensors and routers, to track the trajectory and velocity of a single mobile target in a two-dimensional convex sensor field. A query-driven approach is proposed to input configuration parameters to the network, which allow sensors to self-configure into regions, and routers into tree-like structures, with the common goal of sensing and tracking the target in an energy-aware manner, and communicating this tracking data to a base station node incurring low-overhead responses, respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed algorithms to define and organize the sensor regions, establish the data routing scheme, and create the data stream representing the real-time location/velocity of a target, are heuristic, distributed, and represent localized node collaborations. Node behaviours have been modeled using state diagrams and inter-node collaborations have been designed using straightforward messaging schemes.&#xd;
&#xd;
This work has attempted to establish that by using a query-driven approach to track a target, high-level knowledge can be injected to the sensor network self-organization processes and its following operation, which allows the implementation of an energy-efficient, low-overhead  tracking scheme. The resulting system, although built upon simple components and interactions, is complex in extension, and not directly available for exact evaluation. However, it provides intuitively advantageous behaviours.</description>

   <description>Hydrothermal fluids near and above the critical point of water have unique and potentially very useful thermophysical properties. At present, the lack of knowledge of supercritical water chemistry hinders implementation of innovative hydrothermal technologies. The development of new experimental methods and application of molecular modeling tools is clearly warranted to provide a better understanding of the complex properties of aqueous systems at elevated temperatures and pressures.&#xd;
The thermodynamic, dielectric and transport properties of hydrothermal fluids are investigated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and flow injection techniques. The spatial hydration structures and self-diffusion coefficients of phenol, aniline and naphthalene in aqueous infinitely dilute solution are examined from ambient to supercritical conditions by means of MD simulations. It is shown that the solvation shell around aromatic molecules undergoes significant changes along the liquid-vapour coexistence curve and, essentially, disappears at supercritical conditions. The changes in hydration structures are reflected in the values of the self-diffusion coefficients which dramatically increase near the critical point of water. The thermodynamic and dielectric properties of the Simple Point Charge Extended (SPC/E) water model are examined over a broad range of sub- and supercritical states. Accurate thermodynamic and dielectric equations of state (EOS) for the SPC/E water model are presented. The parameterizations provide the most accurate, up-to-date description of the properties of high-temperature SPC/E water, thus enabling for the direct comparison of molecular simulation results with experimental data via the corresponding states principle. &#xd;
The experimental methodology for the study of aqueous fluids at extreme conditions by using the ex situ flow injection technique is presented. The methodology significantly simplifies the technical aspects of flow injection analysis in hydrothermal fluids as sample injection and detection are performed at ambient temperature, thus allowing the use of standard on-line detection methods. The proposed ex situ experimental technique is applied to the examination of the hydrodynamic regime of a flow-through tubular reactor from ambient to supercritical water conditions. Application of the ex situ Taylor dispersion technique to measurements of the binary diffusion coefficients in hot compressed water is also presented. The ex situ flow injection methodology provides a basis for further development of flow injection analysis techniques at supercritical water conditions.</description>

   <title>Effects of Intermittent Static and Dynamic Tension on Articular Chondrocytes in High Density Culture</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-03-05 18:06:46.925</description>
   <description>Tissue engineering has the potential of becoming an effective approach for the replacement of articular cartilage.  However, the problems of small tissue size and inadequate mechanical properties of the tissue have yet to be overcome.  Mechanical stimulation of cartilaginous tissues is one method of accelerating chondrocyte proliferation and ECM synthesis.  While the effects of compression and shear have been well studied, the effects of tension have received little attention.  Based on the findings of previous mechanical stimulation studies and photographic evidence of tension acting in native articular cartilage in its physiological environment, it was hypothesized that intermittent applications of tensile strain can be used to stimulate cellular proliferation and ECM synthesis and thereby improve the size and mechanical properties of cartilaginous tissues.&#xd;
&#xd;
A loading fixture was constructed to apply biaxial tensile strains (BTS) to cartilaginous tissues grown in vitro.  The optimal conditions for stimulating proliferation and ECM synthesis were found to be static tension (as opposed to dynamic tension), 3.8% radial and 2.1% circumferential strain magnitude for a 30 minute duration.  Tissues subjected to BTS stimulation for 4 weeks at a frequency of once every 2-3 days had increased thickness, wet weight, and proteoglycan content, but had little effect on tissue mechanical properties.  Tissues stimulated at a frequency of once per day over the same period had a negligible effect.  A subsequent experiment confirmed that the effects of BTS stimulation on proliferation and ECM synthesis were dependent on load frequency, as well as culture media pH.&#xd;
&#xd;
The experimental results of this thesis suggest that the physical stretching of chondrocytes may have had more of an impact on stimulating proliferation and ECM synthesis than induced interstitial fluid flow.  Chondrocytes also require a period of preconditioning before the stimulated effects occur, but too high of a loading frequency can cause possible desensitization and/or a catabolic response.  Overall, the experiments were successful in identifying the stimulatory potential of tensile strains.  However, further improvements must be made to the long-term effects on tissue mechanical properties before tension can be used as an effective stimulus to produce better quality in engineered cartilaginous tissues.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-03-09 12:14:27.627</description>
   <description>A numerical study was carried out to improve the design of an autothermal reformer for the onboard production of hydrogen to be used in fuel-cell- powered auxiliary power units (APU) to provide heating and electricity in long haul trucks when they are at rest. The development of these auxiliary power units is based upon the use of power generated by solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system, instead of from a conventional gasoline engine. The present work was undertaken to improve the design of a prototype autothermal fuel reformer that had been developed by the Fuel Cell Research Centre (FCRC) at Queen’s University to convert liquid hydrocarbon truck fuel to a hydrogen rich product gas. In this development work and in the previous work iso-octane (C8H18) has been used as a surrogate fuel.  &#xd;
Using this surrogate of gasoline, the reformer was simulated using various inlet steam/carbon (H2O/C), oxygen/carbon (O/C) molar ratios and gas-hourly-space-velocity (GHSV). In the reformer considered the reforming process is carried out in a compact tubular reactor with a centerline thermocouple tube using a 2% Pt-ZrCe based catalyst with a local porosity of 0.6. During the initial simulations, it was observed that near the start of the catalyst region there were large temperature gradients due to an exothermic partial oxidation reaction. In order to reduce the temperature gradients and facilitate heat transfer by conduction along the reformer, the central thermocouple tube was replaced with a central solid rod. The effects of variations in the thermal conductivity of central solid rod, of the reactor wall, of the catalyst bed, of the inert porous material near the inlet and the outlet of the catalyst bed, of the gas hourly space velocity, of the effectiveness factor of the chemical reaction mechanism on the performance of the reactor were studied. The results so obtained were analyzed to determine potential design improvements that would increase the hydrogen output. The results were compared with the previous numerical and experimental results obtained in the previous studies of the reformer and found to be in good agreement with the general trends of the temperature profiles as well as the outlet molar concentrations of product species. &#xd;
After the analysis and evaluation of all the results, it was found that by replacement of central thermocouple tube with central solid rod made of high conductivity material and by using material for inert porous region at the outlet that had a thermal conductivity equal to that of the catalyst bed led to more even temperature profiles within the catalyst region. It was also found that the hydrogen molar percentage output could be increased by approximately more than 25% and that the length of the reactor could be reduced by 20mm by incorporating these changes in the reformer design.</description>

   <subject>Exploration Writing</subject>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2009-03-10 13:39:01.062</description>
   <description>Focusing on the texts of James Cook, Samuel Hearne, Alexander Mackenzie, Archibald Menzies, David Thompson, and George Vancouver, Mapping the Nation:  Exploration and the English-Canadian Literary Imagination argues that exploration writing is a subgenre of travel writing defined by its empirical perspective and function.  Incorporated into the English-Canadian literary canon while being disparaged for its lack of literary qualities, exploration writing is used by English-Canadian literary histories, encyclopaedias, and companions to prove an environmentally deterministic developmental thesis of the national literature.  The developmental thesis permeates anthologies that offer excerpts of exploration writing and discussions that pertain to the influence of exploration writing on later English-Canadian literature that returns to it.  Returning to exploration writing addressing land exploration are Farley Mowat’s People of the Deer (1952), John Newlove’s “The Pride” (1965) and “Samuel Hearne in Wintertime” (1966), Don Gutteridge’s The Quest for North:  Coppermine (1973), Marion R. Smith’s Koo-Koo-Sint:  David Thompson in Western Canada (1976), and Brian Fawcett’s “The Secret Journal of Alexander Mackenzie” (1985).  Returning to exploration writing addressing oceanic exploration are Earle Birney’s “Pacific Door” (1947), Damnation of Vancouver (1952), and “Captain Cook” (1961); P. K. Page’s “Cook’s Mountains” (1967); George Bowering’s George, Vancouver:  A Discovery Poem (1970); Gutteridge’s Borderlands (1975), and George Bowering’s Burning Water (1980), Audrey Thomas’s “The Man with the Clam Eyes” (1982) and Intertidal Life (1984).  Each text represents an individual interpretation of exploration writing that operates through genre and forms of return such as allusion, imitation, paraphrase, and quotation.</description>

   <description>Establishing the cellular and molecular basis for cardiovascular disease and the application of tools to manipulate the cardiovascular system genetically provide potential for new forms of treatment against cardiovascular disease, including: atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.  Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme that has potential for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).&#xd;
Atherosclerotic plaques express high levels of HO-1.  Advanced plaques are stabilized in part through the separation of plaque constituents from the blood by the fibrous cap made up of smooth muscle cells.  Protection of smooth muscle cells from apoptosis in the fibrous cap may be a means of promoting plaque stability in patients.  Here we show that expression of HO-1 in human vascular smooth muscle cells renders them resistant to apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress.  The cytoprotective mechanism mediated by HO-1 is mediated in part through protein kinase B (Akt).&#xd;
Plaque rupture may lead to myocardial infarction.  Tissue recovery after mycocardial infarction requires neovascularization for improved tissue perfusion.  A novel cell type recently discovered in the circulation has been characterized as an endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) and appears capable of promoting neovascularization of post-infarct tissue, thereby enhancing tissue recovery and perfusion.  Most EPCs transplanted into the infarct environment do not survive or are not retained to function in neovascularization.  Here we show that expression of HO-1 and its cytoprotective partner Akt protect EPCs in an infarct environment and promote EPC function in an infarct environment.&#xd;
Oxidative stress can result in maladaptive cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.  In a model of oxidative stress-induced myocyte hyperterophy we demonstrate the expression of HO-1 prevents cellular hypertrophy through antioxidant mechanisms and regulation of the transcription nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).&#xd;
Atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability is determined by the composition of the lesion.  We demonstrate that HO-1 deficient mice have more calcified and fibrotic lesions.  This may have implications in the management of late stage atherosclerosis.  &#xd;
Collectively, this work demonstrates new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular cells under stress that may have implications for strategies aimed at treating CVD using HO-1.</description>

   <description>The 2.68 Ga Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag Hackett River Main Zone (HRMZ) volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit, within the Hackett River Greenstone Belt of the Archean Slave Craton is highly enriched in Ag (and Pb) compared to other VMS deposits of a similar age and type. The mineralization has been sub-divided into five categories based on mineralogy, textures and stratigraphic location: 1) disseminated footwall sulfides, 2) copper-rich stringer sulfides, 3) pyrite-poor sphalerite-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite mineralization located at the top of the stringer zone, 4) mineralization in calc-silicate altered units and 5) sphalerite-pyrite massive sulfide mineralization. Using a mass-balance for Ag calculated from electron microprobe analyses, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite in type 1 mineralization contain negligible Ag and in type 2, Bi-Ag-(Pb) sulfides, Ag-Bi-Se enriched galena and chalcopyrite are the dominant Ag hosts. Within type 3, freibergite and galena are the main silver hosts. In type 4, Ag is hosted in disseminated electrum and freibergite while freibergite in type 5 hosts 99% of the Ag. Overall, Ag-rich freibergite contains 79.4% of the total Ag, chalcopyrite hosts 6.3% and galena contains 1.8% of the Ag. Trace minerals such as electrum, stephanite, acanthite and Bi-bearing sulfides host the remainder of the Ag (12.5%) and have a restricted spatial distribution. Mineral assemblages have undergone pervasive recrystallization and annealing during amphibolite grade metamorphism with localized redistribution of base and precious metals from metamorphism at a grain scale only. Within freibergite and chalcopyrite, Ag directly substitutes for Cu within the mineral lattice and replaces Pb in galena by coupled substitution with Bi and to a lesser extent, Sb. The principal controls on Ag residence in the HRMZ are temperature and redox conditions (which varies with distance to the hydrothermal vent) and the ratio of Bi and Sb available for coupled substitution with silver within galena. Subsequent deposit-scale zone refining is the principal factor influencing the distribution of Ag. Lower temperatures and more oxidizing conditions favour partitioning of Ag into freibergite and less oxidizing conditions favour galena. At higher temperatures, the most reducing conditions favour incorporation of Ag in Ag-Bi rich galena (plus Se) and Bi-bearing sulfides or Ag-rich chalcopyrite under lesser reducing conditions.</description>

   <description>Hypertension in pregnancy is associated with autonomic dysregulation whereas the effects of obesity in pregnancy on maternal cardiac autonomic function are poorly understood. Furthermore, hypertension in pregnancy is associated with placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction, whereas obesity in pregnancy is associated with placental inflammation and macrosomia. Fetal growth restriction is associated with an increased risk for language deficits at 2-5 years of age. However, maternal cardiac autonomic function and fetal auditory processing in pregnancies complicated by hypertension compared to obesity have not been examined and are the focus of this study. Maternal short-term cardiac autonomic modulation in the supine and standing postures as well as spontaneous and auditory elicited fetal behaviours were compared in 61 mother-fetal pairs (n=20 hypertensive; n=20 overweight; n=21 normal weight comparison pregnancies) from 34 to 40 weeks gestation. Maternal cardiovascular measures included systolic arterial finger-cuff blood pressure and electrocardiographic recordings of heart rate. Spontaneous observations of fetal heart rate, body and breathing movements, muscle tone and an estimate of amniotic fluid were made. Finally, each fetus received a 2 min recording of their mother and the mother’s voice in reverse (counterbalanced over subjects).&#xd;
When standing (othostatic stress), all three groups of women exhibited a decrease in the average baroreflex slope, parasympathetic nervous system indicator and high frequency power compared to the supine position. In a 20 min observation of spontaneous behaviour in the maternal supine compared to the standing position, fetuses of hypertensive mothers had, on average, fewer heart rate accelerations ≥ 15 bpm while the mother was supine; fetuses in the normal weight comparison group experienced more accelerations while the mother was supine. The average number of heart rate accelerations did not change in the two maternal positions for fetuses in the obese group.  Fetuses in the three groups showed differential responses to the mother’s voice played forward and backward. It was concluded that there were no differences in maternal heart rate variability measures in the group of mildly hypertensive women compared to those with obesity and the normal weight comparison group. Differential spontaneous fetal heart rate accelerations and responses to the mother’s voice among the three groups needs further study with sufficient sample size to examine behaviour as a function of gestational age.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Law) -- Queen's University, 2009-03-17 14:58:15.299</description>
   <description>This paper focuses on the evolution of “reasonableness” as a unitary standard of judicial review and the role of tribunal expertise in that process. The modern era begins with Nipawin in 1973, a time when judicial review operated with a crude binary system of standards that allowed for either full curial deference (patent unreasonableness) or no deference (correctness). It ends in 2008 with Dunsmuir and the jettisoning of the highest standard of curial deference, the standard of patent unreasonableness.  Correctness is now implicitly understood not as a standard but, as the justified absence of the need to extend deference to a tribunal`s decision. Patent unreasonableness and the middle ground standard of reasonableness have ostensibly been "collapsed" into a single more rational, workable, flexible and sophisticated unitary system based on the multi faceted standard of reasonableness.  It is argued that the new “standard of review analysis” expressed in Dunsmuir is simply a comprehensive restatement of all the previously articulated diverse and, typically, non-dispositive factors and exceptions. The hallmarks of this new standard are the recognition that, more often than not in administrative law, there is no one right or best answer and that, a reviewing court will respect and affirm a tribunal’s choice if it is within the range of options provided it is well reasoned. This paper also addresses the primarily academic criticism of the Supreme Court over conceptual problems in distinguishing patent unreasonableness from reasonableness, a dispute fuelled by this court’s continued attempts to justify a standard of review that allowed for a tribunal’s right to be wrong. It is argued that patent unreasonableness had become less of a standard of review and more of a simple expression of judicial censure for egregious fault in decision making; a qualifier to a finding of unreasonableness. Arguably that role may have been preserved even with the collapsing of the two standards into one standard in Dunsmuir. While Dunsmuir should have clarified many of the issues the three-way difference of opinion in the Court demonstrates continuing deep rifts that may portend further uncertainty. Uptake by lower courts indicates otherwise.</description>

   <description>Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are impaired in cognitive processes and emotional regulation, and exhibit stereotyped behaviours.  Dopamine (DA) modulates executive functions, learning, memory, emotional processing and social cognition; all of which are impaired in individuals with ASDs.  Because DA modulates a number of processes that are impaired in individuals with ASDs, genes in the dopaminergic pathway are good candidates for genes influencing autistic behaviours.  As our previous findings suggested a role for a dopamine-related gene in families with only affected males, this thesis describes a comprehensive study of five genes affecting DA synthesis, levels and function in mothers and affected males with ASDs in an initial TEST cohort of 112 male-only affected sib-pair families as well as a replication study in three additional male-only family cohorts.  I genotyped three to five polymorphisms in the TH, SLC6A3, DRD1, DRD2 and PPP1R1B genes and performed population-based single marker case-control comparisons, family-based association tests, quantitative transmission disequilibrium tests as well as haplotype-based analyses and tests for gene-gene interactions.  I found evidence for association of the DRD1 (P=0.0027-0.040), DRD2 (P=0.0002-0.007) and PPP1R1B (P=0.00042-0.001) genes with autism in affected males from the TEST cohort.  Evidence for DA-related gene interactions were found between polymorphisms in DRD1, DRD2 and PPP1R1B (P=0.0094-0.012) in affected males relative to a comparison group.  Furthermore, I found that polymorphisms in the TH and DRD1 genes were associated with the risk for mothers having sons with ASD in the TEST families (P=0.007-0.025) and putative risk alleles in DRD1 and DRD2 were preferentially transmitted from mothers (P=0.016) and fathers (P=0.023) respectively, to affected children.  All findings remained significant following corrections for multiple testing.  The TEST cohort findings were not replicated in other family cohorts.  However, an examination of dysmorphology data for the different family sets revealed phenotypic differences and thus, genetic differences are to be expected.  In summary, I found evidence for a contribution of DA-related genes in a specific family cohort with ASDs.  Additional functional and phenotypic studies will enable a better understanding of the contributions and implications of these findings to our understanding of autism.</description>

   <description>A laboratory scale study was conducted to evaluate the thermal remediation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in a saturated groundwater system using electrical resistance heating (ERH). Two experiments were conducted using a two-dimensional polycarbonate test cell, the first consisting of a single pool of TCE perched above a capillary barrier, the second consisting of two pools of TCE each perched on separate capillary barriers.  Temperature data was collected during the heating process from an array of 32 thermocouples located throughout the test cell. Visualization of the vaporization of liquid phase TCE, as well as the upward migration of the produced vapour was recorded using a digital camera.  Chemical testing was performed 48 hours after experiment termination to measure post heating soil concentrations.  A co-boiling plateau in temperature was found to be a clear and evident earmark of an ongoing phase change in the pooled TCE.  Temperature was found to increase more rapidly in the second experiment that included a fully spanning barrier. As temperatures increased above the co-boiling plateau, vapour rise originating from the source zone was observed, and was found to create a high saturation gas zone beneath the upper capillary barrier when no clear pathway was available for it to escape upwards.  When the source zones had reached the target temperature of 100°C and the ERH process stopped, this high saturation gas zone condensed, leading to elevated TCE concentrations below as well as within the capillary barrier itself. The water table within the experimental cell was also noted to drop measurably when the gas zone collapsed. Post-testing chemical analysis showed reductions in TCE concentrations of over 99.04% compared to the source zone, although due to condensation of entrapped gas and convective mixing, there was a net redistribution of TCE within the experimental domain, especially within confined areas below the capillary barriers.&#xd;
&#xd;
A secondary set of experiments were conducted using a homogenous silica sand pack with no chemical contaminants to determine the effect, if any, of the wave shape of electrical input on the ERH process.   It was found that in early time heating, square wave inputs consistently produced a more localized heating pattern when compared to the standard sine wave electrical input.  This effect equalized between the two experiments as the ERH process went on, perhaps due to the increased dominance of conduction and convection as the mode of heat transfer in the test cell at higher temperatures.  It is believed that the localization of heating in square wave experiments is due to a consistent power supply due to the lack of a sinusoidal ramping in power delivery.</description>

   <description>There is a thermal range for the operation of neural circuits beyond which nervous system function is compromised. Poikilotherms are particularly vulnerable to thermal stress, since their body temperature can fluctuate with ambient temperature. Animals that experience frequent hyperthermia have various coping mechanisms such as the thermoprotective effect of a prior exposure to sublethal temperatures (heat shock response). The molecular mechanisms of this thermoprotection have yet to be understood. This project studies the changes in protein expression in the nervous system of gregarious Locusta migratoria subjected to heat shock. For this purpose, proteins were extracted from metathoracic ganglia (MTG) by different methods and a proteomic map was subsequently obtained by 2-D gel electrophoresis which was compared between control (CON) and heat-shocked (HS) animals. Additionally, the localization pattern of Hsp70 was studied in the MTG of CON and HS gregarious locusts. Although 2-D gels showed changes in the amount of different isoforms of ATP-synthase β, the overall amount of this protein subunit was found to be unchanged. My experiments also revealed no significant change in the distribution of Hsp70 in the MTG of locusts caused by HS. However, new findings show that this protein is constitutively expressed at higher levels in perineurium, glia and tracheal cells than in neurons. In separate experiments, isolated locusts were also examined in order to measure any stress-associated increase of Hsp70 in the tissues of animals not previously exposed to crowding pressure. Quantitative western blots did not show a consistent change of the Hsp70 level in the MTG of isolated locusts following heat shock. Results of my research suggest that the change in the protein profile of the metathoracic ganglion following heat shock, if it exists, is subtle or occurs in very low-abundance proteins whose monitoring requires the application of special techniques. Alternatively, the thermoprotective effect of heat shock on the nervous system might be promoted through other pathways which can change the protein activity at the post-translational level and may work independently from protein synthesis.</description>

   <description>Cellular automata (CA) are an interesting computation medium to study because of their simplicity and inherently parallel operation. These characteristics make them a useful and efficient computation tool for applications such as cryptography and physical systems modelling, particularly when implemented on specialized parallel hardware. In this dissertation, we study a number of applications of CA and develop new theoretical results used for them. We begin by presenting conditions which guarantee that a composition of marker cellular automata has the same neighbourhood as each of the individual components. We show that, under certain technical assumptions, a marker cellular automaton has a unique inverse with a given neighbourhood. We use these results to develop a working key generation algorithm for a public-key cryptosystem based on reversible cellular automata originally conceived by Kari. We also give an improvement to a CA algorithm which solves a version of the convex hull problem, ensuring that the algorithm does not require a global rule change and correcting the operation in a special case. Finally, we study a modified version of an established CA-based car traffic flow model for the single-lane highway case, and use CA as a modelling tool to investigate the coverage problem in wireless sensor network design. We developed functional software implementations for all of these experiments.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores the design and applications of subharmonic mixers in CMOS microwave integrated circuits.  First, a 2x down-converting subharmonic mixer is demonstrated with a measured conversion gain of 8 dB using a 2.1 GHz RF signal. Extending the concept of the 2x subharmonic mixer, a 4x subharmonic mixer is proposed that operates in the 12 GHz Ku-band.  This circuit is the first 4x subharmonic mixer in CMOS, and achieves a 6 dB conversion gain, which is the highest for any 4x subharmonic mixer regardless of circuit topology or fabrication technology. Furthermore, it achieves very high measured isolation between its ports (e.g. 4LO-RF: 59 dB).&#xd;
&#xd;
Since both the 2x and the 4x subharmonic mixers require a quadrature oscillator, a new oscillator circuit is presented that could be used with either of the aforementioned mixers. This quadrature oscillator uses active superharmonic coupling to establish the quadrature fundamental relationship. The oscillation frequency is 3.0 GHz and the measured output power is -6 dBm.&#xd;
&#xd;
A dual-band mixer/oscillator is also demonstrated that can operate as either a fundamental mixer or a subharmonic mixer depending on a control voltage. This circuit operates from 5.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz or from 9.8 GHz to 11.8 GHz by using either the fundamental output or the second harmonic output of the quadrature oscillator circuit described above and achieves conversion gain over both frequency bands.&#xd;
&#xd;
A novel frequency tripler circuit is presented based on a subharmonic mixer. This circuit uses the 2x subharmonic mixer discussed above, along with a feedforward fundamental cancellation circuit. The measured fundamental suppression is up to 30 dB and the conversion gain is up to 3 dB. Finally, a frequency divider circuit based on a subharmonic mixer is presented that divides the input signal frequency by a factor of three. This circuit uses a single-balanced version of the 2x subharmonic mixer described above in a regenerative divider topology. The measured input signal bandwidth is 300 MHz (5.2 GHz to 5.5 GHz) with an input power of -7 dBm and the maximum conversion gain is 0 dB.</description>

   <description>Drilling and blasting are seen as sub-systems of size reducing operations in mining. To have better design parameters for economical excavation of mineral production and fragmentation, the comminution and fragmentation operations need to be studied and optimized independently, as well as together, to create optimized use of energy and cost-effective operation. &#xd;
When there is a change in drillhole diameter or fragmentation specification, changes in the blast design parameters are required affecting the cost of a drilling and blasting operation. A model was developed to calculate blast design parameters and costs on the basis of the required 80% fragment size needed for crusher operation. The model is based on previously developed fragmentation models, found in the literature. The model examines the effect of drilling diameter on blasting requirements to achieve certain fragmentation targets and calculates blast design parameters and costs for a range of diameters from 75 to 350 mm. &#xd;
 To examine the effectiveness of this model, two different 80% passing sizes of fragments have been considered. It was shown that cost optimization occurs at an intermediate diameter, since there are opposing trends of the effect of diameter on powder factor and accessories needed. To achieve a certain fragmentation target, the total cost of drilling and blasting shows a clear trend allowing an optimum selection of diameter. The selected diameter also allows the examination of the suitability of the drill machine under the given geological and operational conditions of the drilling site.</description>

   <description>Employee learning provides significant competitive advantage for organizations. Understanding how employees learn in different work contexts can support continuing, effective, and frequent learning. Although most workplace learning is done informally, the characteristics of that learning are minimally reported and the criteria used to define learning as informal are inconsistent.&#xd;
Research into continuing professional development in knowledge-intense environments or distributed workforces is sparse. The pharmaceutical sales industry is a previously unexamined knowledge-intense environment with a geographically distributed workforce. &#xd;
This qualitative case study sought a better understanding of how pharmaceutical sales representatives learn for work by documenting and describing those ways of learning reported as most effective and most frequent. Twenty sales agents from 11 organizations participated in a Delphi collaboration to create a comprehensive list of 64 ways they learn for work. In-depth individual interviews with five agents provided deep detail about learning in this industry, including the ways of learning that the participating agents perceive to be most effective and most frequent. The Colley, Hodkinson and Malcom (2003) framework was interpreted, applied, and extended in order to identify attributes of formality and informality and other characteristics inherent in the ways of learning reported as most effective and most frequent. &#xd;
This study showed that agents learn in a wide variety of ways and that most of those ways are self-initiated, self-directed, minimally structured, and often involve intentional incidental learning: agents are constantly alert to capture learning while engaged in work activities. Learning during customer interactions on the job was reported as particularly effective and frequent. Other reported effective ways of learning varied with the agent but usually involved self-directed learning with mixed formal and informal attributes. It was determined that learning plays a special role in this industry: much of what is learned for work is not being applied directly to the job of sales promotion.  Instead, agents use learning to develop themselves as resources for physicians in order to gain the customer-access required to promote their products.  In this way, learning on the job is the job.</description>

   <description>The ability of the brain to store information and adapt to changes in the sensory environment stems from the capability of neurons to change their communication with&#xd;
other neurons (“synaptic plasticity”). However, the ability of synapses to change (e.g., strengthen) is profoundly influenced by various chemical signals released in the nervous system (neuromodulators). Such modulatory effects may be preferential for different types of synapses. For example, cortical acetylcholine (ACh) has been shown to result in a relative enhancement of thalamocortical over intracortical synapses. Here, I tested the hypothesis that field postsynaptic potentials (fPSPs) in the rat primary visual cortex (V1) evoked by single pulse stimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) can be potentiated when LGN stimulation is paired with short bursts of stimuli applied to the basal forebrain (BF), the major source of ACh released in the cortex. Stimulation of the ipsi- and contralateral LGN elicited fPSPs in V1, with fPSPs triggered from the contralateral LGN exhibiting longer latencies and smaller amplitudes relative to fPSPs in ipsilateral projections. Stimulation bursts applied to the BF, paired with single, delayed LGN pulses, resulted in an enhancement of fPSP amplitude (~25%) for contralateral inputs at short (130 ms), but not longer (200-1000 ms) pairing intervals, while ipsilateral fPSPs failed to show significant potentiation over these intervals. The enhancement of the&#xd;
contralateral LGN-V1 fiber system induced by BF pairings was abolished by systemic or V1 application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine, while systemic&#xd;
nicotinic receptor blockade was ineffective. These data suggest that there is a differential capacity for plasticity induction between strong, ipsilateral and weaker, contralateral fiber inputs to V1, with weaker inputs exhibiting greater synaptic enhancement following pairing with BF stimulation to elicit cortical ACh release. This preferential readiness for&#xd;
synaptic potentiation in normally weaker, non-dominant fiber inputs to V1 may facilitate the detection and integration of separate sensory signals originating in thalamic sensory nuclei.</description>

   <description>The invention of the Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) technique a decade ago enabled the fabrication of nanostructured thin films with highly tailorable structural, electrical, optical, and magnetic properties. Here a three-dimensional atomic-scale growth simulator has been developed to model the growth of thin film materials fabricated with the GLAD technique, utilizing the Monte Carlo (MC) and Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods; the simulator is capable of predicting film structure under a wide range of deposition conditions with a high degree of accuracy as compared to experiment. The stochastic evaporation and transport of atoms from the vapor source to the substrate is modeled as random ballistic deposition, incorporating the dynamic variation in substrate orientation that is central to the GLAD technique, and surface adatom diffusion is modeled as either an activated random walk (MC), or as energy dependent complete system transitions with rates calculated based on site-specific bond counting (KMC). The Sculptured Nanostructured Film Simulator (SNS) provides a three-dimensional physical prediction of film structure given a set of deposition conditions, enabling the calculation of film properties including porosity, roughness, and fractal dimension. Simulations were performed under various growth conditions in order to gain an understanding of the effects of incident angle, substrate rotation, tilt angle, and temperature on the resulting morphology of the thin film. Analysis of the evolution of film porosity during growth suggests a complex growth dynamic with significant variations with changes in tilt or substrate motion, in good agreement with x-ray reflectivity measurements. Future development will merge the physical structure growth simulator, SNS, with Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) electromagnetics simulation to allow predictive design of nanostructured optical materials.</description>

   <description>Climate change will affect all freshwater ecosystems via both direct physiological and indirect, biologically-mediated effects. Small lakes (&lt; 10 ha) numerically dominate the Boreal Shield and represent an important habitat for aquatic biota. Small, shallow lakes are particularly responsive to climate-induced changes in thermal structure. Furthermore, biological interactions may be particularly important in small lakes where space, habitat heterogeneity, and thermal refugia are limited. Therefore, it is critical to understand and predict the consequences of climate change for community dynamics in small Boreal Shield lakes. &#xd;
Using 10 years of monitoring data and a field experiment I tested for differences in crustacean zooplankton community structure between warm and cool lake habitats. I classified years from a small, shallow Boreal Shield lake as ‘warm’ or ‘cool’ based on several characteristics of lake thermal structure. Since macroinvertebrates are often the main predators in small, shallow lakes, I further tested for potential interactions between lake thermal structure and spatially-dependent macroinvertebrate predation using in situ mesocosms.&#xd;
Body sizes of two ubiquitous crustacean zooplankton taxa, Leptodiaptomus minutus and Bosmina spp., were reduced in warm years, but no differences in abundance or diversity were detected at the annual scale. In contrast, in 15d enclosure experiments, crustacean zooplankton abundance and calanoid copepodid body size were reduced by the vertically-migrating predator Chaoborus punctipennis, but only in warm isothermal conditions. Zooplankton lowered their daytime depth distribution to avoid the surface-orienting notonectid predator, Buenoa macrotibialis, regardless of thermal habitat. No predation effect was detected in a hot (25ºC) isothermal habitat where both Chaoborus and notonectids were likely heat-stressed. &#xd;
Differences in abundance effects between the enclosure and monitoring data are likely due to the scales at which the analyses were conducted. Over short timescales predator-prey dynamics depended on lake thermal structure. However, over annual timescales zooplankton response was averaged across periods of seasonal change in thermal structure and biological processes, which may dampen the short-term effects associated with strong predation in isothermal conditions.  Therefore, the importance of macroinvertebrate predators in regulating crustacean zooplankton community structure may increase if small lakes become progressively more isothermal with future climate change.</description>

   <description>Previous investigations have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have the ability to alter electrophysiological and mechanical properties of rat ventricular cardiac myocytes. However, despite the breadth of the literature, there is little definitive consensus on the cellular mechanisms. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to study the cellular mechanism of action of H2O2 and test whether H2O2-mediated affects were partially a result of reverse-mode Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activity. Unloaded cell shortening, intracellular Ca2+ transients, caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients, L-type Ca2+ channel recordings, and action potential waveforms were recorded in the presence of combinations of different compounds including Cd2+, H2O2, and KB-R7943. H2O2 was found to cause significant positive inotropy by an increase in contractility of 80 ± 20 % (n=6) and an increased amplitude of Ca2+ transients by 24 ± 14 % (n=8), relative to pre-treatment values. Interestingly, H2O2 caused an increase in contractility even in the presence of Cd2+ block from 4 ± 1 % (n=9) to 15 ± 3 % (n=5) of resting cell length. Using caffeine pulse experiments to induce unloading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), we found that 100µM H2O2 did not significantly alter SR Ca2+ load. Under control conditions, H2O2 significantly increased L-type Ca2+ currents while this H2O2-induced increase was not observed in myocytes pretreated with Cd2+. Positive inotropy in the presence of H2O2 was blocked using 10µM KB-R7943, a selective reverse-mode inhibitor of the NCX. However, it was found that 10µM KB-R7943 alone altered action potential profile and suppressed normal contraction. Altogether, the major finding of this study is that H2O2 has the ability to enhance myocardial contractility, even under conditions of L-type Ca2+ channel inhibition, through a mechanism that likely involves reverse-mode of the NCX.</description>

   <description>Broadband Wireless Access Systems (BWASs) such as High Speed Downlink Packet &#xd;
Access (HSDPA) and the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), pose a myriad of new opportunities for leveraging the support of a wide range of “content-rich” mobile multimedia services with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This is due to the remarkably high bandwidth that is supported by these systems, which was previously only available to wireline connections. Despite the support for such high bandwidth, satisfying the diverse QoS of users while maximizing the revenues of network operators is still one of the major issues in these systems. Bandwidth management, therefore, will play a decisive role in the success of such wireless access systems. Without &#xd;
efficient bandwidth management, network operators may not be able to meet the growing demand of users for multimedia services, and may consequently suffer great revenue loss.  Bandwidth management in BWASs is, however, a challenging problem due to many issues that need to be taken into consideration. Examples of such issues include the diverse QoS requirements of the services that BWASs support, the varying channel quality conditions of mobile users, and hence the varying amount of resources that are needed to guarantee certain QoS levels during the lifetime of user connections, the utilization of shared channels for data delivery instead of dedicated ones and network congestion.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we address the problem of bandwidth management in BWASs and &#xd;
propose efficient economic-based solutions in order to deal with these issues at different bandwidth management levels, and hence enhance the QoS support in these systems. Specifically, we propose a bandwidth management framework for BWASs. The framework is designed to support multiple classes of traffic with different users having different QoS requirements, maximize the throughput of BWASs, support inter- and intra-class fairness, prevent network congestion and maximize the network operator’s revenues. The framework consists of three related components, namely packet scheduling, bandwidth provisioning and Call Admission Control-based dynamic pricing. By &#xd;
efficiently managing the wireless bandwidth prior to users’ admission (i.e.,pre-admission bandwidth management) and during the users’ connections (i.e., post-admission &#xd;
bandwidth management), these schemes are shown to achieve the design goals of our &#xd;
framework.</description>

   <description>The Pierina high-sulphidation epithermal Au-Ag deposit is located in the Cordillera Negra of north-central Perú, ~ 5km north of the coeval intermediate-sulphidation Ag–base metal Santo Toribio deposit, and in rocks of the Calipuy Supergroup. The deposit contains ~ 8 M oz Au, hosted in non-refractory iron oxides and, with heap-leach extraction, is one of the lowest-cost Au producers in the world.&#xd;
	Stage Ia (15 Ma) and Ib (14.4 Ma) advanced-argillic alteration formed from mixed magmatic and meteoric waters. The main, 14.4 Ma event produced vuggy quartz alteration, focussed in a 16.9 Ma dacitic pumice-lithic tuff, and surrounded by quartz-alunite, quartz-dickite, and illite-montmorillonite alteration zones, the product of increased meteoric water contributions towards the periphery of the deposit.&#xd;
	Stage II sulphide-barite mineralization introduced gold and silver, hosted submicroscopically in the disseminated high-sulphidation pyrite-enargite assemblage. Precipitation occurred from a low-to-medium - salinity magmatic fluid that mixed with meteoric waters at the site of ore deposition.&#xd;
	A 14.1 Ma 40Ar/39Ar age for supergene alunite records the rapid incursion of meteoric waters into the deposit. The resulting oxidation of sulphides to schwertmannite, goethite, and hematite was facilitated by microbes, recorded by the stable-isotopic compositions of supergene barite+acanthite. Schwertmannite is enriched in Au and Ag and is the main precious-metal host.&#xd;
Regional pedimentation is inferred to have initiated retrograde boiling of the source magma chamber at 15 Ma, with renewed magma incursion triggering major alteration at 14.4 Ma. Both events involved the exsolution of an SO2-rich vapour and a more saline aqueous fluid. The latter migrated to Santo Toribio generating phyllic alteration and intermediate-sulphidation mineralization, whereas the SO2-rich vapours caused pyrite-bearing feldspar-destructive alteration along fluid pathways during ascent to Pierina. The subsequent single-phase, H2S-rich mineralizing fluid exsolved from the retracting magma at higher pressures. Vapour contraction during ascent along altered, unreactive pathways minimized the loss of S- and H+, optimizing the transport of Au as AuHS0. Watertable displacement resulting from pediment incision promoted the flow of groundwater into the epithermal environment where mixing with magmatic fluids precipitated gold. Supergene oxidation optimized conditions for microbial activity, a critical factor in the generation of economic mineralization.</description>

   <description>Polymer pipes, typically high density polyethylene (HDPE), can be pulled-into-place, avoiding traditional cut-and-cover construction, using pipe bursting and horizontal directional drilling (HDD) pipe installation techniques. Of particular interest, are the ground displacements, induced by cavity expansion, associated with these techniques and the strains that develop in existing pipes in response to these displacements. Further, the axial stress-strain response of the new HDPE pipe during and after the cyclic pulling force history required to pull the pipe into place is of interest. &#xd;
	Surface displacements and strains in an adjacent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe induced by static pipe bursting were measured during the replacement of a new unreinforced concrete pipe. For the pipe bursting geometry tested, the maximum vertical surface displacement measured at the ground surface was 6 mm, while the distribution of vertical surface displacements extended no more than 2 m on either side of the centreline. The maximum longitudinal strain measured in the PVC pipe was less than 0.1% and its vertical diameter decreased by only 0.5%, suggesting that pipe bursting did not jeopardize the long-term performance of the water pipe tested.&#xd;
	In addition, results from identical stress relaxation and creep tests performed on whole pipe samples and coupons trimmed from a pipe wall were compared, and these demonstrated that the coupons exhibited higher modulus than the pipe samples. Therefore, isolated pipe samples, as opposed to coupons, were tested to quantify the stress-strain response of HDPE pipe during the simulated installation, strain recovery, and axial restraint stages of HDD. Axial strains were found to progressively accumulate when an HDPE pipe sample was subjected to the cyclic stress history used to simulate an HDD installation. It was shown that existing linear and nonlinear viscoelastic models can serve as predictive design tools for estimating the cyclic strain history of HDPE pipe during installation. For the specific conditions examined, the tensile axial stresses redeveloped in the pipe samples, once restrained, were not large enough to lead to long-term stress conditions conducive to slow crack growth even when the short-term performance limits were exceeded by a factor of 1.5.</description>

   <description>Using a mixed-method design, the purpose of this research was to understand interest in the elementary science classroom as affected by different teaching methods. Of particular concern was the state of interest in junior level (Grades 4-6) science classrooms. Research conducted on science interest and attitudes toward science has identified significant declines in student interest and engagement across grade levels. To remedy these concerns, it has become imperative that researchers and science educators gain a greater understanding of the growing literature in the field of interest and how this research might improve student engagement, especially at the elementary level. &#xd;
&#xd;
Questionnaires were administered to 178 students from Grades 4-6 measuring their individual interest in science, the frequency at which they were exposed to different teaching methods in science, and the level of interest they held for each instructional approach in science class. In addition, student interviews were conducted with six students from both genders representing each grade to better understand what makes for interesting and effective teaching of science in the eyes of the students. The quantitative and qualitative components yielded largely similar findings. Results indicated that passive learning tasks, such as written work and note taking, became less popular as grade level increased, that female students maintained a greater interest in passive learning tasks than males, and that passive learning tasks had the greatest impact on predicting student interest in science. Furthermore, students reported that they were best engaged by instructional strategies that were characterized by experimentation, cooperation, relevance, and novelty. These results were used to shed light on previous research in the field, and to suggest directions for future research and practice.</description>

   <description>The deterioration of prestressed concrete structures due to corrosion is a costly problem.  This problem is accelerated in cold weather climates where de-icing salts are used.  These salts accelerate the corrosion of the steel tendons greatly reducing the service life of the structures and leading to constant costly repairs.  Recent research has shown composite materials such as Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP) to be suitable alternatives to steel, providing similar strength without being susceptible to electrochemical corrosion.  Carbon FRP in particular has great promise for prestressed applications, showing resistance to corrosion in environments that might be encountered in concrete and experiencing less relaxation than steel.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis outlines the testing and implementation of a post-tensioned system that uses CFRP tendons to replace corroded, unbonded post-tensioned steel tendons.  This system was then implemented in a parking garage in downtown Toronto.  To the author’s knowledge, this is the first example of an unbonded, post-tensioned tendon replacement using FRP tendons.  The system used split wedge anchors designed specifically for CFRP tendons at the University of Waterloo.  The dead end was anchored by directly bonding the tendon to the concrete slab.  Overall, the system was shown to work and provide a durable solution for unbonded post-tensioning systems. The CFRP tendon was successfully inserted in the opening left by the removal of the corroded tendon and stressed.  It was found that the current anchorage configuration experienced large load losses of up to 60 % during the transfer.  Changing the orientation of the anchor was found to reduce the load lost to a range of 1 % to 9 %.</description>

   <description>Understanding the development of the Himalaya is critical to elucidating continental collisional processes.  The Greater Himalayan sequence (GHS), the exhumed mid-crust of the Himalayan orogen, records the tectonometamorphic evolution of the Himalaya from its deep hinterland to its foreland. The GHS in central Nepal and adjacent Tibet is deformed pervasively; quartz c-axis orientation fabrics from across the GHS indicate that it was deformed at high temperatures (~550-650˚C). The asymmetries of these quartz c-axis fabrics confirm field observations that define a reversal in shear sense from top-south shear near the bottom and middle of the GHS to top-north shear near the top of the package proximal to the South Tibetan detachment system (STDS). Estimates of mean kinematic vorticity from across the GHS indicate a pure shear contribution between 33% and 67%.&#xd;
	U-Pb geochronologic data from the upper GHS exposed in the Changgo culmination in south Tibet indicate that melt crystallization and metamorphism related to crustal thickening occurred at ca. 35 Ma and was succeeded by a second metamorphic episode and syn-kinematic voluminous anatexis at ca. 22 Ma.  The upper GHS was thinned vertically by 50% and extended horizontally during and immediately after the second metamorphic event, in a manner typical of the deep hinterland regions of orogens.   &#xd;
	In central Nepal, the ductile lateral extrusion of the upper GHS between the Main Central thrust (MCT) below and STDS above ceased by ~19 Ma.  The cessation of lateral extrusion followed the collapse of the orogenic wedge and a reduction in the gravitational potential necessary to drive the propagation of deformation southwards towards the foreland.  To restore the geometry of the wedge, deformation stepped out-of-sequence into southern Tibet, with the exhumation of the Changgo culmination and the North Himalayan antiform, before migrating incrementally back toward the foreland. Subsequently, the MCT migrated downward structurally adding material to the lower GHS as thrust slices, characteristic of foreland-style deformation. Thus, the transition between the upper and lower GHS in central Nepal records the transition from hinterland-style deformation to foreland-style deformation.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2009-04-12 16:39:28.315</description>
   <description>This thesis is a collection of four manuscripts linked by the aim of extending strategic alignment thought into the knowledge management domain by explicitly including the concept of knowledge strategy into the discussion of strategic alignment. In the first paper, a set of common knowledge strategy dimensions was synthesized and used to link two existing knowledge strategy typologies. The key finding of the study was that the two typologies operated at different strategic levels, allowing for the creation of portfolios of the lower order types under each higher order type. In the second paper, a model of strategic alignment between business, information system and knowledge strategy was presented and tested using survey data. It was found that the combination of aligned information and knowledge strategies with their associated business strategy resulted in higher performance for defenders, analyzers and prospectors and that the alignment of non-viable strategies led to worse performance than individual non-viable strategies alone. In the third paper, case studies provided examples of alignment and misalignment which were used to populate a framework linking alignment and performance. Four explanations for firms’ location in the model were provided, focusing on appropriate versus inappropriate alignment, conscious versus unconscious misalignment, antagonistic alignment versus misalignment, and strategic alignment versus misalignment. In the final paper, the Strategic Orientation of Knowledge-Based Enterprises (STROKE) instrument was developed to capture the orientation of knowledge strategy employment in firms. During the development process, a new statistic was developed to aid in the validation of card sorts during the scale development step of instrument creation.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research was to synthesize the constrained geometry catalyst Ti[(C5Me4)SiMe2(tBuN)]Cl2 (1) with MAO as a cocatalyst for ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerizations with 1-TMSO-alkenes to produce a copolymer with polar functionality.  Three 1-alkenols of varying length were purchased and derivatized and used for the copolymerization experiments: 2-propen-1-ol, 3-buten-1-ol and 9-decen-1-ol.  Several variables were tested to determine their effects on comonomer incorporation such as temperature, equivalents of comonomer, equivalents of MAO and two different solvents.  Higher catalytic activities were correlated with fewer equivalents of polar comonomer, lower temperatures, and no fewer than 1000 equivalents of MAO.  Toluene was found to be a far more effective reaction solvent than dichloromethane, as polymer yields were on average thirteen times higher.&#xd;
&#xd;
All polymer samples were analyzed by high temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and selected samples were analyzed by DSC and IR spectroscopy.  DSC determined that the polyethylene produced by 1 was substantially linear HDPE with long chain branching and that comonomer incorporation reduced the Tc and Tm, probably due to increased short chain branching.  1-TMSO-9-Decene was the most effective comonomer, as it had the highest incorporation rates (8.0 mol%) of all three of the polar comonomers.  The two shorter comonomers exhibited no incorporation at all.  This confirmed the hypothesis that polar comonomers with longer chains would be less prone to poisoning the electrophilic catalyst.</description>

   <description>With fast development of semiconductor industry, the transistors in microprocessors increase dramatically, which follows the Moore’s law. As a result, the operating voltages of the future microprocessors follow the trend of decreasing (sub 1V) while the demanding currents increase (higher than 100A). Furthermore, the high slew rates during the transient will reach 1200 A/us. All these impose a serious challenge on a Voltage Regulator (VR) or Voltage Regulator Module (VRM). In order to meet requirements of the next generation microprocessors, four new ideas are proposed in this thesis.&#xd;
The first contribution is an accurate analytical loss model of a power MOSFET with a Current-Source Driver (CSD). The impact of the parasitic components is investigated. Based on the proposed loss model, a general method to optimize the CSD is presented. With the proposed optimization method, the CSD improves the efficiency from 79.4% using the conventional voltage source driver to 83.6% at 12V input, 1.5V/30A output and 1MHz.&#xd;
The second contribution is a new continuous CSD for a synchronous buck converter. The proposed CSD is able to drive the control and Synchronous Rectifier (SR) MOSFETs independently with different drive currents enabling optimal design. At 12V input, 1.5 V/30A output and 1MHz, the proposed CSD improves the efficiency from 79.4% using a conventional voltage source driver to 83.9%.&#xd;
The third contribution is a new discontinuous CSD. The most important advantage of the new CSD is the small inductance (typically, 20nH at 1MHz switching frequency). A hybrid gate drive scheme for a synchronous buck converter is also proposed. The idea of the hybrid gate driver scheme is to use the CSD to achieve switching loss reduction for the control MOSFET, while use the conventional voltage source driver for the SR. At 12V input, 1.3V/25A output and 1MHz, the proposed CSD improves the efficiency from 80.7% using the voltage source driver to 85.4%.&#xd;
The final contribution is new self-driven zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) non-isolated full-bridge converters for 12V input VRM applications. The proposed converter achieves the duty cycle extension, ZVS operation and SRs gate energy recovery. At 12V input, 1.3V output and 1MHz, the proposed converter improves the efficiency from 80.7% using the buck converter to 83.6% at 50A.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the qualitative and quantitative variation in local plastic deformation and surface roughening due to crystallographic texture in body-centered cubic materials, specifically interstitial-free steel sheet and molybdenum foil and sheet. Complex forming operations currently used in industrial manufacturing lead to high material failure rates, due in part to the severity of the applied strain path.&#xd;
&#xd;
A multi-scale model was developed to examine the contribution of mesoscopic and local microscopic behaviour to the macroscopic constitutive response of bcc metals during deformation.  The model integrated a dislocation-based hardening scheme and a Taylor-based crystal-plasticity formulation into the subroutine of an explicit dynamic FEM code, LS-DYNA.&#xd;
&#xd;
Numerical analyses using this model were able to predict not only correct grain rotation during deformation, but variations in plastic anisotropy due to initial crystallographic orientation.  Simulations of molybdenum foil under uniaxial tension supported the existence of bending due to local variations in plastic anisotropy, confirmed with good quantitative agreement by experimental measurements of surface roughening.&#xd;
&#xd;
A series of two-stage strain-path tests were performed, revealing a prestrain-dependent softening of both the steel and molybdenum samples when an orthogonal secondary strain path is applied.  Numerical analyses of these tests overestimate macroscopic hardening during complex loading, due in part to the dynamic nature of the FEM code used.</description>

   <description>Numerous studies have investigated motor learning by examining the adaptation&#xd;
of reaching movements to visuomotor perturbations that alter the mapping between actual&#xd;
and visually perceived hand position. The picture of the visuomotor transformation from&#xd;
visual input to motor input that has developed consists of three broad phases: integration&#xd;
of hand and target locations in a common reference frame, calculation of a movement&#xd;
vector between hand and target, and transformation of this movement vector from the&#xd;
common reference frame into motor commands. The process of adapting to a visuomotor&#xd;
rotation is generally viewed as an alteration of the vectorial representation of reach&#xd;
planning. When visual feedback is rotated, the motor and visual directions no longer&#xd;
coincide and the motor command executed is remapped to the subsequent visual direction&#xd;
produced. In the current set of studies, we examined how learning a visuomotor rotation&#xd;
while reaching to a target with a curved hand path generalizes to straight path reaching&#xd;
and novel target directions. We found that there is very little to no generalization of&#xd;
learning between curved reaches and straight reaches when given only endpoint&#xd;
feedback. With continuous visual feedback, we found partial transfer. This suggests that&#xd;
in the absence of visual feedback, the vectorial adaptation hypothesis is insufficient and&#xd;
adaptation to a visuomotor rotation is mediated by the later stages of the visuomotor&#xd;
transformation, when the motor commands specific to the hand path used are being&#xd;
generated.</description>

   <title>The Phenomenology of Role Play: Are Children “Thinking-As-If” or “Behaving-As-If”?</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2009-04-15 17:02:11.029</description>
   <description>When children role play, they do things such as change their tone of voice or take on the character’s emotions or needs. These behaviours make it appear as though children adopt the mental perspective of the character they are pretending to be, which has led some researchers to argue that children “think-as-if” they are the character while role playing (e.g., Harris, 2000). However, it is questionable whether these sorts of behaviours can really be taken as strong evidence that children are “thinking-as-if”; children might simply be imitating the distinctive behavioural characteristics of the character they are pretending to be – or “behaving-as-if”. In two studies, I attempted to obtain better evidence that children “think-as-if” while role playing. To do this, I developed a novel paradigm called the Pretend Self-recognition (PSR) task that examines how children refer to photographs of themselves while they are pretending to be someone else. I reasoned that if children were truly “thinking-as-if”, they might see the photograph of themselves as a third person would, and thus refer to the photograph of themselves using their own proper name. In contrast, if children were simply "behaving-as-if", they might continue to refer to the photograph with the personal pronoun “me”. In Study 1, approximately half of 4-year-old children labeled their own photograph from the perspective of the character they were pretending to be, and thus showed evidence of "thinking-as-if". This finding was replicated when children were given the PSR task at two time points along with measures of theory of mind, executive functioning, pretense understanding, and narrative absorption. Results showed that PSR performance was stable across testing period, but was not related to any of the other constructs that were also measured. Taken together, the findings reported in this dissertation show that the PSR task is a reliable measure of perspective taking in role play, though the source of individual differences in the measure remains a target for future research. The lack of relation between individual differences might suggest that PSR performance is orthogonal to the other constructs and is something in its own right.</description>

   <description>Stimuli-responsive hydrogels swell or contract in response to external pH, ionic strength or temperature, and are of considerable interest as pharmaceutical controlled release devices. Alginate, a linear polysaccharide consisting of mannuronic and guluronic acids, was used as starting material in semisynthesis of pH-responsive hydrogel. Linear alginate was chemically modified with di-aldehyde via acid-catalyzed acetalization, forming a tetrafunctional acetal-linked semisynthetic network alginate polymer (SNAP) with carboxylate moieties preserved as stimuli-responsive sensors. The kinetics of acetalization were found to undergo zero and second-order reaction with respect to di-aldehyde and alginate respectively. With the determined rate constant of 19.06     L•mole-1•s-1 at 40oC and activation energy of 78.58 kJ•mol-1, a proposed predictive reaction model may be used a priori to select reaction conditions providing specific polymer properties. Gel swelling and average pore size were then able to be kinetically or thermodynamically controlled between 80-1000 fold and 30 nm-1 m respectively. As a proof of concept, SNAP hydrogel was fine-tuned with specific swelling and pore sizes for absorptive encapsulation and controlled release of a wide spectrum of molecular sizes of proteins ranging between 1.3 to 546 kDa. SNAP hydrogels/granules demonstrated limited swelling in the simulated gastric environment, protecting proteins from enzymatic and acid degradation, while swelling in alkaline media, releasing active therapeutics in a simulated intestinal lumen (pH ~ 7.8), so is under the consideration as an oral delivery vehicle for protein therapeutics. &#xd;
A constitutive polyelectrolyte gel model based on non-Gaussian polymer elasticity, Flory-Huggins liquid lattice theory, and non-ideal Donnan-membrane equilibria was derived, to describe SNAP gel swelling in dilute and ionic solutions. The derived model accurately describes the SNAP hydrogel swelling in acid and alkaline solutions of wide range of ionic strength. The pore sizes of SNAP hydrogel were estimated by the derived model and were comparable to those determined experimentally by thermoporometry and protein diffusion. The derived model can characterize hydrogel structure such as molecular weight between crosslinks, or can be used as predictive model for swelling and pore size if gel structural information is known, and can potentially be applied to other point-link network polyelectrolytes such as hyaluronic acid gel.</description>

   <description>This study examines the responses of European intellectuals since the 1880s to an increasingly virulent and organized anti-Semitism in Europe, and the ways in which they sought to understand the character and origins of the hatred, and to fathom and work out the problems, terms and possibilities for Jewish identity. Focusing on the French figures Bernard Lazare and Marcel Proust from the time of the Dreyfus Affair and then on the Frankfurt School of social theory and Hannah Arendt from the period around and after the Second World War, the thesis argues that these thinkers created a common historical-psychological discourse on anti-Semitism, which attempted to confront, comprehend and explain the historically critical issues of anti-Semitism and Jewish identity. The study explores the discourse’s fundamental assumptions, insights, and arguments regarding the origins, character, and magnitude of anti-Semitism. It also analyzes its contentions concerning the contradictions, sources, and alternatives for Jewish identity. But, more, it claims that, despite their frequent perceptiveness, these figures’ interpretations of the two concerns proved limited, deficient, even deeply flawed. The thesis seeks to show that its intellectuals’ attempt to understand the twin issues was hence a failure to grasp and interpret them adequately, and to resolve them. It contends further that what impaired the authors’ engagements with anti-Semitism and Jewish selfhood were ideas that were fundamental to their thinking. These intellectual factors, moreover, connected the figures solidly to important historical contexts that they inhabited, thereby implicating the significant settings in the epistemological errors and defeats. These momentous ideas thus operated as both contextualizing and destructive forces—linking the intellectuals to their home contexts and transforming their understanding of their historic problematic into a misunderstanding.</description>

   <description>1D protein sequences, 2D contact maps and 3D structures are three different&#xd;
representational levels of detail for proteins. Predicting protein 3D&#xd;
structures from their 1D sequences remains one of the complex challenges of&#xd;
bioinformatics. The "Divide and Conquer" principle is applied in our&#xd;
research to handle this challenge, by dividing it into two separate yet&#xd;
dependent subproblems, using a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach. Firstly,&#xd;
2D contact maps are predicted from their 1D protein sequences; secondly, 3D&#xd;
protein structures are then predicted from their predicted 2D contact maps.&#xd;
We focus on the problem of identifying common substructural patterns of&#xd;
protein contact maps, which could potentially be used as building blocks for&#xd;
a bottom-up approach for protein structure prediction. We further&#xd;
demonstrate how to improve identifying these patterns by combining both&#xd;
protein sequence and structural information. We assess the consistency and&#xd;
the efficiency of identifying common substructural patterns by conducting&#xd;
statistical analyses on several subsets of the experimental results with&#xd;
different sequence and structural information.</description>

   <description>Dewey provides a rich context in which to develop an understanding of education as growth. By developing an understanding of education as growth, educational research can be incorporated into that context so that a more comprehensive model of education may be considered. Education as growth suggests that education is about progress rather than end states. The knowledge and skills of inquiry must be understood as part of an interconnected whole that includes the physical, social, and intellectual growth of the individual and the community. The role of inquiry in the development of concepts and habits that foster the intellectual and cultural growth of the individual and community are discussed. The work of researchers on math learning disabilities is presented and examined in light of Dewey’s concepts of growth and inquiry so that the educational needs of students with math learning disabilities might be included in a model of education. The quality of the educational experiences of students with math learning disabilities has significant implications for the growth and development of all students, parents, teachers, researchers, and the community.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis was to investigate the relationships between simple anthropometric measures and health risk towards a better characterization of the high-risk obesity phenotype.  To this end, four studies were undertaken.  The first study assessed the comparability of waist circumference (WC) data collected according to four commonly used measurement protocols in a sample of 520 community-dwelling men and women.  This investigation quantified the influence of measurement site on the magnitude and reliability of WC and highlighted the impact of measurement site on prevalence estimates of abdominal obesity.  To extend these findings, the second study examined the influence of WC measurement site on its association with cardiometabolic risk. Despite similar associations with risk factors including blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose, prevalence estimates of metabolic syndrome differed depending on the anatomical site of WC measurement, particularly in women.  In order to better understand the heterogeneity in human obesity and its sequelae, the third and fourth studies focused on the separate and combined influences of central and peripheral circumferences on health outcomes.  Specifically, the third study used data from the Physical Activity Longitudinal Study (PALS) to demonstrate that after adjusting for BMI and WC, larger arm, calf, and thigh circumferences offer a protective effect against incident diabetes.  The fourth study confirmed the opposing influences of central and peripheral circumferences on risk of all-cause mortality in a sample of 10,638 participants from the 1981 Canada Fitness Survey (CFS) with more than 12 y of follow-up.  After adjustment for age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity and BMI, WC was positively associated with mortality whereas arm, thigh, and calf circumferences were significantly protective in men and arm and thigh circumferences were protective in women.  Collectively, the results from these studies contribute to a better understanding of the role of body dimensions in determining health risk and have implications for the use of anthropometric measures in clinical and research settings.</description>

   <description>Recent international and national events such as the SARS outbreak in 2002–2003, the rising incidence of West Nile Virus, and the increasing threat of a pandemic influenza outbreak have brought critical attention to the Canadian public health system and how prepared the system is to respond to various types of contemporary public health threats.  The effective coordination of all agencies at metropolitan, regional, provincial, and federal levels is essential to the management of public health emergencies.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The level of inter-organizational coordination and preparedness of public health and emergency preparedness organizations throughout Alberta was investigated.  An online organizational questionnaire provided a census of organizations involved in public health preparedness, and information on the structure of inter-organizational relations in Alberta and the state of public health preparedness from the perspective of organizational members.  The primary goal was to use the information provided by individual agencies to help improve how policymakers and public health and emergency management officials plan and organize for public health threats and emergencies.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Major findings are as follows: i) organizational characteristics including organizational training opportunities, size, and jurisdiction are associated with different dimensions of organizational-level preparedness in Alberta, ii) perceived organizational connectivity serves as a proxy measure of formal ties objectively reported by organizations with respect to pandemic influenza preparedness, iii) higher jurisdictional organizations display greater degrees of interconnectedness on average, and iv) organizational connectivity moderates the association of perceived public health preparedness with an organization’s objective level of preparedness, independent of jurisdictional level.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The true test of public health preparedness is in how the system responds to an actual crisis.  Since public health emergencies are rare, there is an absence of province-wide data in this regard; however, this work has measured organizational-level perceptions of public health preparedness as a proxy for actual preparedness.  It is critical that organizations have a written emergency response plan which is tested in practice through exercises or in a real situation to observe jurisdictional and organizational ability to execute an appropriate response and assess communication and resource flow among organizations.</description>

   <description>Code faults can seriously degrade scientific software accuracy. Therefore, it is imperative that scientific software developers scrutinize their codes in an attempt to find these faults. This thesis explores, particularly, the efficacy of code testing as a method of scientific software code fault detection.&#xd;
&#xd;
Software engineers, as experts in code quality, have developed many code testing techniques, but many of these techniques cannot readily be applied to scientific codes for at least two reasons. First, scientific software testers do not usually have access to an ideal oracle. Second, scientific software outputs, by nature, can only be judged for accuracy and not correctness. Testing techniques developed under the assumption that these two problems can be ignored--as most have been--are of questionable value to computational scientists.&#xd;
&#xd;
To demonstrate the reality of these problems and to provide an example of how software engineers and scientists can begin to address them, this thesis discusses the development and application of a novel technique: Mutation Sensitivity Testing (MST). MST is based on traditional mutation testing, but--in place of a focus on mutant "killing"--MST focuses on assessing the mutation sensitivity of a test set.  In this thesis, MST experiments are conducted using eight small numerical routines, four classes of mutation operators, and 1155 tests. The results are discussed and some conclusions are drawn. Two observations are of particular interest to computational scientists. First, it is found that oracles that exhibit uncertainties greater than (approximately) 80% of the expected output are of questionable value when they are used in the testing of scientific software. Second, it is found that a small number&#xd;
of carefully selected tests may be sufficient to falsify a code.</description>

   <description>Mesoporous silicates are excellent materials for supported catalysis due to their ease of functionalization, tunable pore size and high surface areas. Mesoporous silicates have been utilized in a variety of applications such as drug delivery scaffolds and catalyst supports. Functionalization of the surface can be achieved by either grafting of alkoxy silanes or co-condensation of the organosilane with the inorganic silica source. &#xd;
My research in this area can be divided into two components.  In the first, we address the significant issue of metal contamination after reactions that are catalyzed by transition metals.  In the second, we examine the design of new catalysts based on organic/inorganic composites.&#xd;
Ruthenium catalyzed processes such as olefin metathesis or asymmetric hydrogenation, are often underutilized due to the difficulty of removing the ruthenium by-products. Attempts to remove ruthenium involve treating the solution with a scavenging reagent followed by silica chromatography. Often these scavenging agents are expensive phosphines or toxic agents like lead tetra-acetate. SBA-15 functionalized with aminopropyl triethoxysilane displays a high affinity for ruthenium. Furthermore, it can be utilized to remove ruthenium by-products from olefin metathesis or hydrogenation reactions without the need for silica chromatography.&#xd;
	We have also prepared sulfur-functionalized mesoporous silicates that have a high affinity for palladium. The materials after loading prove to be active catalysts for a variety of palladium catalyzed processes such as Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira couplings. The catalysts are recyclable with moderate loss of activity and structure, depending on the method of incorporation of the thiol. We have characterized the as-synthesized and used catalysts by nitrogen sorption, TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and a variety of homogeneity tests were performed on the catalysts.&#xd;
	Periodic mesoporous organosilicates (PMOs) are a well known class of inorganic-organic hybrid materials. The majority of PMOs prepared utilize simple organic bridges such as ethyl, phenyl or biphenyl. The use of a chiral organic bridging group, such as BINAP, allows the synthesis of chiral PMOs with possible applications in catalysis and separation science. The synthesis of a triethoxysilyl functionalized BINAP as well as its incorporation into PMO materials with 4,4’-bistriethoxysilyl biphenyl or tetraethylorthosilicate as co-silica sources are described.</description>

   <description>Web services are autonomic software applications that provide specific services on the Web and are accessible through standards-based protocols and interfaces in order to ensure interoperability. Web services have gained immense popularity due to the potential of dynamically composing multiple Web services over the Internet into complex multi-organizational Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumer processes. The management of such composite processes, however, poses a non-trivial problem in terms of cost and complexity due to technology growth, increasing consumer demands for service quality, and the varying Internet workload. &#xd;
&#xd;
     Based on a study of the state-of-the-art and a critical assessment of the limitations of the existing solutions, we present the Comprehensive Service Management Middleware (CSMM) framework to facilitate execution of the four major tasks of client-side process management namely, service selection, negotiation of Service Level Agreement (SLA), composition and execution of the process, and monitoring and validation of SLAs. We also propose the Negotiation Broker (NB) framework for automated intelligent agent-based negotiation of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and the Performance Monitor (PM) framework for distributed client-side monitoring and verification of SLAs. The NB expedites bilateral bargaining of SLAs in a trusted broker framework with enhanced decision algorithms to enable consumer feedback during negotiation. The PM presents a flexible and extensible trusted monitoring solution, which enables faster error detection and recovery and automatic creation of a reputation knowledge base.&#xd;
&#xd;
     We explain a scenario of autonomic process management using the CSMM. We describe experiments using agent simulations on a prototype of the NB to validate our proposed policy model for business level specification of negotiation preferences, the mathematical policy mapping model, and the decision algorithms for different consumer preferences. The optimality of the negotiation results are illustrated by combined utility value of the negotiation outcomes for both parties. The experiments conducted on the proof of concept prototype of the PM show its viability, efficiency, and accuracy in distributed SLA monitoring and verification because it does not include network performance. The CSMM enables partial or complete automation of all the client-side management tasks to leverage use of Web services in business processes.</description>

   <description>Neuropathic (NP) pain is a debilitating chronic pain disorder that is a challenge to diagnose and an even greater challenge to treat. Commonly described as burning or shock-like, NP pain is characteristically resistant to traditional analgesic therapy. This thesis project aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of delta opioid receptor (δOR)-selective agonists in the management of NP pain. In the current experiments, rats that underwent unilateral sciatic nerve injury displayed characteristic behavioural manifestations including cold and thermal hyperalgesia as well as tactile allodynia in the ipsilateral hind paw. The spinal administration of DLT, a δOR-selective agonist, dose-dependently reversed tactile allodynia in NP rats and attenuated cold and thermal hypersensitivities. Moreover, DLT produced greater antinociceptive effects in NP rats compared with controls in the cold water paw withdrawal, hot water tail flick, and thermal plantar box tests. Nerve injury-induced augmentation in δOR function was dependent on nociceptive afferents, since the effect was absent in NP rats that received neonatal treatment with capsaicin. Furthermore, it was not due to increased δOR biosynthesis as western blots and immunohistochemistry revealed no change in spinal δOR protein. We hypothesized that an alternative mechanism, such as redistribution of receptors within the neuron, may underlie δOR function changes. Using immunogold electron microscopy, we showed that nerve injury indeed increased the cell surface expression of δORs within dendritic profiles of the dorsal horn via redistribution of existing receptors. Interestingly, this event was observed bilaterally in the deep dorsal horn, with no effect in the superficial laminae. The mechanisms underlying nerve injury-induced δOR trafficking remain unclear however we may take cues from other δOR trafficking events. We showed that concomitant treatment of rats with morphine and a glial inhibitor prevented both the activation of spinal glia and the changes in δOR agonist effects observed with morphine alone, suggesting that glial activity contributes to morphine-induced δOR trafficking in vivo and may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying nerve injury-induced δOR trafficking. Collectively, these studies reveal an important role of δORs in modulating pain symptoms associated with nerve injury, supporting further exploration of δORs as novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of NP pain.</description>

   <description>Despite a recent focus on understanding cumulative load, researchers still prefer to analyze the data using mean and peak values.  At the same time, technological advancements have provided biomechanists with methods of collecting large amounts of data pertaining to joint loading.  Waveform analysis offers another option that will become increasingly relevant, as wireless data collection devices become common place and provide access to waveforms from many hours of recording.  The overall objectives of this research were to demonstrate some of the limits of current methods of biomechanical analysis, and introduce an alternative, and secondly, to propose a wireless system for use in field-based studies.  &#xd;
&#xd;
An exploratory study using Functional Data Analysis (FDA) was completed on experimental lifting data.  The results demonstrated that FDA can elucidate subtle differences in the curve shape outside of the peak areas typically used for statistical analysis that were attributed to fatigue.  These findings support the need for a better understanding of how workers change their movement strategies as time progresses throughout the length of the workshift.  &#xd;
&#xd;
To achieve this type of knowledge, a wireless data collection device utilizing inertial motion sensors (IMS) was introduced and validated for field use in the remaining three chapters.  The IMS units in conjunction with an anthropometric model were tested against a traditional link segment model recorded in a gold-standard, video system.  Testing that occurred in the entire reach space volume yielded errors as low as 5% for the lumbar moment, but errors also greatly exceeded 50% RMS error in some cases.  Three hand switch alternatives were tested for their potential to provide external hand force timing and duration information to the link segment model, but none were found to be perfectly suitable in the current configuration.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In conclusion, a wireless system based on IMS units has the potential to provide long-term data collection, but the development of the calibration routines and complexity of the underlying model must be improved.  FDA was shown to have good potential for identifying subtle differences in curve shapes, and may become useful when long-term field-based data are readily available with the proposed IMS system.</description>

   <title>Prevalence and associations of Coronary Artery Calcification in Patients with Stages 3-5 Chronic Kidney Disease without Cardiovascular Disease</title>
   <creator>Garland, Jocelyn</creator>
   <subject>Chronic kidney disease</subject>
   <subject>coronary artery calcification</subject>
   <description>Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, and is demonstrable in fifty percent of incident dialysis patients. Therefore, the process of CAC initiation likely occurs in the pre-dialysis period. Pre-dialysis CKD patients have been shown to have a substantially higher burden of CAC than age and sex matched controls from the general population. Consequently, the hypothesis that CKD itself is a risk factor for CAC occurrence is biologically plausible.  &#xd;
Objective: 1) To quantify the relationship between CKD and CAC in stage three to five CKD patients without known cardiovascular disease. 2) To estimate the strengths of associations between traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, non- traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors and CAC in this patient population.&#xd;
Methods: This cross-sectional study investigated one hundred and nineteen CKD patients (excluding dialysis) receiving care at a single hospital in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. For the primary objective, correlational analyses were performed to evaluate associations between a priori selected variables of kidney function and CAC scores, as well as other a priori chosen variables of interest.&#xd;
Results: Mean and median CAC scores were 566.5 SD: 1108 and 111 (inter-quartile range 2 to 631.5) respectively. CAC correlated with age (r = 0.44, p&lt;0.001), body mass index (r = 0.28, p = 0.002), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.23, p = 0.01), diabetes mellitus (r = 0.23, p = 0.01), and the cardiovascular risk score (r = 0.35; p &lt; 0.001). By multivariable linear regression controlling for eGFR and diabetes, age (ß = 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.06; p&lt;0.001), body mass index (ß = 0.04, 0.02 - 0.07; p=0.001), and serum calcium (ß = 0.9, 0.15 - 1.6; p=0.02), were risk factors for CAC. Results from multivariable logistic regression modeling demonstrated consistent findings.&#xd;
Limitations: Inadequate sample size and uncontrolled confounding are possible limitations, but are unlikely to have changed the main study findings. &#xd;
Conclusions: In this study, traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors and serum calcium were associated with coronary artery calcification. No association was demonstrated between CKD and CAC. Studies exploring potential protective mechanisms against coronary artery calcification are needed.</description>

   <description>This thesis discusses and documents the validation efforts related to two new test methods developed for the grading of asphalt cement. Asphalt cements that were recovered from a large number of regular paving contracts and trial sections in eastern and northeastern Ontario were tested according to LS-299 and LS-308 test methods. The LS-308 Extended Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) Method involves testing of asphalt cement in a regular BBR after specific times of conditioning at –10ºC and –20ºC. The LS-299 Double-Edge-Notched Tension (DENT) Test involves testing of asphalt cement in DENT configuration at 15ºC and 50 mm/min. &#xd;
Both these methods improved the ranking of asphalt more than that of regular BBR protocol as in AASHTO M320 method. Pavement contracts and trial sections showing little or no distress were made with asphalt cements having low grade losses in LS-308 and high strain tolerances as measured in LS-299. Hence, future implementation of these methods should reduce thermal cracking distress in Ontario roads.&#xd;
Besides, a number of other properties were investigated. All recovered regular contract materials were tested at –10ºC, –20ºC, and –30ºC after various periods of conditioning. Samples were loaded for 240 s, followed by unloading for 720 s in BBR, allowing the separation of elastic and viscous creep deformations. The regular specification parameters, stiffness (S) and relaxation ability (m-value) and also other performance-related properties were determined. It was found that the confounding effect of simultaneous elastic and viscous deformations and inadequate conditioning prior to testing in the BBR protocol are the most important reasons for the observed inconsistency in grading. These findings are in general agreement to those from the earlier LS-308 tests.&#xd;
The main reason for the poor performance is asphalt physically age during extended periods of exposure to low temperatures. Hence, those that are graded according to the current AASHTO M320 protocol are often under-designed for thermal cracking. The slow crystallization of waxes and precipitation of asphaltenes from oily phase is the primary cause for deterioration of properties. Besides, waste engine oils with other gelling agents like PPA, increase the chemical ageing tendency of asphalts and hence, thermal cracking distress.</description>

   <description>Thymoquinone (TQ), a volatile oil component of black seed oil (derived from Nigella sativa), has been shown to have various biological effects including disease treatment and prevention. TQ is believed to share similar properties to the benzoquinones already in use as therapeutic drugs. Based on previous reports on the anti-inflammatory properties of black seed oil and TQ, it was originally hypothesized that TQ would inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cellular sialidase activity in an anti-inflammatory manner. Sialidase activity was tested on live mouse bone marrow derived primary macrophage cells, BMC-2 macrophage cells, human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK293) cells and human fibroblast cells using an assay that measures the cleavage of the sialidase specific fluorescent substrate 2’-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-DN-acetylneuraminic acid (4-MUNANA). The cleavage of 4-MUNANA causes the release of free 4-methylumbelliferone, which fluoresces at 450nm (blue) after excitation at 365nm. Unexpectedly, TQ induced sialidase activation in all three cell lines and wild type primary macrophage cells. TQ was unable to induce sialidase activity in primary macrophage cells isolated from Neu4 knockout mice suggesting that the TQ activates Neu4 sialidase enzyme.  TQ-induced sialidase activity in these live cells was found to occur through intermediate GPCR-associated guanine nucleotide Gαi subunit and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) by using specific inhibitors. In addition, TQ was found to induce sialidase activity in Toll-like receptor-deficient HEK293 cells. These latter data suggested that TQ may be activating GPCR Gαi and MMP9 signaling associated with Neu4 sialidase independent of TLRs. It is proposed that TQ-induced sialidase activity may activate Toll-like receptors in macrophage cells and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the absence of LPS. Immunocytochemical staining of BMC-2 cells shows that TQ induced NFκB activation. NFκB activation was confirmed with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and western immunoblotting techniques. Cytokine arrays were used to test the pro-inflammatory cytokine response induced in mice by 5 hour treatment of TQ, compared to LPS. Mice treated with TQ exhibited an increase in IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α production, similar to LPS treatment. Taken together, the findings in these studies suggest that TQ is a novel ligand for Neu4 sialidase activation which consequently induces pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores the significance of the journey to Poland in contemporary German literature by women. The texts are Bronjas Erbe (2001) by Beate Rygiert, Himmelskörper (2003) by Tanja Dückers, Pawels Briefe (1999) by Monika Maron, Die Töchter (1976) by Jeannette Lander, and Kindheitsmuster (1976) by Christa Wolf. I argue that Poland, as the site of the Holocaust and of the expulsions, serves as a site of memory in these texts, and that the journey to Poland allows the Jewish and non-Jewish protagonists to come to terms with the past. During their journey, most of the protagonists find what they were looking for. Further, through direct contact with Poles and Polish culture, most of the protagonists are able to overcome prejudice and stereotypical thinking. Since both the authors and their protagonists belong to different generations, i.e., those who experienced WWII directly and their children and grandchildren, the ways in which family history is passed on from one generation to the next and how it is re-collected within the German Polish context is the major concern of these texts. The immediate contact with the Polish sites triggers a process of remembering in the first-generation protagonists who are then able to pass it on to their children to fill the gaps in the family’s collective memory. The members of the younger generations become actively involved in helping to restore this memory. While conflicts between the generations escalate in Poland, the process of working through these conflicts on Polish ground helps the family members to better understand each other. I read the texts through anthropologist Victor Turner’s three-phase model of separation, liminality, and reaggregation. Poland in the five texts can thus be interpreted as a liminal space or, to use Mary Louise Pratt’s term, a contact zone. Since the texts focus on the experience of the female protagonist and traveler, the role of women as keepers of family memory is also stressed. Because of their intense probing of ethnic stereotypes and the legacy of the past, the five texts can be seen as contributing significantly to fostering a better understanding between Germans and Poles and non-Jewish and Jewish Poles.</description>

   <description>Geosynthetic clay liners (GCL) are a composite material commonly used as hydraulic barriers in landfill liners.  Due to their dependence on hydration for proper function, the water retention curve (WRC) of a GCL is important.  The inherent difficulty in obtaining the WRC, including the range of suction and composite material, has limited the number of GCL WRCs in the literature.  In order to quantify the large range of suctions, a dual testing technique was developed, which uses a high capacity tensiometer to measure suctions for the low suction range (0 - 500 kPa) and a relative humidity sensor for the high suction range (3,000 - 1,000,000 kPa).  &#xd;
&#xd;
In total, four different GCL products were tested, varying in both materials (woven and nonwoven geotextiles) and construction methods (thermal treatment and needle punching).  The dual technique method was used to establish both wetting and drying curves that were presented as gravimetric, volumetric and bulk GCL void ratio WRCs.  The WRCs of the different GCL products showed significant variation between their wetting and drying curves indicating that both needle punching and thermal treatment have a significant effect on the swelling behaviour of the GCL and its WRC.  Theoretical equations were fit to the experimental data establishing the parameters that can be used for numerical modeling of these four GCL products.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2009-04-22 17:23:39.409</description>
   <description>In 2002, members of the U.S. Congress requested the Department of Defense (DoD) investigate the issue of 'human trafficking' after Fox News and an ensuing Time Asia article suggested to the American public that their soldiers had been buying the sexual services of women who had been 'trafficked' to work at the clubs in Korean camptowns. The result of the DoD investigation was their adoption of a zero tolerance policy for human trafficking and prostitution. In this thesis I examine why the zero tolerance policy is likely to be as unsuccessful in South Korea as it has been found to be in the Balkans. I do this by exploring two primary questions: (1) has the U.S. military facilitated the prostitution and/or trafficking of women in South Korea?; (2) how do patriarchal constructions of masculinity influence attitudes toward trafficking and prostitution among military commanders and soldiers? To answer these questions, I use a multi-method qualitative approach including a historical analysis of primary and secondary sources, a discourse analysis of letters to the editor in Stars and Stripes newspaper, and a computer-mediated discourse analysis of texts on an online forum for U.S. military in South Korea. Due to questions surrounding the ethics of Internet research, I also examine the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement and the Code of Federal Regulations in the United States that covers the 'Protection of Human Subjects' in research. I argue that not all Internet research constitutes research involving 'human subjects'. I further look at current ethics review policies relevant to Internet research and discuss the ways in which ethics review boards can engage in "academic gate-keeping". The findings of my research indicate that the DoD has failed to consider sufficiently the various cultural contexts that USFK members bring with them to South Korea, as well as those they encounter once they are there. Without providing USFK members with the background needed to understand the complex phenomenon of human trafficking, the DoD's policies will do little to affect the most important element in the trafficking nexus in South Korean camptowns, that is, the attitudes and behaviours of USFK members.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores social construction of the life course of post-war Japanese immigrant (shin ijuusha) women in Canada, based on interviews with 48 Japanese women in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa. First, why women leave Japan is explored. Their emigration occurs in contexts of tourism, Japanese longing for America/the West constructed through Western popular culture, and gender and the life course. Japanese women negotiate their lives, cleverly using multiple meanings attached to the migration experience.&#xd;
     Second, their lives in Canada are examined. Advantages Japanese women found in Canada include freedom and different perspectives, whereas they face serious disadvantages such as language/cultural barriers and difficulty finding employment. They cannot really recognize the existence of racism, however, because of their language/cultural barriers and of subtlety of today’s racism.&#xd;
     Though dispersed and invisible, shin ijuusha networks have developed in Toronto since the early 1970s, with a major motivation to provide Japanese language education for nisei children. Shin ijuusha mothers tend to regret that their children have acquired only basic Japanese, but some have successfully connected their children to Japan/Japanese culture.&#xd;
     Japanese immigrant women often attach emotional meanings to immigration status. Some choose their status with their family in mind. Subjectively, they tend to feel they are “Japanese,” hesitating to claim to be “Canadian.” They have internalized the mainstream gaze and see themselves as “others” in Canada. Meanwhile, many women feel that Canada is their home. They tend to transform Canada to a homeland over their life course, establishing meaningful social relations.&#xd;
     Third, shin ijuusha women’s transnationalism is explored. They keep ties with Japan, especially for social connections. Many women provide transnational care provision for their aging parents in Japan, which is a new gender role invented after World War II. Shin ijuusha women’s transnationalism is associated with life-course transitions. Spatial connection between Canada and Japan is still contingent in societal context, however.&#xd;
     Finally, how migration to Canada has changed lives of Japanese women is considered. Although the migration did not necessarily empower women, they tend to view it positively, because migration helped them to acquire plural perspectives that have deeply enriched their lives.</description>

   <description>We consider various infinite series and examine their arithmetic nature. Series of interest are of the form $$\sum_{n =0}^{\infty} \frac{f(n)A(n)}{B(n)},   \;\;\;\; \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}\frac{f(n)A(n)}{B(n)}, \;\;\;\; \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n A(n)}{B(n)}$$ where $f$ is algebraic valued periodic function, $A(x), B(x) \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}}[x]$ and $z$ is an algebraic number with $|z| \leq 1$. We also examine multivariable extensions $$\sum_{n_1, \ldots, n_k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{f(n_1,&#xd;
\ldots, n_k)A_1(n_1) \cdots A_k(n_k)}{B_1(n_1) \cdots B_k(n_k)}$$ and $$\sum_{n_1, \ldots, n_k \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{f(n_1, \ldots, n_k)A_1(n_1) \cdots A_k(n_k)}{B_1(n_1) \cdots B_k(n_k)}.$$&#xd;
&#xd;
These series are all very natural things to write down and we would like to understand them better. We calculate closed forms using various techniques.  For example, we use relations between Hurwitz zeta functions, digamma functions, polygamma functions,&#xd;
Fourier analysis, discrete Fourier transforms, among other objects and techniques.  Once closed forms are found, we make use of some of the well-known transcendental number theory including the&#xd;
theorem of Baker regarding linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers to determine their arithmetic nature.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In one particular setting, we extend the work of Bundschuh \cite{bundschuh} by proving the following series are all&#xd;
transcendental for positive $c \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \mathbb{Z}$ and $k$ a positive integer: $$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{1}{(n^2 + c)^k}, \;\;\; \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{1}{(n^4 - c^4)^{2k}}, \;\;\; \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{1}{(n^6 - c^6)^{2k}}, \;\;\; \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{1}{(n^3 \pm c^3)^{2k}}$$&#xd;
&#xd;
$$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{1}{n^3 \pm c^3}, \;\;\; \sum_{|n| \geq 2} \frac{1}{n^3 -1}, \;\;\; \sum_{|n| \geq 2} \frac{1}{n^4 -1}, \;\;\; \sum_{|n| \geq 2} \frac{1}{n^6 -1}.$$ Bundschuh conjectured that the last three series are transcendental, but we offer the first unconditional proofs of transcendence.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also show some conditional results under the assumption of some well-known conjectures.  In particular, for $A_i(x), B_i(x) \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}}[x]$ with each $B_i(x)$ has only simple rational roots, if Schanuel's conjecture is true, the series&#xd;
(avoiding roots of the denominator) $$\mathop{{\sum}}_{n_1, \ldots, n_k =0}^{\infty} \frac{f(n_1, \ldots, n_k)A_1(n_1) \cdots A_k(n_k)}{B_1(n_1) \cdots B_k(n_k)}$$ is either an effectively computable algebraic number or transcendental.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also show that Schanuel's conjecture implies that the series $$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{A(n)}{B(n)}$$ is either zero or transcendental, when $B(x)$ has non-integral roots.&#xd;
&#xd;
We develop a general theory, analyzing various infinite series throughout.</description>

   <description>Previous research has looked into the life experiences of middle-aged and younger Hong Kong immigrants in Canada, while the unique experiences of elderly Hong Kong immigrants have not been analyzed in detail. This research aims to fill the gap by focusing on the transnational linkages, concepts of citizenship and sense of belonging among elderly Hong Kong immigrants. It analyzes their multigenerational transnational family arrangements and experiences of racism. Through questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews with thirty-five elderly Hong Kong immigrants residing in Vancouver at the time of data collection, it is shown that they engage in transnationalism to satisfy emotional needs instead of for economic reasons; they hold a high rate of dual citizenship and have a strong sense of belonging and commitment to Canada despite limited citizenship participation and language barriers; and they do not perceive encountering serious racism in their daily lives in Canada despite language and educational constraints. Being mostly grandparents and not in the workplace, their multigenerational transnational family arrangements also impact on their sense of belonging and overall immigration experience. This research acts as one of the first steps to further exposing the unique experiences of elderly immigrants in Canada.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigated the abilities of artificial neural networks as rock classifiers in an open-pit hard rock environment using monitoring-while-drilling (MWD) data. Blast hole drilling data has been collected from an open-pit taconite mine. The data was smoothed with respect to depth and filtered for non-drilling data. Preliminary analysis was performed to determine classifier input variables and a method of labelling training data. Results obtained from principal component analysis suggested that the best set of possible classifier input variables was:  penetration rate, torque, specific fracture energy, vertical vibration, horizontal vibration, penetration rate deviation and thrust deviation. Specific fracture energy and self-organizing-maps were explored as a means of labelling training data and found to be inadequate. Several backpropagation neural networks were trained and tested with various combinations of input parameters and training sets. Input sets that included all seven parameters achieved the best overall performances. 7-input neural networks that were trained with and tested on the entire data set achieved an average overall performance of 81%. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the generalization abilities of the neural networks as rock classifiers. The best overall neural network performance on data not included in the training set was 67%. The results indicated that neural networks by themselves are not capable rock classifiers on MWD data in such a hard rock iron ore environment.</description>

   <description>The Saint Lawrence Lowlands in eastern Canada contain extensive deposits of marine soils deposited in post-glacial seas during and following the retreat of the most recent continental glacier.  These marine soils include silt and clay deposits known collectively as Champlain clay.  When the pore fluid in these marine deposits has changed over time to a lower salinity, the clay can become very sensitive, or demonstrate substantial strength loss after reaching the peak strength with sufficient strain under undrained load conditions.&#xd;
Sensitive clay soils are subject to a peculiar type of very large landslide that typically involves great extents of nearly horizontal ground, usually occurring suddenly and without warning.  These landslides tend to be described as “retrogressive” in the literature and practice, implying that they develop as a series of successive small failures that advance rearward until a final stable position is reached.&#xd;
The work of this thesis is organized into four different themes, with an overall objective of understanding the hazard and risk associated with large landslides in sensitive clay to linear infrastructure such as railways.  The first theme, documented in Chapter 2, develops a number of spatial relationships between specific physiographic and geologic features and landslide occurrence or absence, as determined through air photo analysis and a review of the literature.  The second theme, documented in Chapter 3, presents the construction of a digital database of large landslides in sensitive clay in eastern Canada, for the purposes of studying landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk.  The third theme, documented in Chapters 4 and 5, presents and defends a novel mechanical model for development of these large landslides.  This model suggests the landslides develop progressively, rather than retrogressively, and the science of fracture mechanics is employed to substantiate the model.  The fourth theme, documented in Chapters 6 and 7, synthesizes the findings of the earlier themes and presents a methodology for estimating landslide susceptibility in Champlain clay.  That approach is then extended to develop an understanding of the hazard.  The concluding chapter extends that work to present an initial appreciation of landslide risk to railways.</description>

   <description>This project proposes a reactor-based instrument, which retains most of the above advantages of spallation source engineering instruments, while maintaining the advantages inherent to steady-state instruments.  The main idea is to allow the entire white beam from the reactor onto the sample---no monochromation.  Diffraction is then allowed at a fixed angle, and information from two sample directions can be obtained simultaneously.  Since a white beam is incident onto the sample, the diffraction condition is satisfied for multiple sample planes in the fixed angle of diffraction.  Multiple analyzer/detector pairs are placed downstream from the sample and tuned to scatter only one of the diffracted wavelength bands.&#xd;
&#xd;
Monte Carlo methods were used to create models of both a standard two-axis engineering diffractometer, found on current reactor sources, and the proposed white beam instrument.  There models were validated by experiments performed on a standard two-axis instrument, which was also modified to operate in a white beam configuration, in which the position of the sample and monochromator were interchanged.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both the models and the experiments of the white beam instrument showed proof of concept for this design and identified areas of concern that required special attention.  Upon a comparison on the results from the standard two-axis instrument to the results from the white beam instrument (both simulation and experimental), it was found that the standard diffractometer showed a better performance in all aspects.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, this project proposes numerous areas where the white beam design can be improved upon in order to enhance its performance as an engineering instrument.  The most important of these is the design of an appropriate analyzer/detector system, as the results overwhelmingly show this to be the area of greatest concern.  Ideas for a few such designs are also given.</description>

   <description>Sludge accumulation, treatment and disposal can represent a high percentage of the operating cost for a wastewater system. This is especially important for small-scale and onsite wastewater treatment systems, where sludge removal can be one of the few operating costs of the system. In 2000, as a result of a large number of septic system failures, the community of Wardsville installed a Clearford Industries Inc. Small Bore Sewer™ (SBS™) system which included two-chamber 3600 L tanks located on the properties of individual homes. The tanks were collectively attached to a small bore piping system to deliver the effluent from the tanks to a small community wastewater treatment system. &#xd;
During the summer of 2007, a field study was initiated with a community survey, followed by a review of candidate sites, leading to the selection of 29 sites for site investigation and sampling. Sampling involved the collection of samples for sludge characterization along with the measurements of the height of solids (scum and sludge) within the tank. The data were analyzed to determine the factors having a statistically significant impact on solids accumulation rates within each of the two chambers of the tank. Household water usage was found to be the variable having the strongest association with sludge and scum accumulation, and models were estimated relating solids accumulation to water usage in order predict pump out frequency. A second field sampling program was conducted in Wardsville during April 2008, involving only the first chamber of 13 primary clarifier tanks. &#xd;
Overall contributions have been made in understanding and quantifying solids accumulation rates and sludge characterization in onsite primary clarifier tanks. As well, the information gained from the analysis of the data collected provides a meaningful insight into the factors influencing solids accumulation within individual residential primary clarifier tanks, and points to future research directions for understanding the factors influencing solids accumulation.</description>

   <description>The development of wide-area networks and the availability of powerful computers as low-cost commodity components are changing the face of computation. These progresses in technology make it possible to utilize geographically distributed resources in multiple owner domains to solve large-scale problems in science, engineering and commerce. Research on this topic has led to the emergence of Grid computing. To achieve the promising potentials of tremendous distributed resources in the Grid, effective and efficient scheduling algorithms are fundamentally important. &#xd;
However, scheduling problems are well known for their intractability, and many of instances are in fact NP-Complete. The situation becomes even more challenging in the Grid circumstances due to some unique characteristics of the Grid. Scheduling algorithms in traditional parallel and distributed systems, which usually run on homogeneous and dedicated resources, cannot work well in the new environments.&#xd;
This work focuses on workflow scheduling algorithms in the Grid scenario. New challenges are discussed, previous research in this realm is surveyed, and novel heuristic algorithms addressing the challenges are proposed and tested. &#xd;
The proposed algorithms contribute to the literature by taking the following factors into account when a schedule for a DAG-based workflow is produced: predictable performance fluctuation and non-deterministic performance model of Grid resources, the computation and data staging co-scheduling, the clustering characteristic of Grid resource distribution, and the ability to reschedule according to performance change after the initial schedule is made. The performance of proposed algorithms are tested and analyzed by simulation under different workflow and resource configurations.</description>

   <description>This study demonstrates the power of deliberate and explicit attention to teacher candidates’ prior views of teaching and learning. Focus-group and individual interviews of five individuals document their development of professional knowledge in response to the experiences of a physics methods course and their practicum placements in an &#xd;
8-month preservice teacher education program. This study also explores and interprets the development of a teacher educator’s professional knowledge through a collaborative self-study between the teacher of the methods course and the researcher. &#xd;
While teacher candidates can readily mimic surface-level features of teaching that they have witnessed over many years, they have rarely considered the complex pedagogical decisions made by teachers. This study demonstrates that teacher candidates’ prior views of school can be challenged and extended by carefully enacting a pedagogy of teacher education that contrasts with the cultural tradition of teaching as telling. Such a pedagogy helps candidates develop authority over teaching and learning experiences in ways that facilitate the construction of principled knowledge about teaching grounded in personal experiences. &#xd;
As explained in the literature review, a purely propositional view of teachers’ professional knowledge cannot explain how individuals learn to teach. Epistemological arguments about the role of experience in shaping professionals’ knowledge-in-action frame the qualitative analysis of interview data. One focus-group interview and five individual interviews were conducted at four points in the preservice program; Atlas.ti software facilitated identification of patterns and metaphors in the verbatim transcripts of the 24 interviews. The changing metaphors used by participants reveal the ways in which their understandings of teaching and learning developed through their preservice program.&#xd;
The pedagogy of teacher education enacted in the physics methods course had a major positive influence on the five participants. Although all had the same learning opportunities during the course, each candidate constructed a unique way of thinking about teaching and learning and developed different messages from the way they were taught. Some focused on how they would later enact the active-learning pedagogies they experienced; others focused on broader issues of teaching and learning. Each candidate also valued the relationship of mutual trust that developed between the professor and the class. &#xd;
Three principles for guiding preservice teacher education emerge as broad conclusions to the study. First, tensions experienced by teacher candidates during the practicum cannot be expected to challenge the dominant culture of schooling. Second, providing a coherent set of learning experiences within a methods course can encourage teacher candidates to confront and revise their assumptions about teaching and learning. Third, collaborative self-study can provide a powerful way for teacher educators to focus on enacting pedagogies that help candidates to identify, reframe, and extend their assumptions about teaching and learning.</description>

   <description>Real-time systems are those whose correctness depends not only on logical results&#xd;
of computations, but also on the time at which the results are produced. This thesis&#xd;
provides a formal definition for real-time systems and includes the following original&#xd;
contributions on real-time scheduling algorithms.&#xd;
The first topic studied in the thesis is minimizing the total penalty to be paid&#xd;
in scheduling a set of soft real-time tasks. The problem is NP-hard. We prove the&#xd;
properties of any optimal scheduling algorithm. We also derive a number of heuristic&#xd;
algorithms which satisfy the properties obtained. Moreover, we obtain a tight upper&#xd;
bound for the optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results that compare the&#xd;
upper bound with the optimal solution and the heuristic algorithms are provided.&#xd;
In the second part of this thesis, we study the problem of minimizing the number&#xd;
of processors required for scheduling a set of periodic preemptive independent hard&#xd;
real-time tasks. We use a partitioning strategy with an EDF scheduling algorithm&#xd;
on each processor. The problem is NP-hard. We derive lower and upper bounds&#xd;
for the number of processors required to satisfy the constraints of the problem. We&#xd;
also compare a number of heuristic algorithms with each other and with the bounds&#xd;
derived in this research. Numerical results demonstrate that our lower bound is very&#xd;
tight.&#xd;
In the third part of the thesis, we study the problem of uplink scheduling in&#xd;
telecommunication systems with two dimensional resources. Our goal is to maximize&#xd;
the total value of the packets sent in uplink subframe such that system constraints and&#xd;
requirements are satisfied. The packets have various QoS requirements and have&#xd;
either soft or hard deadlines. We take two approaches, namely 0-1 and fractional&#xd;
approaches, to model the problem. Considering the properties of the application, we&#xd;
derive globally optimal solutions in polynomial time for the models. We also present&#xd;
a method to fine-tune the models. Numerical results are provided to compare the&#xd;
performance of the various optimal algorithms each corresponding to a model.</description>

   <description>Pressure tubes pick up hydrogen while they are in service within CANDU reactors. Sufficiently high hydrogen concentration can lead to hydride precipitation during reactor shutdown/repair at flaws, resulting in the potential for eventual rupture of the pressure tubes by a process called Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC). The threshold stress intensity factor (KIH) below which the cracks will not grow by delayed hydride cracking of Zr-2.5Nb micro pressure tubes (MPTs) has been determined using a load increasing mode (LIM) method at different temperatures. MPTs have been used to allow easy study of the impact of properties like texture and grain size on DHC. Previous studies on MPTs have focused on creep and effects of stress on hydride orientation; here the use of MPTs for DHC studies is confirmed for the first time. &#xd;
&#xd;
Micro pressure tube samples were hydrided to a target hydrogen content of 100 ppm using an electrolytic method. For DHC testing, 3 mm thick half ring samples were cut out from the tubes using Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) with a notch at the center. A sharp notch with a root radius of 15 µm was introduced by broaching to facilitate crack initiation. The direct current potential drop method was used to monitor crack growth during the DHC tests. For the temperature range tested the threshold stress intensity factors for the micro pressure tube used were found to be 6.5-10.5 MPa.m1/2 with the value increasing with increasing temperature. The average DHC velocities obtained for the three different test temperatures 180, 230 and 250oC were 2.64, 10.87 and 8.45 x 10-8 m/s, respectively. The DHC data obtained from the MPTs are comparable to the data published in the literature for full sized CANDU pressure tubes.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2009-04-24 10:56:51.709</description>
   <description>This dissertation explores the changing nature of food provisioning in the contemporary Third World city, employing the experience of Accra, Ghana, as a case study.  The issue is studied by examining changes that are occurring within urban food markets, and how households are altering their food acquisition patterns in response to structural changes within the city.  The investigation provides an in-depth analysis of the policy framework and socio-economic context for the delivery of, and access to, food in Accra, and probes the food situation as a window to investigate broader issues relating to poverty, livelihoods, and coping strategies within a Third World city.&#xd;
Data were collected from three markets and six residential neighbourhoods through focus group discussions and personal interviews.  The investigation reveals that the food system has been altered by processes of transformation occurring in the city, with dire implication for access to food by the poor.  The activities of traders in maintaining the urban food supply emphasize the dominance of individual initiatives in sustaining the city.  The household surveys show that the level of direct engagement between households and the food market is waning, as households increasingly source their food from city’s various food outlets.  This does not mean that food markets are losing their significance in the food supply chain.  They remain the nexus between the source of supply (farmstead or port) and the urban household consumer. &#xd;
This case study indicates that urban economic restructuring is translated into the lives of residents by altering how people meet their needs.  It illustrates how individuals and households adopt new ways of engaging their changing environment and navigating the landscape in order to survive.  The coping strategies adopted highlight the resilience of vulnerable groups to this precarious urban landscape.  These people are not passive victims to the constraints they face.  Their responses to crisis make them active participants in the transformation of the city.  The study concludes that understanding how the poor organize themselves to meet their challenges is key to understanding any interventions that are designed to tackle urban poverty or improve access to basic needs in the city.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents the analysis, design and characterization of an integrated &#xd;
high-frequency&#xd;
phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency multiplier.  The frequency multiplier is novel&#xd;
in its use of a low multiplication factor of 4 and a fully differential topology&#xd;
for rejection of common mode interference signals.  &#xd;
The PLL is composed of a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), injection-locked &#xd;
frequency divider (ILFD) for the first divide-by-two stage, a static&#xd;
master-slave flip-flop (MSFF) divider for the second divide-by-two stage and&#xd;
a Gilbert cell mixer phase detector (PD).  &#xd;
The circuit has been fabricated &#xd;
using a standard CMOS 0.18-um process based on its relatively low cost and ready&#xd;
availability. The PLL frequency multiplier &#xd;
generates an output signal at 26 GHz and is the highest operational frequency PLL &#xd;
in the technology node reported to date.&#xd;
&#xd;
Time domain phase plane analysis  &#xd;
is used for prediction of PLL locking range based on initial conditions of&#xd;
phase and frequency offsets.&#xd;
Tracking range of the PLL is limited by the inherent narrow locking range of the ILFD, &#xd;
and is confirmed via experimental results.&#xd;
&#xd;
The performance benefits of the fully differential PLL are experimentally &#xd;
confirmed by the injection of &#xd;
differential- and common-mode interfering signals at the &#xd;
VCO control lines.  A comparison of the&#xd;
common- and differential-mode modulation&#xd;
indices reveals that a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of greater than 20 dB is &#xd;
possible for carrier offset frequencies of less than 1 MHz. &#xd;
&#xd;
Closed-loop frequency domain transfer functions are used for prediction of the PLL &#xd;
phase noise response, with the PLL being dominated by the reference and&#xd;
VCO phase noise contributions. Regions of dominant phase noise contributions &#xd;
are presented and correlated to the overall PLL phase noise performance.&#xd;
Experimental verifications display good agreement and confirm the usefulness of the &#xd;
techniques for PLL performance prediction.&#xd;
  &#xd;
The PLL clock multiplier has an operational output frequency of 26.204 to 26.796 GHz &#xd;
and a maximum&#xd;
output frequency step of 16 MHz.  Measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset from the &#xd;
carrier is -103.9 dBc/Hz.  The PLL clock multiplier core circuit &#xd;
(VCO/ILFD/MSFF Divider/PD) consumes&#xd;
186 mW of combined power from 2.8 and 4.3 V DC rails.</description>

   <description>Despite the tremendous bandwidth increase in 3rd generation (3G) Broadband Wireless&#xd;
Networks (BWNs) such as Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS),&#xd;
maintaining the mobile users’ Quality of Service (QoS) requirements while maximizing&#xd;
the network operators’ revenues is still a challenging issue. Moreover, spatial&#xd;
distribution of network traffic has a negative impact on the overall network performance&#xd;
where network resources are overutilized in parts of the network coverage area&#xd;
while such resources are underutilized in other network coverage areas. Therefore,&#xd;
network congestion and traffic imbalance become inevitable. Hence, efficient Radio&#xd;
Resource Management (RRM) techniques which release congestion and balance&#xd;
network traffic are of utmost need for the success of such wireless cellular systems.&#xd;
Congestion control and load balancing in BWNs are, however, challenging tasks due&#xd;
to the complexity of these systems and the multiple dimensions that need to be taken&#xd;
into consideration. Examples of such issues include the diverse QoS requirements of&#xd;
the supported multimedia services, the interference level in the system, which vary&#xd;
the mobile users and base stations allocated transmission powers and transmission&#xd;
rates to guarantee certain QoS levels during the lifetime of mobile users connections.&#xd;
In this thesis, we address the problem of congestion control and load balancing&#xd;
in BWNs and propose efficient network coverage adaptation solution in order to deal with these issues, and hence enhance the QoS support in these systems. Specifically,&#xd;
we propose a directional coverage adaptation framework for BWNs. The framework&#xd;
is designed to dynamically vary the coverage level of network cells to release system&#xd;
congestion and balance traffic load by forcing mobile users handoff from a loaded&#xd;
cell to its nearby lightly loaded cell. The framework consists of three related components,&#xd;
namely directional coverage adaptation module, congestion control and load&#xd;
balancing protocol, and QoS provisioning module. These components interact with&#xd;
each other to release system congestion, balance network load, maximize network&#xd;
resource utilization, while maintaining the required QoS parameters for individual&#xd;
mobile users.</description>

   <description>The keyboard and mouse have dominated human-computer interaction for over twenty years. Much effort has been made to break away from this paradigm by creating novel interaction systems and techniques. This thesis presents a system with small hexagonally shaped cardboard tiles called Organic Board Games, along with methods of interaction for these tiles.  Tiles are used as a means for controlling and interfacing with abstract objects in a computer system. Particular attention is given to controlling games with the tiles, as some of the original motivation for the system was from the board game Settlers of Catan.&#xd;
&#xd;
The many design considerations for Organic Board Games are discussed; prototype implementations that were constructed are presented and critiqued, and observations are made regarding these systems' applicability to interface design. Several proposals are presented for the system's evaluation and development beyond the example implementations.</description>

   <description>Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by reduced bone mass and reduced bone quality.  This deterioration manifests itself in osteoporotic fractures at skeletal sites containing large proportions of cancellous bone (ie. forearm, hip, spine).  Given the costs associated with these fractures, improvements in our ability to model and predict the behaviour of cancellous bone would be of great financial and social benefit to society.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis makes contributions in three areas within the much larger goal of developing a comprehensive model for describing the mechanical behaviour of cancellous bone.  Since the accuracy of model predictions can only be as good as the test data against which it is compared, the effect of experimental artifacts introduced by specimen geometry is examined for cored samples.  The apparent elastic modulus of cancellous bone is found to be relatively insensitive to specimen (or gauge) length, such that it can be reduced below the recommended 2:1 aspect ratio without introducing detectable artifact.  Conversely, apparent modulus is found to be much more sensitive to specimen diameter.  The role of water is also examined.  Dehydration at room temperature was found to increase the apparent elastic modulus by roughly 14%.  This net increase results from the competing effects of an increased tissue modulus and a  decreased bone volume fraction due to shrinkage.  Finally, preliminary work is presented which attempts to relate micro-CT voxel intensity and locally measured nanoindentation moduli, in order to provide an experimental basis for assigning heterogeneous material properties to finite element method (FEM) models.</description>

   <description>This study investigated the overpotential performance enhancement of cathodes in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) due to the addition of carbonates to traditional Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolytes.  It was postulated in this study that this enhancement was due to the protonic conductivity of the carbonates.  This provided an electrolyte with a dual conduction mechanism which improves the catalytic performance of the cathode. &#xd;
	The cathode systems investigated were characterised for overpotential loss, conductivity and thermal expansion matching with the electrolyte.  This produced results which predicted power outputs for a standard SOFC configuration as high as 970, 524 and 357 mW/cm2 at operational temperatures of 650oC, 600oC and 550oC.  The benefits of these high power outputs and their potential to further reduce SOFC operational temperature was discussed.&#xd;
	This study developed a cost-effective, reliable and commercially scalable manufacturing process for carbonate/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 electrolytes.  This pressureless sintering method is the first reported in literature, and is a promising replacement for the current hot-pressing technique currently used for these electrolytes.&#xd;
	The electrolyte composition examined was 70 wt% Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 with 30 wt% carbonates (67 mol% Li2CO3 / 33 mol% Na2CO3).  The cathode examined in this study was a composite cathode consisting of 50-90 wt% functional cathode material (Gd1-xSrxCoO3 with 10 to 30 mol% Sr doping on the Gd site) with a balance of electrolyte.   It was determined that the composite cathode system with 10 wt% electrolyte and 20-30 mol% Sr doping was the optimal composition when operating at 600oC and above, with predicted power densities of 524 and 510 mW/cm2 at 600oC.  At operational temperatures between 550oC and 600oC (and potentially lower), it was determined that a composite cathode system with 30  wt% electrolyte and 10-30 mol% Sr doping was the optimal composition. &#xd;
	It was found that the presence of carbonates in the electrolyte decreased the overpotential losses of the cathode by 50-70% at 600oC for system studied; indicating that an improvement in cathodic performance coupled with the high conductivities of the electrolyte is most likely responsible for the high power outputs seen in literature.</description>

   <description>As the pressures of urban development progressively threaten the preservation of greenfields, it is increasingly understood that sustainable development and smart growth strategies must include the remediation and redevelopment of brownfields. As the support for brownfield redevelopment strengthens, and frameworks for brownfield planning become more prominent at municipal levels, it is important that municipalities not only ensure the proper remediation of old brownfield sites, but also identify a place for civil society within brownfield plans.  The legal, financial, social, environmental, and health complexities of redevelopment, as well as the impact of brownfield sites on the community, make civil society involvement an essential component of a successful brownfield strategy.  &#xd;
	&#xd;
This case-based thesis research examines the role of civil society in brownfield remediation and redevelopment through themes of social capital, social learning and risk perceptions. The two cases studies are former landfill sites; the Rennie Street landfill in Hamilton, Ontario and the Belle Park landfill in Kingston, Ontario. Both cases involved civil society using legal action as a reactive approach to contamination leaching from the respective sites into nearby water bodies. The research was conducted through participant observation, interviews with key stakeholders in the Belle Park and Rennie Street landfill cases, and a comprehensive review of written information. The literature review informed the development of a conceptual framework, which was used to guide the research and the evaluation of results. &#xd;
	&#xd;
The thesis reveals examples of civil society bringing awareness to brownfield issues through a reactive strategy, followed by proactive community involvement in brownfield programs. In both cases, civil society’s perceptions of the associated risks informed the reaction to the suspected contamination. The results of the study suggest that the establishment of networks and trust, as well as the reflective process that occurred throughout the legal action contributed to civil society’s ability to influence decision making. It is anticipated that the Rennie Street and Belle Park case studies will highlight for brownfield stakeholders the significance of engaging civil society in municipal brownfield planning.</description>

   <description>For many learners the school system works. Skills and knowledge are learned, social relationships are formed, and positive self-esteem and self-image as a learner lead to accomplishments such as a secondary school diplomas, opportunities for further education, and futures filled with a litany of choices. For others diplomas are not forthcoming, nor are futures bright with hope and opportunity. Schools in Ontario have struggled to develop engaging and meaningful programs for these other students; students identified as “at-risk” of not successfully completing secondary school. Making up nearly 30% of the secondary school population (King, 2004), these students struggle or fail to meet curriculum expectations often resulting in missed opportunities for the development of a solid framework for life-long learning.&#xd;
	Educators grapple with the question of how to support at-risk students in classrooms and schools. This study provides an often overlooked perspective to the existing literature on pedagogy, curriculum, and programming for at-risk students; that of the learner. It gives a voice to at-risk students and offers educators and policy makers insights into how at-risk students experience learning, how they feel they learn best, what they need from their school setting, and what they identify as meaningful to their lives and their learning. Listening to the voices of at-risk students provides an authentic perspective of how to best serve at-risk students. This thesis tells the story of four at-risk students (key informants) in an alternative educational setting. In addition, one educational assistant, identified by key informants, provided information about the setting and further insights into key informants’ engagement in the curriculum and their learning. This study reveals stories of at-risk learners and what they see as relevant and necessary for active engagement with school and learning.</description>

   <description>The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (Stat3) is a transcription factor that is required for transformation by a number of oncogenes, while a constitutively active form of Stat3 alone is sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation.  It was previously demonstrated that cell to cell adhesion causes a dramatic increase in the activity of Stat3 in both normal and tumour cells.  This hinted for the first time at the possibility that the role of Stat3 may differ upon cellular confluence.  To examine such a mechanism, it is important to evaluate the effect of Stat3 downregulation at different time-points relative to confluence.  To examine this, two different approaches for Stat3 downregulation were used:  (1) the introduction of high levels of peptidomimetics analogs, which block the Stat3-SH2 domain by using a technique of in situ electroporation.  (2) Treatment with two platinum compounds that inhibit Stat3 binding to activated receptors and DNA.&#xd;
	 The results demonstrated that Stat3 downregulation in vSrc or TAg transformed mouse fibroblast cells or in breast carcinoma lines, induced apoptosis which was more pronounced post-confluence at the time of its peak activity.  In contrast, in sparsely growing normal mouse fibroblasts, Stat3 inhibition induced merely a growth retardation.  However, in densely growing normal fibroblasts, Stat3 inhibition induced apoptosis.   At least in part, apoptosis induced by Stat3 inhibition was mediated by p53, as shown by the resistance to cell death by Stat3 downregulation in colon carcinoma cells, HCT116, where the p53 gene is ablated.  Overall, our observations point to the possibility that constitutive activation of Stat3 may lead to tumourigenesis by downregulating wt-53 in cancers that do not have p53 mutations.  As a result, targeting Stat3 in cancers with wt-p53 may be a promising therapeutic approach for restoring p53 function, thereby inducing p53-mediated apoptosis.  &#xd;
	Next, we examined the effect of constitutively activated Stat3 as an oncogene.  Stat3C expression in rat F111 fibroblasts induced anchorage independence, but to a lower degree compared to other oncogenes, such as vSrc.   Surprisingly Stat3C expression increased gap junction intercellular communication, despite the fact that other oncogenes such as vSrc or vRas effectively block gap junctions.</description>

   <description>To minimize the damage caused by oil spills, responders may chemically disperse floating oil into the underlying water before it contacts shorelines and wildlife.  Quantifying this strategy’s net ecological and commercial benefits requires an analysis of its effects on subsurface ecosystems and biota.  Unfortunately, spill-responders have little empirical data on which to base such an analysis.  Herein I report the effects of dispersed oil to early life stages of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).  Medium South American crude oil (MESA) dispersed with Corexit 9500 caused blue sac disease (BSD) in embryos, but not in free-swimming embryos.  The ages of embryos were negatively correlated with their sensitivity to oil, making those that were freshly fertilized the most sensitive.  However, sensitivity was also high after hatch.  Free-swimming embryos displayed signs of narcosis following brief exposure to dispersed oil.  Gametes were also tested; dispersed oil dramatically impaired fertilization success.  Toxicity was a function of concentration and duration of exposure, as well as of the life stage exposed.  When the duration of exposure was &lt; 24 h, gametes and free-swimming embryos were the most sensitive life stages (i.e. responded to the lowest concentrations).  For durations > 24 h, young embryos (&lt; 1 day old) were most sensitive.  The results are presented as toxicity models that incorporate developmental stage, oil concentration, and exposure duration.  Current effects-forecasting models for oil dispersion are based on published chronic toxicity data, which do not account for the effects of exposure duration and developmental events on toxicity.  Thus, the results will better-enable modelers to estimate the effects of realistic exposures to dispersed oil in various locations, including spawning shoals.</description>
