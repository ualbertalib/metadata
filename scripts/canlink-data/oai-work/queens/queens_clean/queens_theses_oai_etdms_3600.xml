   <description>A previously developed, efficient and simple on-line leaching method was used to assess the bioaccessible fraction of potentially toxic elements (Cr, As, Pb and Cd) in whole wheat brown and white bread samples. Artificial saliva, gastric juice and intestinal juice were successively pumped into a mini-column, packed with bread (maintained at 37°C) connected on-line to the nebulizer of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrument equipped with a collision-reaction interface (CRI) to mitigate the impact of polyatomic interferences. In contrast to the conventional batch method to which it was compared, this approach provides real-time monitoring of potentially toxic elements that are continuously leached with 3 artificial gastro-intestinal reagents. Mass balance for both methods was verified at the 95% confidence level. Results obtained from the whole wheat brown and white bread showed that the majority of Cr, Pb and Cd was leached by gastric juice but, in contrast, the majority of As was leached by saliva. Results showed a higher total content for elements in whole wheat bread than in white bread but in contrast, there was a higher percentage of bioaccessible elements in white bread than in whole wheat bread. This difference may be attributed to the several food processing steps involved for white bread compared to whole wheat bread. Both the on-line and batch methods showed that 40% -98% of toxic elements in bread samples are bioaccessible. Hydrogen as the CRI gas was efficient at minimizing carbon- and chlorine-based polyatomic interferences.</description>

   <description>This research contributes to the growing field of ethnogerontological research in Canada offering insights into the health and aging experiences of immigrants, with specific reference to the Filipino immigrant community.  The two-fold purpose of this study was to first examine how ethnicity and immigration operate within various settings of senior-centered community and health care services. Secondly, this study examined the role of place and how it shapes health and age identities among later-life Filipino immigrants. In total 37 semi-structured interviews (22 key informants and 15 later-life Filipinos) and a survey of 138 questionnaires were collected for analysis. Results from key informant interviews support current literature which suggests that immigrant seniors experience significant barriers to services, such as language, economic difficulties, immigrant family conflict and social and cultural isolation. Sharing from their working and personal experiences, key informants expanded on their own views about cultural and ethnic diversity describing the intersectionality of immigrant, ethnic and social identities, as well as their experiences of health and aging in Canada. They also discussed the predominance of monocultural views of aging and the limitations of multicultural and culturally competent senior care services. Compared to research on other Canadian immigrant populations, later-life Filipinos reported high levels of physical and mental health and described very few barriers to health care access in Canada. In-depth analyses of later-life Filipinos’ narratives on their aging and migration experiences revealed culturally-informed views, expectations and understandings of what it means to age in a foreign land. Older Filipinos shared their ideas on the meaning of place, perceptions of aging and age identity, such as place-making and a sense of belonging in older age. This research considers the significance of ethnicity and migration as important social determinants of health and advocates for more life-course analyses on the health and aging experiences of the older immigrant. This research was built from a conceptual framework that incorporated concepts from life course theory and social determinants of health approaches in providing a critical perspective and examination about the role of place, culture and migration on normative views of the aging experience.</description>

   <description>Biological motion stimuli, depicted as orthographically projected point-light or stick-figure walkers, do not contain any information about their orientation in depth. The projections of such stimuli, therefore, provide the same visual information when oriented towards the viewer as when oriented away. Even though this is the case, naïve observers display a bias to perceive the facing-towards percept more often. Some researchers have speculated that this facing-the-viewer bias may exist for sociobiological reasons. That is, mistaking another human as retreating when they are actually approaching could potentially have more severe consequences than the opposite error. This theory implies that the facing-towards percept of a biological motion stimulus is potentially more threatening. Measures of anxiety and the facing-the-viewer bias should therefore be related, as researchers have consistently found that anxious individuals display an attentional bias towards more threatening stimuli. In our first experiment, we demonstrated that individuals with greater anxiety do indeed have greater facing-the-viewer biases, and that this relationship is mediated by inhibitory ability (Chapter 2). As our first experiment was correlational in nature, we next used a between-subjects design. We showed that physical exercise, which is known to reduce anxiety, also reduces the facing-the-viewer bias for full stick figure walkers, but not for bottom- or top-half-only stimuli (Chapter 3). In our final experiment, we manipulated anxiety more directly using progressive muscle relaxation and an anxiety induction task (Chapter 4). In the latter experiment, we found that relaxation had the same effect on facing-the-viewer biases that physical exercise had, while our anxiety induction task did not affect biases significantly. In Chapter 6, we discuss the importance of these findings in the context of understanding how anxiety affects our perception of our external environment.</description>

   <description>The rising burden of physical inactivity among Mexican adults warrants population wide intervention strategies. The healthcare setting has been recognized as an appropriate place to implement such strategies. Although physician-delivered strategies have been shown to improve patient physical activity (PA), physician counselling, prescription and referral rates remain low. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, the purpose of this dissertation was to identify gaps in Mexican physician PA prescription practices, to identify a counselling tool for addressing this gap and to implement an intervention for improving physician counselling practices.&#xd;
In study 1, the PA prescription behaviour of Mexican primary care physicians (N=633) and the psychosocial factors influencing this behaviour were explored. Findings showed that only 6% of physicians regularly prescribe PA and that their perceived ability to prescribe, as well as their own PA behaviour, explain this practice. &#xd;
In study 2, the informational (e.g. signage), educational (e.g. posters) and instrumental (e.g. stairs) environments of 40 primary care clinics/hospitals in Guadalajara were assessed for their potential to promote PA. The Healthcare Environment Assessment Tool was developed to assess these environments (kappa=.81). Findings showed that the instrumental environment is encouraging, but the informational and educational environments could be improved.&#xd;
In study 3, a theory-based training intervention to improve PA counselling practices among primary care physicians was developed and evaluated using the RE-AIM framework. The training strategy reached 305 primary care physicians (52% female, mean age 40 years), was effective for improving physicians’ psychosocial constructs in iii the short term and PA counselling practices in the long term, was successfully adopted and consistently implemented across the state of Jalisco and was institutionalized by the Jalisco Secretary of Health.&#xd;
This dissertation demonstrates that knowledge translation efforts in Mexican healthcare settings are feasible and promising for promoting evidence-based PA promotion practices. This dissertation represents the first step in that direction and sheds light on potential approaches for facilitating such efforts.</description>

   <description>Providing support services and programs to undergraduate students is well recognized as of critical importance in the United States, where many graduate programs and specialized training opportunities exist for student services professionals to learn about the unique and diverse population known as traditional undergraduate students. In Canada, the academic and professional development opportunities for studying undergraduate education are significantly limited. This project is an exploration of the theoretical perspectives of student development theory and a review of academic literature to determine the unique characteristics, barriers, motivations, and teaching strategies for both traditional undergraduate students and adult learners. The purpose is to consider how adult learning principles can apply to undergraduate students.&#xd;
In considering how to best meet the needs of undergraduate students, a workshop series was created to enhance professional development opportunities for individuals who provide programs and services to undergraduate students at one mid-sized Canadian University. The workshops seek to encourage participants to consider the characteristics, barriers, and motivations of traditional undergraduate students from the theoretical perspective of student development theory and adult learning principles. The workshops incorporate a review of adult learning principles and how they can be applied when providing programs and services to undergraduate students. The workshops have been designed as a four-workshop series to be offered sequentially between October and March. Workshops may be taken individually but are designed as a series where knowledge builds over the course of the workshops.</description>

   <description>N-linked glycosylation is a post-translational protein modification that occurs in all three domains of life. Methanococcus maripaludis archaellin proteins are known to be glycosylated by a tetrasaccharide composed of N-acetylgalactosamine, a di-acetylated glucuronic acid, a modified mannuronic acid with an attached threonine, and a novel terminal sugar. Disruption of the N-glycosylation pathway has consequences for archaella assembly and function. Genes located in two adjacent operons were targeted for study based on their annotations and proximity to mmp0350, which encodes a known acetyltransferase involved in biosynthesis of the second sugar of the tetrasaccharide. Mutants carrying deletions of mmp0351, mmp0352, or mmp0353 synthesized archaellins of lower apparent molecular weight compared to wild type archaellins, and are likely modified with only a 1-sugar glycan. These deletion strains were also non-archaellated. Deletion of mmp0357 resulted in archaellated cells whose archaellins were modified with a 2-sugar glycan as suggested by Western blotting and confirmed by mass spectrometry of purified archaella. Based on their gene annotations, M. maripaludis genes mmp0350, mmp0351, mmp0352, mmp0353, and mmp0357 are hypothesized to be functionally equivalent to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 wbp gene cluster (wbpABEDI) involved in converting UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to UDP-2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-D-mannuronic acid for formation of lipopolysaccharide O5-specific antigen. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the successful cross-domain complementation of the final step of the P. aeruginosa pathway.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-07-28 19:04:00.667</description>
   <description>This study consists of three phases examining the durability of concrete bridge decks with stay-in-place GFRP structural forms that completely replace the bottom reinforcing bars.  Phase I examines the effect of aggressive freeze-thaw (FT) cycles on strength of small scale decks. The concern has been whether entrapped moisture may cause ‘frost-jacking’ of the form.  Eleven specimens were built, each using two spliced flat GFRP plates with T-shape ribs, spanning the gap between girders. The study simulated various surface treatments of the form as well as unbonded and bonded lap splices. The decks were cracked before being saturated and subjected to up to 300 FT cycles at +5°C to -18°C core temperatures. Some specimens were thawed without being submerged and one specimen had perforated forms for drainage.  Subsequent testing to failure showed no reduction in ultimate capacity or stiffness, despite the 23% reduction in tensile strength of GFRP coupons from the same form, because failure was governed by punching shear.&#xd;
Phase II compares the GFRP form tested in Phase I to another corrugated form, using short one way slabs to trigger a shear-bond failure.  Nine slabs with different surface treatments were fabricated and some were exposed to the same FT cycles. It was clearly shown that flat-ribbed forms are superior to corrugated ones, as no loss in strength occurred after FT exposure, whereas corrugated form-specimens lost 18-21%. This is attributed to the anchorage advantage provided by the T-shape rib embedment in concrete.&#xd;
In Phase III accelerated aging of the two GFRP forms is studied in 3% salt solution at 23, 40 and 55oC for up to 224 days, using 170 coupons to establish tensile strength retentions. Data were assessed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). It was shown that the tensile strength retentions of both forms were similar and reduced from 77 to 63% as the temperature increased from 23 to 55°C. Results also showed that the polymer matrix is not fully degraded by the hydrolysis as no significant changes occurred in glass transition temperature. When data was fitted in the Arrhenius service life model, it showed that after 100 years, the ribbed form will suffer more deterioration than the corrugated one as the strength retentions at a location with annual mean temperatures of 10oC were 42 and 61%, respectively.</description>

   <description>The problems associated with an overly impartial moral psychology are well discussed&#xd;
in the literature on utilitarianism, consequentialism, and rational decision moral theory.&#xd;
Criticisms of these approaches to morality center on how they invite us to think&#xd;
in terms which alienate us from those things which matter to us most, our friends&#xd;
and family, our special projects, and our personal integrity. To the extent that these&#xd;
criticisms are successful, they recommend viewing morality and moral reasoning in&#xd;
the context of personal concerns. This inquiry is an investigation into how to understand&#xd;
the reasons of partiality as genuine reasons, and to determine, broadly, how to&#xd;
understand reasonable partiality.&#xd;
The account presented here has descriptive and normative elements. It is descriptive&#xd;
of the grounds of special responsibilities and the restrictions on what relationships&#xd;
are capable to support special responsibilities. It is normative insofar as it answers&#xd;
questions regarding what relationships should support special responsibilities and&#xd;
what significance they should have in comparison to other important considerations.&#xd;
The primary focus is on how relationships do, and should, modify a moral agent’s&#xd;
practical outlook. The practical relevance of relationships is modeled on a theory of&#xd;
joint action, which sets out how joint actions modify an individual’s practical outlook&#xd;
by making certain considerations necessarily salient.&#xd;
The resulting position is primarily deflationary with regard to the conflict between&#xd;
morality, on the one hand, and partiality on the other. The joint action presentation&#xd;
reveals that relationships do not need to conflict with morality, but can, and should,&#xd;
incorporate moral principles into the central aims and action sequences which are their&#xd;
mainstays. Reasonable partiality is simply the form of reasoning that adequately recognizes the joint enterprises that compose a person’s relationship. Accordingly,&#xd;
controversial acts of reasonable partiality, such as transfers of wealth, are categorized&#xd;
as substantive positions within a theory of what counts as adequate recognition, not&#xd;
necessary to all partiality</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2014-08-25 20:46:52.17</description>
   <description>This thesis presents three papers in Competition Economics. The unifying theme is leniency policies from an international perspective; that is, I investigate theoretically and empirically the design and effectiveness of leniency policies in major jurisdictions: U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Section, European Commission's DG-COMP and Canada's Competition Bureau. A corporation (or an individual) may be granted a lenient treatment in terms of financial fine and/or jail time by confessing its (his/her) information about the collusive activity. Such policies aim at deterring and forcing desistance of this illegal practice. According to some metrics, leniency policies are very effective tools. Other metrics result in more nuanced conclusions, as tested. Using a standard method in industrial organization research with firm-level data, I estimate the effect on corporations' behavior from the amendment in 1993 of the U.S. Corporate Leniency Program. One key element for understanding the mechanisms driving a corporation's application for leniency lies in the nature of the information transferred from the applicant to the competition agency. I claim that by making the lenient fine conditional on this information, a competition agency will receive higher quality information and promote a higher welfare standard. The accrued savings in prosecution resources justifies the benefit of this conditioning. Another key element is the interaction of corporate and individual leniency policies. I claim that a competition agency should align its resources with the leniency policies in place based on two variables: the degree to which collusion affects the worker and the profit margin of collusion over the competitive level.</description>

   <description>This thesis examined the introduction and potential issues associated with the introduction of low carbon fuel (LCF) within the context of a project currently in progress at the Lafarge Bath plant. &#xd;
&#xd;
An analysis considering the stack sampling methods for acquiring polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD)(dioxin)/polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF)(furan) samples was conducted. The variance of dioxin/furan data obtained from single train and simultaneous multiple train stack sampling methods was compared. Standard deviation as a function of concentration, and confidence intervals at the 95th percentile were determined. The relationships were plotted and superimposed upon one another to determine if one of the two methods was beneficial. Results indicated that there was a benefit from the use of simultaneous multiple train sampling for sample concentrations above 129 pg toxic equivalency (TEQ)/m3.&#xd;
&#xd;
	To comply with regulations, facilities in Ontario, California and the European Union (EU) that emit above the reporting threshold must quantify and report their emissions. Biogenic-based carbon can be quantified and deducted from the reported greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for facilities in Ontario, the EU, and under the California Article 5 policy. Biogenic-based carbon is reported separately under the California MRR. The standard ASTM D6866, BS EN 15440, or ISO 13833 can be used to determine the ratio of biogenic-based, to fossil-based carbon.  The three standards incorporate a carbon-14 radioisotope analysis. ASTM D6866 and ISO 13833 analyze the flue gas emitted into the atmosphere and BS EN 15440 analyzes a solid fuel. Carbon emissions deductions as determined by life cycle assessment (LCA) are not permitted by these regulations.</description>

   <description>The inclusion of adequate physical activity time within schools is difficult when curriculum time is already saturated with a focus on skills that improve academic achievement.  Time-efficient physical activity solutions that demonstrate their impact on academic achievement related outcomes are needed to prioritize physical activity within the school curricula.  FUNtervals are 4-minute high-intensity interval activities that use whole body actions to complement a storyline. The purpose of this thesis was four-fold.  1) To develop a resource of classroom appropriate high-intensity interval activities (FUNtervals) 2) to examine the effects of FUNtervals on classroom behaviour and 3) selective attention in elementary school children and lastly 4) to determine whether classroom behaviour predicts changes in selective attention following FUNtervals. Over the past two years, two separate studies have compared FUNtervals (FUN) to No Activity (NA) days using observations of off-task behaviour and administration of the d2 test of attention. Results from the first study showed mean percentages of passive and motor off-task behaviour were significantly decreased in both the grade 2 and 4 classrooms following FUNterval activity (Grade 4: Passive, MNA =29% ± 13% vs. MFUN = 25% ± 13%, p&lt;0.05, ES= 0.31; Motor, MNA =31% ± 16% vs. MFUN = 24% ± 13%, p&lt;0.01, ES= 0.48); Grade 2: Passive MNA =23% ± 14% vs. MFUN = 14% ± 10v, p&lt;0.01, ES= 0.74; Motor MNA =29% ± 17% vs. MFUN = 14% ± 10%, p&lt;=0.01, ES= 1.08) with verbal off-task behaviour decreasing in the grade 2 class only (NA=8% ± 8% vs. FUN= 5% ± 5%, p&lt;0.05, ES= 0.45).  The second study demonstrated that students made fewer errors during the d2 test of attention (% Error; MFUN=3.4% ±0.3% vs. MNA=4.4% ±0.5%, p= 0.001, ES= 0.26) following FUNtervals. Further, a significant relationship between baseline verbal classroom behaviour and changes in selective attention following FUNtervals was observed (EComm: R=.27, P=0.03; E%: R=.27, P=0.02; CP: R=.24, P=0.05).  In supporting the priority of physical activity inclusion within schools, FUNtervals, a time-efficient and easily implemented physical activity break, can improve both classroom behaviour and selective attention in elementary school children.</description>

   <description>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed female cancer, and kills 1 in 30 Canadian women, mostly from metastatic disease. Previous studies showed PPARγ decreases breast cancer progression, but due to the many mammary gland-associated cell types expressing PPARγ, each with unique signal patterns, the mechanisms required clarification. To define the mammary stromal role of PPARγ during breast tumourigenesis, cell-type targeted PPARγ knockout (KO) mice were generated, and studied using both chemical carcinogen (DMBA) and multi-risk factor DMBA + protumourigenic high fat diet (ProHF) models. PPARγ adipocyte targeted KO mice (PPARγ-A KO) were more susceptible to DMBA and DMBA+ProHF-induced mammary tumourigenesis than wild-type (PPARγ-WT) controls. In both studies, PPARγ-A KO mice had increased mammary tumour incidences and decreased latency. PPARγ-A KOs also developed more ovarian tumours when treated with DMBA+ProHF. Dietary supplementation with the PPARγ activator rosiglitazone (ROSI) rescued tumourigenic phenotypes in PPARγ-WTs more so than PPARγ-A KOs. Mechanistic studies unveiled untreated PPARγ-A KOs had significantly decreased BRCA1 expression in mammary stromal adipocytes, decreased circulating IL-2, IL-13 and MIP-1α, and increased serum leptin. BRCA1 regulates aromatase in adipocytes, IL-2, IL-13 and MIP-1α stimulate immune surveillance, and leptin promotes tumour cell proliferation and angiogenesis. These novel findings suggest that loss of PPARγ in mammary stromal adipocytes exerts both local and systemic protumourigenic signaling changes contributing to breast and ovarian tumourigenesis, and that use of ROSI may be beneficial to some patients. Since human use of ROSI is limited due to peripheral edema, which may stem from vascular endothelial cell (VEC) effects, PPARγ-VEC KO mice were used to unravel the mechanisms. In contrast to PPARγ-WTs, PPARγ-VEC KOs resisted extracellular fluid increases and plasma volume expansion in response to ROSI. FAK and VE-cadherin were also dramatically increased in PPARγ-VEC KO endothelial cell junctions compared to PPARγ-WTs. These studies directly unveil the mechanisms of TZD-induced edema and identify biomarkers to improve the therapeutic window for PPARγ agonists. In the long-term, these studies may help identify susceptible populations, and serve as the basis for novel treatments to prevent deaths among the 24,000 Canadians diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014.</description>

   <description>Data centers and supercomputers have become the backbone to support today’s scientific researches, economic developments, and individual lives. The power consumption of data centers and supercomputers are enormously high, bringing the urgency of improving energy efficiency of the power conversion systems. &#xd;
The LLC resonant converter emerged in recent years. As an element of the front-end AC-DC power conversion systems, it brought significant efficiency improvement and has been popularly deployed. However, surrounding the LLC topology there are still several problems unsolved, including: (a) interleaving problem, (b) current sensing problem, (c) poor dynamic performance problem, and (d) peak gain design problem. &#xd;
The works in this thesis include several original ideas to solve above problems:&#xd;
Firstly, an SCC-LLC topology is proposed, featuring constant switching frequency operation to solve the interleaving problem. &#xd;
Secondly, theoretical analysis reveals that the constant frequency operation compromises the converter’s operation range to some degree. A new control strategy featuring variable switching frequency is proposed to achieve lower cost and better performance than its constant frequency counterpart. &#xd;
Thirdly, upon solving the interleaving problem, it is recognized that existing current sensing methods bring inaccuracy to the load sharing performance, as well as low bandwidth to the current-mode control. A cycle-by-cycle average input current sensing method is proposed obtain per-cycle average input current based on sampling the resonant capacitor voltage, which is simple, accurate, with no delay, and virtually has no cost. &#xd;
Fourthly, inspired by the cycle-by-cycle average input current sensing method, a Bang-Bang Charge Control (BBCC) method is proposed to achieve very fast dynamic performance. The feedback loop bandwidth can achieve 1/6 of switching frequency at all operation conditions. &#xd;
Lastly, it is recognized that the design method of the LLC converter lacks an accurate and comprehensive mathematical solution. An accurate design algorithm is derived based on time-domain analysis to identify all the possible designs that provide the exact peak gain. The results of this algorithm will help identify the optimal design. &#xd;
Simulation models are developed to prove the accuracy of the proposed theories and algorithms. Prototype circuits are built to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed circuits and control methods.</description>

   <description>Previous studies with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ heterozygous mice suggest PPARγ normally suppresses 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast tumour progression, but the mechanisms and cell types involved remain unknown. This thesis elucidates the mammary epithelial role of PPARγ during DMBA- and multi-risk factor (DMBA+protumourigenic high fat diet (ProHF))-mediated breast tumourigenesis. Studies were performed using nulliparous mammary epithelial (MG) cell- and postlactational mammary secretory epithelial (MSE) cell-targeted PPARγ knockout (KO) mice. Surprisingly, the first study revealed that PPARγ-MG KOs had decreased DMBA-induced mammary tumourigenesis compared to congenic wildtype (PPARγ-WT) controls. In contrast, cotreatment with a PPARγ activator was protective in PPARγ-WTs, but worsened breast tumour progression in PPARγ-MG KOs. In the second study, MSE-targeted PPARγ deletion generated a significantly increased protumourigenic mammary gland microenvironment and enhanced DMBA-mediated breast tumourigenesis, suggestive of critical epithelial-stromal cell crosstalk. Cotreatment with a PPARγ activator was protective in PPARγ-WT but not PPARγ-MSE KOs during DMBA- induced mammary tumourigenesis, suggesting critical antibreast cancer signaling within MSEs is PPARγ-dependent. In the third study, DMBA+ProHF treatment significantly increased primary breast tumourigenesis in PPARγ-WTs and lung metastases among PPARγ-MSE KOs. Cotreatment with a PPARγ activator was protective only among PPARγ-WTs. Collectively, these data unveil PPARγ expression and signaling in MG and MSE cells as a candidate prognostic and predictive biomarker for breast cancer, and add further support for the novel chemotherapeutic role of PPARγ activation for a subpopulation of breast cancer patients.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2014-08-02 07:56:32.404</description>
   <description>The defining criteria of ASD include impairments in social interaction and communication, and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors (APA, 2000). Compared to typical developing (TD) children, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) spend more time alone and less time interacting in social situations (Humphrey &amp; Symes, 2010). In addition, they report having few, if any, friends and are often excluded from the peer group (Wainscot, Naylor, Sutcliffe, Tantam, &amp; Williams, 2008). Over the last decade a number of studies have emerged that consistently show that children and adolescents with ASD are at greater risk of victimization than their TD peers (Cappadocia et al., 2012; Humphrey &amp; Symes, 2011; Little, 2002; Symes &amp; Humphrey, 2010; Rowley et al., 2012; Van Roekel et al., 2010; Wainscot et al., 2008). Thus, the primary goals of the current research were: 1) to examine the involvement in types of bullying behavior by adolescent boys with ASD, and 2) to determine whether two factors, pragmatic language and executive functioning (EF), may contribute to the elevated risk of peer victimization experienced by this population. &#xd;
	The first chapter of this dissertation provides a general introduction to the current research problem. The second chapter presents a manuscript that outlines the types and frequency of bullying behaviors experienced by adolescent boys with ASD in comparison to a group of special needs (SN) peers and a group of TD adolescents. It was found that adolescents with ASD reported more social isolation in comparison to the other two groups and more physical bullying than their TD peers. This chapter also highlights the agreement found between parental and self-reports of bullying behavior experienced by adolescents with SN. &#xd;
	The third chapter presents a manuscript that investigates deficits in EF and pragmatic language as possible predictors of bullying behavior in adolescents with and without ASD.  Results revealed that EF was a significant predictor of physical, social, and verbal victimization for the adolescent boys with and without ASD. In the fourth chapter, research findings are discussed in the broader context of the existing literature. Implications, limitations, recruitment issues, and directions for future research are also addressed.</description>

   <description>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy, and the second leading cancer-related cause of death in North American men. If diagnosed early, PCa can be managed with a 5-year relative survival rate above 95%. The current standard for PCa diagnosis involves ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy; however, the biopsy procedure is not scaled to individual patients due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of conventional ultrasound images. Previously, a tissue typing approach was proposed that uses ultrasound RF time series acquired from a stationary transducer and tissue position over a few seconds. The goal in this thesis is to present clinical feasibility studies and new applications using RF time series. We pursue this goal in the context of three studies involving: i) prediction of cancer for in vivo radical prostatectomy cases, ii) prediction of cancer following prostate biopsy, and iii) prediction of changes to the tissue following interstitial ablation therapy. Finally, in simulation and controlled laboratory experiments, we explore the rise of tissue temperature as a potential source of tissue typing information in RF time series.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the in vivo clinical study involving prostatectomy cases, PCa likelihood maps are generated using a computer-aided intervention solution that takes advantage of ultrasound RF time series features. In a cross-validation framework, and by using an ultrasound to histology registration, an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.93 is achieved for PCa detection. We also provide cancer likelihood maps and predict the pathology of MRI-identified targets in biopsy cores with an AUC of 0.91. Using a new approach for fusion of RF time series data and without the need for exhaustive search in the feature space, we achieve comparable classification results with those obtained previously using a feature selection approach to characterize PCa in vivo. Moreover, the application of ultrasound RF time series imaging to differentiate ablated and non-ablated tissue results in the cross-validation accuracy of 84.5%, and an AUC of 0.91 for ex vivo data, and an accuracy of 85% for in situ data.</description>

   <title>The Role of Interleukin-17A in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-related Neural Plasticity</title>

   <description>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that cause impairments in GI functions, as well as structural and functional plasticity to the innervation of gut that regulates these functions. T helper-17 lymphocytes and interleukin (IL)-17A are crucial to the pathogenesis of IBD and intestinal inflammation. Recent studies in mice report that IL-17A promotes postganglionic sympathetic neurite outgrowth, inhibits voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and likely contributes to neuroanatomical plasticity within the inflamed GI tract. We hypothesized that IL-17A contributes to sympathetic neuroanatomical remodelling in the colon of patients with IBD and is also capable of signalling to neurons of the enteric nervous system.&#xd;
	Mucosal biopsy supernatants from patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) enhanced neurite outgrowth of mouse sympathetic neurons compared to supernatants from control patients. The enhanced outgrowth was abolished when a neutralizing IL-17A antiserum was added. Supernatants from patients with ulcerative colitis did not enhance sympathetic neurite outgrowth, but addition of the neutralizing IL-17A antiserum reduced outgrowth. Despite the growth-promoting effect of the inflammatory milieu from patients with CD, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity, a marker of sympathetic axons, was reduced within inflamed regions of resected colon specimens from patients with CD compared to uninflamed regions and control patients without IBD. &#xd;
	Since enteric neurons also express the IL-17 receptor-A, we examined the effect of IL-17A on myenteric neuron Ca2+ signaling and neurite outgrowth. Depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling was doubled in IL-17A-treated neurons relative to controls. IL-17A also increased myenteric neuron neurite complexity, and promoted the proliferation of enteric glial cells. The enhanced neurite complexity was abrogated by the mitotic inhibitor cytosine arabinoside. Although the colons of mice with acute dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) colitis had an elevated amount of IL-17A, there was no difference in myenteric neuron depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling. Myenteric neurons from mice with acute DSS colitis also had enhanced neurite outgrowth, but a reduction in glial cell proliferation compared to cultures from control mice. These findings suggest that IL-17A signals to the innervation of the gut and likely contributes to the effects of inflammation on these neural circuits.</description>

   <description>The undisturbed flow behavior in the Queen’s University Low Speed Wind Tunnel was investigated experimentally and computationally. The velocity profiles, turbulent parameters, boundary layer and corner effects were detailed by traversing the lower left quadrant of the wind tunnel with a seven-hole pressure probe and uniaxial constant temperature hot-wire anemometer. The research goal was to provide a complete reference data set as a comparison standard for future experimental work. The flow in the wind tunnel was verified using computational fluid dynamics in order to present the model requirements and inlet conditions required to accurately simulate the flow. &#xd;
The experimental results indicated that the LSWT was capable of producing a mean axial flow speed of 30 – 31 m/s, dependent on ambient conditions and atmospheric wind speeds, in a 1 m2 test section. Measurements were collected under a variety of external weather conditions and it was determined that the average transient and spatial flow deviation from the mean was on the order of 1.5% and 0.5% respectively. The boundary layer thickness at the exit of the test section was found to be 10 cm above the floor and the corner effects were determined to extend 15 cm into the test section. The turbulent intensity reached 10% at the wall boundaries decaying to a constant uniform value of 3% in the center. &#xd;
Computational simulations were performed for three specific sets of experimental data. The results indicated that the mean axial velocity was predicted with an average deviation of 0.5%. Solution results were extrapolated 1 m downstream from the contraction exit plane, averaged and used to provide reference inlet conditions to a simplified test section model. The turbulence model applied to the solution was varied; the Spalart-Allmaras, k-ε, k-ω, and the blended k-ω SST models were able to resolve the turbulent distribution and flow behavior in a comparable manner. The flow was predicted within the bounds of engineering accuracy, the discrepancy in the simulated and experimental mean velocity ranged from 0.4% to 0.02%.</description>

   <description>The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of adding molecular hydrogen to a mixture of n-heptane (surrogate for diesel fuel) and air on ignition delay time at prototypic post-compression diesel engine conditions. Ignition delay time data was measured using the reflected shock wave technique at a pressure of 20 bar (representative of part load engine conditions), for three fuel equivalence ratios (ϕ = 0.833, 1, 1.25) over a temperature range of 700 K to 1150 K. The ignition delay time data, obtained for all heptane-hydrogen fuel combinations and fuel-air equivalence ratios, is characterized by a negative temperature coefficient region between 800 K and 1000 K. This is shown to be consistent with known intermediate temperature large hydrocarbon molecular kinetics.  For prototypic diesel post-compression temperatures of less than 1000 K the addition of hydrogen to n-heptane-air, for all three equivalence ratios, resulted in an increase in the measured ignition delay time. This increase was the result of hydrogen acting as a diluent due to the relatively slow dissociation compared to heptane. Therefore, although hydrogen addition to the diesel fuel is expected to reduce soot, it will have a negative impact on the cetane number. However, the impact is expected to be very small as 20% hydrogen addition on average only increases the ignition delay time by 8%. For temperatures above 1000 K, the fast decomposition of hydrogen provides free radicals that speed up the n-heptane abstraction process that result in a reduction in ignition delay time. The ignition delay time prediction using a constant volume model with the Lund reaction mechanism [1] was satisfactory. There was a negative 50 K temperature shift in the computed ignition delay time, compared to the measured data that can be attributed to the zero velocity approximation of the constant volume model. For all three equivalence ratios the constant volume model predicted the increase in ignition delay time with hydrogen addition for temperatures below 1000 K, and the decrease for temperatures above 1000 K.</description>

   <description>Intrinsic physico-chemical characteristics, trophic transfer and preexisting mercury (Hg) in aquatic ecosystems are ultimate drivers influencing accumulation and mercury concentrations ([Hg]) in organisms in a food web. Moreover, migration between aquatic systems is believed to greatly influence intraspecific [Hg] in fish-eating birds due to differential Hg accumulation during their annual migration cycle. Birds can therefore biologically transport Hg across long distances. Here, I investigated the geospatial variation of Hg pertaining to (1) Hg biomagnification in aquatic food webs, and (2) biologically-mediated transport of Hg via fish-eating birds through migration.&#xd;
First, I examined total Hg (THg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) biomagnification rates in aquatic food webs by compiling data from 205 sites worldwide. There was an effect of latitude on THg and MeHg food web biomagnification rates. Biomagnification rates in freshwater sites increased with dissolved organic carbon and decreased with total phosphorus and atmospheric Hg deposition. These results suggest that Hg biomagnification rates are highest in cold and low-productivity systems.&#xd;
Second, I examined the importance of migration on [Hg] in two migratory fish-eating bird species, the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and the Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia) breeding in Lake Ontario. Temporal trends of [Hg] and stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) during birds’ annual migration cycle was determined by sampling breast feathers and blood in recaptured individuals. I found Hg carryover in bird tissues from winter to summer, which is indicative of biologically-mediated transport of Hg. Slow changes in [Hg] over time were found for individuals with high winter exposure, suggesting a slow depuration rate and a fast uptake rate. I characterized (1) overwintering habitats by combining stable isotopes of sulfur (δ34S), δ13C, and δ15N, and (2) overwintering areas using stable isotopes of hydrogen (δ2H) in winter feathers. High [Hg] were found in birds overwintering in habitats characterized by food webs supported by benthic and C4 primary production. Higher [Hg] were found in birds overwintering in southernmost locations. Winter feather [Hg] were related to [Hg] in fish based on bird spatial assignments. &#xd;
Overall, these findings show that geospatial patterns and physico-chemistry are critically important to explain Hg biomagnification in aquatic food webs, and bioaccumulation and biotransport in fish-eating birds.</description>

   <description>Increased wireless network intelligence and interference awareness enabled by cognitive radio can lead to improved spectrum utilization and network performance. This thesis proposes a novel Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS) algorithm based around a cognitive radio platform developed by Communications Research Centre Canada (CRC). The proposed algorithm leverages the underlying cognitive radio platform to continuously monitor and dynamically adjust the channels of the network based on identified WiFi interference sources, thus relieving the network operator of having to manually configure and update the channels across the network.&#xd;
&#xd;
In recent years, the widespread adoption and deployment of WiFi networks has led to congestion and interference issues as there are only three non-overlapping channels in the 2.4GHz band where the majority of WiFi networks operate today. The proposed algorithm can detect both intra-network and external interference allowing it to vary the networks channels thereby reducing congestion and increasing throughput. Three tailoring factors allow the algorithm to be customized for various network environments and reduce unnecessary channel changes. An extensive performance evaluation is presented with field experiments in both rural and urban environments as well as the network simulation software, ns-3. The results demonstrate significant improvement in terms of throughput, spectrum efficiency as well as robustness to variations in the interference. The main contribution of this work is a DCS algorithm that uses a weighted edge graph to autonomously monitor and adjust a WiFi networks channels based on a variety of interference sources. The algorithm outperforms the current state of the art DCS algorithm and is the first of its kind to be implemented in a large scale cognitive radio field deployment.</description>

   <description>It has been proposed that our knowledge about music is acquired passively, without intention, through exposure to music (Zatorre &amp; Salimpoor, 2013). Research has shown that the mental tonal hierarchy of a listener, as assessed by the probe tone technique, often reflects the pitch hierarchy of the music to which the listener has been exposed (Castellano, Bharucha, &amp; Krumhansl, 1984; Lantz, Kim, &amp; Cuddy, 2013). The pitch hierarchy is reflected by the frequency with which each pitch class occurs, i.e., a first-order probability system. However, research concerned with the acquisition of statistical rules in music has only explored learning of second-order probability systems (Loui, Wessel, &amp; Hudson Kam, 2010). &#xd;
In a series of experiments, I aimed to explore the possibility of unintentional learning of musical pitch hierarchy, a first-order probability system. For this purpose, I assessed participants’ sensitivity to frequency information contained in brief excerpts of a novel musical system. I also assessed whether short exposure to a novel musical system would influence participants’ representation of pitch hierarchy, and whether participants would be able to distinguish the novel musical system from another musical system to which they were not exposed.  &#xd;
Participants with more music training exhibited higher sensitivity to frequency information contained in a novel musical system than participants with little music training. The sensitivity to frequency information was correlated with the amount of music training that participants had received. However, the mental representation of pitch hierarchy of participants with little music training was more influenced by the pitch hierarchy of the musical system to which they were exposed, whereas the mental representation of pitch hierarchy participants with more music training remained unchanged. &#xd;
The results suggest that unintentional learning of musical pitch hierarchy is influenced by the amount of music training participants have received. Overall, these findings provide evidence supporting the third proposition of the Theory of Tonal Hierarchies in Music (Krumhansl &amp; Cuddy, 2010), which states that listeners are able to quickly adapt to the tonal hierarchies of unfamiliar music.</description>

   <description>Accurate localization of medical instruments with respect to patient anatomy is an integral part of computer-assisted interventions. Electromagnetic tracking is the primary choice, particularly for minimally invasive procedures subject to visual tracking occlusion.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, electromagnetic measurements are susceptible to field distortion by magnetic and electrically-conductive objects, including medical imaging devices, equipment, and instruments. Furthermore, in the majority of applications it is infeasible to mount electromagnetic sensors directly on the distal end of the instruments (tool tip); thus, the sensors are placed at the proximal end to indirectly observe the tool tip. In this case, measurement orientation error as well as instrument deflection can lead to significant tool tip tracking error. In clinical environments, the resulting tracking error can be in the order of a few centimeters. Unless compensated for, this error may severely compromise the outcome of the procedure.&#xd;
&#xd;
This research is aimed to alleviate the aforementioned electromagnetic instrument tracking limitations. We present advanced methods for dynamic field distortion compensation and deflection estimation. Specifically, we propose to integrate the motion model of the tracked instrument with the sensor observations and apply a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm to both accurately estimate the pose of the instrument and create a map of the field distortion in real-time for dynamic calibration. Furthermore, for flexible instruments, such as needles, we propose deflection estimation methods that anticipate instrument bending during insertion into deformable tissue. These methods rely on statistical sensor fusion techniques to combine kinematic deflection models with the position measurements in order to reduce the estimation error caused by uncertainties inherent in electromagnetic measurements and in the quantification of deflection model parameters. &#xd;
&#xd;
For field distortion compensation, we conducted experiments in the presence of ferromagnetic and conductive field distorting objects, then compared our results to alternative statistical fusion methods. For instrument deflection estimation, we evaluated the performance of our multi sensor fusion approach during simulated needle insertions and brachytherapy phantom experiments. We also performed sensitivity analysis for plausible intra-operative conditions. With reduced tracking error and improved deflection estimation, our approach is promising for reliable electromagnetic navigation in various image-guided medical interventions.</description>

   <description>Hawk Rapids is a uranium exploration project located in the southeastern part of the Athabasca Basin, in Saskatchewan, Canada. Geochemical and mineralogical assessments of drill core from Hawk Rapids were used to evaluate the possibility of an unconformity-related uranium deposit occurring within the area. The mineral evolution of this area spans the pre-Athabasca Basin period through diagenesis to post hydrothermal alteration events. Pre-Athabasca alteration is characterized by muscovite and clinochlore while early to late diagenesis is represented by early hematite, quartz overgrowths, dickite and illite. These events were followed by dravite, both in the basement and sandstone units, kaolinite, pyrite, minor coffinite, uraninite, and siderite, which mark the hydrothermal evolution of the area. Post-hydrothermal activity is marked by the late influx of meteoric water, which resulted in formation of late kaolinite.&#xd;
	The alteration fluids at Hawk Rapids have three distinct isotopic compositions associated with these stages of evolution. The fluid in equilibrium with pre-Athabasca alteration minerals has an isotopic composition similar to that of modified seawater or low latitude meteoric waters. Basinal brines with a meteoric component characterize the fluid in equilibrium with illite, which represents the diagenetic mineral assemblage. The precipitation of dravite in the hydrothermal stage records a mixture of both basement modified and basinal brines.&#xd;
	Radiogenic Pb leached from the drill core samples at Hawk Rapids was derived from both internal and external sources. The breakdown of uranium-rich heavy minerals such as apatite, zircon and monazite make up the internal sources while other uranium-rich sources such as possible proximal uranium deposits constitute external sources. &#xd;
	Microbial methane production coupled with methane consumption (microbial methane oxidation) are the major microbial activities associated with unconformity-related uranium at Hawk Rapids. The activities of these microbes are most pronounced near the unconformity where there is secondary dispersion of uranium and associated pathfinder elements that serve as nutrients. This work shows that the integration of both geochemical and mineralogical data is an effective tool in evaluating the prospectivity of an area for possible unconformity-related uranium deposits.</description>

   <title>Control of a Nonlinear Mach-Zehnder Interferometer for Regeneration Using Digital Signal Processing</title>

   <description>Transmission impairments degrade the quality of optical signals and limit the transmission reach. Phase modulated signals are susceptible to both amplitude and phase noises. Optical regenerators based on nonlinear Mach Zehnder interferometers (NMZIs) are able to suppress them both. To use a NMZI as a regenerator, the frequency of the pump signal must be kept close to that of the data carrier and the phase difference between the data and pump signals needs to be aligned with the phase transfer curve. A digital signal processing (DSP) based control method is proposed and demonstrated in this thesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
The method uses a coherent receiver with DSP to estimate the frequency offset and phase difference between the input data and pump signals. A control signal is generated according to the estimation results for a frequency and phase shifter to adjust the pump signal. System performance of regenerators with the control method for 43 Gb/s DPSK signals is evaluated by simulation. The sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in coherent receiver is 335.94 MSa/s, which largely reduces the complexity and cost. The simulations assume all the samples are obtained at bit centers for simplicity. The validity of this assumption is demonstrated.&#xd;
&#xd;
Experimental 40 Gb/s DPSK signal is detected using an optical modulation analyzer (OMA). Signals are collected at an OSNR of 20.7 dB, corresponding to an error free condition. Frequency offset and phase estimation is performed using the collected data with both the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and moving average method at 40 GSa/s and the proposed method at 312.5 MSa/s. The two methods give results of minor difference. After frequency offset correction and interpolation, the experimental data are used as the input DPSK signals in the simulations to evaluate the system performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
Cascadability of the regenerator with the proposed control method is demonstrated in recirculating loop simulations using both simulation and experimental DPSK signals. The experimental data are collected when no noise is added. The error free transmission distance is greatly increased by using the NMZI-based regenerators with the proposed control method.</description>

   <description>Impaired insulin action predicts the development of type 2 diabetes.  Evidence is growing that sedentary time (SED) is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, independent of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels.  While it is clear from large-scale epidemiological studies that SED is associated with impaired insulin action, higher levels of evidence from intervention studies are sorely lacking.  The objective of the present investigation was to determine whether a pragmatic 1 hour increase in daily SED for 4 days could mask the acute effect of exercise on insulin action.  &#xd;
	The study enrolled 15 sedentary, abdominally obese men and women.  Participants completed 3 conditions, each of which was 4 days in length.  A counterbalanced randomized crossover design was used, in which participants served as their own controls.  In the baseline condition participants were instructed to maintain habitual levels of PA.  In the exercise condition participants were asked to perform 1 hour of supervised moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day.  In the exercise + sedentary condition participants completed 1 hour of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day and were also asked to increase daily SED by 1 hour from baseline.  PA and SED were assessed using accelerometry.  Measurements of insulin action were obtained from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed in the fasting state the morning after the 4 days of each condition. &#xd;
	Unexpectedly, SED in the exercise condition decreased from baseline (9:28±0:45hr:min vs. 8:14±1:07hr:min, p&lt;0.001), whereas SED was maintained at baseline levels in the exercise + sedentary condition.  The exercise and exercise + sedentary conditions were therefore renamed as ‘exercise – sedentary’ and ‘exercise’, respectively.  Insulin action was improved following the exercise – sedentary condition in comparison to baseline (1601±657pmol/L2h vs. 1181±419pmol/L2h, p&lt;0.01).  An improvement in insulin action was also observed in the exercise condition by comparison to baseline (1601±657pmol/L2h vs. 1362±456pmol/L2h, p&lt;0.05).  The improvement in insulin action following the exercise – sedentary condition in comparison to the exercise condition approached statistical significance but was not statistically significant (1362±456pmol/L2h vs. 1181±419pmol/L2h, p=0.058). &#xd;
	These findings provide preliminary evidence in support of the notion that SED, in addition to the adoption of PA, may be an important behaviour to target for management of insulin action.</description>

   <description>To facilitate an efficient process of asset price determination in minerals industry markets, participants require materially complete, accurate, and timely disclosure of information. The standardization of reporting related to mineral assets evolved out of a recognition of the need for such information. However, development of an international mineral asset valuation code has lagged behind similar efforts for technical reporting of reserves and resources.&#xd;
A review of existing national mineral asset valuation codes in Australia, Canada, and South Africa indicated broad compatibility of these codes with respect to developing an international standard. The existing national codes provide a firm foundation on which to base a harmonized global standard, including valuation principles, common definitions, and code structure. While a previously existent standard, Guidance Note 14, developed by the International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC) was withdrawn in 2010, the emergence of the International Mineral Valuation (IMVAL) Committee and a new IVSC Extractive Industries Expert Group in 2012, suggests new hope for a global standard.&#xd;
A series of interviews were conducted in order to assess the viability of developing an international mineral asset valuation code, and to determine the current state of valuation reporting standards. Interviewees included market regulators, valuation professionals, representatives of minerals professional organizations, and other individuals identified as key persons in the development of mineral asset valuation codes. These interviews in combination with a review of existing valuation reporting codes and practices indicated that the industry would be best placed to adopt the International Valuation Standards (IVS) and develop an Extractives Industry Standard as well as an Extractives Industry Technical Paper to be incorporated into a subsequent edition of the IVS.&#xd;
An analysis of the business case for an international mineral asset valuation code indicated the urgency of developing such a code. The severe access to capital constraints faced by the industry in 2013, in&#xd;
combination with generally declining market conditions indicate a need to attract alternative forms of financing which would be better facilitated through improved reporting. The expansion of the market for valuation services and reduced regulatory compliance costs were also identified as key benefits.</description>

   <description>The dysregulation of motility typical in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indicates involvement of the enteric nervous system (ENS). Indeed, animal models of IBD have demonstrated that intestinal inflammation is typified by the early loss of enteric neurons. It has been proposed that ischemia may occur in intestinal inflammation, due to the organization of splanchnic circulation combined with local inflammatory damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ENS experiences ischemic challenge in inflammation, which we investigated by probing for hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α) in the 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-model of colitis in adult rats. By Day 2 of TNBS-induced colitis, HIF1-α presence in the nuclei of myenteric neurons had significantly increased, indicating hypoxic challenge. &#xd;
Despite the potential for ischemia to occur in inflammation, little is known about the impact of the resultant metabolic inhibition on enteric neurons. We further hypothesized that metabolic challenge would cause neuronal damage. Glucose deprivation, hypoxia and treatment with an electron transport chain (ETC) uncoupler caused neuron loss and axonal damage in in vitro co-cultures of myenteric neurons, intestinal smooth muscle cells and glia. Furthermore, we investigated the potential impact of subsequent reperfusion on myenteric neurons by resupplying glucose following a period of deprivation. Resupply of glucose was observed to cause acute neuron loss in vitro.&#xd;
Lastly, if the ENS is damaged by ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion, it is then important to investigate methods of neuroprotection. In the CNS, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and HIF1-α have both been demonstrated to be neuroprotective during metabolic inhibition. In co-cultures, GDNF was observed to prevent neuron loss by an ETC uncoupler or glucose deprivation. Hypoxic preconditioning also protected against neuron damage in a HIF1- α dependent manner. We concluded that the ENS is vulnerable to ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion occurring in inflammation. Further, GDNF and HIF1-α can be neuroprotective during metabolic challenge.</description>

   <description>The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the α subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel (IKr), which plays an essential role in human cardiac repolarization. Dysfunction of hERG caused by genetic mutations or drug-mediated effects can lead to long QT syndrome (LQTS), predisposing affected individuals to cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden death. Recently, studies have reported roles for fever in triggering QT prolongation and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias in patients with congenital hERG mutations or in those with no familial or medical history related to LQTS. In contrast, cell culture at low temperature (27°C) can rescue mutation-related or drug-induced reduction in hERG expression and function in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing hERG channels. In this study, I investigated the hypothesis that hERG channel function is altered by increased temperature, the potential mechanisms responsible, and the role of such effect on fever-precipitated LQTS. Since hypokalemia (a low serum K+ concentration) accentuates hERG degradation and may occur concomitantly with fever, I also examined the effect of febrile temperature on hERG under low-K+ conditions. Using Western blot, electrophysiological, and immunocytochemical analyses, I found that culturing cells at febrile temperature (40°C) specifically reduced the expression and current amplitude of wild type (WT) hERG stably expressed in HEK293 cells. This reduction of cell-surface hERG is through accelerated degradation, mediated by extracellular K+: the K+ concentration to maintain half maximum of hERG conductance (EC50) was shifted from 0.5 mM at 37°C to 1.6 mM at 40°C after overnight cultures; and low K+-insensitive hERG mutations S624T and F627Y completely abolished both hypokalemia-and febrile temperature-induced reduction of IhERG. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, both febrile temperature and hypokalemia prolonged the cardiac action potential and selectively reduced IKr. Also, the in-vivo rabbit model showed that fever and hypokalemia induced in rabbits synergistically prolonged the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). These results indicate that febrile temperature may facilitate the development of LQTS through expediting hERG degradation, especially under conditions such as hypokalemia.&#xd;

   <description>The human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr). A reduction in the hERG current causes long QT syndrome, predisposing affected individuals to a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. We previously reported that hERG channels in the plasma membrane undergo internalization under low K+ conditions. While studies have characterized the synthesis and degradation pathways that maintain the homeostasis of hERG density in the plasma membrane, whether internalization occurs under normal K+ conditions and whether internalized channels can be recycled to the plasma membrane are not addressed. Using patch clamp, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses, we studied the retrieval trafficking of internalized hERG channels to the plasma membrane. Our data demonstrated that an enhanced internalization is accompanied by an increased rate of recovery of hERG channels to the plasma membrane. The increased recovery rate is not due to enhanced protein synthesis, since hERG mRNA expression level was not altered by low K+ exposure, and the increased recovery was not affected by the inhibition of protein synthesis using cycloheximide. Disrupting the trans-Golgi network with brefeldin A (BFA) blocked not only hERG maturation, but also the retrieval trafficking. Given these findings, we were interested to identify which Rab GTPase proteins were involved in this recycling pathway, since these proteins are known to regulate trafficking. Our study demonstrated that GTPase Rab11, but not Rab4, is involved in the retrieval trafficking of hERG channels. Furthermore, interfering with Rab11 function not only delayed hERG recovery after exposure to low K+ medium, but led to decreased hERG expression and function under normal culture conditions. We conclude that the retrieval trafficking plays an important role in the homeostasis of membrane-bound hERG channels.</description>

   <description>According to biological sciences, placentas are transient organs that are necessary for mammalian fetal development and produced by interaction of maternal and fetal cells, a process called “placentation.” The aim of this dissertation is to understand as well as elucidate effects of placentations. I employ an agential realist framework to do this analysis. As developed by Karen Barad, agential realism is a performative theory of the irreducible entanglement of matter and discourse that relates knowing and being as inseparable. Intra-action is the foundational operationalization of agential realism. Unlike interaction, which assumes that agential entities pre-exist their meeting, intra-action refers to the entanglement of mutually constituted agencies. Informed by this ‘onto-epistemology,’ I define placentation as the differential and entangled intra- and inter-species, intra- and inter-cultural, and intra- and inter-disciplinary production of placentas. This definition is ‘naturalcultural,’ presuming that nature and culture are not distinct realms occupied by distinct kinds of beings. Rather, such a duality is a performative effect of what Barad calls agential cuts enacted by the specific apparatuses that are employed to understand it. To understand placentation naturalculturally requires the breaching of disciplinary boundaries that relegate ‘culture’ as a topic proper to the social sciences and ‘nature’ to science. This dissertation breaches these boundaries, and in so doing opens up new avenues for thinking about placentations and their consequences. In order to empirically explore placentations, I interviewed and/or observed 31 scientists who study placentas, and reviewed scientific and other secondary sources. The main findings of this dissertation concern differences made by theorizing placentas in particular ways. Based on these findings, I argue that understanding placentations naturalculturally is not only a more accurate approach than the one predicating dominant scientific explanations, but also prompts new ethical, theoretical, and practical considerations concerning pregnancy, bioethics, environmentalism, health, and more.</description>

   <description>This project presents an educational context in which previous faculty development had failed to lead to consistent use of learner-focused teaching practices. I chose to explore the literature in transformative learning theory and professional development in higher education in order to inform the design of a longitudinal faculty development program that would result in a transformation of teaching perspectives amongst participant medical faculty and the cultivation of a community of practice with a focus on education. After a review of the relevant literature, this project will describe the curriculum for the program, detailing the rationale for the choices made in its development. Finally, I will propose a plan to evaluate the program in order to demonstrate a change in teaching perspective that is exhibited by a change in teaching practices.</description>

   <description>Gender-based violence (GBV) and rape myth acceptance (RMA) have received increasing attention as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic in South Africa continues to engage researchers, health care providers, and human rights activists. South Africa has among the highest rates of HIV/AIDS and violence against women worldwide. As such, investigations into the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa have shifted from a concern solely with biological transmission risks to deconstructing the sociocultural context of HIV/AIDS. The current study sought to assess the potential relationship between GBV and RMA, and the impact of alcohol use, age, and employment on these issues. Problem drinking and alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use significantly increased the likelihood of all types of GBV perpetration but did not moderate the relationship between RMA and GBV. Men below the ages of 21 years had increasing levels of sexual GBV perpetration with increasing levels of RMA whereas the opposite was true for men over 22 years. Results also revealed that while students’ likelihood of psychological GBV perpetration was unaffected by RMA, employed males experienced an increasing likelihood of perpetration with increasing levels of RMA but unemployed males experienced decreasing likelihood of perpetration with increasing levels of RMA. The implications of prevention in the context of substance use and amongst younger boys and employed men are explored and have great potential for policy makers and practitioners tailoring current programming to slow the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2014-08-25 10:35:42.122</description>
   <description>Purpose: Image-guided interventions rely on registration of images, models, and surgical tools into a common navigation space. Point-set registration is commonly used to perform this registration, but requires well-defined landmark points to be present on these tools. In this thesis, a generalization of point-set registration is proposed to simultaneously register point, line, and plane landmarks present on surgical tools. This facilitates registration when point-set registration is not feasible. Methods: The proposed algorithm first determines correspondences between points, lines, and planes in the coordinate systems using a set of “reference” landmarks, then calculates invariant features in each coordinate frame for an initial registration, and finally optimizes the registration iteratively. Several forms of validation are investigated: registration of simulated data with a known ground-truth registration, phantom registration using a tracked stylus for registration to a model or a volume, and volume registration of a reconstructed ultrasound volume to a model. Validation accuracy is determined by comparison to a known ground-truth registration or using registration quality metrics such as target registration error. Results: For the simulated data experiments, the linear object registration was sufficiently close to the ground-truth registration in all cases given the level of noise. For real registration experiments, in all instances where accurate point-set registration was possible, the linear object registration was equally as accurate, and the difference between the two registrations was less than the fiducial localization error. When accurate point-set registration was not possible, the linear object registration was observed to be more accurate and more precise than point-set registration using approximate landmarks. Conclusion: The proposed linear object registration algorithm is a viable alternative when point-set registration cannot be performed. The algorithm has been developed as an open-source registration tool for practical use as a module for the 3D Slicer platform.</description>

   <description>This project takes an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from modern prosthesis theories, disability theory and studies, as well as psychoanalysis, to think again about prosthesis and prosthetic embodiment across the romance-hagiography axis. My dissertation explores the literary representations of three medieval social bodies and their experiences with prosthesis: the saintly body, the sovereign body, and the aristocratic/knightly body. The main objective is to show how the experiences of these differing social bodies with prosthesis challenge the ideology of the whole, normal, fleshly body, and, rather, offer the body as a malleable concept—as always already prosthetic. In my first chapter, I analyze the Life of Elizabeth of Spalbeek, written by the Cistercian Abbot Philip of Clairvaux in 1267, and translated into Middle English in the fifteenth century, which bears witness to the miraculous nature of the virgin Elizabeth’s somatic mysticism. I then turn to study the meaning of the hand (primarily) and foot in the body of a young child prince and martyr through the narrative of their loss and replacement in the vitae of Saint Melor. This chapter examines what I believe to be the earliest known medieval hagiographic representation of actual prosthetic body parts in the fourteenth-century Latin and Anglo-Norman vitae, composed in England, of the little martyr prince. I then conclude with a study of the formation of the knightly body and identity in the fourteenth/fifteenth-century Middle English romance of Amis and Amiloun, where I consider how the two titular knights’ bodies are constructed and connected vis-à-vis armour as prosthesis. Even though actual prosthetics did exist in the Middle Ages, I claim that, in literature, prosthesis is particularly elaborated in relation to these three social bodies, because it helps to reveal the ways in which these types of identities are imagined as tied into bodies or manifested through bodies. A saint’s body, a king’s body, and a knight’s body all have particular sociocultural ideologies attached to them that I believe prosthesis accentuates.</description>

   <description>Model-Driven Engineering is becoming increasingly prevalent and mature.  As&#xd;
software projects developed through this methodology age, the need for analysis&#xd;
of Model-Driven projects becomes imperative. One form of analysis is Model Clone&#xd;
Detection, which involves finding similar or identical model fragments in a&#xd;
given context. There are a number of techniques intended for Model Clone&#xd;
Detection and for different types of models.&#xd;
One hindrance to the growth of this field is the ability to objectively and&#xd;
quantitatively compare different model clone detectors and settings of the same&#xd;
detector.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, our original contribution to knowledge includes a framework&#xd;
utilizing Mutation Analysis to evaluate and compare model clone detectors.  It&#xd;
is our proposition that, through distinguishing edit operations on models as&#xd;
mutations, we can create such a framework.  In order to demonstrate the&#xd;
plausibility of our framework, we develop a Simulink implementation of the&#xd;
framework.&#xd;
&#xd;
We begin by outlining our initial, qualitative, attempts evaluating our&#xd;
Simulink model clone detector.  This includes challenges encountered&#xd;
that are addressed by our framework. We outline the framework and describe each&#xd;
step in its process in an example-driven manner through creation of a framework&#xd;
prototype that works on Simulink model clone detectors.  We choose Simulink&#xd;
because it is the most mature form of Model Clone Detection, it is of interest&#xd;
to our industrial partners, and we previously created a Simulink model clone&#xd;
detector. An additional contribution is a taxonomy of Simulink model mutations&#xd;
intended to inject the various types of model clones, while still being&#xd;
representative of realistic Simulink model evolution, which we verify through a&#xd;
case study.  We run our Simulink framework prototype on leading Simulink clone&#xd;
detectors to ascertain their recall and precision. We observe high recall for&#xd;
Simone, lower recall for ConQAT because it is intended for only a subset of&#xd;
clone types, and high precision for both tools.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is our hope that having such a framework in place will help facilitate gains&#xd;
in Model Clone Detection research as engineers in this area can now refine their&#xd;
own tools and new detectors can be compared against existing ones.</description>

   <title>The Development of a Mentoring Program for a Local Public Health Agency</title>
   <creator>Blasko, Stephanie A.</creator>
   <subject>Mentoring</subject>
   <subject>Public Health</subject>
   <description>Mentoring programs have many advantages for the agency, mentor, and protégé. The&#xd;
focus of this project is a Local Public Health Agency [LPHA; pseudonym] that is experiencing the attrition of many top executives. The purpose of this project was to develop a plan for implementation of a formal, organization-wide mentorship program for the LPHA. Appreciative Inquiry is recommended as an organizational development (OD) tool to design the mentorship program. Appreciative Inquiry is a positive approach to organizational development that seeks&#xd;
out success stories to build a positive future reality. In addition, organizational readiness is assessed to determine the extent which the agency is ready to implement a new program. A program planning framework is described as a means to develop the mentoring program. The framework provides step-by-step guidance for program development to ensure important steps&#xd;
are not overlooked that could jeopardize the success of the program. Finally, Adaptive&#xd;
Mentorship® is recommended as a framework for designing the mentoring program. Adaptive&#xd;
Mentorship is based on the premise that the mentor adapts his or her mentoring behaviour to match that developmental level of the protégé.</description>

   <title>A Tensegrity Based Structure Optimization Framework</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2014-08-25 16:01:06.214</description>
   <description>This thesis presents a tensegrity based structure optimization framework. A tensegrity structure consists of rods (compressed elements) and elastics (tensile elements) connected into a stable structure. A tensegrity structure diffuses the forces applied to any one of its elements to the entire network of connected elements, making the whole of the structure flexible and strong.&#xd;
This thesis focuses on structural optimization problems that are bound in the physical world and subject to real-world laws; examples include optimization of a bridge design and optimization of an electrical grid. The framework presented in this thesis exploits the properties of tensegrity networks as an efficient, powerful, low-level heuristic to steer the optimization.&#xd;
The tensegrity modeling framework stipulates that a tensegrity model consists&#xd;
of three components: an optimization goal (specifies the method by which the performance of an instantiation of the tensegrity model is evaluated), a graph specification (defines the properties of a tensegrity graph, including edge labels and attributes that can appear in this graph), and an adaptation rule set (specifies the change over time in the attributes of a tensegrity graph).&#xd;
A tensegrity graph provides a versatile platform for structural modeling and optimization, because attributed nodes and edges can be used to satisfactorily represent the essential properties of a large variety of optimization problems. This is illustrated in the three examples: a detailed and instantiated model of fascia, a conceptual bridge model, and a model abstracting the intricacies of an electrical grid. The components of each model are very easy to modify, allowing for rapid prototyping and insight into the significance of the variables altered between prototypes. The framework is generic, allowing for models of varying degrees of abstraction while remaining intuitive and applicable to the structural optimization problems they represent.</description>

   <description>The transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding domain (TAZ) is a key downstream component of the Hippo pathway that plays important roles in animal size control, stem cell renewal, differentiation and tumorigenesis. We and others have previously characterized TAZ as a transcriptional co-activator which regulates cell migration, invasion, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TAZ-mediated phenotypes as well as its implications in tumorigenesis are still not fully addressed. To identify the genes mediating TAZ function, we have performed DNA microarray screenings. Surprisingly, we have identified over 400 genes negatively regulated by TAZ. Further mRNA and protein quantification assays by qRT-PCR and western blot confirmed ΔNp63, a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family, as a significant downregulated target in TAZ-overexpressing MCF10A (MCF10A-TAZ) non-tumorigenic mammary cells. Moreover, luciferase assays have shown that TAZ regulation of the ΔNp63 promoter activity is mainly mediated by the TEA domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors. Interestingly, loss of TEAD abolishes TAZ-induced suppression of ΔNp63. We have further shown that TAZ interacts with other transcription factors, including the thyroid transcriptional factor 1 (TTF-1) to enhance ΔNp63 repression. Surprisingly, TTF-1-mediated repression was also compromised in TEAD-lacking conditions, thus elucidating a novel transcriptional complex for gene suppression.  Finally, we have shown that re-introduction of ΔNp63 into MCF10A-TAZ cells partially rescues TAZ-induced cell migration. Together, these findings have identified TAZ as a novel dual modulator of cellular gene expression, arguing against its sole role as a transcriptional co-activator. Future elucidation of the clinical implications of TAZ as a co-repressor of genetic transcription might contribute significantly to our better understanding of the roles of TAZ in breast cancer development, as well as illustrating novel strategies to target this signaling pathway for cancer therapies.</description>

   <description>Tensegrity systems are a type of structural system relying on a balance of tension and compression forces to maintain structural soundness. These systems have a wide variety of applications ranging from architecture to biological modeling, art, and even space exploration. This thesis provides a flexible modeling platform for tensegrity systems, allowing exploration of a wide range of systems, including fractal and adaptive tensegrity systems. In order to provide the necessary flexibility for scientific exploration, this framework incorporates a hierarchical object definition structure. A hill climbing algorithm is provided for finding minimal potential energy states of these systems.  Extensive validation of the presented hill climbing algorithm shows that this algorithm finds global minima in $99\%$ of test cases. This framework employs a clear distinction between object definition, object sampling, and object optimization, to allow for a greater range of uses.</description>

   <description>Canadian (N = 117) and U.S. officers (N = 167) completed an online survey regarding their eyewitness identification procedures.  Chapter 2 compared current procedures with each country’s respective policy recommendations.  In some cases, policy recommendations were the same.  In other cases they were different.  Hypotheses were that where recommendations were the same, no between-country differences would be observed, and that where recommendations were different, between-country differences would be observed in line with recommended procedures.  Partial support for these hypotheses was found indicating that policies had some impact on procedures.  Chapters 3 and 4 examined lineup construction and administration practices (respectively).  Some reported practices are of concern since research demonstrates they may reduce witness accuracy, though caution is necessary in interpreting why certain practices may or may not be used as there are many possible reasons.  One of the most marked findings across all chapters was the great variability found in procedure both within and between countries, demonstrating that ‘typical’ police procedures vary considerably.  Major recommendations include policy mandates in order to achieve procedure consistent with best-practice recommendations, as well as provision of training materials in order to achieve such consistency.  This survey provides a needed update in the literature regarding current police practices and offers a rich data source to help stimulate further research in the field.</description>

   <description>The evaluation of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is a crucial step in pharmaceutical drug discovery and design. Unfortunately, if adverse effects are to occur between the co-administration of two or more drugs, they are often difficult to test for. Traditional methods rely on in vitro studies as a basis for further in vivo assessment which can be a slow and costly process that may not detect all interactions. Here is presented a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling approach that may be used to screen drugs early in development and bring new, beneficial drugs to market more quickly and at a lesser cost. A data set of 6532 drugs was obtained from DrugBank for which 292 QSAR descriptors were calculated. The multi-label support vector machines (SVM) method was used for classification and the K-means method was used to cluster the data. The model was validated in vitro by exposing Hepa1-6 cells to select compounds found in energy drinks and assessing cell death. Model accuracy was found to be 99%, predicting 50% of known interactions despite being biased to predicting non-interacting drug pairs. Cluster analysis revealed interesting information, although current progress shows that more data is needed to better analyse results, and tools that bring various drug information together would be beneficial.  Non-transfected Hepa1-6 cells exposed to acetaminophen, pyridoxine, creatine, L-carnitine, taurine and caffeine did not reveal any significant drug-drug interactions, nor were they predicted by the model.</description>

   <description>Background: Obesity is becoming increasingly prevalent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but the physiological and clinical consequences of their combination remain poorly understood.  In particular, the impact of obesity on dyspnea and exercise intolerance in COPD is clinically pertinent but little studied and is the main focus of this thesis. Previous studies utilizing cycle ergometry have concluded that obesity does not convey either mechanical or sensory disadvantages during physical activity in COPD. However, it remains to be seen whether such advantages persist in COPD during weight-bearing walking when metabolic requirements are greater than during cycling &#xd;
Aim: To examine contributors to dyspnea in obese COPD by comparing physiological and perceptual responses at similar work rates during the two exercise conditions where metabolic loading and respiratory muscle activity are distinctly different.   &#xd;
Methods: Obese (body mass index >30 kg/m2) patients were recruited with moderate to severe airflow obstruction (post-bronchodilator FEV1 30-79% predicted). We compared metabolic, ventilatory (breathing pattern, operating lung volumes, respiratory muscle function and electromyography of the diaphragm) and dyspnea (intensity and quality) during symptom-limited cycle and treadmill exercise protocols using a matched linearized incremental 10 W step rise in work rate. &#xd;
Results: Cycle exercise was associated with reduced oxygen uptake, greater arterial oxygen saturation, earlier ventilatory threshold, greater neuromuscular efficiency and activity of the diaphragm, and less expiratory muscle activity compared to treadmill walking (p&lt;0.01). However, ventilation, breathing pattern, operating lung volumes, global respiratory effort and electrical activation of the diaphragm were similar at comparable work rates across modalities. Accordingly, dyspnea intensity and quality were not different. &#xd;
Conclusions: Our results indicate that, when the rise in work rate is standardized, dyspnea intensity and quality are independent of small inter-modality difference in metabolic acidosis and arterial oxygen saturation that could potentially influence efferent output from the central respiratory controller.  Moreover, altered afferent inputs associated with inter-modality differences in diaphragmatic function and expiratory muscle activity do not directly influence dyspnea at least when respiratory neural drive, breathing pattern and operating lung volumes are similar.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2014-08-27 13:42:58.878</description>
   <description>The number of mobile applications has increased drastically in the past few years.&#xd;
According to the statistics, it is estimated that 167 billion mobile applications will&#xd;
be downloaded by 2015. However, some applications are superior to the others in&#xd;
terms of user-perceived quality. User-perceived quality can be defined as the user's&#xd;
opinion of a product. For mobile applications, it can be quantified by the number of&#xd;
downloads and ratings. Earlier studies suggested that user interface (UI) design is one&#xd;
of the major reasons that can affect the user-perceived quality of mobile applications.&#xd;
UI design is relatively a complex concept by its nature. In this thesis, we try to&#xd;
examine the affect of UI design on user-perceived quality by focusing on two different&#xd;
aspects of UI, namely UI complexity and UI reuse. We carry out our case studies on&#xd;
1,292 Android applications from the Android market (i.e., Google Play).&#xd;
We find that our measurement of UI complexity quantified by the number of inputs&#xd;
and outputs confirms the findings of previous studies on UI complexity. UI complexity&#xd;
can affect the user-perceived quality, and we are able to provide guidelines for the&#xd;
proper amount of UI complexity that helps an application achieve high user-perceived&#xd;
quality. We observe that UI of mobile applications are widely reused among and across&#xd;
different mobile categories. Frequently used UI elements with certain characteristics&#xd;
can provide high user-perceived quality. Finally, we are able to extract practical UI templates with high user-perceived quality for developers to design UIs with high quality. Developers and quality assurance personnel can use our guidelines to improve the quality of mobile applications.</description>

   <description>Many Low Carbon Fuels (LCFs) present unknown spontaneous combustion risks, which must be quantified before their use as fossil fuel replacements. Wood and coal spontaneous combustion is well understood; however, LCFs weather, and subsequent chemical changes could affect their spontaneous combustion properties. LCF spontaneous combustion could lead to accidental fires with possible loss of life, limb andproperty. The spontaneous combustion risks of two LCFs, discarded creosote-treated wooden railway ties and roofing asphalt shingles, were investigated with calorimetry and heat transfer experiments. Chemical changes due to weathering were studied with pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (py-GC/MS).&#xd;
Creosote-treated wooden railway tie dust, roofing asphalt shingle particles, poplar wood pellets, and petroleum coke self-heating were studied with isothermal calorimetry. Railway tie dust and asphalt shingle heat transfer were characterized with a guarded hot plate. Petroleum coke self-heating was consistent with coal, while both poplar pellets and railway tie dust were found to be more reactive compared to oven test results of similar materials. The observed increase in reactivity was probably a result of significant moisture contenint in the pellet and railway tie dust. Critical conditions for spontaneous combustion were evaluated with the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, assuming an ambient temperature of 40°C and constant moisture content. Kamenetskii calculations indicate that a 1.6 m cube of railway tie dust, or a 58 m cube of asphalt particles, would be unstable and combust.&#xd;
LCF chemistry may have been affected by weathering, which would cause chemical changes that affect their spontaneous combustion properties. Therefore, railway tie wood and roofing asphalt shingle chemistry were investigated by identifying products of 250° and 550°C pyrolysis with py-GC/MS. Railway tie wood pyrolyzates did not show signs of weathering; in contrast, asphalt pyrolysis produced sulfur dioxide and many oxygenated species, which indicated that the asphalt was extensively oxidized.&#xd;
Calorimetry showed that self-heating was primarily oxidative — the oxygen content of asphalt probably reduced its self-heating capacity. The railway tie wood was not extensively oxidized and it self-heated in a similar manner to “fresh” wood.</description>

   <title>Young Children's Understanding of False Belief: P3b Responses to an Implicit False Belief Task</title>

   <description>Representational theory of mind (TOM) is the everyday understanding that others’ behaviour is motivated by internal representational mental states such as beliefs, desires and intentions. In the standard false belief task, which traditionally indexes representational TOM, a character places an object in one location, and then leaves the room. During her absence, a second character moves the object to a new location. The first character returns, and children are asked where she will look for the object. Children pass this task (answering that she’ll look in the first location) around 4-5 years. Recently, studies have found that infants and young children succeed on implicit versions of the false belief task – their anticipatory gaze and looking time align with an understanding of beliefs. Some suggest that infants and young children possess a representational TOM, masked by performance limitations, whereas others hold that the early competence relies on a non-representational, perhaps statistical basis. To address this debate, I investigated young children’s false belief understanding using a component of the event-related potential: P3b, a positive potential elicited in response to unexpected events and thought to reflect conceptual updating. Children aged 3.5 to 4.5 years and adults watched 48 trials following the standard false belief task, and P3b was measured in response to seeing the character search in belief- congruent or incongruent locations. I found a significant age group by outcome interaction: adults’ P3b responses corresponded with an understanding of others’ beliefs, whereas young children’s P3b responses reflected a lack of belief understanding. These results support the conclusion that young children do not have a representational understanding of false belief, and that perhaps their early performance on implicit false belief tasks is mediated by an early-developing non-representational understanding. These results have implications for the development of theory of mind.</description>

   <title>A Competition Study on Copper-binding Affinity of SCO protein</title>

   <description>Cytochrome c oxidase catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water and contributes to the electrochemical gradient by translocating protons across the membrane. The SCO protein (for Synthesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase) is proposed to be an important assembly factor in biogenesis of the oxidase. Particularly, SCO has been demonstrated to function as a metallochaperone that receives copper ions from an upstream copper source in the cell and subsequently delivers them to the CuA centre in subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase. However, the SCO protein binds copper ions tightly and forms a stable complex in vitro that is extremely difficult to dissociate. Direct titration and differential scanning calorimetry, for example, have demonstrated a tight binding between SCO and Cu(II). Nonetheless, the reported dissociation constant KD falls in a wide range from 65 nM to 3.5 pM. In this study, binding affinities of Bacillus subtilis SCO (BsSCO) for both Cu(II) and Cu(I) ions were quantitatively estimated via competition with various copper ion ligands and chelators. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as a competitor to BsSCO. In this case, BsSCO is able to compete with the chelator for copper-binding, which binds Cu(II) with KD ~ 3.1 x 10-16 M (i.e., 0.31 fM). Estimation of binding affinity via competition provides a different perspective of quantifying the interaction between the SCO protein and copper ions. The tight binding (i.e., in the fM range) between the Cu(II) and the SCO protein suggests that Cu(II) ion is unlikely to be the oxidation form during the transfer from SCO to the CuA site. Strong Cu(I) ligands, such as ferrozine (Fz), were introduced in quantification of the Cu(I) binding affinity of the SCO protein. Competition with Fz for Cu(I) binding supports a relatively weak interaction between BsSCO and Cu(I) ions, which characterized with KD ~10 μM. Therefore, we propose that a stable BsSCO-Cu(II) complex could be reduced to BsSCO-Cu(I) in order for the SCO protein to fulfill a copper chaperone role in vivo that delivers and releases its copper ion to the CuA site of cytochrome c oxidase.</description>

   <description>The majority of children are not meeting the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines (PAG) or the Screen Time Guidelines (STG). Parents play a role in changing the health behaviours of their children by engaging in supportive behaviours (eg. transporting them to sports; placing limits on TV viewing). These behaviours, and their determinants, may differ for moms versus dads and for physical activity versus screen time. According to the social issue advertising believability model (SIABM), whether parents support their children in achieving these guidelines may depend on how believable they find guideline promotion advertisements (message believability [MB]). Whether parents find a message believable may depend upon their perceived behavioural control for engaging in the supportive behaviours. The purpose of this study was to examine a) MB as a determinant of parents’ intentions to support their children in meeting the PAG and STG, and b) perceived behavioural control as a determinant of whether parents consider PAG and STG advertisements believable. A secondary objective was to examine differences in parents’ evaluations of the PAG and STG advertisements. Data were collected online using Survey Monkey Audience; 500 Canadian parents with at least one child aged 5-11 (75.6% moms; 24.4% dads) were included in the sample. A structural equation model testing the SIABM relationships demonstrated good model fit for both advertisements in the whole sample, and moms, and dads separately (CFIs ≥.96; RMSEAs ≤.06). Contrary to hypothesis MB did not predict intentions, and perceived behavioural control did not predict MB (ps>.05). Parents had more positive evaluations of the PAG advertisement versus the STG advertisement; nonetheless, parents had stronger intentions to support screen time reduction versus physical activity participation (ps&lt;.05). When considering moms and dads separately, moms had stronger attitudes towards physical activity participation and screen time reduction, and believed both advertisements more than dads. Moms had greater intentions to support screen time reductions versus physical activity participation. More research is needed to examine the relationship between perceived behavioural control, MB, and intentions. Future advertisements should emphasize how parents can support screen time reduction beyond the scope of promoting supportive behaviours for physical activity participation.</description>

   <description>Less than 15% of North American adults currently met the physical activity guidelines. These guidelines recommend that adults accumulate at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in bouts of 10 minutes or more. Emerging evidence suggests that accumulating sporadic MVPA (i.e. physical activity performed in periods of less than 10 consecutive minutes) also has health benefits. Little is known about how much sporadic physical activity (SPA) adults get. Furthermore, it is not known if SPA needs to be of at least moderate intensity to convey health benefits. The purpose of this thesis was twofold: 1) to describe SPA levels and intensity patterns in adults, and 2) to investigate the relationship between various intensities of SPA and the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.&#xd;
Data for the thesis research came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative cross-sectional sample of adults from the United States. Physical activity was measured over 7 days using accelerometers, which are small electronic sensors worn on the hip. The metabolic syndrome was determined from direct body measurements and blood samples.&#xd;
Results of this thesis indicate that the typical American adult accumulates 103 minutes/day of SPA, which represented 27% of their total daily physical activity. Of these 103 minutes/day, only 2 minutes/day were of moderate-to-vigorous intensity. However, adults accumulated 16 minutes/day of MVPA that was embedded within bouts of primarily light intensity activity – this activity did not meet the MVPA bout criteria but it was not truly sporadic since it occurred within bouts of primarily light intensity activity. Accumulation of this&#xd;
iii&#xd;
embedded MVPA was as strongly related to the MetS as bouted MVPA. Conversely, sporadic light intensity physical activity was weakly associated with the metabolic syndrome. Together, these results suggest MVPA is commonly accumulated outside of the current recommended bout length and that this type of activity is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome.</description>

   <title>Methodological Factors Impacting Sexual Concordance in Women</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2014-08-28 14:58:28.238</description>
   <description>A growing body of research investigating sexual concordance (the degree to which genital and subjective arousal are related) suggests that on average, women exhibit a weak, positive correlation between their genital and subjective arousal, whereas men exhibit a strong positive correlation between these responses. Although some researchers view this gender difference as a true phenomenon, others argue that women’s lower degree of concordance is the result of methodological factors, produced by the device that is most commonly used to measure genital response in women. Other factors, such as stimulus duration and content, may also have systematic effects on genital blood flow, potentially impacting the relationship between genital and subjective arousal in women. In the current study, sexual concordance was examined using concurrent measures of vulvar blood flow (using the laser Doppler imager; LDI) and vaginal vasocongestion (using the vaginal photoplethysmograph; VPP) to investigate potential differences in vulvar and vaginal concordance. Twenty-five women viewed two erotic films that differed in sexual activity content (foreplay and intercourse) while their genital and subjective arousal was measured. In support of previous meta-analytic findings, results from the current study suggest that the choice of genital arousal measurement device significantly impacts estimates of sexual concordance in women. That is, subjective arousal is significantly less correlated with vaginal vasocongestion assessed by the VPP than with vulvar blood flow assessed by LDI. Other methodological factors, such as stimulus content, order of presentation, and duration appear to have negligible impact on estimates of vulvar or vaginal concordance. Findings from the current study suggest that special consideration should be taken when selecting which genital arousal measurement device to employ for investigating sexual concordance in women.</description>

   <description>The experience of pain is a highly complex and personal experience, characterized by tremendous inter-individual variability. Pain perception can differ substantially across individuals due to many factors such as age, gender, genetics, cognition and emotionality etc. Some individuals are very sensitive to pain whereas others tolerate pain well. Athletes can play competitive sports even with significant injuries while other people feel tremendous pain while getting a flu shot. This phenomenon of inter-individual variability in pain responses has challenged scientists and clinicians alike. It is difficult to determine whether subjective reports of pain reflect true individual experiences of pain. However, the development of neuroimaging techniques has dramatically progressed our understanding of pain processing. This project investigated the neural correlates of inter-individual differences in pain responses in healthy individuals, by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the entire central nervous system. Twenty-healthy participants were asked to rate their pain following a noxious thermal stimulus, while undergoing functional MRI, and considerable inter-individual variability was observed. Results from this project demonstrated central mechanisms in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord that contribute to this variability. Participants that reported higher pain to the noxious stimulus showed greater fMRI responses in some brain, brainstem and spinal cord structures involved in processing the emotional, cognitive and motivational aspects of pain. This showed that the subjective reports of pain are a reliable indicator, and inter-individual differences in pain responses truly reflect variability in pain experience. It is expected that this knowledge will contribute to a better understanding of the neuronal processes, as well as substantial inter-individual variability observed in chronic neuropathic pain populations such as fibromyalgia, patients with spinal cord injuries etc.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2014-08-28 14:54:58.54</description>
   <description>Phishing is one of the most prevalent types of modern attacks, costing signiﬁcant ﬁnancial losses to enterprises and users each day. Despite the emergence of various anti-phishing tools and techniques, not only there has been a dramatic increase in the number of phishing attacks but also more sophisticated forms of these attacks have come into existence. One of the most complicated and deceptive forms of phishing attacks is the tabnabbing attack. This newly discovered threat takes advantage of the user’s trust and inattention to the open tabs in the browser and changes the appearance of an already open malicious page to the appearance of a trusted website that demands conﬁdential information from the user. As one might imagine, the tabnabbing attack mechanism makes it quite probable for even an attentive user to be lured into revealing his or her conﬁdential information. Few tabnabbing detection and prevention techniques have been proposed thus far. The majority of these techniques block scripts that are susceptible to perform malicious actions or violate the browser security policy. However, most of these techniques cannot eﬀectively prevent the other variant of the tabnabbing attack that is launched without the use of scripts.&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose a hybrid tabnabbing detection approach with the aim of overcoming the shortcomings of the existing anti-tabnabbing approaches and techniques. Our approach combines ﬁve heuristic-based metrics with data mining techniques to keep track of the major changes made to the structure of a webpage whenever a tab loses its focus. We develop our approach as a browser extension for Mozilla Firefox and evaluate its eﬀectiveness and performance using a dataset consisting of legitimate and tabnabbing websites. Our evaluation results convey a signiﬁcant improvement over the existing techniques, indicating that our approach can be utilized as a viable means for protecting users from tabnabbing attacks.</description>

   <description>Neocortical architecture is established by both intrinsic, genetic factors and experience- dependent factors. Postnatal sensory experience plays a significant role in the maturation and refinement of cortical sensory fields, such as the primary auditory cortex (A1). In this thesis, I investigated the effects of manipulating postnatal acoustic experience on the functional and morphological properties of neurons in the thalamocortical auditory pathway of adult rats. In Experiment 1, I used two converging electrophysiological techniques to determine the effects of patterned acoustic deprivation (through exposure to continuous, moderate-level white noise; cWN) on the functional properties of neurons in the central auditory system. In Experiment 2, I used Golgi-Cox staining to visualize morphological correlates of experience-dependent changes in neuron functioning. &#xd;
Long- and short-term plasticity mediate synaptic strengthening in sensory cortices in response to postnatal sensory experience. I assessed levels of long-term plasticity (using long- term potentiation; LTP) and short-term plasticity (using paired-pulse facilitation/depression; PPF/PPD) in vivo (under deep urethane anesthesia) in the A1 of normally reared rats and rats reared in the absence of patterned acoustic input through cWN exposure. Rats reared under cWN showed significantly greater LTP of field postsynaptic potentials (fPSPs) for thalamocortical, but not intracortical synapses in A1 compared to age-matched controls, indicative of immature, more plastic synaptic connectivity. Both groups showed similar, moderate levels of PPD (across interstimulus intervals ranging from 25 to 1000 ms) prior to LTP induction. Across groups, PPD was significantly enhanced after LTP induction, indicative of a presynaptic component of thalamocortical LTP in A1. &#xd;
I also assessed the morphology of layer II/III pyramidal neurons in A1 using Golgi-Cox staining and two-dimensional neuron reconstruction. Morphological features, including dendritic length, arbor complexity, and spine density, did not differ significantly between rats reared under cWN and age-matched controls. Rats reared under cWN showed a significantly greater proportion of filopodia to mature spines on apical dendrites compared to age-matched controls. &#xd;
Together, these data indicate that patterned acoustic experience results in a reduction of plasticity in A1, indicative of more mature, hard-wired synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, LTP in A1 in vivo is mediated in part by presynaptic mechanisms, such as increases in transmitter release probability at thalamocortical synapses.</description>

   <description>The issue of lower academic achievement for English language learners (ELLs) compared to their English-speaking peers has been identified in the research literature. Professional learning for classroom teachers, English as a second language (ESL) teachers, and ESL paraprofessionals has been promoted as one strategy to address this achievement gap. In some rural school boards, ELLs represent a small proportion of the overall student population. Academic achievement, however, is as much an equity issue for ELLs in rural as in urban school boards. The purpose of this study was to describe how the implementation of ELL-related professional learning policy was perceived in a rural school board in the province of Ontario, Canada from 2007 to 2013. Honig’s (2006) conceptualization of education policy implementation guided the study. The unit of analysis for this descriptive case study was a rural school board in which ELLs were approximately 2% of the student population. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 20 participants: board-level ESL consultants, ESL teachers, classroom teachers, ESL paraprofessionals, and a secondary school principal. ELL-related learning materials published by the school board were also collected. Five themes emerged from data analysis: first, the board’s two ESL consultants were the key providers of ELL-related professional learning; second, the ESL consultants were learners as well as leaders of professional learning; third, schools varied in their capacity to initiate professional learning; fourth, ELL-related professional learning initiatives were parallel to rather than integral to the board’s primary professional learning delivery model of collaborative inquiry; and fifth, challenges in providing ELL-related professional learning related to the uneven distribution of the board’s small ELL population across a wide geographical area. The study’s significance was in contributing to empirical work at the intersection of rural education, second language learning, and professional learning; and in describing how a rural context interacted with both normative and technical aspects of education policy implementation. Implications for future research included further research into the following: first, relationship building as a policy implementation instrument; second, links between ELL-related professional learning and increased achievement for ELLs; and third, the provision of ELL-related professional learning for paraprofessionals.</description>

   <title>Inferring Systemic Functional Language Models</title>

   <description>Language production in the brain is a complicated process that is not yet fully understood. The bag-of-words model, which considers the frequencies of each word in a document, is a useful approach in many text mining fields, but it does not provide any information about how language is produced. Systemic networks model language as a set of choices, where each choice operates in a particular context. Capturing patterns of choices used to create a particular document provides useful information about the authors and what they were feeling and thinking when they created the document. &#xd;
&#xd;
However, producing systemic networks manually is expensive. We define an automated way of producing systemic networks. Given a set of documents, we cluster words of interest into smaller groups, by using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF). We create hierarchical clusters that we interpret as systemic networks. We validate the produced systemic networks in a number of ways; we use them in an authorship prediction problem and compare their results to that of the bag-of-words model, as well as how well they cluster the different choices made by the authors. We also generate random systemic networks and compare their performance with the produced systemic networks.</description>

   <description>Semantically ambiguous words are ubiquitous in daily communication. Neurotypical individuals are able to resolve ambiguity with ease and efficiency, whereas individuals with schizophrenia tend to exhibit ambiguity-processing deficits. The exact nature of these deficits is unclear.  For the disambiguation of homonyms (words with more than one meaning), impairment in schizophrenia may arise from abnormalities in the use of context – informational cues that support a particular interpretation over others – and meaning dominance – the relative frequency of meaning alternatives. The present investigation had two main parts. In one part, clinical participants (those with schizophrenia or a related disorder, i.e. schizoaffective disorder, a mood disorder with psychotic features) and control participants were asked to provide definitions for homonyms presented in sentential context, requiring them to select a single meaning. Contextual information (which always supported the less frequent, subordinate meaning of the homonym) was heard either before (PRE) or after (POST) the homonym. This manipulation of context position was expected to reflect working-memory abilities since longer on-line maintenance of the homonym and its possible interpretations would be more challenging for POST sentences. In fact working memory was found to correlate with both sentence conditions. As well, clinical participants had comparable success to control participants. In the second part, participants heard a sentence containing a homonym (PRE and POST sentences), and 20 minutes later, were asked to provide a word associate for that homonym. Participants were more likely to select the primed (subordinate) meaning of the homonym when they had heard the homonym in context 20 minutes earlier. Significantly more clinical participants than control participants did not show an effect of priming, suggesting a difficulty for these individuals to use relatively recent experience to facilitate comprehension. This ability to benefit from recent exposure would be expected to improve real-world speech comprehension wherein the correct interpretation of a homonym is not likely to change over a short period of time. Therefore, despite intact comprehension of ambiguous words in context, a majority of clinical participants could not shift their interpretation of homonyms to fit with recent exposure, a potential cause for real-world comprehension deficits.</description>

   <description>Computer assisted mosaic arthroplasty shows promise compared to traditional treatments of cartilage degeneration in the knee. It can be more accurate and less invasive, leading to improved outcomes. Computer assisted mosaic arthroplasty requires a computerized 3D model of the patient's distal femur, normally generated from an Arthro-CT scan or MRI, but this process is associated with high cost, error, extended wait times, and radiation exposure. Our objective was to develop an alternative method to generate a 3D model intraoperatively within 1 mm error using points collected by a tracked pointing device. After generating the 3D model, we can optionally colour it according to a confidence metric. We validated our method in a user study where several orthopaedic surgeons and residents generated models of a rapid prototyped distal femur under different conditions. Our results suggest that it is possible to generate patient-specific 3D models with submillimeter accuracy using our method, and that this can be done within the time constraints of surgical procedures. We believe that the low error and minimal intraoperative time requirement may allow 3D model generation within the operating room without the need for any preoperative preparation.</description>

   <description>Phosphate is a mineral component of the human diet that is essential for life. However, elevated blood phosphate levels are associated with cardiovascular disease and death in the general population. The mechanisms through which phosphate may be detrimental to cardiovascular health remain unclear, however there is emerging evidence that suggests phosphate may impair the function of human arteries. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a single phosphate supplement affects the ability of the brachial artery to dilate in response to: a) increases in blood flow (flow-mediated dilation, FMD), b) a drug that causes dilation (GTN), or c) both FMD and GTN. 17 healthy male participants (22.9 ±3.07 years old) were exposed to phosphate (PHOS) and placebo (PLAC) conditions over two experimental days (one each visit) in a within-subjects, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects drank a liquid containing 1200 mg of phosphorus or a placebo. FMD tests were performed pre- and 20 min, 60 min and 120 min post-supplement or placebo ingestion by a standard procedure involving the occlusion of blood flow to the forearm (reactive hyperemia). Blood phosphate concentrations were significantly greater in PHOS vs. PLAC, but did not increase differently between the two groups. Blood phosphate concentrations were significantly greater 60 min vs. 20 min post-supplement in both conditions. Phosphate excretion increased 315% in the PHOS vs. PLAC condition, indicating that the kidney rapidly removed phosphate from the blood. There was no difference in FMD between PHOS and PLAC conditions at any post-supplement time point. There was no effect of PHOS on the GTN tests. These findings indicate that a single phosphate supplement did not impair brachial artery dilation in response to increases in blood flow or the administration of a drug that induces dilation. Also, the phosphate supplement did not substantially increase phosphate concentrations in the blood likely due to a large excretion of phosphate by the kidneys. Further research is needed to better understand how phosphate may be linked to vascular function.</description>

   <description>Through a diachronic study of a large selection of writings (composed within a period of a half century), marked, for the most part, by the seal of a constitutive undetermined genre, this thesis attempts to grasp the rapport to the worldly that takes shape in a particularly complex and divided literary work. Within the framework of socio-criticism, this study strives to uncover the sociality in Kateb’s work, that is, to identify the significant elements as well as the function of heterogeneity. In addition, it attempts to identify how the socio-historic dimension converts exterior space to interior space via a bidirectional movement. This study is directly interested in the literariness of Kateb’s work, but is heavily founded in a much larger epistemological perspective that underlines and brings the rapport to History, to memory and to social imaginary into play. This in turns allows us to underscore the aesthetic aspect of Katebian theatre, specifically the historical and thematic change of tragic theatre to heterogeneous theatre, a change incited by either the choice of theatricalized textual materials or by mise-en-scène ¬techniques. Both methods give rise to formal dissidence which liberates, on stage, the spoken word as an instrument of criticism with regard to socio-political action. Based on studies particularly rich in hermeneutics and discourse analysis, (Duchet, Popovic, Angenot, Robin, Biron, Amossy, Maingueneau), as well as on theoretical approaches initiated by de Certeau, Chambers and Riffaterre, this thesis, without overtly delimiting theoretical and disciplinary thought, also outlines where and how Kateb’s work coincides with fundamental concepts developed by Agamben, such as « camp », « pouvoir souverain » and « dispositif », or others defined by Foucault, such as « bio-pouvoir » and « analytique du pouvoir ». Whilst explaining and interpreting this polymorphous work, the aesthetic dimension allows us to employ and add various new key concepts in the realm of literary criticism. Finally, the link to History is analysed through the protean notion of « Revolution », which Kateb exploits in order to adopt an open perspective with regard to the future and to attribute meaning to causes striving to transform reality.</description>

   <description>Teaching creationism, also called creation science, intelligent design (ID), and evidence against evolution—a religious doctrine, holding that life and the universe were created by a supernatural actor out of nothing—contravenes the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and is illegal in U.S. public science classes. Nevertheless many U.S. high school science teachers continue to teach creationist doctrine as part of an undocumented, or hidden, curriculum. &#xd;
The arguments advanced in this study propose that creationism—as opposed to evolution—cannot be defined as science, and seeks to answer the following questions: &#xd;
(1)	What arguments have been put forward by advocates of creationism, to make the case for creationist ideology in U.S. public school science classes? &#xd;
(2)	What impact have the arguments of proponents of intelligent design creationism had, on American public education policy and the law? &#xd;
Data has been collected from precedent-setting U.S. Supreme Court rulings and associated texts, e.g., expert witness testimony under oath, cross-examination, and published works referred to in the proceedings. &#xd;
Testimony was analysed for its content—content analytic—to address specific creationist arguments with regard to scientific rigour, honesty and empirical reasoning. Judicial opinion proved to be more relevant in terms of commentary—context analytic. Judges as decision makers have given clear accounts of how creationist arguments have swayed their ruling, and thus U.S. law and government education policy, thereby directly addressing this study’s second research question. &#xd;
In addressing these questions, this research has provided a summative analysis of the arguments presented for ID to be taught in the science classrooms of U.S. public schools, and the counter arguments which have convinced U.S. Supreme Court Judges to deny consistent attempts to include its doctrine in science curricula. In doing so, this study provides a detailed baseline to which future arguments can be compared to highlight new—or simply recycled—points in the debate, and to identify any potential strategies for alleviating this on-going and costly dispute.</description>

   <description>Self-discrepancies have traditionally been measured with the Selves Questionnaire. This is an objective measure, in that it does not assume that individuals are aware of the discrepancies between their various self-state representations. The purpose of this research project was to examine a new method of measuring self-discrepancy: simply asking individuals for their subjective views of their self-discrepancies. These studies aimed to show that objective and subjective measures tap into distinct constructs which function differently depending on the level of deliberation of the testing conditions. The attitudes literature, from which this distinction was borrowed, provided groundwork to predict that subjective self-discrepancy would function better under conditions of deliberation whereas objective self-discrepancy would function better under conditions of spontaneity. In Study 1, both measures of self-discrepancy were used to predict agitation. This study showed that the objective and subjective measures were indeed only modestly correlated with one another. As expected, subjective ought self-discrepancy was a significant predictor of agitation under deliberative but not spontaneous conditions. Contrary to predictions, subjective ideal but not objective ought self-discrepancy significantly predicted agitation under spontaneous conditions. Study 2 predicted dejection from both measures of self-discrepancy, and showed again that they are distinct measures. Subjective ideal self-discrepancy predicted dejection under deliberative but not spontaneous conditions, as expected. However, objective ideal self-discrepancy failed to predict dejection under spontaneous conditions. Self-esteem was the outcome variable of interest in Study 3, where it was measured with the deliberative Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) as well as the spontaneous Implicit Association Test (IAT). Once again, in this study objective and subjective measures of self-discrepancy were shown to be distinct from one another. A structural equation model showed that subjective ideal self-discrepancy was the only significant predictor of RSE scores, as expected; nothing significantly predicted IAT scores. Explanations for these findings, as well as implications and directions for future research, are discussed.</description>

   <description>Smooth muscle alpha actin is one of six mammalian isoforms and the predominant isoform in vascular smooth muscle. In mice and humans lacking functional SMAA, pathophysiological changes have been identified in the aorta, bladder, colon, and olfactory ensheathing cell population in the olfactory nervous system. These include impaired vascular contractility, thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, hypocontractile bladders, gastrointestinal hypoperistalsis, and pathological OEC development. Our investigation set out to compare the whole tissue proteomes of the olfactory epithelium, thoracic aorta, urinary bladder, and descending colon from age-matched adult SMAA null mice and their wild type siblings.  This approach allowed us to better understand the mechanism of pathologies, the role of SMAA in these tissues, and to determine whether tissues compensate for a loss of this isoactin. Our objective was to systematically characterize changes in proteins that are of structural and/or contractile significance and in proteins that may be indirectly affected by lack of functional SMAA.  We hypothesized that the expression of various cytoskeletal and contractile proteins will be altered in smooth muscle cell-rich tissues of mice lacking functional SMAA, thereby signifying adaptive and maladaptive changes. Through 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we found increased abundance of four proteins in the olfactory mucosa of SMAA null mice: alpha tubulin, precursors of vomeronasal secretory proteins I and II, and lipocalin 13 precursor. In the thoracic aorta of SMAA null mice, levels of skeletal muscle myosin essential and regulatory light chain, along with gamma actin, were increased, whereas levels of alpha cardiac muscle actin were decreased. In the urinary bladder, a loss of SMAA expression was accompanied by a decrease in skeletal muscle myosin essential and regulatory light chain levels. Lastly, in the descending colon we found reductions in annexin A5, chymotrypsinogen B precursor, ela 3 protein, and lithostathine 1 precursor. Together, these protein changes reveal remarkable adaptability of mammalian smooth muscle contractile protein expression and new relationships between SMAA and proteins that previously have not been associated with SMAA or smooth muscle contraction. This proteomic investigation has identified proteins that offer new directions for future investigations regarding SMAA function and SMAA-related pathologies.</description>

   <description>Long-term memory has been widely studied, but it is unclear whether it can influence processing efficiency. In the past, researchers have focused on the effect of familiarity through repeated exposure to examine effects on subsequent processing. Behavioural, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated processing savings at an early stage for simple and complex visual stimuli. However, other researchers have argued that familiarity has a negligible or even a negative effect on processing mechanisms, making it unclear whether benefits can be attained at all.&#xd;
In the present study, we used complex real-world scenes to investigate the effects of familiarity on early processing of visual information and to investigate the mechanisms that could be responsible for any effects. In a pilot study, we established that there was an effect of familiarity on early scene processing. Thus, the present study examined the effect of different memory representations on early scene processing (Experiment 1), and investigated a potential underlying attentional mechanism of the processing benefits (Experiment 2).&#xd;
In Experiment 1, we explored whether familiarity effects on processing were due to a priming of a scene’s low-level perceptual details from a single image (Familiar Viewpoint) or due to a scene’s high-level conceptual representation from multiple viewpoints (Familiar Place). A lack of power within the study did not allow us to draw conclusions from the data; however, the findings suggest that there may be a benefit for familiar information. In Experiment 2, we explored whether processing savings from familiarity were due to fewer attentional resources required for familiar scenes. The availability of resources was manipulated using a dual-task paradigm. We found no performance detriment to scene processing under low and high cognitive load conditions. Our findings likely reflect a change in strategy and prioritization of scene processing over the secondary task, indicating that more sensitive methods of measuring attentional resources are required. In summary, long-term memory from perceptually-driven and conceptually-based representations can affect early scene processing mechanisms, without any effect on the underlying attentional resources needed for familiar information.</description>

   <description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen, being able to live in a diverse environmental niche. It possesses several resistance mechanisms, including a highly impermeable outer membrane and multiple RND-family efflux pumps, against a variety of antimicrobials, including aminoglycosides. P. aeruginosa causes a variety of infections in individuals, especially those with compromised immune system. Chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is an example of such. The most common antibiotic used today to treat the P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection in CF patients belongs to one of the major antibiotic families, aminoglycosides. Due to constant exposure of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides, this bacterium has gradually developed high level of resistance to aminoglycosides through the acquisition and selection of numerous chromosomal mutations. Previous P. aeruginosa transposon mutant library screen identified genes contributing to aminoglycoside resistance, including an atypical regulatory system, PA2797-PA2798. The array study on P. aeruginosa K767 ΔPA2798 determined possible pathways by which PA2797-PA2798 was connected to aminoglycoside resistance. A series of in-frame gene deletion (anr), gene cloning (rpoS, anr, rpsP operon), double deletion (rpoS and anr in K767 ΔPA2798), q-RT PCR (pslA, lexA, recN, rpsP operon), and a growth assay (K767, K767 ΔPA2797, K767 ΔPA2798) was performed to examine a possible connection between PA2797-PA2798, and RpoS, Anr, oxidative stress response, temperature stress response, and ribosomal proteins. Although the aforementioned experiments were performed successfully, none of them could identify a potential pathway through which PA2797-PA2798 was connected to aminoglycoside resistance.</description>

   <description>Software can be made more secure by stipulating and integrating security specifications in the development process. However, guaranteeing the correct implementation of these specifications is a daunting task. In spite of security testing, vulnerabilities can still be present in the deployed software. Especially, the development practice is in favor of reusing off-the-shelf components in component-based software development. Therefore, a component with security vulnerabilities can affect the security of the entire software system. Hence, the behavior of the deployed software should be monitored and checked against its security specifications to identify vulnerabilities introduced due to incorrect implementations.&#xd;
In this thesis, we first present a secure software development process that links the development phases to the monitoring phase. As part of this process, we identify the activities necessary to develop a software component with an embedded specification-based security monitor. The security specifications are stipulated using UML state machines to bring the software and security engineering domains closer. These state machines are then used to develop the embedded specification-based security monitor, thereby enabling self-monitoring. Moreover, we describe how UML state machines can be employed to represent attack scenarios for a specification-based intrusion detection system. We elaborate upon the design and operation of the embedded monitor within the software component. Finally, we suggest using a hybrid of event and time monitoring techniques to observe different constraints imposed by security specifications.&#xd;
We evaluate our proposed methodology by developing an authentication component and enhancing selected components Filezilla and the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS). The authentication and CVS components are evaluated for the impact on design complexity and performance of the target software systems due to the embedded monitor. The viability of the proposed hybrid monitoring technique is assessed by comparing its effectiveness and performance with event and time monitoring techniques. The hybrid monitoring technique is more effective and efficient when compared with event or time monitoring techniques separately.</description>

   <description>The direct analysis of solid samples by electrothermal vapourization (ETV) coupled to inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectrometry (OES) is typically reserved to niche applications.  This thesis is focused on a new niche application: geochemical exploration.  First, solid sampling (SS) ETV-ICP-OES was used to determine the distribution of elements in soil samples in the Flin Flon-Snow Lake terrain, Manitoba, Canada in order to locate the undercover ore deposit. Samples were first vaporized by ETV and the vapor was then introduced into the ICP. &#xd;
         Under optimal conditions and with a four-step ETV temperature program, the surface distribution of some pathfinder elements in soils showed obvious anomalies delineating the undercover ore. External calibration with 0–4 mg of soil reference material, together with internal standardization with an argon emission line, yielded results for Zn and P in good agreement with those obtained, following aqua regia (AR) digestion, by ICP mass spectrometry (MS). &#xd;
          The vertical distribution of target elements in soil samples from the same area was also determined, which revealed anomalously high concentrations toward the surface of the profile in the area above the undercover ore. Again, good agreement was obtained with results by AR-ICP-MS for those elements that could be determined by ICP-MS. Hence, SS-ETV-ICP-OES completely eliminates the need for extraction or digestion of samples prior to analysis, which significantly simplifies the analysis of soils.&#xd;
          Finally, in order to increase the amount of solid analyzed, the outlet of SS-ETV-ICP-OES was connected to a switching valve (for venting of pyrolysis products), itself connected to the side arm of a sheathing device whose other inlet was connected to a nebulizer/spray chamber. The aerosol exiting the nebulizer and spray chamber was heated to 400 °C by applying infrared heating to the sheathing device and bottom of the torch while vaporized analytes produced by ETV were transferred to the ICP. This system allowed the amount of sample to be increased from 5 to 13 mg without extinguishing the plasma, resulting in a 2-10 fold improvement in sensitivity and detection limit versus conventional SS-ETV-ICP-OES, and as accurate but more precise analysis of soil .</description>

   <description>A combined experimental and numerical study is presented on the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow within spacer-filled channels representative of those used in spiral wound membrane (SWM) modules. Spacers are used in the membrane modules to maintain a uniform gap between the membrane layers, as well as to control the flow which may reduce the effect of fouling and concentration polarization phenomena.&#xd;
A 10× scaled-up model of a spacer-filled channel was constructed that enabled detailed non-intrusive particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the average velocity and fluctuation flow fields. The flow characteristics were investigated for Reynolds numbers (based on the hydraulic diameter and the interstitial velocity) ranging from 100 to 1000. Computational studies were also conducted using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and validated with the experimental results.&#xd;
It was found that the main flow splits into two main streams which move parallel to the spacer filaments with 90° direction difference to each other. The interaction of these two streams at the channel centre-plane where they exchange momentum creates secondary swirling motions in the main flow streams. Counterclockwise swirling flows (primary vortices) that rotate with the main flow streams and small clockwise swirling motions (secondary vortices) observed at the corners of the channel and spacer filaments regions for flow at Re ≥ 350 were identified. Four different flow regimes were observed. Laminar-steady (Re ≤ 200), laminar-unsteady-periodic (Re around 300), unsteady (Re ≥ 350) and onset of turbulent flow (Re = 1000). A better design of feed spacers is proposed for the purpose of improving the membrane module performance. This new spacer forces the flow streams toward the membrane walls with a zigzag motion of flow between the spacer unit cells as well as promotes flow instabilities at a lower Reynolds number compared to the CONWED spacer.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I use transgenic fruit flies that have sperm labeled with Green Fluorescent Protein to investigate sperm competition and cryptic female choice in three populations of Drosophila melanogaster adapted to markedly different life cycles by long term laboratory evolution. To do this, I analyze male ejaculate tailoring and female sperm storage in relation to female and male quality, respectively. I discuss the life history strategies of three populations: a FAST stock selected for early reproductive maturity, an intermediate BASELINE stock and a SLOW stock selected for late-life reproductive fitness. Using a full-factorial experimental design, I show evidence for ejaculate tailoring and selective sperm storage over 30 d after mating. In all three stocks, males ejaculate significantly more sperm cells into the bigger SLOW females. However, SLOW females store more SLOW sperm than BASELINE or FAST sperm. Likewise, FAST females store a higher proportion of SLOW and BASELINE sperm than FAST male sperm. Overall, FAST sperm disappear from the female reproductive tract more rapidly than other male-sperm types over 30 d of storage. My results also suggest that the spermathecal organs are responsible for long-term sperm storage. It is evident that female type plays a strong role in determining how much sperm will be ejaculated and ultimately stored, but it also appears that males are self-referrent in allocating ejaculate; body size is likely to play a major role in this plasticity.</description>

   <description>As radiation therapy treatment modalities continue to develop, patient dose delivery has become increasingly complex.  The verification of dose delivery and the quality assurance (QA) to ensure that a prescribed dose is accurately and precisely delivered to a patient is critical.  Radiochromic film dosimetry has been adopted in the clinic as a convenient option for QA because it provides verification in a two dimensional plane, is essentially energy independent, is near tissue equivalent, and has high spatial resolution. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to use.  Radiochromic films are typically read out using an advanced flatbed scanner, such as the commercially available Epson 10000XL scanner (commonly used in the clinic).  However, difficulties overcoming imaging artifacts on these scanners, related to such factors as directional dependence of the film orientation and non-uniform scanner sensitivity, have necessitated the development of strict protocols for film readout and sophisticated image correction techniques.  Based on experience with optical tomography using the Vista Optical CT Scanner, a simpler readout technique based on components of the Vista scanner was investigated.  In this work, a setup consisting of a camera and light box, interfaced with computer image acquisition software was developed and characterized for the purpose of imaging radiochromic film.  Two cameras (a colour and a greyscale camera) were tested and benchmarked using a commonly used Epson 10000XL scanner.  The optical properties of the system were optimized and various film calibration models were tested.  Single channel and triple channel dosimetry methods were implemented and applied to film imaging data.  Validation tests examined simple irradiations as well as more complex intensity modulated radiation therapy plans.  Studies using the prototype film imaging system showed that film imaging is orientation independent, and that good agreement is found using single channel dosimetry methods with the greyscale camera and red light illumination.  While further improvements to the light box are needed to effectively implement triple channel dosimetry methods and to make the system more practical for clinical use, this simple imaging technique shows good promise to simplify and improve on existing film dosimetry readout.</description>

   <title>A New Approach For Geocoding Postal Code-Based Data in Health Related Studies</title>
   <creator>Rosu, Andrei</creator>

   <subject>Postal Codes, Geocoding,</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-02 10:32:40.026</description>
   <description>Geocoding involves the conversion of textual addresses or names of places into digital coordinates. Health researchers often use geocoding for studying the spatial distribution of populations based on a certain health outcome.  To conduct any form of geocoding, health researchers generally require the use of address based data (e.g. street addresses) that are commonly obtained through survey questionnaires or hospital registries. Due to Canadian privacy and confidentiality laws, high precision addresses must be masked or aggregated to coarser geographies. In Canada, most health studies adopt the use of postal codes as they are widely available and accessible. Traditionally, postal codes are geocoded based on the Statistics Canada geocoding methodology that links postal codes to geographic representation points. However, this approach can lead to bias results in accessibility or spatial pattern analysis studies as postal codes (particularly those in rural areas) are at times displaced at far distances from actual residences. As a result, this research introduces a new postal code geocoding approach that can potentially improve upon the traditional approach by considering the land-use within postal code boundaries. Using two study areas (City of Kingston and the province of Ontario) the new and traditional approach were compared to determine which of the two better represents populations (based on residential location) at the postal code geography.  Results showed that the new approach significantly improved how populations are represented in rural areas, with minimal improvements for urban areas. The impact of the new approach was also examined using population accessibility to medical clinics in the City of Kingston. The level of impact was based on the amount of population that was misallocated (by the two approaches) to non-nearest medical clinics. No significant difference was found in results between the two approaches with the new approach misallocating approximately the same amount of population (at both urban and rural areas) as the traditional approach. A larger study area that incorporates a higher number of rural postal codes is suggested (where the new approach has a higher geocoding positional accuracy) for future research.</description>

   <description>Matlab Simulink is one of the leading tools for model based software development in the automotive industry. One extension to Simulink is Stateflow, which allows the user to embed Statecharts as components in a Simulink Model. These state machines contain nested states, an action language that describes events, guards, conditions and actions and complex transitions. As Stateflow has become increasingly important in Simulink models for the automotive sector, we extend previous work on clone detection of Simulink models to Stateflow components.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we present an approach for identifying Stateflow clones in Matlab Stateflow  models. In order to leverage robust near-miss code clone technology, our approach is text-based. First, we transform the Stateflow textual representation into a hierarchical textual structure. We implement a SIMONE plugin that normalizes the initial input to remove irrelevant elements and rename irrelevant naming differences to make the process of clone identification more accurate. Finally,  we identify potential clone candidates and cluster them into classes.&#xd;
&#xd;
We conducted experiments with our approach on the Matlab Simulink/Stateflow Demo set.  Our approach showed promising results on the identification of Stateflow clones as an isolated component as well as an integrated component of the Simulink models that are hosting them. All of our results are manually validated.</description>

   <title>Experimental and Numerical Study of  Multi- Phase Flow in a Coaxial Air Jet</title>

   <description>The ultimate goal of this work was to optimize a polymer flame deposition process by developing an experimentally verified numerical model of it.  This process consisted of injecting a polymer powder into an air/propane flame where the powder was heated enough to soften it before it was projected on to a substrate to provide a protective coating. &#xd;
&#xd;
 Intermediate goals towards the final goal were identified.  This thesis was based on four papers with each paper reporting the results of the work on an intermediate goal.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The first paper reported on work with the turbulent coaxial air jet created by shutting off the flow of propane and polymer particles to the torch head.  Experimental measurements of the flow field were compared to the results of numerical simulations using different Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS) models.   The k-ε realizable model provided the best agreement with the axial velocity measurements, but all the RANS models predicted a recirculation zone immediately downstream of the central jet that did not exist.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The next paper described two phase flow created by the introduction of polymer particles into the air stream to the central air jet.  A sheet of laser light and high speed digital imaging were used to determine the particle velocities, which varied widely because the particle size and shapes varied widely.  The radial particle distribution was roughly Gaussian.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third paper described the use of the large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model in Fluent to try to improve the agreement between experiment and numerical results.  The LES results did not predict any recirculation zones, but agreement with experimental axial velocities was worse than with the RANS simulation results.  Overall, no numerical model’s results agreed with all experimental results within 10%, so their further development was abandoned.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The fourth paper described mixing when propane was replaced with air or CO2 and seeded with fine water/glycerine droplets.  These jets were rapidly but irregularly entrained in the coaxial air jet. Gas sampling showed this irregular entrainment was related to significant variations in the concentrations of CO2 off the jet centerline.  Introducing a particle stream had little effect on the CO2 concentrations.</description>

   <description>The lower Lajas Formation (Jurassic), western Argentina, has been interpreted to represent a progradational tide-dominated deltaic succession with tidal dominance throughout complete base-level cycles. Two sequences have been identified in this study containing different suites of facies associations. Sequence 1 is composed of a river-dominated suite, with prodelta to distal delta front, river-dominated mouth bars, and terminal distributary channels. Sequence 2 is composed of both river-dominated and tide-influenced mouth bars, channels and interdistributary bays. Both sequences contain distinct event bedding (mainly in the mouth bars and interdistributary bays) that is expressed as alternating layers of finer and coarser sediment, representing interflood and river-flood layers, respectively. Variations exist in the character of event beds between river-dominated settings and tide-influenced settings. In river-dominated settings, almost no tidal indicators are found in flood or interflood layers. This is in contrast to tide-influenced settings, which contain tidal indicators such as bi-directional ripples and tidal rhythmites in interflood layers. Tidal indicators such as tidal rhythmites are rare in the flood layers. Many organic-matter drapes that were previously interpreted as tidal in origin lack a regular cyclicity and are inferred to have been deposited through fluvial processes with no tidal influence. The event beds are interpreted to have been formed on an annual cycle, rather than by individual storms, due to commonalities with modern seasonal bedding and the large size of the drainage basin. The recognition of heterolithic event beds provides another criterion for recognizing river influence and differentiating these from heterolithic tidal sediments. Because of the overwhelming presence of a seasonal signature, the Lajas is re-interpreted to be overall river-dominated, with tide-influence found mainly in Sequence 2. The extensive exposure of the river-dominated mouth bars in Sequence 1 allowed for the architecture to be described in detail. A compensational architecture was recognized between individual bars and was delineated by slight changes in dip direction. Individual bars are comparable in size to the modern Wax Lake delta and the ancient Ferron Sandstone. Mouth bars amalgamate to form mouth-bar complexes, within which slight changes in relative sea-level can be deciphered.</description>

   <description>This thesis is focused on developing cost effective and environmentally friendly techniques to improve the properties and processability of biopolyesters through compounding and reactive modification. Specifically, elastomeric medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (MCL PHA) have been evaluated as potential impact modifiers for poly(lactic acid)  (PLA) and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), using conventional melt compounding. The Mark-Houwink constants, absolute molecular weight distributions and the absolute molecular weight (MW) averages of MCL PHAs with predominantly 3-hydroxyoctanoate (PHO), 3-hydroxynonanoate (PHN) or 3-hydroxydodecanoate (PHDD) content were determined and ranged between 18,200 for PHN to 172,000 Da for PHO. Detailed thermal and rheological characterization revealed that PHO had the highest viscosity, and was thus the best candidate as impact modifier for PHB and PLA. Melt compounded PHB/PHO and PLA/PHO blends showed improved tensile strain at break and unnotched impact strength upon addition of up to 30 wt.% PHO in PHB and 15 wt.% PHO in PLA. This was counteracted by decreased Young’s modulus due to lower blend crystallinity.  The droplet-matrix morphology coarsened as PHO content increased beyond 5 wt.%, due to PHO coalescence attributed to viscosity mismatch between blend components. PHO was reacted using lauroyl peroxide to increase its viscosity through partial cross-linking, thus improving the morphology but the mechanical properties showed only moderate improvements, presumably due to high PHO gel content which compromised its elastomeric nature. Reactive compounding by radical mediated solvent-free grafting of triallyl trimesate (TAM) coagent was employed to improve blend properties. Reactively modified PLA had higher molar mass, melt viscosity and enhanced strain hardening.  Additionally it showed a distinct crystallization peak upon cooling with disappearance of the cold crystallization peak, indicative of a nucleation effect. PLA modified using a multi-functional epoxide oligomeric chain extender yielded similar improvements in rheological properties, but no considerable change in crystallization. This coagent modification approach also increased the viscosity of PHO, and improved both extrudate appearance and handling. Coagent modified PLA/PHO blends demonstrated significant improvement in crystallization and rheological properties, similar to those seen in the coagent modified PLA alone, while the mechanical properties remained unaffected.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Cultural Studies) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-04 22:07:35.693</description>
   <description>Beginning with Adrienne Rich’s work Of Woman Born (1986), writing about maternal theory and the experience of motherhood abounds (Joyce Trebilcot 1984; Andrea O’Reilly 2007), and there is a growing canon of theory about mother blaming (Molly Ladd-Taylor and Laurie Umansky 1998; Paula J Caplan 2000; O’Reilly 2006.) Comics’ literature provides a different approach to maternal studies. A history of female comics’ heroes acknowledges their maternal values in the way they rule their worlds (Mike Madrid 2009.) 1960s film goddess Elasti-girl may grow fifty feet and, equal to any man, catch a missile in one hand; but Alison Bechdel’s headstrong cast of queers (2000) will explode the missile and Elasti-girl safely, to save the world from patriarchy’s super heroes. The contemporary heroes I am most interested in are lesbian mothers. Theory about lesbian motherhood exists, but explicit maternal experience in comics remains uncommon – except as incidental to several characters in Bechdel’s cast – and a comic dealing specifically with lesbian mothering of daughters and mother blaming, does not exist. Concurrent with maternal theory and comics’ creation, women’s life-writing is also a growing trend. Hélène Cixous (2007) talks at the intersection of life experience, the body and language, about writing from and about her life. She uses metaphor to make complex reflections accessible to readers, and metaphor operates similarly in comics and in trauma memory. Grounded in Cathy Caruth’s (1996) theories of trauma, narrative and history, and Giles Deleuze’s theories of affect (1997) my thesis explores artistic form, specifically comics, as vehicle for rendering metaphor, traumatic memory and affect visible. At the intersection of theory and life practice, it seeks to examine mother blaming as a phenomenon that changes with the times in its insidious need to see mothers as the single driver of influences impacting their children’s behavior and life function, and to make the personal political through the collision of worlds that disrupt the hegemony of mothers as institutions, with theories that attempt to explain them.</description>

   <description>Moldables is a thin, flexible shape-changing screen that retains shape when deformed and adapts the Graphical User Interface (GUI) layout to particular shapes. We extracted the 14 most popular shapes for a Moldable from a participatory study using an early prototype. In a second study, participants chose the appropriateness of four different user interface elements - thumbnails, focus item, menu, and toolbar - for shape regions in both landscape and portrait orientations. A factor analysis on participant preferences revealed two principal factors that influenced the popularity of each UI element in each shape: the size of the shape region and its location on the screen. The results of the factor analysis were used to develop an algorithm that updates the display automatically whenever the shape is changed. We compared the algorithm’s output with the mean participant preferences from our study to confirm our factor analysis. We found that, when deformed, the device updated the GUI with the preferred layout 79% of the time.</description>

   <description>This work concerns the development of two classes of triarylboron functionalized β-diketone ligands. In the first class, the boron unit is conjugated with a phenyl linker and the diketone backbone. In the second class, the boron unit, the aryl linker, and the diketone backbone are non-conjugated with a mutual orthogonal arrangement. To understand the impact of the location of the triarylboron unit on the electronic and photophysical properties of the β-diketone ligands, difluoroboron chelate complexes were synthesized and characterized. The complexes were studied computationally to determine the singlet and triplet transitions, along with their major contributing orbitals. They were then studied for their photophysical properties. The first class of ligands displayed a concentration dependent excimer emission. Finally, they were studied for their ability to sense fluoride and the binding constants of the fluoride-boron interaction were estimated.&#xd;
The four ligands were also investigated for their use in selective sensitization of Tb(III) and Eu(III). The four Ln(III) complexes were characterized and their photophysical properties were investigated. The first class of ligands were found to be effective in activating Eu(III) emission while the second class is effective in activating Tb(III) emission. The Eu(III) complexes were found to have a low quantum efficiency, but can it can be greatly enhanced by the addition of fluoride ions. In contrast, the Tb(III) complexes have moderate quantum efficiencies that are quenched upon the addition of fluoride. The selective sensitization of Eu(III) and Tb(III) and the luminescent response towards fluoride is caused by the distinct intra-ligand charge transfer transitions of the two classes of ligands and the triarylboron unit.</description>

   <description>The present research introduces the construct of Relationship Status Disclosure, an individual difference variable that assesses the extent to which people are willing to disclose and discuss their relationship status with other people.  In Studies 1A and 1B I developed and validated the Relationship Status Disclosure Index.  In Study Two I examined whether Relationship Status Disclosure could predict how often a sample of dating participants mentioned their romantic partners during an instant messaging “Getting to Know You” task (Linardatos &amp; Lydon, 2011).  In Study Three I examined the predictive validity of Relationship Status Disclosure for single and dating participants’ behaviour on Facebook.  Across these studies, I found that Relationship Status Disclosure is a construct that was reliably measured, and demonstrated convergent validity with general self-disclosure and divergent validity with relationship satisfaction and commitment.  Relationship Status Disclosure also predicted the frequency of partner mentions (Study Two) and differentially predicted the content of Facebook status updates, posts, and photos, for single and dating samples (Study Three).  Taken together, the present research suggests that Relationship Status Disclosure is a promising new construct for understanding how individuals navigate their relationship status within a broader social context and future directions for research are discussed.</description>

   <title>A Biopsychosocial Approach to Persistent Postpartum Pain and Postpartum Sexual Function</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-05 15:51:58.515</description>
   <description>Recently, there has been a push for a maternal-focused model of postpartum care; however, this model of care tends to focus on postpartum depression. Two issues that are related to postpartum depression but may go unaddressed by health-care professionals are persistent postpartum pain (PPP) and postpartum sexual function. Traditionally, these issues have been investigated using a biomedical approach. With a biomedical approach, PPP is attributed to tissue damage during childbirth, and sexual problems emerge due to an overemphasis placed on the (heteronormative) functionality of the genitals. However, the biomedical model provides insufficient explanations for PPP and postpartum sexual function. Therefore, the primary goal of the current studies was to apply a multidimensional framework to the study of PPP and postpartum sexual function using comprehensive conceptualizations of “pain” and “sexual function”. A secondary goal was to elucidate the relationships among postpartum depression, PPP, and sexual function by investigating the role of potential mediating variables.  &#xd;
Women within one year postpartum completed an online survey. In Study 1, pain characteristics of PPP (pain persisting for two months or more) were described. Women with PPP were compared to women whose pain resolved within two months postpartum on birth-related physical and psychosocial factors. The results of Study 1 indicated that PPP is pervasive in nature and more common after a Caesarean section. Somatization (functional impairment) was the only biopsychosocial factor to significantly predict PPP, and it mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and PPP. Study 2 examined the role of birth-related physical, psychological, and relationship variables on several facets of postpartum sexual function. In this study, fatigue and relationship satisfaction predicted sexual function as well as independently mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and postpartum sexual function. &#xd;
The results of the current studies indicate that PPP and postpartum sexual function are best addressed using a multidimensional approach, which goes well beyond the biomedical model that is so commonly used in the current literature. Furthermore, the results of these studies have significant implications for health-care providers with respect to what information should be integrated into pre- and postpartum health-care.</description>

   <description>This thesis concerns the present model of moral education in Ontario public schools: Finding Common Ground: Character Development in Ontario Schools, K-12. I argue that Finding Common Ground makes use of an impoverished form of virtue ethics in the construction of its model of moral education, and tacitly encourages assimilation and obedience rather than authentic moral becoming; it is a re-articulation of customary morality. To encourage authentic moral becoming, I propose a pragmatic, Deweyan model for moral education. This model is rooted in developing the capacities that encourage moral agency: imagination, reflection, and deliberation</description>

   <title>Structural Insights Into the High Microtubule Binding Affinity of KIF14: a Mitotic Kinesin Known to Play a Key Role in Cytokinesis</title>

   <description>Kinesins use ATP hydrolysis-derived energy to power transport of cellular materials along microtubules and to regulate microtubule organization in eukaryotes. This enables them to serve various cellular functions including organelle and vesicle trafficking, chromosome segregation, and cellular morphogenesis. Association with these roles depends on the structural and mechanochemical properties of the specific kinesin, which can vary widely as the kinesin superfamily is large and structurally diverse compared to other cytoskeletal motors. The mitotic kinesin, KIF14, is an intriguing example of this diversity. It is essential for cytokinesis, and has been implicated in cerebral development and a variety of human cancers. It has unusual biochemical properties in comparison to other kinesins, including extremely tight microtubule binding, insensitivity of this affinity to the identity of the nucleotide bound in its active site, and very slow motility. Upstream of the motor domain is an unusually long N-terminal region that bears no homology to any other protein, yet is important for KIF14 localization to the central spindle and midbody during late anaphase and cytokinesis, respectively. Recent observations of this domain binding and bundling actin have not been previously demonstrated for a kinesin. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, a better understanding of the basis for these properties, as well as novel activities, is provided here. The crystal structure of the ADP-bound form of the mouse KIF14 motor domain reveals a dramatically opened ATP-binding pocket, as if ready to exchange its bound ADP for Mg·ATP, as well as a much larger twist in the central β-sheet than in other kinesins. This configuration has only been seen in the nucleotide-free states of myosins – known as the ‘rigor’ state – and has never been captured for a kinesin in solution. Moreover, cryo-electron microscopy indicates a distinct binding configuration of the motor domain to microtubules, possibly explaining its high microtubule affinity. Intriguingly, the KIF14 N-terminal extension also binds microtubules, and together with the motor domain, is capable of bundling microtubules. We postulate that these properties of KIF14 relate directly to its unique biochemical activity, and are functionally important for forming and stabilizing midbody microtubules during cytokinesis.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this project was to explore factors influencing the recruitment and retention of part-time clinical instructors at a community college in Ontario. Interviews were conducted with two project managers and four previously employed part-time clinical instructors. The focus of the analysis was to examine what attracted the clinical instructors to teaching, their journey of teaching, recruitment, and their reasons for leaving. Major themes for leaving centred on workload; student, clinical agency, and personal/professional demands; and remuneration with respect to time spent. Essential factors highlighted for retention included support and guidance to contribute to the success of the clinical instructors’ teaching experience. In the final analysis, five recommendations were proposed:&#xd;
1.	Provide ongoing collegial support and guidance through mentoring.&#xd;
2.	Decrease the instructors’ workload by reducing the number of written assignments and streamlining evaluation methods. &#xd;
3.	Expand the orientation time for new instructors. &#xd;
4.	Provide appropriate remuneration for and recognition of teaching contributions. &#xd;
5.	Support instructors in addressing their clinical agency concerns.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-11 18:10:46.163</description>
   <description>I believe that disguise reveals that medieval identities were fluid and unfixed, but also subject to patriarchal and authoritarian attempts to stabilize them. In these romance traditions, disguise exposes at once the fluidity of identity and the anxiety surrounding this fluidity. &#xd;
	I argue that Le Roman de Horne, King Horn, L’ai de Haveloc and Havelok the Dane are conservative reactions to the radical potential of disguise. This impression is much less obvious in the Middle English King Horn, however. With that romance’s famously sparse narration, Horn needs to define his identity through his disguise, leading to a plot structure where his final noble identity is built on (rather than created in contrast with) the lower-class identities that he adopts throughout the romance.&#xd;
The second chapter focuses on the episode from the Tristan romances where Tristan disguises himself as a leper in order to create a conceivable story for Isolde to tell when she is brought to trial for adultery. Tristan and Isolde manipulate Mark and deceive him in order to keep their affair a secret, but in doing so, they also bolster his rule by keeping scandal out of the court. It is only in the Old Norse versions of the tale that the Isolde character is able to carve out an identity free from the dominant order.&#xd;
	My final chapter consists of the Middle English, Old French and Old Norse versions of the romance Bevis of Hampton. Josiane is described as white, yet she colours her face black to search for her husband in Saracen lands—at least, in the French version. The relationship between Josiane and Bevis parallels the imperialist crusading ethos: Josiane is “Other” enough to justify conquering her, and that Otherness is performed with her blackface disguise. At the same time, she is safe and “normal” enough to marry (as demonstrated by her whiteness) and to incorporate into the Christian world. The Middle English and Old Norse versions de-emphasize this racial aspect due to their diminished investment in the Crusades.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-09 10:05:42.491</description>
   <description>Cuprate superconductors exhibit very high critical temperatures, $T_c$, compared to those in the conventional superconductors. The doping at which $T_c$ is maximized is called optimal doping. Below this level, in the underdoped region, cuprate superconductors exhibit not only high $T_c$ superconductivity, but also the celebrated pseudogap phase, a theory of which is still not established. In the pseudogap region cuprates exhibit incommensurate charge orders and  electronic nematicity, which are the focus of this thesis. Borrowed from the liquid crystal terminology, nematicity refers to the breaking of rotational symmetry in the electron degree of freedom where charge densities are re-arranged within the unit cell. The aim of this thesis is to establish the microscopic origin of charge orders in cuprates, and provide an explanation for some of the anomalous properties in the pseudogap region.&#xd;
&#xd;
Established by experiments, electronic nematicity originates from the inequivalency of the two oxygen orbitals in the cuprate unit-cell. Using this hint, the instability towards nematic charge orders was studied in the three-band  model of cuprate superconductors, which explicitly takes into account the oxygen orbitals. Using the generalized random phase approximation, the nematic charge susceptibility was calculated, and it was found that the three-band model has nematic instabilities driven by the Coulomb repulsion between densities at oxygen orbitals. In the experimentally relevant doping range, the leading charge instability occurs as electronic nematicity with a modulation in space whose periodicity incommensurate with the underlying lattice. Such density modulations cause Fermi surface reconstructions, giving so-called Fermi arcs and small Fermi surface pockets. These findings, as well as the doping dependence of the modulation wavevector, are consistent with experiments.  There is some disagreement with experiments as well: the modulation wavevector points along the diagonal of the Brillouin zone as opposed to the zone axes, and its magnitude is about half of that measured experimentally. &#xd;
Further improvement to the model is necessary to better match the experimental findings. A thorough understanding of electronic nematicity and its interplay with other phases is necessary to establish the theory of the pseudogap phase as well as  that of the cuprate high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

   <description>Background:&#xd;
Canadian youth are increasingly likely to grow up in non-traditional families, such as single parent families, stepfamilies, and/or in the shared physical custody of their separated parents. Given that growing up in a non-traditional family is associated with many negative health outcomes, it is of interest to examine how family structure influences upstream health-related behaviours such as physical activity and sedentary behaviour.&#xd;
Objectives:&#xd;
The objectives of this thesis were to examine family structure as a predictor of organized sports participation and screen time (television-viewing, recreational computer use and video game use). A secondary objective was to assess socioeconomic status as a mediator in the relationship between family structure and organized sports participation.&#xd;
Methods:&#xd;
Data were obtained from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of Canadian youth in grades 6-10 (N=26 068). Participants’ family structures were classified as traditional, single parent, or reconstituted based on self-report of the number of parents and parents’ partners living in their primary home. Non-traditional families were further classified based on how often the youth reported visiting a second home. Average daily screen time and current organized sports participation were also assessed via self-report. Logistic regression and bootstrap-based mediation analysis were used to examine the associations of interest.&#xd;
Results:&#xd;
Youth from all single parent and reconstituted families had lower odds of sports participation (OR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.38-0.61) to 0.78 (95% CI: 0.56-1.08)) compared to their traditional family counterparts, regardless of physical custody arrangements. The relationship was moderately-to-weakly mediated by socioeconomic status (ie: &lt;20% change in effect estimate). Youth from single parent and reconstituted families did not have higher odds of spending more than 2 hours per day using a television, computer or video game device, or of being in the highest quartile of time spent in these behaviours.&#xd;
Conclusions:&#xd;
Youth living in single parent and reconstituted families experience significant disparities in organized sports participation that are partially mediated by their family’s socioeconomic status. Family structure is not, however, a significant predictor of excessive screen time.</description>

   <description>This study contributes to the scholarship on early modern medicine and the professions by examining English surgical practitioners, 1590-1715.  It explores the growth of surgery through the intersection of print culture and institutional history and delineates the manner in which surgical practitioners worked with, and within, their changing socio-cultural context to gain social and occupational credit.  Bringing together published treatises and manuscript sources such as practitioner casebooks, institutional records of the Company of Barbers and Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians, it argues that surgical practitioners sought actively to create new social and occupational identities based on that of physicians.  &#xd;
The project reveals that surgical practitioners underwent a theoretical and experiential education that reflected an understanding of “surgery” beyond incision, extirpation, and suturing.  Practitioners took to print to present themselves as learned; they took advantage of the new emphasis on empirical ways of knowing and stressed that their knowledge acquisition – unlike that of physicians – was both theoretical and practical.  Print however, was also used to reify a largely negative view of surgeons and surgery.  Popular health treatises presented surgery as painful, invasive, and to be avoided at all costs while, in fiction, surgeons were ill-educated and merely aping the physician’s vocabulary and gentlemanly conduct.  The latter observation echoes mockingly surgeons’ self-creation in both print and institution.  &#xd;
As the seventeenth century progressed, the Company of Barbers and Surgeons acted increasingly to shape the occupational identity of surgeons as separate from barbers and more closely related to physicians.  The institution battled to be recognized as an organized body whose members were competent medical practitioners.  Individual practitioners sought to showcase their adherence to the new science as a method of knowledge creation and testing, seizing upon the Royal Society to further their aims.  Through both this institutional mechanism and informal patronage relationships, surgeons could ingratiate themselves with those who could provide both positions and patients.  Combined, these findings hold implications for the history of surgery and the occupation’s advancement – especially in terms of “horizontal honour” – during a period that lacked significant innovation in terms of technique or even improved quality of care.</description>

   <title>An Investigation into Training, Evaluation, and Application of the Physical Demands Description to Document Paramedic Work</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2014-09-09 17:56:25.067</description>
   <description>Every job requires a worker to complete a subset of physical demands.  These physical demands are classified into different elements (e.g., lifting, pushing, pulling), each with requisite measurement characteristics (e.g., frequency, duration, weight).  Understanding the physical demands is important when making job-related decisions such as developing job descriptions, adjudicating injury claims, and effectively facilitating return-to-work scenarios.  As these decisions are made by professionals both internal to a workplace (e.g., managers, human resources, engineers) and external (e.g., physicians, insurance providers); physical demands information must be objective, easily understandable, and accurate.  A Physical Demands Description (PDD) is the document that summarizes all physical demands of a job, as characterized following periods of job observation interspersed with physical demands measurements.&#xd;
     There were two main purposes of this research, 1) to study the effectiveness of PDD training on trainee’s ability to accurately identify and measure physical demand elements, and 2) to characterize the physical demands of paramedic work, by training paramedics to identify physical demand elements.  First, PDD training was delivered to ten university students who then applied their training to perform condensed PDDs using three different job simulation examples.  Participants accurately identified physical demand elements with a success rate of 80%, but failed to accurately measure aspects of those elements within a 10% margin of error relative to the criterion established by a team of subject matter experts.  Implementing these findings, a participatory approach was taken to document the physical demands of paramedics by training paramedics to identify (not measure) the physical demands of their colleagues.  Fourteen paramedics from seven services across Canada received PDD training to identify the physical demands of their work.  They documented demands during two separate full-shift ride-outs, acting as an observer.  The most physically demanding aspects of paramedic work, as identified by paramedics, were stretcher loading and unloading (25.6% of respondents), carrying equipment (19.5%), and pushing and pulling the stretcher (13.4%).  When considering differences in task frequency between service population areas, high-populated services loaded and unloaded an empty stretcher and handled medication bags more frequently than low-populated services.  These data contribute to the Canadian paramedic community by characterizing the work of paramedics, useful in developing a physical abilities pre-hire test to ensure candidates match the physical demands of the occupation.</description>

   <description>The overall goal of this study is to advance the availability of prosthetic devices for developing and post conflict regions by establishing a framework for their design based on those used for Class II medical devices.  The Niagara Foot Model 2  was used as an example case.  This device has been refined within an international consortium of engineers, prosthetists, materials scientists and non-governmental organizations over the past decade.  It is a unique Controlled Passive Energy Management (CPEM) foot that can be modified to suit the needs of a particular user.  Its success has prompted interest in the development of other devices for this market.  &#xd;
    Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) were used to assess the current design.  A systematic literature review was used to generate 29 User-centred Functional Requirements, which were compared to 47 engineering variables extracted from the design archives.  In addition, 33 potential failure modes and their mechanisms were assessed based on a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis.&#xd;
    Features controlling energy management in the CPEM System had the greatest impact on User-centred Functional Requirements.  The potential for top plate fracture at the connection to the pylon had the highest risk rating.  These observations prompted the analysis and design of the bearing system for controlled passive energy management in the current design.  The analysis showed a bearing contact area, sliding speed and contact force that produced a PV value 25% above the recommended limit for Hytrel® 8238 which the horn portion of the CPEM System is comprised of.  A modification to the contact geometry was proposed that would reduce the PV value by 63%, and would move the contact point forward 1.6mm.  Based on a simplified static analysis, this would further reduce the peak moment in the top plate by 2%, therefore the risk to top plate failure would not be increased.</description>

   <description>Low tissue oxygen levels, known as hypoxia, characterize many solid cancers. Both clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that intratumoral hypoxia is associated with malignant progression defined by increased tumour growth, metastasis and resistance to therapy. A major mechanism mediating malignant adaptive responses to hypoxia involves the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits; HIF-1α is highly regulated by oxygen, such that its protein levels determine HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Accumulating evidence indicates that hypoxia-induced acquisition of malignant phenotypes is, in part, due to impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling and that restoration of cGMP signalling prevents such hypoxic responses. The present study aimed to determine the downstream mechanism by which the NO/cGMP signalling regulates hypoxic responses. Using DU145 prostate cancer cells, studies were conducted to assess the effect of the NO mimetic glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and the cGMP analogue 8-Bromo-cGMP on hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1α. Results revealed that GTN, at a concentration known to primarily activate the NO/cGMP pathway, inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation in a time-dependent manner; 8-Bromo-cGMP mimicked the effect of GTN on HIF-1α protein while levels of HIF-1α mRNA remained unaltered by exposure to either GTN or 8-Bromo-cGMP. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the calpain (Ca2+-activated proteinase) inhibitor calpastatin attenuated the effects of GTN and 8-Bromo-cGMP on HIF-1α protein accumulation. Collectively, these findings indicate a role for NO/cGMP signalling in the regulation of HIF-1α, and hence HIF-1-mediated hypoxic responses, via a mechanism that is likely dependent on calpain activity.</description>

   <description>Men’s genital responses tend to be gender-specific, such that they show significantly greater arousal to their preferred gender compared to their nonpreferred gender, whereas the genital responses of androphilic women (i.e., sexually attracted to men) tend to be similar to stimuli depicting women or men (gender-nonspecific). Gender-specificity of arousal has been previously studied using short stimuli (approximately 90-second videos or audio-narratives) with genital responses assessed using vaginal photoplethysmography (VPP) in women and penile plethysmography (PPG) in men. One limitation to using these measures of genital response is that they use different scales (mV change in VPP and mm change in PPG), making it difficult to draw direct gender comparisons. In the current thesis, I examined gender-specificity of sexual arousal in women and men by measuring genital responses using thermography, which assesses similar physiological processes (i.e., temperature change associated with genital vasocongestion) in women and men. Specifically, I evaluated whether the gender-specificity of men’s and women’s genital temperature was similar to that observed for genital responses concurrently assessed using VPP (women) or PPG (men). I presented gynephilic men (i.e., sexually attracted to women; n = 27) and androphilic women (n = 28) with 10-minute audiovisual stimuli depicting men masturbating, women masturbating, and a nonsexual nature film. Participants reported feelings of sexual arousal before, during, and after each film, and genital responses were concurrently assessed using thermography and VPP or PPG. For all dependent variables, men exhibited gender-specific sexual arousal and women exhibited gender-nonspecific sexual arousal. These findings demonstrate that the gender difference in gender-specificity of sexual arousal persists beyond early sexual responding, including longer stimuli and relatively slow changes in genital temperature. Limitations and implications are discussed.</description>

   <description>This research is an exploration of physically-devised performance processes. The paper is in dialogue with a major performance (Loss2Lust), which has been recorded on DVD, and will remain stored at Queen’s University in the Department of Cultural Studies (it has also been submitted to Qspace). &#xd;
The performance of Loss2Lust reflects a process that is ongoing and self-reflexive, and as such this paper is also a process of ongoing self-reflection about performance within academic contexts.</description>

   <description>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are nearly ideal one-dimensional systems, with aspect ratios exceeding 10$^{5}$:1.&#xd;
The band gap of a SWCNT, determined by the species, covers the majority of the visible spectrum all the way out into the near infrared.&#xd;
However, despite their amazing potential, the vast majority of SWCNT applications are still on the horizon.&#xd;
This is partly because the opto-electronic behaviour of a SWCNT is so sensitive to its physical structure (determined by sample preparation method) and its ambient environment. &#xd;
Structural defects and environmental perturbations introduce extrinsic effects (\textit{e.g.} disorder limited diffusion) which vastly inhibit the realization the intrinsic behaviour.&#xd;
A decade of progress in sample preparation techniques has vastly improved SWCNT properties (\textit{e.g.} increased quantum yield, longer diffusion lengths).&#xd;
The pinnacle of sample purification and isolation culminates in an isolated individual air-suspended SWCNT.&#xd;
These air-suspended SWCNTs are free from substrate effects, encapsulation, and defects caused by post processing.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, I study the intrinsic exciton dynamics of high quality air-suspended SWCNTs.&#xd;
A diffusion-annihilation model is developed for homogeneously excited SWCNTs which reveals an exciton diffusion constant on the order of 300 cm$^{2}$/s.&#xd;
To strengthen the case for intrinsic diffusion, a temporally and spatially resolved PL experiment is developed which is sensitive to quenching defect sites.&#xd;
Results from several SWCNTs confirm a diffusion constant of $\sim$ 300 cm$^{2}$/s.&#xd;
&#xd;
In order to test the validity of the diffusion-reaction model, direct absorption measurements are performed to ensure that photoluminescence (PL) nonlinearity is not caused by nonlinear optical absorption.&#xd;
The observed strong nonlinearity in PL is not accompanied by a nonlinear absorption signal, indicating that absorption saturation does not play a significant role the observed phenomena.&#xd;
In addition, time-resolved SWCNT PL and absorption studies indicate that the presence of an exciton population does not significantly affect the optical absorption.&#xd;
The observed optical absorption cross-sections for the air-suspended SWCNTs are on the order of 3 $\times$ 10$^{-17}$ cm$^{2}$/atom.&#xd;
This is about 5 times higher than graphene and among the highest observed for SWCNTs.</description>

   <description>Delayed-onset crosslinking of commodity polymers is accomplished by peroxide-initiated reactions of 4-acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (AOTEMPO) under solvent-free conditions.  Consistent with previous studies of polyethylene cure formulations, AOTEMPO provides predictable induction periods for ethylene-rich copolymers, such as poly(ethylene-co-propylene) (EPR) and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA), without compromising ultimate crosslink densities.   However, cure yields for AOTEMPO formulations of 1,2-polybutadiene (vinyl-BR) and 1,4-butadiene (cis-BR) fell well below those of nitroxyl-free formulations, due to lost backbone C=C group oligomerization during the induction period.  Quenching a radical in these butadiene-rich materials eliminates multiple crosslinks, creating a deficit that acrylate oligomerization cannot overcome.  As a result, AOTEMPO can only delay the onset of polybutadiene cures at the expense of crosslink yield.&#xd;
&#xd;
A new extension of AOTEMPO chemistry offers a means of crosslinking polymers that cleave when treated with peroxides alone.  The severe degradation incurred by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and polypropylene (PP) when heated with dicumyl  peroxide (DCP) is arrested  by nitroxyl trapping during the induction phase of the cure.  Upon complete conversion of nitroxyl, oligomerization of pendant acrylate groups dominates scission of the polymer backbone, yielding the desired thermoset.  Residual peroxide initiator beyond that required to convert macromonomer groups serves only to degrade the polymer network, necessitating the optimization of peroxide and AOTEMPO concentrations.  Experiments conducted on PEO, PP, polyisobutylene (PIB), and poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) (IIR) are discussed in terms of known principles of H-atom abstraction efficiency, acrylate oligomerization, and macroradical scission.&#xd;
&#xd;
The importance of H-atom transfer to AOTEMPO formulation efficacy has motivated the study of a technique for measuring the yield of macroradicals produced by peroxide thermolysis in a polymer melt.  DCP decomposition in polymer compounds containing 4-(1-naphthoyloxy)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (NTEMPO) generates polymer-bound alkoxyamines whose concentrations can be measured by fluorescence spectroscopy.  Measurements of alkoxyamine yields are comparable to gas chromatography measurements of cumyl alcohol, which is an initiator byproduct of H-atom abstraction from the polymer.</description>

   <title>Gravitas in the Desert: An Analysis of Selected Letters of Isidore of Pelusium and his Influence on the Secular and Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Fifth Century CE.</title>
   <creator>Boivin, Laurent</creator>
   <subject>Classics</subject>
   <subject>History</subject>
   <description>With the 2,000 letters that have come down to us under his name, Isidore of Pelusium has long been considered an important Church father not only for the quality of his doctrinal exegesis, but also for the meticulous craftsmanship of his writing.  Isidore is also known for the myriad of subjects on which he could write, including teaching, rhetoric, philosophy, and even science.  However, one aspect of Isidore’s output that needs further study is his correspondence with powerful secular and ecclesiastical officials of the first half of the fifth century CE.  This paper begins with an examination of Isidore’s upbringing and education and a review of the manuscript tradition of his letters.  An analysis of selections of his correspondence with crucial officials of the empire then follows, as well references to John Chrysostom in relation to Cyril of Alexandria and aspects of Isidore’s theological thinking.  The paper will conclude with the suggestion that, besides being a Church father of note, Isidore was also a very well-connected holy man during the time of the First Council of Ephesus of 431 CE.</description>

   <description>Various approaches of quantifying nondeterminism in nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) are considered.&#xd;
We consider nondeterministic finite automata having finite tree width (ftw-NFA) where the computation on any input string has a constant number of branches. We give effective characterizations of ftw-NFAs and a tight bound for determinizing an ftw-NFA A as a function of the tree width and the number of states of A. We introduce a lower bound technique for ftw-NFAs.&#xd;
We study the interrelationships between various measures of nondeterminism for finite automata. We define the trace measure which is a new approach of quantifying nondeterminism. &#xd;
The trace is defined in terms of the maximum product of the degrees of nondeterministic choices in any computation. We establish upper and lower bounds for the trace of an NFA in terms of its tree width.&#xd;
It is known that an NFA with n states and branching k can be simulated  by a deterministic finite automaton with multiple initial states (MDFA) having kn states. &#xd;
We give a lower bound (k/(1+\logk))n for the size blow-up of this conversion. &#xd;
We also consider bounds for the number of states an MDFA needs to simulate a given NFA of finite tree width.&#xd;
We consider unary NFA employing limited nondeterminism. We show that for unary regular languages, minimal ftw-NFAs can always be found in Chrobak normal form. A similar property holds with respect to other measures of nondeterminism.&#xd;
The latter observation is used to establish, for a given unary regular language, relationships between the sizes of minimal NFAs where the nondeterminism is limited in various ways.&#xd;
We study also the state complexity of language operations for unary NFAs with limited nondeterminism. We consider the operations of concatenation, Kleene star, and complement.               &#xd;
We give upper bounds for the state complexity of these language operations and lower bounds that are fairly close to the upper bounds.&#xd;
Finally, we show that the branching measure (J. Goldstine, C. Kintala, D. Wotschke, Inf. and Comput vol 86, 1990, 179-194) of a unary NFA is always either bounded by a constant or has an exponential growth rate.</description>

   <description>Most, if not all, universities across Canada emphasize diversity, inclusivity, and equity in their missions, value statements, and institutional priorities. However, institutions of higher learning across Canada have yet to sufficiently challenge institutional discourse and culture in ways that truly move it and its members beyond passively articulating value for diversity to actively demonstrating commitments to inclusivity and equity. Universities struggle to achieve a range of educational equity goals across four domains: (a) improving access for historically underrepresented students, (b) fostering inclusive campus climates, (c) developing globally inclusive curricula, and (d) recruiting and retaining equity-seeking  faculty and staff. Persistent challenges in implementing educational equity policy in Canadian academe suggest an imperative to critically examine whether and how the social, political, and economic forces of neoliberalism, as the prevailing ideology in Canada, complicate the educational equity policy process. In particular, I am interested in exploring whether and how the discourses of neoliberalism manifest in discursive practices of senior administrators and the implications for enacting change to achieve educational equity. The purpose of my research is fivefold: (1) to investigate the social, political, and cultural ideologies and discourses that dominate in the academy and influence the educational equity policymaking process; (2) to learn about the perspectives and practices of individual senior administrators in relation to educational equity; (3) to identify the thematic barriers and enablers to advancing educational equity, as perceived by senior administrators; (4) to identify discursive practices among senior administrators, in relation to educational equity; and (5) to consider the ways that senior administrators believe their social identities and positionalities influence their success advancing educational equity.</description>
