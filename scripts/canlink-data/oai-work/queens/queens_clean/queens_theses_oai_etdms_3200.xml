   <description>Background: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death in Tanzanian women, with annual age-standardized mortality of 38 per 100,000. While organized screening programs have minimized cervical cancer rates in the developed world, a national prevention program has not yet been instituted in Tanzania. Though screening is available at clinics in the Kilimanjaro region, uptake of these services is reported to be low. The objectives of this thesis were: 1) to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices of cervical cancer screening in rural and urban Kilimanjaro women, 2) to determine the main barriers preventing women from being screened, and 3) to identify important determinants of screening status and screening acceptability in the population. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 312 rural and 280 urban women in the region over June-July 2012. The sample was obtained through a multistage random sampling strategy. Descriptive statistics were performed to address Objectives 1 and 2, while multivariate logistic regression models were created using generalized estimating equations to address Objective 3. Results: Awareness of cervical cancer in the sample was high, but women had less knowledge of screening tests for the disease. The proportion of ever-screened women was significantly lower in the rural (4%) than in the urban (8%) sample. The most common barrier in never-screened women was not knowing that screening existed, followed by anticipated cost of the procedure. Travel distance was a more frequent concern in rural women. Older age, being married, cervical cancer knowledge and healthcare access factors were significantly associated with screening status in urban women, while only older age and condom use were associated in rural women. Personal beliefs about risk were associated with screening acceptability in never-screened women. Willingness to be screened was low in urban women with high socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Participation in cervical screening is extremely low in the Kilimanjaro region due to both access-related and personal barriers. While Tanzania awaits a national screening program, the identified determinants may inform regional screening and education initiatives aimed at increasing screening coverage in the Kilimanjaro area.</description>

   <description>Naming speed (NS) tasks that measure how quickly and accurately participants can name visual stimuli (e.g., letters) are commonly used to predict reading ability. However, the link between NS and reading is poorly understood. Three methods were used to investigate how NS relates to reading and what cognitive processes are involved: (a) changing stimulus composition to emphasize phonological and/or visual aspects (Compton, 2003); (b) decomposing NS times into pause and articulation components; and (c) analyzing eye movements during a NS task. Participants were in three groups: dyslexics (aged 9, 10), chronological-age (CA) controls (age 9, 10), and reading-level (RL) controls (aged 6, 7). We used a letter NS task and three variants that were either phonologically and/or visually confusing while subjects’ eye movements and articulations were recorded, and examined how these manipulations influenced NS performance and eye movements. &#xd;
For all groups, NS manipulations were associated with specific patterns of behaviour and saccadic performance, reflecting differential contributions of NS to reading. RL controls were less efficient, made more errors, saccades and regressions, and made longer fixation durations, articulation times, and pause times than CA controls. Dyslexics consistently scored in between controls, except for the number of saccades and regressions in which they made more than both control groups. Overall there were clear developmental changes in NS performance, NS components, and eye movements in controls from ages 6 to 10 that appear to occur more slowly for dyslexics.&#xd;
Furthermore, pause time and fixation duration were key features in the NS-reading relationship, and increasing visual similarity of the letter matrix had the greatest effect on performance for all subjects. This latter result was demonstrated by the decrease in efficiency and eye-voice span, increase in naming errors, saccades, and regressions, and longer pause times and fixation durations found for all subjects. We conclude that NS is related to reading via fixation durations and pause times; longer fixation durations reflect the greater amount of time needed to acquire visual/orthographic information from stimuli, and longer pause times in children with dyslexia reflect the greater amount of time needed to prepare to respond to stimuli.</description>

   <description>Breast cancer is a disease that afflicts a significant proportion of women globally. 5-10% of breast cancer cases are linked to inherited polymorphisms in critical genes such as BRCA1, a tumour suppressor essential for genomic stability. A dysfunctional BRCA1 gene can increase breast cancer risk by 60-80%. Previous microarray analysis established that differential gene expression in unperturbed Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocyte cell lines (EBV-LCL) was able to distinguish BRCA1 mutation carriers from controls with a high degree of accuracy. A 43-gene radiation-independent classifier for BRCA1 status was constructed.&#xd;
We hypothesize that this differential gene expression can be observed in a subset of these genes using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in both EBV-LCL and B-lymphocytes isolated from patients with known BRCA1 mutation carrier status. &#xd;
The 43-gene classifier was analyzed using gene ontology analysis and 4 target genes selected based on predictive value, expression intensity and gene ontology similarity. Genes selected were CXCR3, TBX21, MX2, and IFIT1, with GusB as an endogenous reference gene. EBV-LCL established from known BRCA1 mutation carriers and from BRCA1 wildtype individuals were obtained and RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptase qPCR) performed on isolated RNA. Our results showed significant downregulation of CXCR3 and TBX21 in BRCA1 mutation carriers (p=0.018 and p=0.003, respectively), as expected from previous microarray results. IFIT1, while showing a non-significant upregulation (p=0.183), agreed with the expected trend. MX2 did not show significant differential expression. These results indicate that differential gene expression has the potential to accurately distinguish pathogenic variants, even if it may require EBV immortalization of B-lymphocytes.&#xd;
To determine whether the assay could be extended to fresh blood samples, B-lymphocytes were isolated from patients with known BRCA1 mutation carrier status from North York General Hospital in Toronto, ON. An optimized protocol to enrich the B-lymphocyte population using magnetic separation was developed for this purpose. RT-qPCR using RNA isolated from these lymphocytes showed no significant differential gene expression in CXCR3 and TBX21. However, a low sample size, use of non-sequenced controls and a need for further qPCR optimization may call these results into question. In addition, problems with blood sample transportation from off-site sources resulted in an unacceptable drop in RNA integrity. &#xd;
While this gene expression assay may be limited to screening a small number of blood samples, results indicate that may still have clinical relevance that can be explored. This would necessitate further optimization of the qPCR methodology and resolution of the issues surrounding RNA integrity and sample transport.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-26 13:21:06.097</description>
   <description>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee affects between 5.4% and 38% of older adults and this prevalence is increasing as the population ages and becomes more obese.  As health costs rise, it is important to have accurate and cost-effective methods to assess knee OA and the risk for OA.  &#xd;
One risk factor for progression of knee OA is lower extremity (LE) frontal-plane malalignment.  The first goal of this thesis was to assess the suitability of knee radiographs and LE photographs for the estimation of frontal-plane LE alignment.  In the first study, several versions of the femoral shaft-tibial shaft (FS-TS) angle, assessed from knee radiographs, were compared to the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, assessed from full-length radiographs.  We concluded that the FS-TS angle is not a recommended substitute for the HKA angle, because the association between the two measures differs depending on alignment, OA severity and the method of determining the FS-TS angle. &#xd;
In the second study, the hip-knee-ankle angle determined from a pelvis-to-ankle photograph (HKA-P) was assessed for its ability to estimate the HKA angle.  The HKA-P angle was reliable and highly correlated to the HKA.  It therefore shows promise as an accurate and cost-effective assessment tool for the estimation of LE alignment.&#xd;
Commonly-used grading scales for the severity of knee OA seen on a radiograph emphasize just one feature of OA; therefore the second goal of this thesis was to assess the psychometric properties of the unicompartmental osteoarthritis grade (UCOAG), a composite scale which grades several features of OA in the tibiofemoral (TF) compartment. &#xd;
In the third and fourth studies, the reliability, validity and sensitivity to change of the UCOAG scale was assessed and compared to two commonly-used scales (Kellgren-Lawrence and Osteoarthritis Research Society International joint space narrowing).  The UCOAG scale showed moderate to excellent reliability.  All three scales demonstrated comparable validity and sensitivity to change.  The UCOAG is therefore recommended for the assessment of OA severity and change over time. &#xd;
This research provides evidence for the use of accurate and cost-effective measures to assess LE alignment using photographs, and TF OA severity using radiographs, for clinical assessment and research purposes.</description>

   <description>Over the past several years, the physical appearance of pregnant and new mothers has been evolving within Western society.  In particular, celebrity mothers who are templates for contemporary ideals within society (Tyler 2011) experience heightened levels of surveillance and normalizing practices.  The shifting ideal, maternal form illustrates how the bodies of women continue to be subjected to discipline and control within society.  Furthermore, the flourishing of consumer culture within some neoliberal societies pressures women to consume in order to fully realize their maternal identity. Increased articulation of individual identity through consumption, coupled with increasingly specific appearance standards, narrow the scope of what idealized motherhood embodies. In order to best investigate the issue of the shifting, ideal maternal form, various issues of tabloid magazines will be analyzed.  Relying on social constructionism in conjunction with Foucault’s theories of the disciplining of docile bodies and biopower, along with Lyotard’s desire-based, libidinal economy, the literature on the public presentation of maternal bodies will be analyzed with focus on newly developed, rigorous appearance and fitness standards for mothers.  Additionally, how these disciplinary practices function within neoliberal climates that champion desire-based consumption, freedom, liberty, individualism and self-subjectification will also be investigated.  A cultural analysis of thirty-seven tabloid publications from 2012 to 2013 will be examined for both visual and written discourse pertaining to the cultural construction of ideal motherhood.  Through this analysis the interplay between the two seemingly contradictory messages of excessive, desire-based consumption and restrictive, corporeal discipline will be explored in order to gain a better understanding of how these incongruous scripts affect the lives of mothers today.</description>

   <description>The host-guest chemistry between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and cationic organic guests of medicinal and biological interest are described in this thesis. In the first part, three cationic steroidal neuromuscular blockers (SNMBs) were studied, along with guests that model their monocationic N-alkyl-N-methylheterocyclic (morpholinium, pyrrolidinium and piperidinium) terminal groups of the SNMBs, and dicationic guests in which the two N-methylheterocyclic rings are linked by a decamethylene chain, modelling a variety of NMBs.  Other cationic drugs related to acetylcholine processes in neuromuscular blockage were also studied. In the second part, the amino acids lysine, and its mono-, di- and trimethylated and acetylated Nε derivatives, and arginine, and mono- and (symmetric and asymmetric) dimethylarginine, were investigated as guests, along with analogs of arginine. The nature and strength of the complexation between CB[7] and these guests in aqueous solution were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry.&#xd;
The CB[7] showed high binding affinity (KCB[7] = 106-109 M-1) towards the N-alkyl-N-methylheterocyclic cations with a trend of piperidinium > pyrrolidinium > morpholinium, which reflects the relative hydrophobicities of the guests. The CB[7] forms 1:1 and 2:1 host-guest complexes with dicationic model guests, with the CB[7] initially encapsulating the decamethylene chain. The second CB[7] binds to a terminal site, resulting in electrostatic repulsions with the first CB[7], which are resolved by the translocation of the first CB[7] to the opposite terminal site.  This 2:1 binding mode is also observed with CB[7] and the SNMBs, and the trend in KCB[7]  with these SNMB terminal sites is comparable to that observed for the monocationic model guests. The other cationic drugs also form stable host-guest complexes with CB[7], and the binding constants displayed dependences on the size, charge, and hydrophobicity of the guests.&#xd;
The CB[7] exhibits significant selectivity towards different lysine and arginine derivatives, which can be related to the relative hydrophobicity afforded by the methyl substituents and the positioning of the guest within the CB[7] cavity. The 3500-fold selectivity for Nε,Nε,Nε-trimethyllysine over lysine by CB[7] is the highest observed for a synthetic macrocyclic receptor, while a modest selectivity of symmetrical over asymmetrical dimethylarginine by CB[7] is observed.</description>

   <description>Rail and bridge infrastructure assets are critical elements of Canada’s transportation network and their continued efficient and safe operation is necessary to ensure the nation’s economic livelihood. Monitoring technologies that can detect changes in performance as well as precursors to failure are an important element of ensuring this efficient and safe operation. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a monitoring technology that has the potential to provide critical data for infrastructure assessment and to replace various conventional sensors with one integrated monitoring solution.&#xd;
In this research, the accuracy of DIC is evaluated using numerical, laboratory and field-based experiments. The sources of error of particular relevance to dynamic measurement using DIC are identified as (i) bias error in the sub-pixel interpolation scheme, (ii) the ratio of sample rate to the frequency of the signal being monitoring and (iii) the signal to noise ratio. It is also shown that the chosen sub-pixel interpolation scheme can greatly affect the accuracy of dynamic measurements.&#xd;
The use of DIC was investigated for field monitoring of both horizontal and vertical railway displacements at sites with good and poor subgrade conditions under dynamic train loading. It is shown that there is a significant benefit to using an absolute displacement measurement system rather than a relative displacement measurement system as the former can capture irrecoverable rail displacements in both the vertical and horizontal directions.&#xd;
Finally, DIC was also used for field monitoring of a very stiff reinforced concrete bridge during static and dynamic load tests. It is shown that when using DIC for deflection monitoring, corrections may have to be made to compensate for errors such as camera jitter and drift to acquire the most accurate results. Two potential correction methods were the use of a fixed reference point and generating composite images using average pixel intensity values from multiple images. It was found that using a fixed reference point was the optimal choice in this bridge test. It is concluded that DIC can be used as an effective displacement measurement tool for bridge assessment because it shows excellent correlation with linear potentiometer results and it can allow measurements to be taken without having to close the bridge.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines visual and material culture in relation to free trade in North America, focusing on cultural production between 1985 and 2012. These dates broadly encompass a period in which the Canadian state entered into progressively larger free trade agreements with neighbouring states, including the United States in 1989 and Mexico in 1994. This period resulted in significant changes to the dominant understandings of North America. I trace the substantial role that art endeavors played in establishing and naturalizing economic integration in the continent. Through discussion of diverse examples of art production, I posit that consideration of the selected artworks and exhibitions is integral to properly assessing histories of free trade in North America. Each chapter deals with a different case study of forms of art production, chosen because they helped promote new understandings of North America after the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. These case studies deal with how exhibitions of modern and contemporary landscape art and exhibitions of indigenous visual and material culture contribute to constructing narratives of North America. They also cover the contemporary art festival inSite, as well as the history of Mexican modern art in Canada. I demonstrate that visual and material culture played an integral role in deploying new understandings of the continent, while concurrently serving as a means to circulate counter-narratives of North America. To foreground Canadian artistic responses to free trade, I insert interstices between every chapter, each focused on a specific work of contemporary video art from the period. These six interstices demonstrate a sustained engagement by Canadian contemporary artists to respond to and comment on North American integration, and thus provide a map to the key issues of neoliberal expansion.</description>

   <description>The surface electrocardiogram (ECG) is a periodic signal portraying the electrical activity of the heart from the torso. The past fifty years have witnessed a proliferation of computer algorithms destined for ECG analysis. Signal averaging is a noise reduction technique believed to enable the surface ECG to act as a non-invasive surrogate for cardiac electrophysiology.&#xd;
&#xd;
The P wave and the QRS complex of the ECG respectively depict atrial and ventricular depolarization. QRS detection is a pre-requisite to P wave and QRS averaging. A novel algorithm for robust QRS detection in mice achieves a four-fold reduction in false detections compared to leading commercial software, while its human version boasts an error rate of just 0.29% on a public database containing ECGs with varying morphologies and degrees of noise.&#xd;
&#xd;
A fully automated P wave and QRS averaging and onset/offset detection algorithm is also proposed. This approach is shown to predict atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia which could cause stroke or heart failure, from normal asymptomatic ECGs, with 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Automated signal averaging also proves to be slightly more reproducible in consecutive recordings than manual signal averaging performed by expert users.&#xd;
&#xd;
Several studies postulated that high-frequency energy content in the signal-averaged QRS may be a marker of sudden cardiac death. Traditional frequency spectrum analysis techniques have failed to consistently validate this hypothesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
Layered Symbolic Decomposition (LSD), a novel algorithmic time-scale analysis approach requiring no basis function assumptions, is presented. LSD proves more reproducible than state-of-the-art algorithms, and capable of predicting sudden cardiac death in the general population from the surface ECG with 97% sensitivity and 96% specificity.&#xd;
&#xd;
A link between atrial refractory period and high-frequency energy content of the signal-averaged P wave is also considered, but neither LSD nor other algorithms find a meaningful correlation.&#xd;
&#xd;
LSD is not ECG-specific and may be effective in countless other signals with no known single basis function, such as other bio-potentials, geophysical signals, and socio-economic trends.</description>

   <description>Laser welding has great potential as a fast, non-contact joining method for thermoplastic parts. In the laser transmission welding of thermoplastics, light passes through a semi-transparent part to reach the weld interface. There, it is absorbed as heat, which causes melting and subsequent welding. The distribution and quantity of light reaching the interface are important for predicting the quality of a weld, but are experimentally difficult to estimate. A model for simulating the path of this laser light through these light-scattering plastic parts has been developed. The technique uses a Monte-Carlo approach to generate photon paths through the material, accounting for absorption, scattering and reflection between boundaries in the transparent polymer. It was assumed that any light escaping the bottom surface contributed to welding. The photon paths are then scaled according to the input beam profile in order to simulate non-Gaussian beam profiles.&#xd;
A method for determining the 3 independent optical parameters to accurately predict transmission and beam power distribution at the interface was established using experimental data for polycarbonate at 4 different glass fibre concentrations and polyamide-6 reinforced with 20% long glass fibres. Exit beam profiles and transmissions predicted by the simulation were found to be in generally good agreement (R2>0.90) with experimental measurements. The simulations allowed the prediction of transmission and power distributions at other thicknesses as well as information on reflection, energy absorption and power distributions at other thicknesses for these materials.</description>

   <title>Thermal Degradation of PC and PA6 During Laser Transmission Welding (LTW)</title>

   <subject>Laser Welding Thermoplastics</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-27 10:45:24.688</description>
   <description>In laser transmission welding (LTW), a laser beam passes through the laser-transparent part and is absorbed by carbon black (CB) in the laser-absorbent part. This causes a temperature rise at the interface between the parts which leads to melting, diffusion and ultimately joining of the two components. Weld temperatures increase with laser power at a given scan speed. However at higher temperatures, it has been observed that weld strength of LTW starts to decline due to material thermal degradation.&#xd;
Thermal degradation of materials is a kinetic phenomenon which depends on both temperature and time. Therefore there is no specific temperature for thermal degradation. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to study the thermal degradation of two commonly used thermoplastic materials: polycarbonate (PC) and polyamide 6 (PA6). Each material was studied at two levels of CB. It is shown in this work that increasing the carbon black (CB) level from 0.05 to 0.2wt% has no significant effect on the thermal stability of PA6. However, it is observed that increasing the CB level from 0.05 to 0.2wt% has a noticeable effect on the thermal stability of PC. &#xd;
The TGA data were then used to obtain the kinetic triplets (frequency factor (k_0), activation energy (E), and reaction model (f(α))) of the materials using a non-linear model-fitting method. These kinetic triplets were combined with temperature-time data obtained from a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of the LTW process to predict material degradation during LTW. The predicted degradation was then compared with experimental data. It is found that the predicted onset of material degradation is in good agreement with experimentally observed thermal degradation (of both visually observed degradation onset and weld strength decline) for PC and PA6. &#xd;
A semi-empirical model based on the FEM temperature data is also developed in this work as a simpler alternative for obtaining LTW maximum temperature-time profiles for prediction of material thermal degradation during LTW. Comparison of the predicted material conversion using temperature-time profile obtained by FEM and the semi-empirical model shows good agreement.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to explore coach-athlete interactive behaviours.  More specifically, it investigated why coaches choose to interact with their athletes, and why coaches interact with their athletes in a particular manner.  Head male coaches, of nine female competitive club soccer teams participated in the current study.  Each coach was videotaped and audiotaped during two practices.  Each video was uploaded to a computer and reviewed.  Coaches then participated in a stimulated recall interview.  During the interview, coaches were shown a total of 15 video clips that included footage of themselves interacting with an individual athlete, group of athletes, and the entire team.  Coaches were asked to expand on the dynamics of these interactions.  The results of the study indicate that when coaches interact with athletes, their reasoning is two-fold: first they decide to interact, and second, they decide the way in which they should interact with their athlete(s) based on several factors.  Coaches interacted for one of four reasons: (1) connection to a larger picture, (2) teachable moments, (3) standards of behaviour, and (4) organization.  The manner in which coaches interacted with their athletes was influenced by four factors: (1) knowledge of the athlete, (2) degree of athlete input, (3) degree of tolerance, and (4) team unit involved.  Together, these results helped to construct a model that illustrates how coaches make decisions with regards to coach-athlete interactive behaviour in context.  Preliminary findings indicate that coaching philosophy permeates this entire process.</description>

   <description>In this thesis I develop a formalism for analyzing quantum optics in photonic crystal slab cavities which may be coupled, lossy, and non-orthogonal. Using a tight-binding approximation I find classical coupled-cavity quasimodes which overlap in space and frequency. These classical modes are used to develop a multiphoton basis for quantum optics with non-orthogonal photon states. I develop creation and annihilation operators with a novel commutation relation as a consequence of the nonorthogonality of the quasimodes. With these operators the effective Hamiltonian, number operator, electric field operator and quadrature operators are obtained.&#xd;
The quantum jump technique is applied to handle the effects of loss. This technique is compared with the master equation, and conditions for the quantum jump technique being preferable are described. The quantum jump technique is implemented numerically, allowing for time-dependent linear and X(2) non-linear pumping.&#xd;
I use a combination of analytic results and characteristic functions to examine the evolution of coherent and squeezed states in a single lossy quasimode. The analysis is then extended to two nonorthogonal quasimodes. States are investigated using reduced characteristic functions.</description>

   <description>Benzaldehyde (BZA), a biologically derived high-value molecule used in the flavour and fragrance industry for its characteristic almond-like aroma, has also found use in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agrochemical, and dye applications. Although, nature-identical BZA is most commonly produced by chemical synthesis, biologically derived BZA, whether by plant material extraction or via microbial biocatalysts, commands much higher prices. The bioproduction of high value molecules has often been characterized by low titers as results of substrate and product inhibition. The current work examined a variety of process strategies and the implementation of a solid-liquid bioreactor partitioning system with continuous integrated pervaporation to enhance the bioproduction of BZA using Pichia pastoris.&#xd;
Previous work on two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) for the biotransformation of BZA using Pichia pastoris has had limitations due to long fermentation times and unutilized substrate in the immiscible polymer phase, contributing to complications for product purification. To reduce fermentation times, a mixed methanol/glycerol feeding strategy was employed and reduced the time required for high-density fermentation by 3.5 fold over previous studies. Additionally, because BZA and not the substrate benzyl alcohol (BA) had been found to be significantly inhibitory to the biotransformation reaction, a polymer selection strategy based on the ratio of partition coefficients (PCs) for the two target molecules was implemented. Using the polymer Kraton D1102K, with a PC ratio of 14.9 (BZA:BA), generated a 3.4 fold increase in BZA produced (14.4 g vs. 4.2 g) relative to single phase operation at more than double the volumetric productivity (97 mg L-1 h-1 vs. 41 mg L-1 h-1). This work also confirmed that the solute(s) of interest were taken up by polymers via absorption, not adsorption.&#xd;
BZA and BA cell growth inhibition experiments showed that these compounds are toxic to cells and it was their accumulation rather than low enzyme levels or energy (ATP) depletion that caused a reduction in the biotransformation rate. For this reason, the final strategy employed to enhance the bioproduction of benzaldehyde involved in situ product removal by pervaporation using polymer (Hytrel 3078) fabricated into tubing by DuPont, Canada. This aspect was initiated by first characterizing the custom-fabricated tubing in terms BZA and BA fluxes. The tubing was then integrated into an in situ pervaporation biotransformation and was shown to be effective at continuous product separation, using 87.4% less polymer by mass in comparison to polymer beads in conventional TPPB operation, and improved overall volumetric productivity by 214% (245.9 mg L-1 h-1 vs. 115.0 mg L-1 h-1) over previous work producing BZA.</description>

   <description>Champlain Sea Clay (also known as Leda Clay) is a sensitive marine clay that was deposited within the limits of the Champlain Sea transgression during the final retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet. Upon isostatic rebound, the watersheds incised deep river valleys throughout the Ottawa region. These sensitive clay river banks have been shown to be highly susceptible to large retrogressive landslides. A cone penetration testing and hydrogeological program was developed in this thesis to characterize a retrogressive landslide along a creek valley consisting mainly of Champlain Sea Clay. As Champlain Sea Clay has been commonly shown to consist of banded layers, a 2 cm2 piezocone, and 5 cm2, 10 cm2 and 15 cm2 CPTu cones were used to demonstrate that the slightly larger 5 cm2 penetrometer was the most practical size for investigating landslides in Champlain Sea Clay. In doing so, the 5 cm2 cone was capable of high resolution stratigraphic profiling, locating remoulded layers for slip surface detection and characterizing the Champlain Sea Clay landslide near Ottawa. &#xd;
Due to the significant effects of the pore pressure distribution on slope stability and retrogressive behavior, a long term hydrogeological program was initiated which defined the ground water regime and real-time pore pressure data during a retrogressive landslide event. The seasonal change in the ground water regime from rapid snowmelt has shown to be a significant hydrogeological influence on triggering a retrogressive landslide along Mud Creek.  With regular monitoring over multiple seasons, the seasonal pore pressure changes can be used to further understand the long term development of retrogressive landslides in Champlain Sea Clay.</description>

   <title>Do Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Abdominal Obesity Mediate the Exercise-Induced Change in Insulin Sensitivity in Older Adults?</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-27 14:53:00.796</description>
   <description>Aging is associated with increased insulin resistance, a condition in which the tissue response to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is reduced. Insulin resistance is a strong predictor of disease and mortality. Aging is also associated with a decline in physical activity, lower cardiorespiratory fitness (ability to deliver oxygen to active muscles during exercise), and increase in abdominal fat. Both low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and excess abdominal fat are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity in older adults. Improvements in CRF and abdominal obesity through exercise training may be responsible for improvement in insulin sensitivity.&#xd;
	Several investigations have reported that changes in CRF and abdominal obesity through exercise are associated with changes in insulin sensitivity. To our knowledge, no prior study has assessed whether change in CRF or abdominal fat alone explains the association between exercise and improvement in insulin sensitivity in older adults. Our findings suggest that improvement in CRF may not explain the exercise-induced change in insulin sensitivity. The improvement in insulin sensitivity from exercise is explained through a decrease abdominal fat that also occurs with exercise. Additionally, improvements in waist circumference, a surrogate measure for abdominal obesity, and body mass index together explained a large portion of exercise-induced change in insulin sensitivity compared to either variable alone.&#xd;
Our findings suggest that exercise combined with a healthy diet will improve insulin resistance, a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in older adults. Our findings suggest that the reduction in abdominal obesity is the conduit by which exercise improves insulin sensitivity in older adults. Although CRF is not related to exercise-induced change in insulin sensitivity, change in CRF from exercise has been reported to decrease risk for other health conditions, such as hypertension and all-cause mortality. Our findings suggest that clinicians should measure both waist circumference and body mass index when evaluating the effectiveness of a lifestyle-based treatment strategy for improving insulin resistance and its associated health outcomes in older adults.</description>

   <title>Continuously Improving in Tough Times: Overcoming Resource Constraints With Positive Psychological Resources</title>

   <description>Individuals and organizations must continuously improve to succeed in today’s competitive economic climate, yet a major dilemma in tough economic conditions is that the resources needed to support such proactive improvement behaviors are limited. Existing theories on organizational resources, stressors, and continuous improvement are relevant yet insufficient for answering the important question of how individuals remain motivated to pursue continuous improvement activities despite minimal organizational resources to support them. Therefore, the goal of this dissertation was to build and test theory on this phenomenon. Inspired by full-cycle research, I began this program of research with a phenomenological study of employees in a manufacturing environment to better understand their appraisals regarding continuous improvement under resource-constrained conditions. The results highlighted the ways in which employees interpret constraints as either a threat or a challenge, and how positive psychological capital (PsyCap) guides these interpretations and subsequent continuous improvement. Informed by this rich data, I proposed a synthesized theoretical model which was tested in two separate contexts. First, I conducted a time-lagged survey study in another resource-constrained environment that demands continuous improvement, namely entrepreneurs launching a new business. To exert more control and to enhance the generalizability of this research, I then conducted an online experiment with participants from various industries and backgrounds. The results of these studies largely supported the theoretical model, documenting in particular the importance of individuals’ challenge appraisals for their ensuing continuous improvement behaviors. The benefits of individuals’ positive psychological resources as a way to enhance the perceived learning opportunities from resource constraints (i.e., challenge appraisal) were also illustrated. Threat appraisals did not produce the expected effects in this context of continuous improvement, and as such, the theoretical model was refined further. Collectively, this research provides answers to the important question of how individuals can find ways to proactively improve in the face of resource constraints, which is a timely and relevant topic across contemporary organizational contexts today.</description>

   <title>On the Performativity of Economics</title>

   <subject>Performativity</subject>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-28 08:05:52.036</description>
   <description>This project seeks to deepen the understanding of economic “performativity” – the effects of economic theory and models on the economy - by examining the history of financial markets and the relationship between economic and political forces. Chapter One demonstrates how the culture of finance (and economics, more generally) began changing in 1950 from methods that aimed in the production of epistemologically true, descriptive statements to abstract theories that illuminated the potentials of markets. As a result, economics was able to provide the mechanisms necessary to transform markets for the first time.&#xd;
	Chapter Two demonstrates that this departure from orthodox methods birthed a new field of research concerning the ability of economics to construct theoretically described worlds: performativity. This chapter demonstrates that all conceptions of performativity are able to be organized into weak and strong claims, being further united by their depiction of economics as an independent force that comes up against external forces in periods of market emergence and transformation. Interestingly, a dichotomy emerges between performativity and political-cultural approaches to understanding economies: the former claims economics is the force that practically transforms markets and the latter claims transformation occurs through mediation of political and institutional interests.  &#xd;
	It is the purpose of Chapter Three to unveil a new context to understand economic performativity. It will first be demonstrated that there exists little evidence for the performative claim that economics is a force unto itself: instead, economics is utilized as tool to provide organization and stability for actors in periods of market transformation and as such, relies on external forces for performative success. Reconceptualizing performativity in this way addresses many critiques against variations of the performative thesis and suggests that the dichotomization between performative and political-cultural approaches may be reconciled, illuminating a more plausible account of how economics interacts with its objects. It is concluded that performative accounts of economics ought to be subsumed within political-cultural approaches to understanding economic organization.</description>

   <description>The use of personality tests throughout Canadian society is based on the assumption that their results are valid. However, research has shown that individuals can, and do, fake their responses on personality inventories. Individuals may fake good, emphasizing their positive characteristics, or fake bad, emphasizing negative characteristics, in order to obtain a desired outcome. Recent research has provided support for a congruence model of faking, which states that schema-consistent responses are provided more quickly than schema-inconsistent responses. Faking successfully, without being detected by validity indices, requires balancing favourable and unfavourable responses, regardless of the faking schema a participant adopts. This demand results in cognitive fatigue over time, producing increasingly unbalanced response patterns. Two studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the congruence and cognitive overload models of faking in detecting instructed faking, and to examine whether these models or the newly developed Faking Response Strategy Scales provide added value in detecting faking relative to currently established gold-standard measures. Results showed that all of the self-report scales examined—whether traditional or new—were valid detectors of faking, which supports their ongoing use. However, results highlighted the weakness of the Impression Management subscale of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding, the current gold-standard in the field, in providing added value relative to other scales. Response latency data supported the congruence model of faking, but results for the cognitive overload model were mixed: Study 1 data supported the cognitive overload model, but time constraints introduced in Study 2 seem to have caused random responding, rather than increasing cognitive overload as was intended. Results supported a multidimensional model of faking, and show that adding measures of response latency and response pattern can enhance the ability of traditional measures to detect faking. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications for methods of detecting faking and for the understanding of cognitive processes underlying faking.</description>

   <description>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are popular for their wide scope of application domains ranging from agricultural, medical, defense, industrial, social, mining, etc. Many of these applications are in outdoor type environments that are unregulated and unpredictable, thus, potentially hostile or physically harsh for sensors. The popularity of WSNs stems from their fundamental concept of being low cost and ultra-low power wireless devices that can monitor and report sensor readings with little user intervention, which has led to greater demand for WSN deployment in harsh industrial environments. We argue that there are a new set of architectural challenges and requirements imposed on the hardware, software, and network architecture of a wireless sensor platform to operate effectively under harsh industrial environments, which are not met by currently available WSN platforms. We propose a new sensor platform, called Sprouts. Sprouts is a readily deployable, physically rugged, volumetrically miniature, modular, network standard, plug-and-play (PnP), and easy to use sensor platform that will assist university researchers, developers, and industrial companies to evaluate WSN applications in the field, and potentially bring about new application domains that were previously difficult to accomplish using off the shelf WSN development platforms. Therefore, we addresses the inherent requirements and challenges across the hardware, software, and network layer required for designing and implementing Sprouts sensor platform for harsh industrial environments. We fully implement the hardware, network, and software architecture for the Sprouts platform and verify that they meet the requirements for harsh environments. We deploy the Sprouts platform customized with our PnP ultrasound sensor module in an industrial application to monitor the health conditions of Syncrude's vibration screens operating under extreme harsh conditions. Sprouts has been showcased in OCE Discovery 2011, and has been proven to be extremely valuable for industrial mining companies such as Syncrude.</description>

   <description>The notion of a sculptural type of drawing is often summarily included in critical literature. These references tend to be brief and regularly contradict one another. Furthermore, drawings made by Tuscan sculptors of the sixteenth century are often neglected altogether. This thesis investigates the notion of a sculptural type of drawing and attempts to understand more clearly the appearance and purpose of drawings made by sixteenth-century sculptors working in central Italy. In order to understand this notion, the history of drawings for sculpture and the literature related to them should be examined. Individual artists from whom a number of drawings survive must be studied separately before being related to one another as a group. This investigation utilizes several methodologies: the early history of drawings for sculpture is recreated from information contained in contemporary written documents and contracts; the literature related to the characterization of inherently sculptural qualities is reevaluated against the surviving visual material; the attributions made to lesser-known sixteenth-century sculptors are scrutinized; and, finally, the drawings executed by sculptors are placed in the broader context of sixteenth-century draughtsmanship. This investigation reveals that some drawings exhibit a functional approach that explores the challenges of preparing a three-dimensional work of art. Such an approach is, however, not unique to sculptors, whose drawings employ an approach that cannot be separated from those by painters. These similarities are significant because they reveal several misunderstandings concerning graphic characteristics often understood to be inherently sculptural, and a history of incorrect attributions based on these assumptions.</description>

   <description>This project is a discourse analysis of first-person and ethnographic writings published between the years 2000 to 2012, written by cis-gendered women who have worked or are working as erotic dancers. Utilizing frameworks of “whore feminism” and whiteness I argue that the works under examination within this project assail the victim/agent dichotomy that has historically dominated discourses surrounding sex workers, which ignore what erotic dancers themselves have to say about female empowerment and how they choose to define themselves. By examining the issues of self-presentation that arise within the context of autobiographical work, I interrogate the tensions inherent within the erotic dance industry surrounding assumed motivations for engaging in the industry; measurements of success for erotic dancers; and how stigmatization impacts the lives of dancers and their loved ones. The project highlights ways in which erotic dance memoirs at once open up new critical and theoretical spaces and also problematically reinforce patriarchal stereotypes.</description>

   <description>This thesis is concerned with the study of morphology and properties of sub-micron thin Nafion® films.  The motivation of the work arises from the need to characterize the 4 -10 nm thin ionomer films in the catalyst layer of polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). &#xd;
A protocol for the fabrication of self-assembled ultra-thin Nafion® films on planar substrates was successfully developed. Films of thickness ranging 4 nm-300 nm, determined by three different techniques - variable angle spectroscopy ellipsometry (VASE), atomic force microscope (AFM) and x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), could be reproducibly generated on SiO2/Si wafer. The 4 nm thin film is one of the thinnest, continuous film of Nafion® ever reported. This is the first time that the structure/properties of such thin Nafion® film have been investigated.&#xd;
An interesting finding is the thickness-dependent structure and property of these films. Films with thickness &lt;55 nm exhibited hydrophilic-free surface but thicker films (>55 nm) had hydrophobic surface. Similarly, sub-55 nm films had a lower and thickness-independent protonic conductivity compared to thicker films that exhibited thickness-dependent conductivity. Anomalously high water uptake (by quartz crystal microbalance) and swelling (by ellipsometry) of sub-55nm films indicate that low conductivity is not due to low water content However, differences in surface morphology were observed by the AFM phase contrast analysis. The lack of ionic domain was also observed in the thinner films (4-30 nm) from the grazing incidence small x-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments. &#xd;
Thermal annealing over a range of temperature (110-160 oC) revealed a dramatic switching of the film surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic was observed for sub-55 nm films with lower thickness film requiring higher annealing temperature. Bulk proton conductivity was significantly reduced after annealing for all films. An interesting finding was the regeneration of conductivity after to prolonged liquid water exposure and a corresponding switching back of the surface to hydrophilic. The thickness-dependent structure/property of ultra-thin Nafion® films is attributed to substrate induced confinement effect.&#xd;
Self-assembly of Nafion® on various substrates (SiO2, carbon, Pt and Au) was studied. The ionomer/substrate interaction and resulting film morphology followed a trend with respect to substrate surface energies and Nafion® dispersion compositions.</description>

   <title>R v NS 2012 SCC 72 –  Assessing the Contours of the Freedom to Wear the Niqab in Canada</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Law) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-29 20:00:52.439</description>
   <description>This thesis uses the recently decided R v NS to assess the contours of the freedom to wear the niqab, as part of religious freedom, in Canada. By criticizing the majority and concurring  opinions I argue that, properly understood, a witness’s religious freedom should protect her from an order to unveil when she is testifying in court. I show that the concurring opinion holds the witness to an illiberal, unfair standard of personal behaviour that fails to respect the witness’s religious freedom. I show that the majority’s decision, though following a justified liberal process of balancing rights, failed to protect NS’s meaningful choice to practice her religion, a standard set by the court in Hutterian Brethren. I then assess the broader implications of R v NS. I argue that in theoretical terms R v NS reaffirms Canada’s commitment to a liberal system of reciprocal rights and rejects a perfectionist approach according to which societal values can override rights. These theoretical lessons are then applied to other policies regulating the veil. I argue that despite its shortcomings, R v NS should generate optimism that perfectionist policies will be rejected and that the veil will only be limited minimally and only when the limit is necessary to uphold other legitimate aims.</description>

   <description>Antibiotics disrupt the normal balance of the gut microbiota and may subsequently reduce colonization resistance, allowing pathogenic bacteria to colonize and cause disease. By re-introducing normal microbiota from a donor, colonization resistance can be restored. Based on this premise, a complex mixture, “microbial ecosystem therapeutic-1” (MET-1) containing 33 strains of commensal bacteria was derived from the stool of a healthy human donor. This gut microbial ecosystem has been successfully used to treat two patients infected with C. difficile, but mechanisms of action of the beneficial effects of MET-1 were undefined. An infectious antibiotic-associated mouse model of S. typhimurium and a germ free mouse model of C. difficile infection were utilized to determine the therapeutic effect of MET-1. In the S. typhimurium model, female C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with oral streptomycin prior to receiving MET-1 or vehicle control. When S. typhimurium infected mice were pretreated with MET-1, weight loss was attenuated (-3.5% vs. -6.8%; p&lt;0.05). Serum cytokine levels of TNF-α, MIP-1β, IL-3 and GM-CSF were all significantly reduced. The S. typhimurium bacterial loads in the spleen were decreased in mice pretreated with MET-1 (9190 CFU/g vs. 25,438 CFU/g; p&lt;0.05). Verified using a time-kill assay, MET-1 was bactericidal against S. typhimurium. These results showed that MET-1 could have attenuated the infection by inhibiting the growth of S. typhimurium. Germ-free, female Swiss Webster mice were pretreated with MET-1 or vehicle control prior to infection with C. difficile strain 027.  In infected mice that were pretreated with MET-1 weight loss was attenuated, (-2.43% vs. -13.35%; p&lt;0.05)  and serum cytokine levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, GM-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1α and MIP-1β  were all significantly reduced. The C. difficile bacterial loads in the cecum were reduced in mice pretreated with MET-1 (1.1x106 CFU/g vs. 1.9x108 CFU/g; p&lt;0.05). In this model MET-1 was able to restore colonization resistance and therefore attenuate the C. difficile infection. Therefore, using a complex microbial community could restore colonization resistance against two different pathogens, S. typhimurium and C. difficile. In the future, MET-1 could be used as a prophylactic in conjunction with antibiotics to ensure colonization resistance is maintained against pathogenic bacteria.</description>

   <description>Chiral molecules, which exist under enantiomers with non-mirror-symmetrical structures, have been the subject of intense research for their linear and nonlinear optical activities. Cysteine is such a chiral amino acid found as a building block of proteins throughout human bodies. Second harmonic generation (SHG) has been considered to investigate chiral molecules. SHG from metallic nanoparticles is promising for nanoplasmonics and photonic nanodevice applications. Therefore, it’s desirable to combine and study nonlinear properties due to both chirality and metallic nanoparticles, and help developing an alternatively optical diagnostic of chiral molecules. &#xd;
Our experiments are carried out with the FemtoFiber Scientific FFS laser system. SHG of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) modified by either L-Cysteine (L-C) or D-Cysteine (D-C) is observed, where L-Cysteine and D-Cysteine are a pair of enantiomers. Ag NPs are deposited through Vacuum Thermal Evaporation, controlled under different deposition thicknesses. UV-Vis/IR spectra and AFM are used to characterize Ag NPs under different conditions. Transmitted SHG measurements dependent on incidence are recorded with standard lock-in techniques. &#xd;
Deposition thickness of vacuum thermal evaporation plays an important role in forming diverse Ag NPs, which strongly imparts the intensity of SHG. Second harmonic intensity as a function of the incident angle presents similar results for Ag NPs with or without L-Cysteine or D-Cysteine modification, in the output of p- and s-polarization. However, we monitor reversed rotation difference in second harmonic intensities at linearly +45° and -45° polarization for L-C/Ag NPs and D-C/Ag NPs, while there’s no difference at linearly +45° and -45° polarization for Ag NPs alone. This optical rotation difference in SHG is termed as SHG-ORD. Also, for second harmonic light fixed at p-polarization, L-C/Ag NPs and D-C/Ag NPs exhibit a reversely net difference for SHG excited by right and left circular polarization, which is termed as SHG-CD. Experiments on SHG-ORD of chiral-modified Ag NPs by a mixture of L-Cysteine and D-Cysteine further help verifying the existence of chirality in chiral-modified Ag NPs. &#xd;
As a conclusion, SHG efficiently probed and distinguished L-Cysteine from D-Cysteine in chiral-modified Ag NPs.</description>

   <description>Unprecedented rates of anthropogenic environmental change have resulted in dramatic decreases in biodiversity worldwide. In order to persist during changes in both the abiotic and biotic environment resulting from anthropogenic stressors such as climate change and habitat degradation, populations must be able to respond or face extirpation. Predicted population-level responses to environmental change include i) range shifts as individuals disperse into more suitable regions, ii) phenotypic plasticity allowing for shifts in the mean phenotype of the population or iii) microevolution resulting from a genetic change within the population. The goal of this thesis is to assess how species within a community respond to a dramatic change in the environment.&#xd;
	This study used the sediment record of a Subarctic pond to investigate the impacts of a rapid increase in salinity on two species of the crustacean zooplankton Daphnia. One species, Daphnia tenebrosa, was unable to persist in the high salinity conditions and is believed to have been extirpated from the system. The other species, Daphnia magna, was tolerant of the new environmental conditions and was present throughout the sediment record.  To investigate the changes in life history of D. magna, resting eggs from the sediment were hatched to compare iso-female lines from pre- and post-disturbance time periods. No differences were observed between the clone lines, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity allowed D. magna to persist despite the rapidly changing environmental conditions, and that microevolution in salinity tolerance may not have occurred in this population.&#xd;
	This study suggests that, in environments with moderate levels of post environmental change, pre-existing phenotypic plasticity may play a greater role than microevolution in species response to environmental changes. However, not all species from a community display the same response to environmental changes, as seen in this study with the extirpation of D. tenebrosa. To better understand how communities will be affected by future environmental change, further investigations need to be made on what factors influence species response. Identifying species response may allow conservation efforts to focus on species that are unlikely to adapt to environmental change, and are most at risk.</description>

   <description>Background: Moving the latest evidence from research into nursing practice remains a challenge. We are only beginning to recognize the processes involved and little is known as to which approaches are effective in different contexts. Facilitation is an intervention that involves helping practitioners recognize what it is they need to change in practice and how to make these changes to incorporate evidence into practice.  &#xd;
Objective: To describe the role, function, and practice of facilitation in moving evidence into nursing practice. A secondary element is to determine if a provisional facilitation framework, developed to reflect the concept in guideline adaptation and the early stages of implementation, accurately depicts facilitation in the context of actual implementation.&#xd;
Methods: The thesis employs an emergent mixed-methods design and is composed of two phases each with multiple components. The first phase explores the conceptual, theoretical, and experiential foundations of facilitation and examines: (1) how the concept has evolved over 16 years in a comprehensive literature review, (2) facilitation as described by experienced nurses in guideline implementation, and (3) how facilitation relates to other guideline implementation interventions in a review of studies included in an existing systematic review. The second phase describes the practical foundations of facilitation and follows the facilitation occurring naturally over time in a guideline implementation involving front-line nurses at the point of care. &#xd;
Results: The comprehensive review provides a description of how facilitation has evolved and presents a current synopsis of the state of knowledge regarding facilitation. The conceptual, theoretical, and empirical understandings of the concept were integrated with the practical foundations to confirm and refine the framework to reflect facilitation across the continuum from guideline adaptation to implementation. The revised framework is displayed and represents a comprehensive view and understanding of facilitation of evidence-based practice in nursing from multiple perspectives.&#xd;
Conclusions: The detail in the revised framework provides a useful guide for practitioners and organizations in planning for change. Further testing is required to determine its applicability and usability in the practice setting.</description>

   <description>Successful fertilization depends upon the activation of metaphase II arrested oocytes by sperm-borne oocyte activating factor (SOAF). Failure of oocyte activation is considered as the cause of treatment failure in a proportion of infertile couples. SOAF induces the release of intracellular calcium in oocyte which leads to meiotic resumption and pronuclear formation. Calcium release is either in the form of single calcium transient in echinoderm and amphibian oocytes or several calcium oscillations in ascidian and mammalian oocytes. Although the SOAF attributes are established, it is not clear which sperm protein(s) play such role. Sperm postacrosomal WW binding protein (PAWP) satisfies a developmental criteria set for a candidate SOAF. This study shows that recombinant human PAWP protein or its transcript acts upstream of calcium release and fully activates the amphibian and mammalian oocytes. Interference trials provided evidence for the first time that PAWP mediates sperm-induced intracellular calcium release through a PPXY/WWI domain module in Xenopus, mouse and human oocytes. Clinical applications of PAWP were further investigated by prospective study on the sperm samples from patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). PAWP expression level, analyzed by flow cytometry, was correlated to ICSI success rate and embryonic development. This study also explored the developmental expression of the other SOAF candidate, PLCζ in male reproductive system and its function during fertilization. Our findings showed for the first time that PLCζ most likely binds to the sperm head surface during epididymal passage and is expressed in epididymis. We demonstrated that PLCζ is also compartmentalized early in spermiogenesis and thus could play an important role during spermiogenesis. Detailed analysis of in vitro fertilization revealed that PLCζ disappears from sperm head during acrosome reaction and is not detectable during sperm incorporation into the oocyte cytoplasm. In conclusion, this dissertation provides evidence for the essential non-redundant role of sperm PAWP in amphibian and mammalian fertilization; recommends PAWP as a biomarker for prediction of ICSI outcomes in infertile couples; and proposes that sperm PLCζ may have functions other than inducing oocyte activation during fertilization.</description>

   <description>Clad alloys feature one or more different alloys bonded to the outside of a core alloy, with non-equilibrium, interalloy interfaces.  There is limited understanding of the recovery and recrystallization behaviour of cold rolled clad aluminum alloys.  In order to optimize the properties of such alloys, new heat treatment processes may be required that differ from what is used for the monolithic alloys.  This study examines the recovery behaviour of a cold rolled Novelis FusionTM alloy containing an AA6XXX core with an AA3003 cladding on one side.  The bond between alloys appears microscopically discrete and continuous, but has a 30 m wide chemical gradient.   The as-deformed structure at the interalloy region consists of pancaked sub-grains with dislocations at the misorientation boundaries and a lower density organized within the more open interiors.   X-ray line broadening was used to extract the dislocation density from the interalloy region and an equivalently deformed AA6XXX following static annealing using a modified Williamson-Hall analysis. This analysis assumed that Gaussian broadening contributions in a pseudo-Voigt function corresponded only to strain from dislocations.  The kinetics of the dislocation density evolution to recrystallization were studied isothermally at 2 minute intervals, and isochronally at 175 and 205°C.  The data fit the Nes model, in which the interalloy region recovered faster than AA6XXX at 175°C, but was slower at 205°C.  This was most likely caused by change in texture and chemistry within this region such as over-aging of AA6XXX . Simulation of a continuous annealing and self homogenization process both with and without pre-recovery indicates a detectable, though small change in the texture and grain size in the interalloy region.</description>

   <description>Short-term tensile strains that arise from local gravel indentations in municipal solid waste landfill base geomembrane liners are investigated with an emphasis on quantifying how strains are obtained and providing methods for limiting long-term local geomembrane strains below allowable levels. This involved the development of new experimental techniques and apparatuses to study geomembrane strains under controlled conditions.&#xd;
An experimental technique to measure the radial and vertical components of displacement from local gravel indentations in a geomembrane is presented. Geomembrane strains were calculated using large strain-displacement theory, thin shell theory, and the arc elongation method. While radial displacements were found to be small relative to vertical displacements, they were shown to provide the dominant contribution to the maximum strain beneath the centre of the gravel indentation. Both the thin shell and arc elongation methods produced incorrect distributions of strain and also provided magnitudes that significantly underestimated the maximum geomembrane strain.&#xd;
Small-scale screening tests were conducted to gain insight into how key factors including the compressibility of the underlying clay layer, particle size of the overlying gravel, and mass of the geotextile protection layer influence local geomembrane strains. Results are provided that can be used to rule out protection layers that are unable to meet a long-term strain limit, and conversely, identify those that may be able to limit strains below a target strain for further larger scale evaluation. Compaction water contents towards the lower range of water content to achieve an acceptably low hydraulic conductivity of field compacted clay liners were found to be more successful in limiting local strains in the geomembrane. Protection from geotextiles with masses up to 2440 g/m2 were unable to limit geomembrane strains below 1.5% with nominal 50 mm gravel at a temperature of 55°C. Tests with nominal 25 mm gravel revealed that a geotextile with a mass of 1500 g/m2 successfully limited the maximum geomembrane strain below 1.5% at an applied stress of 250 kPa while another geotextile (2440 g/m2) met the strain limit up to applied stresses of 500 kPa at a temperature of 55°C.</description>

   <description>Modern communication systems have increased the need for creative antenna solutions and low-profile circuit configurations that can offer high-quality performance at a low cost. The microwave and millimeter-wave frequency ranges have shown much promise allowing for increased data transmission rates while also offering smaller and compact designs. Specific applications for these wireless systems include radar, biomedical sensors, phased arrays, and communication devices. Planar antennas and circuits are generally well adopted for these applications due to their low profile and ease of fabrication. However, classic feeding techniques for planar structures can be problematic. Losses can also be observed in these conventional feeding schemes due to unwanted surface wave (SW) excitation. This can lead to reduced antenna and circuit efficiencies, and thus, diminished system performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is shown in this thesis that by the use of planar SW sources, or surface-wave launchers (SWLs), innovative and efficient antennas and feed systems are possible. Theoretical analysis and experimental verification for these SWLs are initially presented. New topologies and array configurations are also examined for directive beam steering at end-fire and at broadside. Additionally, studied structures include novel surface-wave antennas (SWAs) and leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) for 3-D beam pattern control in the far-field. A comprehensive design strategy is also examined which describes the implementation of these planar antennas using SWLs. This design strategy is based on a full-wave analysis of the modes that can be supported by the planar structures which include various planar-periodic metallic strip configurations and partially reflecting surfaces (PRSs) or screens. With appropriate conditions SWs can also be bound and guided for field channeling and power routing. For instance, novel planar metallic SW lenses and guidance structures are developed. Demonstrated applications include couplers, transition sections, as well as new planar circuits for power dividing/combining. To the author's knowledge, similar techniques have not been previously studied in the literature which allow for such controlled SW propagation and radiation. This way, SWs, which are normally considered an unwanted effect are used here to advantage.</description>

   <description>In Situ Thermal Treatment (ISTT) is a candidate remediation technology for dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). However, the relationships between gas production, gas flow, and contaminant mass removal during ISTT are not fully understood. A laboratory study was conducted to assess the degree of mass removal, as well as the gas generation rate and the composition of the gas phase as a function of different heating times and initial DNAPL saturations. The temperature of the contaminated soil was measured continuously using a thermocouple to identify periods of heating, co-boiling and boiling. Samples were collected from the aqueous and DNAPL phase of the condensate, as well as from the source soil, at different heating times, and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In addition to laboratory experiments, a mathematical model was developed to predict the co-boiling temperature and transient composition of the gas phase during heating of a uniform source. Predictions for single-component sources matched the experiments well, with a co-boiling plateau at 88°C ± 1°C for experiments with tetrachloroethene (PCE) and water. A comparison of predicted and observed boiling behaviour showed a discrepancy at the end of the co-boiling period, with earlier temperature increases occurring in the experiments. The results of this study suggest that temperature observations related to the co-boiling period during ISTT applications may not provide a clear indication of complete NAPL mass removal, and that multi-compartment modeling associated with various NAPL saturation zones is required to consider mass-transfer limitations within the heated zone. Predictions for multi-component DNAPL, containing 1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), PCE and Chlorobenzene, showed no co-boiling plateau. CB is the least volatile component and dominates in the vapour phase at the end of the co-boiling process, and it can be used as an indicator of the end of the co-boiling stage. Two field NAPL mixtures were simulated using the screening-level analytical model to demonstrate its potential application on ISTT. The two mixtures with similar composition but different mass fractions result in distinct co-boiling temperature and mass transfer behaviour. The non-volatile component in the NAPL mixture results in larger amounts of water consumption and longer ISTT operation time.</description>

   <description>A spectral wave model (SWAN) coupled with a depth averaged hydrodynamic model (Delft3D) was used to understand the wave and flow dynamics of the Kingston Basin of Lake Ontario during large winter storm events. This model was then used to assess the impact of an offshore wind farm in the Kingston Basin. Results over different model domains with various forcing methods were compared to achieve the highest correlation with wave, current and water level observations from several locations. Storm events were modelled over the complex bathymetry of the basin and results were verified using wave and current profiler data collected during the winters of 2009-10 and 2011-12. Waves were composed of both locally generated wind sea and swell from the main basin of Lake Ontario, while flows throughout the Kingston Basin showed a complex circulation pattern. This circulation is composed of several wind-driven gyres, which are magnified during storm events. The impact of waves on the circulation patterns within the basin is highest in shallow areas where wave breaking drives circulation. To simulate a wind farm, a transmission coefficient was used in the wave model to represent the effects on waves, and an energy loss term was added to the hydrodynamic momentum equations to represent the added drag of the piles on the circulation. The results indicate that the coastal areas in eastern Lake Ontario will be minimally affected. The headlands of Big Sandy Bay, Wolfe Island, could see the largest coastal effects with changes in significant wave height predicted to be &lt; 2%. The majority of impacts to circulation occur in the near-field, with changes in current magnitude of &lt; 0.08 m s-1 (up to 50%). Areas near Wolfe Island exhibit changes of ~ 0.05 m s-1 (30 %), although overall circulation patterns throughout the basin are not affected. The majority of changes to surface waves and wind-driven currents are due to wind farm position with respect to wind direction and the re-direction of flows and waves as they pass through the wind farm.</description>

   <description>Amidst the global wave of democratization, modernization, and economic engagement during the 1980s and 1990s, the traditional tenets of constitutionalism have proven to be unwieldy dogma for States undergoing periods of rapid transition. In order to retain the administrative capacity to steer – rather than merely adapt to – political and social change, numerous transitioning States have adopted a new paradigm of constitutionalism, namely transitional constitutionalism, characterized by a centralized and streamlined structure of governance. However, in many instances, including Korea’s post-division transitional history, this model has demonstrably undermined fundamental human rights protections. In this thesis, I propose a hybrid constitutional paradigm for unification in Korea (another form of State transition) which seeks to balance the dual objectives of effective governance and human rights protection. I do so by examining and critiquing the core principles of traditional and transitional constitutionalism, outlining the human rights issues that the unified Korea will likely confront in its constitutional trajectory based on an analysis of Korea’s political, social, cultural, and constitutional history, and finally proposing a hybrid model of constitutionalism that utilizes an institutional approach to prevent violations of human rights in the unified Korea while allowing the State to retain governmental efficiency during transition.</description>

   <description>Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by bone loss affecting 10% of the US population over 50 years old.  The spine is one critical area affected by the disease.  The effectiveness of experimental treatments can be tested on an ovariectomized rat osteoporosis model.  As a result, lumbar vertebral bodies are often mechanically tested in uniaxial compression in order to determine whether or not the mechanical properties of the bone in ovariectomized rats improve with treatment.  The irregular shape of rat vertebral bodies requires some specimen preparation to create two parallel loading surfaces for uniaxial compression testing.  &#xd;
Two specimen preparation methods are reported in the current body of literature. One cuts the cranial and caudal surfaces to make them parallel to each other. The other cuts the caudal surface and uses bone cement to create a flat loading surface at the cranial end.  In this thesis a total of twenty rat vertebral bodies were tested. Ten were prepared with a cut specimen preparation method and ten with an embedding method.   Each specimen was tested in uniaxial compression and was microCT scanned before and after testing.  Eleven parameters were calculated from the mechanical testing data and compared between the two groups using Student’s t-tests.  The specimens were also categorized into six failure modes and locations observed in the microCT images.&#xd;
The embedded specimens showed a lower stiffness (p = 0.026), greater yield displacement (p = 0.007) and apparent strain at failure (p = 0.050).  These differences were largely attributed to the embedded specimens being 1 mm taller than the cut specimens.  The shorter size of the cut specimens affected the mechanical parameters.  The cut specimens were easier to prepare and were less sensitive to end effect failures.  The embedded specimens kept the endplate, which distributes the load from the intervertebral disk through the vertebral body, intact.  In addition, the embedded specimens exhibited two failure modes, endplate failure and failure at the center of the vertebral body, observed in ex vivo human lumbar vertebral body testing, which suggests the interaction of the vertebral body with the endplate is an important factor in vertebral body failure in uniaxial compression testing.  In conclusion, neither preparation method showed an overwhelming advantage over the other, and experimental parameters should be considered when choosing a loading surface preparation method.</description>

   <description>SuperCDMS is a leading direct dark matter search experiment which uses solid state detectors (Ge crystals) at milliKelvin temperatures to look for nuclear recoils caused by dark matter interactions in the detector. ‘Weakly Interacting Massive Particles’ (WIMPs) are the most favoured dark matter candidate particles. SuperCDMS, like many other direct dark matter search experiments, primarily looks for WIMPs. The measurement of both the ionization and the lattice vibration (phonon) signals from an interaction in the detector allow it to discriminate against electron recoils which are the main source of background for WIMP detection.&#xd;
SuperCDMS currently operates about 9 kgs worth of germanium detectors at the Soudan underground lab in northern Minnesota. In its next phase, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, it plans to use 100-200 kg of target mass (Ge) which would allow it to probe more of the interesting and unexplored parameter space for WIMPs predicted by theoretical models. The SuperCDMS Queen’s Test Facility is a detector testing facility which is intended to serve detector testing and detector research and development purposes for the SuperCDMS experiment.&#xd;
A modified detector called the ‘HiZIP’ (Half-iZIP), which is reduced in complexity in comparison to the currently used iZIP (interleaved Z-sensitive Ionization and Phonon mediated) detectors, is studied in this thesis. The HiZIP detector design also serves to discriminate against background from multiple scatter events occurring close to the surfaces in a single detector. Studies carried out to compare the surface event leakage in the HiZIP detector using limited information from iZIP data taken at SuperCDMS test facility at UC Berkley produce a highly conservative upper limit of 5 out of 10,000 events at 90% confidence level. This upper limit is the best among many different HiZIP configurations that were investigated and is comparable to the upper limit calculated for an iZIP detector in the same way using the same data. A real HiZIP device operated at Queen’s Test Facility produced an exposure limited 90% upper limit of about 1 in 100 events for surface event leakage. The data used in these studies contain true nuclear recoil events from cosmogenic and ambient neutrons. This background was not subtracted in the calculation of the upper limits stated above and hence they are highly conservative.&#xd;
A surface event source was produced by depositing lead-210 from radon exposure onto a copper plate. This source was then used to take data for a surface event discrimination study of the HiZIP detector operated at Queen’s Test Facility.&#xd;
A study of the contribution of the noise from capacitive crosstalk between charge sensors in a HiZIP detector configuration was investigated, confirming the expectation that no significant drop in performance is to be expected due to this effect.</description>

   <description>Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes have been increasingly used in phase III randomized controlled trials to characterize the benefits or risks of a cancer treatment. HRQL outcomes from clinical trials can also inform clinical practice in oncology settings. Previous qualitative research suggests that oncologists value HRQL outcomes but challenges to their clinical application exist. Little quantitative research has been conducted to examine these barriers. This study describes the opinions of oncologists toward HRQL outcomes, the ways in which HRQL outcomes can be presented, and the importance of suggested reporting standards for HRQL outcomes in clinical trials. It further examines the association between attitudinal and demographic factors associated with the self-reported current use and achievable use of HRQL outcomes in clinical practice.&#xd;
Methods: This study is a cross-sectional survey of oncologists. A web-based questionnaire was disseminated in Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia/New Zealand. The study included oncologist members of the NCIC Clinical Trials Group, the NCRI Clinical Studies Groups, and the Australasian Cancer Clinical Trials Groups.  Respondents were asked to report their opinions toward HRQL outcomes and the factors associated with the use of these outcomes in clinical practice. Demographic characteristics were also collected. Chi-square tests were used to compare the proportion of responses between countries. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the use of HRQL outcomes in clinical practice. &#xd;
Results: A total of 344 oncologists completed the survey. Most oncologists (65.9%) reported having a good knowledge of HRQL outcomes and 72% perceived HRQL outcomes to be useful. High current use of HRQL outcomes in clinical practice was associated with more medical practice experience; perceiving HRQL outcomes to be useful; perceiving HRQL measurements to be reliable; and reporting lack of understanding to rarely be a barrier to using HRQL outcomes. High achievable use of HRQL outcomes in clinical practice was associated with being a male oncologist, perceiving HRQL outcomes to be useful, and being an investigator in RCTs. &#xd;
Conclusions: Important factors associated with the use of HRQL outcomes in clinical practice were identified, highlighting the need for future research and education.</description>

   <description>Composites of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with polypropylene (PP) and thermoplastic olefins (TPOs) were prepared by melt compounding. Two non-covalent functionalization methods were employed to improve nanotube dispersion and the resulting composite properties are reported. &#xd;
	The first functionalization approach involved partial coating of the surface of the nanotubes with a hyperbranched polyethylene (HBPE). MWCNT functionalization with HBPE was only moderately successful in breaking up the large aggregates that formed upon melt mixing with PP. In spite of the formation of large aggregates, the samples were conductive above a percolation threshold of 7.3 wt%. MWCNT functionalization did not disrupt the electrical conductivity of the nanotubes. The composite strength was improved with addition of nanotubes, but ductility was severely compromised because of the existence of aggregates. &#xd;
	The second method involved PP matrix functionalization with aromatic moieties capable of π-π interaction with MWCNT sidewalls. Various microscopy techniques revealed the addition of only 25 wt% of PP-g-pyridine (Py) to the neat PP was capable of drastically reducing nanotube aggregate size and amount. Raman spectroscopy confirmed improved polymer/nanotube interaction with the PP-g-Py matrix. Electrical percolation threshold was obtained at a MWCNT loading of approximately 1.2 wt%. Electrical conductivity on the order of 10-2 S/m was achieved, suggesting possible use in semi-conducting applications. Composite strength was improved upon addition of MWCNTs. The matrix functionalization with Py resulted in a significant improvement in composite ductility when filled with MWCNTs in comparison to its maleic anhydride (MA) counterpart. Preliminary investigations suggest that the use of alternating current (AC) electric fields may be effective in aligning nanotubes in PP to reduce the filler loading required for electrical percolation.&#xd;
	Composites containing MWCNT within PP/ethylene-octene copolymer (EOC) blends were prepared. Microscopy revealed that MWCNTs localized preferentially in the EOC phase. This was explained by the tendency of the system to minimize interfacial energy when the MWCNTs reside in the thermodynamically preferential phase. A kinetic approach, which involved pre-mixing the MWCNTs with PP and adding the EOC phase subsequently was attempted to monitor the migration of MWCNTs. MWCNTs began to migrate after two minutes of melt mixing with the EOC. The PP-g-Py matrix functionalization appears to slightly delay the migration. A reduction in electrical percolation threshold to 0.5 wt% MWCNTs was achieved with a co-continuous blend morphology, consisting of a 50/50 by weight ratio of PP and EOC.</description>

   <description>The majority of stroke survivors return to living in the community; however, muscle weakness and cardiovascular deconditioning can restrict mobility, limit community access and independence, particularly when challenging activities like stair negotiation are involved. A “step-by-step” (SBS) strategy (both feet per step) may be adopted in lieu of a “step-over-step” (SOS) method (one foot per step) to increase stability and off-load the paretic limb though the physical demands of the two methods are unknown. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the strength and energy demands of the two stair-stepping strategies in chronic stroke compared to healthy adults. The first study identified the relative strength and aerobic demands of both strategies. The results showed that the stroke group produced similar peak joint moments compared to controls, despite their slower cadence suggesting that the stroke group exerts comparable ‘effort’ to move more slowly. The SBS method was associated with lower strength costs (relative to individuals’ maximum strength output) than SOS, however aerobic cost was significantly higher. The second study identified the mechanical energy expenditures (MEEs) and transfers related to both strategies. The MEEs were found to be lower when the SBS strategy was used. Though expenditures were similar between groups, the stroke group had higher expenditures associated with the work of the less affected knee extensors (lead limb) during ascent and descent and controls exhibited higher expenditures for the plantarflexors during ascent. The reduced output of the trail (affected) limb plantarflexors likely resulted in the increased workload of the knee extensors. Overall, the aerobic cost per step was higher in stroke, particularly during descent, suggesting that in addition to reducing cadence, persons with stroke may be co-contracting to increase stabilization during descent, thus increasing oxygen demands. &#xd;
This thesis provides novel information on the physical demands associated with two methods of stair negotiation demonstrating that the SBS strategy might be better suited to persons with chronic stroke by minimizing the strength demands on the paretic side, but the benefit comes at an elevated aerobic cost. This information is valuable to rehabilitation professionals engaged in retraining mobility to facilitate community reintegration.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents new control approaches for improving the performance, stability, and efficiency of a single-phase grid-connected voltage source inverter (VSI) with an LCL filter that is used in renewable energy power conditioning applications. There are two main controllers that need to be designed: an external DC-bus voltage controller to balance the power flow coming into the VSI, and an internal current controller to control the current injected by the VSI into the utility grid. This thesis aims to find well-tailored control approaches for the aforementioned control loops.&#xd;
First, the stability and behavioral characteristics of the open-loop VSI with an LCL filter are explored using a Poincaré map, and the open-loop system is found to have marginal stability. A current control method is proposed, called composite nonlinear feedback (CNF), which offers significantly improved overall performance compared to the state-of-the-art proportional resonant (PR) controller with state feedback. &#xd;
To reduce the overall number of sensors in the system, two different observers are implemented to estimate the VSI state variables: (1) the Luenberger observer (LO), and (2) the sliding mode observer (SMO). &#xd;
To balance the system power flow, a new DC-bus voltage droop control method is proposed, that provides fast performance during transients. This control approach includes a novel discrete DC-bus voltage sensing technique, which effectively removes the double frequency ripple from the DC-bus voltage signal and prevents it from propagating into the current control loop. A variant on the DC-bus voltage droop control method, called adaptive droop control is proposed, which adaptively changes the droop gains in order to regulate the DC-bus voltage to a constant value. Finally, another variant on the DC-bus voltage droop control method is proposed, called optimized adaptive droop control, which adaptively changes the gains of the controller in order to minimize the overall system power losses. &#xd;
A stability analysis is conducted using the singular perturbation control theory, which allows a nonlinear dynamical system to be broken down into subsystems with different time scales. The results of the stability analysis confirm that the proposed closed-loop grid-connected VSI with an LCL filter is locally stable.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 14:02:55.865</description>
   <description>Einstein's field equations are extremely difficult to solve, and when solved, the solutions are even harder to understand. In this thesis, two analysis tools are developed to explore and visualize the curvature of spacetimes. The first tool is based on a thorough examination of observer independent curvature invariants constructed from different contractions of the Riemann curvature tensor. These invariants are analyzed through their gradient fields, and attention is given to the resulting flow and critical points. Furthermore, we propose a Newtonian analog to some general relativistic invariants based on the underlying physical meaning of these invariants, where they represent the cumulative tidal and frame-dragging effects of the spacetime. This provides us with a novel and intuitive tool to compare Newtonian gravitational fields to exact solutions of Einstein's field equations on equal footing. We analyze the obscure Curzon-Chazy solution using the new approach, and reveal rich structure that resembles the Newtonian gravitational field of a non-rotating ring, as it has been suspected for decades. Next, we examine the important Kerr solution, which describes the gravitational field of rotating black holes. We discover that the observable part of the geometry outside the black hole's event horizon depends significantly on its angular momentum. The fields representing the cumulative tidal and frame-dragging forces change qualitatively at seven specific values of the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole. The second tool we develop in this thesis is the accurate construction of the Penrose conformal diagrams. These diagrams are a valuable tool to explore the causal structure of spacetimes, where the entire spacetime is compactified to a finite size, and the coordinate choice is fixed such that light rays are straight lines on the diagram. However, for most spacetimes these diagrams can only be constructed as a qualitative guess, since their null geodesics cannot be solved.  We developed an algorithm to construct very accurate Penrose diagrams based on numeric solutions to the null geodesics, and applied it to the McVittie metric. These diagrams confirmed the long held suspicion that this spacetime does indeed describe a black hole embedded in an isotropic universe.</description>

   <description>Finite element models are used frequently in both engineering and scientific research. While they can provide useful information as to the performance of materials, as length scales are decreased more sophisticated model descriptions are required. It is also important to develop methods by which existing models may be verified against experimental findings. The present study evaluates the ability of various finite element models to predict materials behaviour at length scales ranging from several microns to tens of nanometers. Considering this motivation, this thesis is provided in manuscript form with the bulk of material coming from two case studies. Following an overview of relevant literature in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 considers the nucleation of delta-zirconium hydrides in a Zircaloy-2 matrix. Zirconium hydrides are an important topic in the nuclear industry as they form a brittle phase which leads to delayed hydride cracking during reactor start-up and shut-down. Several FE models are used to compare present results with literature findings and illustrate the weaknesses of standard FE approaches. It is shown that standard continuum techniques do not sufficiently capture the interfacial effects of an inclusion-matrix system. By using nano-scale material descriptions, nucleation lattice strains are obtained which are in good agreement with previous experimental studies. The motivation for Chapter 4 stems from a recognized need to develop a method for modeling corrosion behaviour of materials. Corrosion is also an issue for reactor design and an ability to predict failure points is needed. Finite element models could be used for this purpose, provided model accuracy is verified first. In Chapter 4 a technique is developed which facilitates the extraction of sub-micron resolution strain data from correlation images obtained during in-situ tensile deformation. By comparing image correlation results with a crystal plasticity finite element code it is found that good agreement between the two exists. The method outlined is material independent and could be applied to most metallurgical studies. Chapter 5 reviews the findings of each case study and makes suggestions as to the direction of future research.</description>

   <description>American Military Contractors and the Neoliberal Way of War explores the historical patterns of modern military contracting and its place in the political economy of American war. During the post-September 11 wars, contractors have played a prominent role, comprising over half the US total force. While the participation of contractors in major US contingency operations is not new, the scale and scope of contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan is without precedent. The study emerges from a puzzling historical development: during the Vietnam War, contractors constituted about 10 percent of the US footprint. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the figure climbs to 53 percent. What accounts for this change? The answer turns on one ideational and one institutional condition. Institutionally, the transition began with the US military’s shift from a mixed volunteer and draftee force to the All-Volunteer Force in 1973. Doing so removed personnel procurement from a statist framework through the introduction of the logic of the labour market. This institutional change was a necessary precondition for the gradual incursion of neoliberal market logic into military personnel policy. A series of reforms in subsequent decades initiated path dependent processes of military neoliberalization that eventually yielded the troop-contractor ratios of the post-September 11 wars. The dissertation develops a theoretical framework drawn from traditions in critical International Political Economy that conceptualizes five decades of uneven neoliberalization in the Department of Defense. Empirically, it undertakes a comparative study of US contracting practices during the Vietnam and post-September 11 wars, tracing gradual institutional change in the Department of Defense from the 1970s to the present.</description>

   <description>The current set of studies adds to the growing body of literature of self-perceptions in atypical populations. Previous research has demonstrated that, despite significant functional problems in multiple domains, children with ADHD unexpectedly provide overly-positive reports of their own competence in comparison to actual performance on objective measures. Study 1 empirically examined the self-perceptions of adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using performance on individual, specific, concrete tasks as the basis for participants’ ratings of competence. Participants completed a verbal and mathematic task and were asked how well they thought they did prior to completing the tasks (pre-prediction rating). After they completed each task they were asked how well they thought they did (current post-performance) and how well they thought they would do in the future (future post-performance). For the purpose of the study, self-perceptions can be described as the difference between perceived performance and actual performance. These difference scores were used in analyses.  Results suggested that adolescents with ADHD tend to have more positively-biased self-perceptions than typically developing (TD) adolescents. The current study also examined the role that IQ and executive functioning have on self-perceptions; however, no significant relationships were found. &#xd;
Using the same methodology, Study 2 examined the self-perceptions of adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). By examining a population with similar cognitive deficits as individuals with ADHD, the current study aimed to determine whether these positively-biased self-perceptions are specific to ADHD or if it is a phenomenon related to more general difficulties or dysfunction. Results suggested that adolescents with ASD also tended to have more positively-biased self-perceptions than TD adolescents. In adolescents with ASD, lower IQ and greater executive functioning deficits tended to be related to more positively-biased self-perceptions. Limitations of this research are discussed. Future investigation is needed to systematically examine other possible mechanisms that may be contributing to these biased self-perceptions.</description>

   <description>Two computational fluid dynamics models are developed to predict the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell stack, a detailed and a simplified model. In the detailed model, the three dimensional momentum, heat, and species transport equations are coupled with electrochemistry. In the simplified model, the diffusion terms in the transport equations are selectively replaced by rate terms within the core region of the stack. This allows much coarser meshes to be employed at a fraction of the computational cost.  Following the mathematical description of the problem, results for single-cell and multi-cell stacks are presented. Comparisons of local current density, temperature, and cell voltage indicate that good agreement is obtained between the detailed and simplified models, verifying the latter as a practical option in stack design. Then, the simplified model is used to determine the effects of utilization on the electrochemical performance and temperature distributions of a 10 cell stack. The results are presented in terms of fluid flow, pressure, species mass fraction, temperature, voltage and current density distributions. The effects of species and flow distributions on electrochemical performance and temperature are then analyzed for a 100 cell stack. The discussion highlights the importance of manifold design on performance and thermal management of large stacks.</description>

   <description>A numerical model was developed to evaluate the performance of detailed solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode microstructures obtained from experimental reconstruction techniques or generated from synthetic computational techniques. The model is also capable of identifying the linear triple phase boundary (TPB) reaction sites and evaluating the effective transport within the detailed structures, allowing a comparison between the structural properties and performance to be conducted. To simulate the cell performance, a novel numerical coupling technique was developed in OpenFOAM and validated. The computational grid type and mesh properties were also evaluated to establish appropriate mesh resolutions to employ when studying the performance. The performance of a baseline synthetic electrode structure was evaluated using the model and under the applied conditions it was observed that the ionic potential had the largest influence over the performance. &#xd;
&#xd;
The model was used in conjunction with a computational synthetic electrode manufacturing algorithm to conduct a numerical powder to power parametric study investigating the effects of the manufacturing properties on the performance. An improvement in the overall performance was observed in structures which maximized the number of reaction sites and had well established transport networks in the ion phase. From the manufacturing parameters studied a performance increase was observed in structures with low porosity and ionic solid volume fractions near the percolation threshold, and when the anodes were manufactured from small monosized particles or binary mixtures comprising of smaller oxygen ion conductive particles. Insight into the anode thickness was also provided and it was observed that the current distribution within the anode was a function of the applied overpotential and an increase in the overpotential resulted in the majority of the current production to increase and shift closer to the electrode-electrolyte interface.</description>

   <description>IEEE 802.11n Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) employ Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO), which significantly boosts the raw data rate at the Physical layer (PHY). But the potential of enhancing Medium Access Control (MAC) layer efficiencies by MIMO is still in its early stage and is the aim of the research in this thesis. Many existing works in this field mainly employ distributed MIMO spatial multiplexing/Multi-User Detection (MUD) technique and stream sharing to enable multiple simultaneous transmissions. Most works require synchronization among multiple transmissions, split the channel, and aim for single-hop networks. In this thesis, a novel Hybrid Carrier Sense (HCS) framework is proposed, mainly at the MAC layer to exploit the power of MIMO. HCS senses the channel availability jointly by the virtual carrier sense and physical carrier sense. HCS does not require synchronization among nodes; each node independently and locally determines when to start its transmission. HCS not only shares the channel, but also exploits the bi-directional handshakes of the wireless transmissions and increases the number of simultaneous stream transmissions. For a network with M antennas in each node, HCS can accommodate 2x(M-1) streams instead of M streams achieved by all other existing works. Moreover, HCS is aimed for multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks, in which the hidden terminal, exposed terminal, and deafness problems greatly degrade network performance. The HCS framework incorporates solutions to these problems. HCS is implemented in an NS2 network simulator and the performance evaluation shows that HCS significantly outperforms MIMO-enabled IEEE 802.11 (in which MIMO is only used for enhancing the raw data rate in the physical layer), resulting in higher aggregate throughput, packet delivery ratio and fairness in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks. The HCS framework will be in wide use in the future generation of wireless networks and opens up more research possibilities. Some ideas in the HCS framework can be applied not only for MIMO, but also for many other techniques surveyed in this thesis; or we may combine them with HCS to further boost the network performance.</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a global disease with a disproportionate burden among low- and middle-income countries. In Tanzania, cervical cancer is the most common female cancer and a prophylactic vaccine offering protection against four human papillomavirus (HPV) strains is a promising prevention method. The targeted age and sex, as well as the sexually transmitted nature and novelty of the vaccine, support the need for formative research on the knowledge, attitudes, and barriers toward vaccination. &#xd;
OBJECTIVES: The first objective of this thesis was to systematically review studies of HPV vaccine acceptability among African countries. The second and third objectives were to describe and determine the socio-demographic factors and HPV-related knowledge and attitudes associated with HPV vaccination and to identify the barriers to vaccination among a population-based sample of rural and urban women in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. &#xd;
&#xd;
METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed by searching electronic databases, and a data abstraction form structured by the Health Belief Model was used to collect data and synthesize findings. For objectives 2 and 3, a cross-sectional study was conducted among rural (n=303) and urban (n=272) women aged 18-55. Differences in socio-demographic factors, knowledge, attitudes, and barriers were compared between groups, and multivariable models were used to identify associations among rural and urban women separately.&#xd;
&#xd;
RESULTS: Reviewed literature suggested that HPV vaccine-related knowledge was low, however predicted acceptance of the vaccine was high. Research on this topic was largely composed of cross-sectional studies in urban areas. Among rural women in the Kilimanjaro Region, independent associations with acceptance included variables related to cost, knowledge, access, and educational attainment. Among urban women, independent associations were related to social networks/norms and educational attainment. The most frequent perceived barriers to vaccination were cost, side effects, and safety. &#xd;
&#xd;
CONCLUSION: Educational programs on the HPV vaccine and cervical cancer are needed in Tanzania and in other areas of Africa. This research suggests that vaccine campaigns in the Kilimanjaro Region should focus on emphasizing financial and physical accessibility, peer acceptance, and safety, in addition to highlighting endorsement of the vaccine by healthcare providers and the government.</description>

   <description>Mean shift (MS) and subspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) algorithms are non-parametric, iterative methods to find a representation of a high dimensional data set on a  principal curve or surface embedded in a high dimensional space. The representation of high dimensional data on a principal curve or surface, the class of mean shift type algorithms and their properties, and applications of these algorithms are the main focus of this dissertation. Although MS and SCMS algorithms have been used in many applications, a rigorous study of their convergence is still missing. This dissertation aims to fill some of the gaps between theory and practice by investigating some convergence properties of these algorithms. In particular, we propose a sufficient condition for a kernel density estimate with a Gaussian kernel to have isolated stationary points to guarantee the convergence of the MS algorithm. We also show that the SCMS algorithm inherits some of the important convergence properties of the MS algorithm. In particular, the monotonicity and  convergence of the density estimate values along the sequence of output values of the algorithm are shown. We also show  that the distance between consecutive points of the output sequence converges to zero, as does the projection of the gradient vector onto the subspace spanned by the D-d eigenvectors corresponding to the D-d largest eigenvalues of the local inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, three new variations of the SCMS algorithm are proposed and the running times and performance of the resulting algorithms are  compared with original SCMS algorithm. We also propose an adaptive version of the SCMS algorithm to consider the effect of new incoming samples without running the algorithm on the whole data set. As well, we develop some new potential applications of the MS and SCMS algorithm. These applications involve finding straight lines in digital images; pre-processing data before applying locally linear embedding (LLE) and ISOMAP for dimensionality reduction; noisy source vector quantization where the clean data need to be estimated before the quanization step; improving the performance of kernel regression in certain situations; and skeletonization of digitally stored handwritten characters.</description>

   <title>Reducing Haul Truck Fuel Consumption in Open Pit Mines by Strategic Changes to the Haulage Cycle</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 19:22:29.328</description>
   <description>The goals of minimizing emissions and lowering operating costs by monitoring and controlling fuel efficiency have been a growing concern in the mining and construction industries. The largest single contributor of energy consumption in an open pit mining operation is haul trucks. At Goldstrike Mine, haul trucks accounted for approximately 67% of fuel used in 2010. By examining haul trucks in their operating environment, strategic changes in critical parts of the truck cycles can result in fuel savings. This project was a subproject of the Mine Traffic Optimization (MTO) project and is funded by MITACS and Barrick Gold Corporation. One objective of the MTO project was to examine how mine traffic affects fuel efficiency. &#xd;
&#xd;
Certain components of the haulage profile result in inefficient use of fuel, which results in increased operating costs and a larger environmental footprint. Monitoring the trucks in real time allows for the examination of various ways to modify truck’s behaviours in order to improve fuel efficiency. One critical component of the haulage cycle is intersections. An analysis was performed to gain a better understanding of efficient intersection layouts and travel speeds. Cycle time analysis was conducted to ensure that alterations to the haulage cycle would result in minimal impact to the overall productivity of the mine. Modifications to operating practices and simple coding changes to the dispatching program suggest possibilities for potential fuel savings, reduced mechanical degradation, and improved operation efficiency.</description>

   <description>Zirconium and its alloys are used extensively in the nuclear industry. In the Canadian Deuterium Uranium reactor, the primary containment in the primary coolant system is composed of Zr-2.5wt%Nb in the form of a pressure tube. The permissible chemical composition of Zr-2.5wt%Nb for use in the pressure tube in nuclear reactors is dictated by ASTMB353. Oxygen and iron are the highest content controlled elements in the standard alloy, after zirconium and niobium. Oxygen is an alpha-stabilizer, and diffuses preferentially to the alpha phase, leading to a well established increase in the yield strength of the alpha phase. Iron is a beta-stabilizer, and is concentrated in the beta phase, as well as near alpha-beta grain boundaries. While the mechanical properties of standard Zr-2.5wt%Nb alloy are well understood, there is a dearth of knowledge on the individual effect of these alloying additions, especially at non-standard concentrations. Additionally, the experimental evidence that does exist does not directly take into account the two-phase nature of the alloy, or the effect of impurities on specific deformation modes. Notably absent is experimental evidence on the effect of interstitial impurities on twinning in the hexagonal close-packed alpha phase. This work seeks to complement the present understanding of these phenomena.  Mechanical tests have been performed on three specially prepared Zr-2.5wt%Nb alloys to clarify the contributions of oxygen and iron to Zr-2.5wt%Nb deformation properties. Traditional mechanical measurements were complemented by in situ and ex situ diffraction measurements. Tests were performed at a range of temperatures (77K - 673K) and strain rates (quasi-static to 10^-2/s). Increasing oxygen content from 1176wppm to 3300wppm increases the macroscopic yield stress at room temperature, and results in a transition in work hardening behaviour at low strain rates. Increasing iron content from 547wppm to 1080wppm has no effect on the macroscopic yield stress, but increases the work hardening rate at room temperature.</description>

   <description>The results of a study of the neutral hydrogen (HI) content and distribution within a sample of 18 blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) are presented.  An investigation of the behaviour of the gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) as a function of metallicity (Z) is also presented.  Observations of these BCDs was performed using the Very Large Array (VLA) in 2009, a year in which the array was undergoing a technological upgrade to the the Karl G. Jansky VLA (JVLA).  The observations were reduced and images processed using the Astronomical Image Processing Software (AIPS), and data cubes for each galaxy were produced.&#xd;
	&#xd;
The results include detections of eleven HI lines (two new detections) and ten background continuum sources (two new discoveries).  All detections are at a higher resolution and/or sensitivity than previous measurements.  These detections spanned a large range of line widths and HI masses; some masses comparable to those in normal galaxies.&#xd;
	&#xd;
Of particular interest was the discovery of a compact absorption feature in the dwarf galaxy Haro 11.  A paper submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS) Letters on this discovery is presented.  Another significant result was the discovery of a highly extended and massive HI region in the dwarf galaxy CGCG 297-017.&#xd;
	&#xd;
For those galaxies with no detected HI line or radio continuum, an upper limit to the flux density was computed, which was used to derive upper limits to the HI mass or star-formation rate (SFR) respectively.  Three HI flux density upper limits are new results, and seven continuum flux density upper limits are also new.&#xd;
	&#xd;
The GDR-Z relation at low metallicities shows a potential power law or broken power law relation with a turning point at Z=7.96 or Z=8.05.  To within error, these turning points and power law indices of the broken power law fits are consistent with other work.</description>

   <description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and erectile dysfunction (ED) have common etiologies, such as increased adiposity and chronic diseases. Incident ED is known to be a sentinel of CVD, providing a unique opportunity for early lifestyle interventions to attenuate the progression of disease. The internal pudendal artery (IPA) plays an important role in controlling resistance to penile blood flow and thereby erections. Although morphological and functional disturbances in the IPA have been associated with ED, few studies have characterized changes in the IPA as it relates to increased adiposity and chronic diseases (e.g., chronic kidney disease [CKD]). Finally, although both vascular calcification and ED have been shown to be prevalent in patients with CKD, there has yet to be an assessment of associated mechanisms.&#xd;
	The effect of lifestyle modifications on erectile function was evaluated in both experimental and clinical settings. Specifically, the studies assessed the effect of caloric restriction (CR) in rats and of chronic exercise in sedentary, overweight or obese male and female subjects. In rats, structural and functional changes of the IPA and erectile responses were characterized in relation to increasing adiposity and to CKD. Experimentally, the susceptibility of various vascular beds to calcification in CKD was determined. Clinically, erectile and female sexual function was assessed in patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD, who had no history of CVD. &#xd;
	 In rats, CR blunted the accumulation of abdominal adiposity, and attenuated progression of both endothelial dysfunction and ED, independently of morphological changes in the IPA. Rats with CKD had an increased frequency of ED, greater endothelial dysfunction, and altered vascular morphology, yet vascular calcification per se did not account for ED. &#xd;
	In the clinical study, sedentary and overweight or obese males with ED, but not females, had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Chronic exercise significantly improved ED and female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Clinically, CKD was associated with ED and FSD as well as increased coronary artery calcification and endothelial dysfunction.&#xd;
	These findings support the concept that early detection of cardiovascular abnormalities, using incident ED as a sentinel, should facilitate early interventions in otherwise asymptomatic populations.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we review and build on the common methods used to analyze null geodesics in Schwarzschild de Sitter space. We present a general technique which allows ﬁnding measurable intersection angles of null trajectories analytically, and as one of its applications we establish a general relativistic aberration relationship. The tools presented are used to analyze some standard setups of gravitational deﬂection of light and gain a clear understanding of the role that the cosmological constant, Λ, plays in gravitational lensing phenomena. Through reviewing some recent papers on the topic with the present results in mind, we attempt to explain the major sources of disagreement in the ongoing debate on the subject, which started with Rindler and Ishak’s original paper, regarding the inﬂuence of Λ on lensing phenomena. To avoid ambiguities and room for misunderstanding we present clear deﬁnitions of the quantities used in the present analysis as well as in other papers we discuss.</description>

   <description>MRI-guided percutaneous needle-based surgery has become part of routine clinical practice. There are millions of these procedures performed in Canada. The conventional MRI-guided needle intervention is usually performed with the primary goal of navigating a needle to a target while sparing healthy and/or critical structures. Potential limitations of conventional unassisted free-hand needle placement include the physician's ability to align and maintain the correct trajectory and angle toward a target, especially in case of deep targets. In contemporary practice, images are displayed on the operator's 2D console only outside the treatment room, where the physician plans the intervention. Then the physician enters the room, mentally registers the images with the anatomy of the actual patient, and uses hand-eye coordination to execute the planned intervention. Previous concept has been shown and preliminary results discussed from demonstrated MRI-guided needle intervention using an augmented reality 2D image overlay system in a closed configuration 1.5T MRI scanner. However, the limited availability of interventional MR imaging systems and the length of time of MR-guided interventions have been limiting factors in the past.&#xd;
This dissertation addresses topics related to evaluating and developing the 2D augmented reality system, the assistance device for MRI-guided needle interventions. This research effort has primarily focused on developing a new adjustable 2D MR image overlay system and validating the previous 2D image overlay system in the clinical environment. The adjustable system requirement is to overcome the oblique insertions, difficulties inherent to MR-guided procedures, and to promise safe and reliable needle placement inside closed high-field MRI scanners. This thesis describes development of the image overlay system including requirements, mechanism design and evaluation of MR compatibility. Additionally, a standalone realization of an MR image overlay system, named “The Perk Station” was developed, implemented and evaluated. The system was deployed in the laboratory as a training/teaching tool with non-bio-hazardous specimens. This laboratory version of the system allows for evaluation of trial interventions. The system also supports recording of the complete intervention trajectory for operator performance, technical efficacy, and accuracy studies of insertion techniques.</description>

   <description>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that use tiny wireless devices capable of communicating, processing, and sensing promise to have applications in virtually all fields. Smart homes and smart cities are just few of the examples that WSNs can enable. Despite their potential, WSNs suffer from reliability and energy limitations.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this study, we address the problem of designing Distributed Data Storage Systems (DDSSs) for WSNs using decentralized erasure codes. A unique aspect of WSNs is that their data is inherently decentralized. This calls for a decentralized mechanism for encoding and decoding. We propose a distributed data storage framework to increase data survivability in WSNs. The framework utilizes Decentralized Erasure Codes for Data Survivability (DEC-DS) which allow for determining the amount of redundancy required in both hardware and data to allow sensed data to survive failures in the network.&#xd;
&#xd;
To address the energy limitations, we show two approaches to implement the proposed solution in an energy efficient manner. The two approaches employ Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to exploit coding opportunities in order to save energy and in turn prolong network life. A routing based scheme, called DEC Encode-and-Forward (DEC-EaF), applies to networks with routing capability, while the second, DEC Encode-and-Disseminate (DEC-EaD), uses a variation of random walk to build the target code in a decentralized fashion. We also introduce a new decentralized approach to implement Luby Transform (LT)-Codes based DDSSs. The scheme is called Decentralized Robust Soliton Storage (DRSS) and it operates in a decentralized fashion and requires no coordination between sensor nodes.&#xd;
&#xd;
The schemes are tested through extensive simulations to evaluate their performance. We also compare the proposed schemes to similar schemes in the literature. The comparison considers energy efficiency as well as coding related aspects. Using the proposed schemes can greatly improve the reliability of WSNs especially under harsh working conditions.</description>

   <description>It has been proposed that the in utero environment along with the genetic susceptibility for atopy might influence the risk of allergic disorders in infants. Two key features that are most related with allergic disease are eosinophilia and a heightened T helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokine profile. The differentiation and accumulation of eosinophils and their progenitors are associated with the pathogenesis of these disorders. Eosinophils arise from CD34+ progenitors in the bone marrow and peripheral tissues. Two important molecules related to eosinophilopoiesis are GATA1 and major basic protein (MBP). GATA1 is an essential eosinophil transcription factor and MBP is a cataionic protein found in the granule of mature eosinophils. MBP is coded by the PRG2 gene. The time course of eosinophilopoiesis upon IL-5 stimulation in umbilical cord blood CD34+ progenitor cells from infants with and without risk of atopy has not yet been adequately examined. Additionally, knowledge of the potential differences in cytokine profiles during eosinophilopoiesis between children at high and low atopic risk is lacking.  This thesis studied cord blood non-adherent mononuclear cells (NAMNCs) as surrogates of the CD34+ progenitor population in order to examine various predictive biomarkers of future allergic disease. First, differences in gene expression patterns of GATA1 and PRG2 during IL-5 induced eosinophilopoiesis were established. In addition, cell population changes were determined. Specifically, the percentage of CD34+, IL-5Rα+, CD4+ and CCR3+ cells were measured through flow cytometry in NAMNCs following IL-5 stimulation for 72 hours. Finally, cytokine profiles of the NAMNC supernatants were determined.  This study found no significant differences in the patterns of gene expression of GATA1 and PRG2 as well as cell population changes in NAMNCs from infants born to atopic versus non atopic mothers. Levels of IL-2,IL-4,IL-6,IL-7,IL-8,IL-10,IL-12,GM-CSF,TNF-α and IFN-γ were significantly up-regulated over time but only the levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ at 48 and 72 hours were significantly different between the atopic and non-atopic samples. &#xd;
 &#xd;
This research describes features of progenitor cell differentiation and cytokine profiles that could be used as putative biomarkers of atopy as early as birth.</description>

   <title>The control of speech motor targets</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 22:44:48.165</description>
   <description>Studies of speech production and its control have traditionally focused on acoustic parameters and/or articulatory configurations of the end result of the production process as the target of speech production. The representations of production target, however, are far richer than the stereotypical acoustic/articulatory features that have been identified from those traditional studies. Speech production is a process through which mental representations of a language are transformed into vocal tract movements and sounds as physical entities. Thus, the speech production target includes these complete representations, and in order to fully understand how the target is controlled, we need to perturb the production process. This paradigm allows us to see how the production system as a whole corrects behavior in response to the perturbation. By systematically introducing perturbation, it is possible to examine what is needed for the system to detect an error, and how such an error is reduced. This, in turn, enables us to have a better understanding of what the speech production target is and how it is defined. A series of experiments were carried out to examine this issue in this thesis, using a real-time auditory perturbation paradigm. This paradigm perturbs the auditory feedback speakers receive while they are producing a speech segment. In response to the perturbation, subjects spontaneously change their articulation to compensate. The results showed that 1) the speech production target is not a list of independently controlled acoustic features but is a multi-dimensionally defined category that is language dependent 2) spectral and temporal aspects of speech motor control show the same results 3) similar compensation behavior is observed even with using an unfamiliar tool to produce a vowel-like sounds, and 4) an intention to produce a speech category may be manifested in ways that are different than behavior in other motor control studies such as reaching.</description>

   <title>Characterization of Filling Materials for Easel Paintings</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Art Conservation) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 23:24:52.475</description>
   <description>Developing appropriate treatments for easel paintings can be complex, as many works are composed of various materials that respond in different ways. When selecting a filling material for these artworks, several properties are investigated including: the need for the infill to react to environmental conditions in a similar manner as the original material; the need for the infill to have good handling properties, adhesion to the original support, and cohesion within the filling material; the ability for the infill to withstand the stress of the surrounding material and; be as flexible as the original material to not cause further damage. Also, changes in colour or mechanical properties should not occur as part of the ageing process. Studies are needed on acrylic-based materials used as infills in conservation treatments.&#xd;
&#xd;
This research examines some of the chemical, physical, and optical changes of eleven filling materials before and after ageing, with the aim to evaluate the overall appropriateness of these materials as infills for easel paintings. The materials examined were three rabbit skin glue (RSG) gessoes, and seven commercially prepared acrylic materials, all easily acquired in North America. Chemical analysis was carried out with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Overall the compositions of the various materials examined were found to be in agreement with the available literature and previous research. This study also examined characteristics of these materials not described in previous works and, additionally, presented the compositions and behaviour of several commonly used materials with little literature description. After application of an ageing regimen, most naturally aged and artificially aged samples displayed small changes in gloss, colour, thickness, and diffusive behaviour; however, to evaluate these materials fully mechanical testing and environmental studies should be carried out.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 23:32:48.575</description>
   <description>We conduct a broad investigation about stellar mass and population diagnostics in order to formulate novel constraints related to the formation and evolution of galaxies from a nearby cluster environment.  Our work is powered by the use of stellar population models which transform galaxy colours and/or absorption line strengths into estimates of its stellar properties.  As input to such models, we assemble an extensive compilation of age and chemical abundance information for Galactic globular clusters.  This compilation allows a confident expansion of these models into new regions of parameter space that promise to refine our knowledge of galactic chemical evolution.&#xd;
&#xd;
We then draw upon a state-of-the-art spectroscopic and photometric survey of the Virgo galaxy cluster in order to constrain spatial variations of the stellar ages, metallicities, and masses within its member galaxies, and their dynamical masses.  We interpret these data in the context of the histories of star formation, chemical enrichment, and stellar mass assembly to formulate a broad picture of the build-up of this cluster’s content over time.  In it, the giant early-type galaxies formed through highly dissipational processes at early times that built up most of their stellar mass and drew significant amounts of dark matter within their optical radii.  Conversely, dwarf early-types experienced environmental processes that quenched their star formation during either the early stages of cluster assembly or upon infall at later times.  Somewhat perplexing is our finding that the internal dynamics of these galaxies are largely explained by their stellar masses.  Lastly, Virgo spirals also suffer from their dense environment, through ram pressure stripping and/or tidal harrassment.  In addition to quenching, these effects leave an imprint on their internal dynamical evolution too.  Late-type spirals exhibit evidence of having ejected significant amounts of baryons from their inner regions, likely via energetic feedback events.&#xd;
&#xd;
Rich as our picture of the history of the Virgo cluster has become, real progress in our understanding of this system will truly benefit from future high-resolution cosmological and hydrodynamic simulations of this environment.  Such simulations are still in their infancy, but the data assembled here should soon provide their most direct validation.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study is to explore what teacher candidates (n=156) believe will be their primary assessment purposes, summative assessment practices, and assessment formats in their classrooms, their values and beliefs surrounding assessment, and what contextual factors influence teacher candidates’ assessment beliefs and practices. The results are placed in the context of previous research into the assessment practice of teachers and compared to the recommended assessment practices identified in research and what the Ministry of Education of Ontario expects its teachers to do through its assessment document, Growing Success (O.M.E., 2010). The survey instrument used in the study was composed of questions original to this research in combination with a revised version of the instrument used by McMillan (2001) and Duncan and Noonan (2007). Teacher candidates were divided into different groups based on their grade level, academic level, subject area, and B. Ed program (concurrent, or consecutive). Descriptive statistics were generated for each question by group and overall. &#xd;
A Principal Components Analysis was used to reduce the 35 items in the summative assessment practices section into 5 scales for ease of interpretation. Inferential statistics (paired samples t-tests, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between groups. The results of my research indicate that the teacher candidates report having values and beliefs supportive of the orientation towards assessments reported in the research literature and Growing Success (O.M.E., 2010). Teacher candidates’ responses regarding purpose and format were also in alignment with practices supported in the research literature and Growing Success (O.M.E., 2010). In contrast, teacher candidates’ uses of non-academic criteria in making assessment decisions were not in line with recommendations found in the research literature and Growing Success (O.M.E., 2010). Only two statistically significant differences were noted between groups: Grades 7 and 8 teacher candidates reported using constructed response items more frequently than Grades 11 and 12 teacher candidates in their summative assessment practices; and concurrent education program teacher candidates reported their coursework as being less of an influence on their future practice than their consecutive education program peers.</description>

   <description>Solid oxide fuel cells represent a potentially important application for ceramic materials. There are, however, some significant issues which can affect the reliability and durability of the cell. &#xd;
Mechanical failure owing to stress is one of the critical factors which can affect the stability and working life of the fuel cell stacks. These stresses generate in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) owing to mechanical forces and change in temperature during fabrication, assembly and operating conditions. There can be chances of cell delamination and micro-cracks in cell electrodes if these stresses are too high. The elastic properties and thermal expansion coefficient play a vital role to improve cell stability and performance. These properties depend on the types of materials and geometries of the composites. In this research, a numerical framework to predict the effective elastic properties and the effective thermal expansion coefficient for porous Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) electrode microstructures in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell is presented. The electrodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells are discretized as porous microstructures that are formed by randomly distributed and overlapping spheres with particle size distributions that match those of actual ceramic powder. Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures of YSZ-pore are formed with a porosity ranging from 25% to 40%. The technique involves the construction of the YSZ-pores microstructures based on measurable starting parameters and subsequent numerical prediction of effective elastic properties and effective thermal expansion coefficient. Three domain sizes are considered for the generation of YSZ-pore microstructures. The method of prediction of effective Young’s modulus (Eeff), effective Poisson’s ratio , effective bulk modulus  effective shear modulus , and effective thermal expansion coefficients  for various porosities (P) of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) electrode material in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells is based on the Finite Volume analysis which in turn is based on the solution of the linear elastic stress analysis problem. The predicted results are compared with some theoretical correlations of two-phase composites for effective elastic properties and effective thermal expansion coefficient. It has been found that predicted results are falling inside of the upper and lower bounds.</description>

   <description>Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms along with cognitive symptoms that include impairment in working memory (WM). WM is the storage of relevant information for short intervals of time to guide thoughts and actions. The neural correlate of WM is thought to be the persistent activity exhibited during the retention interval of WM tasks. Persistent activity is hypothesized to be mediated by the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) within recurrent neuronal circuits.&#xd;
	Consistent with this hypothesis, studies with healthy humans and monkeys have shown that the administration of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine induces memory-load dependent deficits in WM, along with increasing response time. In parallel to this, the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been hypothesized to rest on the hypofunction of NMDAR. Previous studies in humans indicate that blockade of NMDAR induces schizophrenia-like symptoms. In addition, symptoms of schizophrenia patients are alleviated with sub-chronic treatments focusing on the activation of the NMDAR co-agonist site. Based on these observations, I tested the hypothesis that increasing the activation of NMDAR with co-agonist stimulation has beneficial effects on WM. D-serine (100mg/kg/day-6 weeks) was orally administered to two female macaque monkeys performing a visual sequential comparison task (VCST), which allows the manipulation of memory load. In this task, the monkeys had to identify the location of a colour change within an array of 2 to 5 coloured stimuli following a retention interval of 1 second. I hypothesized that sub-chronic treatment with D-serine produces a gradual improvement in the monkeys’ performance on the VSCT. Specifically, I predicted that the improvement would scale with memory load due to increased demands on WM resources at higher loads.&#xd;
	Contrary to my hypothesis, D-serine produced minute changes in response accuracy, which were not memory load-dependent. Also, the response latency of the monkeys was found to increase, which is commonly observed following NMDAR antagonist treatments. These findings suggest that D-serine has a limited role in increasing the activation of NMDARs to improve WM per se. The beneficial effects reported by NMDAR co-agonists in schizophrenic patients could be a general reduction in cognitive symptoms, not specifically related to WM.</description>

   <subject>International Minority Protection</subject>
   <subject>Article 27 of the ICCPR</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Law) -- Queen's University, 2013-10-01 18:37:15.416</description>
   <description>Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a legally binding and justiciable minority protection provision.  It stipulates, “In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own lan-guage.”  Perhaps due to its negative, weak and qualified terminology, too many legal scholars display a dismissive attitude toward this article suggesting that they deem it to be an inadequate measure of minority protection.  This thesis seeks to address the question of whether article 27 is simply another inadequate measure or an underappreciated resource through analyses of four key questions: (i) the scope question, (ii) the definitional ques¬tion, (iii) the right-bearer question, and, (iv) the obligation question.  Article 27’s cautious terminology has produced much confusion and controversy, but the United Nations Human Rights Com¬mittee’s practice has helped clarify many significant points of contention.  Despite contesta¬tions to the contrary by many States parties, article 27 has a universal scope and applicability with only two minor, but significant, exceptions.  The right-holder is a person belonging to a non-majority ethnic, national, indigenous, racial, religious or linguistic community, and she bears and exercises the rights protected by article 27 as an individual, even though she has a right to exercise them in concert with other members of her community.  States parties are obligated to ensure that persons belonging to minority communities have these rights.  Hence, I suggest that article 27 should be interpreted according to the following formulation:&#xd;
States parties have negative, and possibly also positive, obligations to ensure that persons belonging to non-majority ethnic, national, indigenous, racial, religious or linguistic communities have individual rights to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, and to use their own language, including also the right to exercise these rights in concert with other members of their community.</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: The nonmedical use of prescription medications among young people has escalated substantially in recent years. Certain subgroups of adolescents are at greater risk than others, including rural youth, however this has yet to be adequately quantified in Canada, and risk and protective factors in rural communities remain understudied. &#xd;
OBJECTIVES: The first objective of this thesis was to characterize the nonmedical use of prescription drugs in Canadian youth by age, gender, socioeconomic, immigrant and geographic statuses. The second objective was to examine time-use patterns among rural young people as they may relate to their risk of using prescription drugs recreationally. &#xd;
METHODS: Data were obtained from 10,429 youth in grades 9 and 10 across Canada who participated in the 2009/2010 Cycle of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey. Participants documented information about their nonmedical use of opioid pain relievers, stimulants and sedative or tranquilizer medications in the past year. Cross-tabulations and multi-level regression analyses were used to determine proportions and estimate risk by demographic subgroups, and among 2393 rural youth, to examine associations with time-use patterns&#xd;
RESULTS: Females were 1.25 times more likely to report recreational use of pain relievers (95% CI: 1.04-1.51). Lower SES students were 2.41 times more likely to report recreational use of any type of medication (95% CI: 1.94-2.99). Pain reliever use was highest among rural youth living in close proximity to urban centres. Frequent peer time after school and in the evenings was associated with a 1.73 (95% CI: 1.10-2.73) and 2.16 times (95% CI: 1.30-3.60) increased risk of using prescription drugs recreationally, however associations were attenuated when adjusted for other risk factors. Non-participation in extracurricular activities was associated with a 50% increase in risk for nonmedical use of prescription drugs, even when adjusted for other risk factors. &#xd;
CONCLUSIONS: Females, those of low SES and some rural youth, especially those who do not participate in extracurricular activities, are at increased risk for using prescription drugs recreationally. Results from this thesis point to priority areas for public health and education in reducing harms associated with nonmedical use of prescription drugs.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, three broadband low-noise mixing circuits which use CMOS 130 nm technology are presented. As one of the first few stages in a receiving front-end, stringent requirements are posted on mixer performance. The Gilbert cell mixers have presented excellent properties and achieved wide applications. However, the noise of a conventional active Gilbert cell mixer is high. This thesis demonstrates both passive and active mixing circuits with improved noise performance while maintaining the advantages of the Gilbert cell-based mixing core. Furthermore, wide bandwidth and variable gain are implemented, making the designed mixers multi-functional, yet with compact sizes and low power consumptions. &#xd;
&#xd;
The first circuit is a passive 2x subharmonic mixer that works from 4.5 GHz to 8.5 GHz. The subharmonic mixing core is a two-stage passive Gilbert cell driven by a quadrature LO signal. Together with a noise-cancelling transconductor and an inverter-based TIA, this subharmonic mixer possesses an excellent broadband conversion gain and a low noise figure. Measurement results show a high conversion gain of 16 dB and a low average DSB NF of 9 dB. &#xd;
&#xd;
The second design is a broadband low-noise variable gain mixer which operates between 1 and 6 GHz. The transconductor stage is implemented with noise cancellation and current bleeding techniques. Series inductive peaking is used to extend the bandwidth. Gain variation is achieved by a current-steering IF stage. Measurements show a wide gain control range of 13 dB and a low noise performance over the entire frequency and gain range. The lowest DSB NF is 3.8 dB and the highest DSB NF is 14.2 dB.&#xd;
&#xd;
The Third design is a broadband low-noise mixer with linear-in-dB gain control scheme. Using the same transconductance stage with the second circuit, this design also works from 1 to 6 GHz. A 10 dB linear-in-dB gain control range is achieved using an R-r load network with a linear-in-dB error less than $\pm$ 0.5 dB. Low noise performance is achieved. For different frequencies and conversion gains, the lowest DSB NF is 3.8 dB and the highest DSB NF is 12 dB.</description>

   <description>Working memory is the ability to store relevant information temporarily to guide thoughts and behavior. As a basic executive function that is required for everyday tasks, it is essential to understand working memory to fully understand cognition. A neural correlate of working memory has been suggested in the persistent activity displayed by single neurons during the retention interval of working memory tasks performed by monkeys. Physiological and computational studies have proposed that the maintenance of this activity depends on NMDA receptor activation. Human homologues of persistent activity have been suggested using neuroimaging methods and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. To help bridge the gap between these studies within and between species, EEG signals in the form of event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while one female rhesus macaque monkey (Macaca mulatta) performed a series of tasks that involve visual working memory, in which a visual array presented for 500 ms must be maintained in working memory for a retention interval of 1 s to guide a subsequent saccade to a stimulus. In addition, the effect of NMDA blockade on ERPs was investigated by administering a sub-anesthetic dose of the NMDA antagonist ketamine. A neural correlate of visual working memory was identified in the ERP that was contralaterally-specific to the to-be-remembered target during the retention interval of the tasks. For the first time in the monkey, it was shown that the amplitude and polarity of this activity reflects the spatial location of the target stimulus, scales with the number of items that had to be remembered, and is predictive of trial outcome. The activity was less positive for contralaterally presented stimuli, greater memory loads, and correct trials. Furthermore, this contralateral activity was modulated by ketamine, primarily during the retention interval but also during memory item presentation at P100 and P300. Taken together, these properties support this contralateral activity as a candidate for an electrophysiological index of working memory that is similar to that of humans. These findings also provide a link to the single-neuron mechanisms of working memory in monkeys and further validate the monkey as a model of human visual working memory.</description>

   <description>This project report is a design of an online security investigation from the perspective of professors and students, to provide information to higher educational institutions that would help them prepare professors and students to work securely online. Therefore the project has the secondary purpose of creating a safer online learning environment for students and professors.&#xd;
Post-secondary educational institutions are responding increasingly to demands for online distance education, demands fuelled by the exponential growth of the Internet and associated information and communications technology (ICT) (Fan, 2011; Homeland Security Digital Library (HSDL), 2009; Kingkade, 2013; Rudestam &amp; Shoenholtz-Read, 2010). As institutions increase their dependence on the Internet to deliver courses to students online, they encounter rapid growth in malicious online activity, which happens literally everyday (European Commission, 2013; Johnson, 2005; Orrey, 2010; Shaeffer, 2009). Literature on the security of online education has acknowledged this fact (Adams &amp; Bradford, 2003), but offers little guidance for protection.&#xd;
Every online education stakeholder has responsibility to ensure safety online. Administrators depend on ICT professionals to meet most of their security needs, but professors and students also have responsibility for security and may need guidance and support. The results of inadequate security can be catastrophic, leading to loss of trust and revenue (European Commission, 2013; Kovacs, Markam &amp; Sweeting, 2004; Kennedy, 2011). E-Learning demands change in curriculum and in attitudes from the traditional educational system to the new online distance education (Zhang &amp; Nunamaker, 2003). Professors and students need to be protected online; they also need to feel free to choose computer programs and applications that facilitate online learning. Balance is required in addressing the needs of professors and students versus those of the administrators of institutions of higher education (Power, 2008).&#xd;
This study addresses the following research questions: What online security problems do professors and students face? What do they know about online security? What steps do they take to protect themselves? What are the gaps between their security knowledge and practice? How do professors and students learn about online security problems, and what can they do to address these problems?&#xd;
The design uses a qualitative research methodology. The proposed data gathering consists of interviews and a focus group (McMillan &amp; Schumacher, 2010), all conducted online. The interviews and focus group discussions will be recorded and the collected data later analyzed using NVivo software. The outcome of this project report is a design of research to guide those working in higher-education institutions to support professors and students in the safe use of the internet.</description>

   <description>The north eastern region in India represents a legacy of uneven imperial state formation inherited by the Indian nation state. My doctoral dissertation examines British imperialism in the nineteenth century, as it operated in “non-British” spaces of the north east frontier of colonial India. I focus on the historical production and cooption of the Khasi and Jaintiah hills, into a frontier space of the British Empire. I analyse the interconnections between physical transformations, colonial structures of law, and colonial knowledge that produced inhabitants of the autonomous polities, north east of Bengal into “hill tribals”.&#xd;
Law provided a foundational framework through which colonial commercial and military advancement into non-British territories such as the Khasi hills was achieved. The most profound implication of colonial processes was on ruler-subject relations, which accompanied the reconstitution of space and inhabitants’ conceptions of self. The dissertation traces both spatial and imaginative transformations that stripped the groups occupying the Khasi and Jaintiah hills of a political identity. The Khasi tribal subject’s relationship to the governing structures was navigated, and negotiated using a reconstituted notion of custom. &#xd;
This project is more than a history of tribal minorities in India. It addresses the crisis of colonial sovereignty in colonial frontiers, and the nature of imperialism in non-British territories. The dissertation also addresses how the hills and its peoples have long resisted incorporation and integration into totalizing histories of colonial modernity, capitalism and nationalism. Social identities of the diverse communities in the north east of India are articulated through, what I have called narratives of continuity that are both constitutive of and framed against colonial knowledge systems. Critical of the “naturalisation of the association between history and western modernity” and the consequent binaries of past and present, this dissertation analyses indigenous narratives, and the articulation of distinct pasts often inhered in the present.</description>

   <description>Conservators have long been aware of the problems associated with the preservation of rubber objects due to inherent instability that can be attributed, in part, to the presence of additives. Inorganic additives, such as fillers, accelerators, stabilizers, and special ingredients are necessary in manufacturing to alter the properties of natural rubber. These materials all have different interactions with the rubber, and each other, and differing effects on the ageing process. To date, the most effective and accepted methods to preserve rubber are cold, dark storage of objects, or the use of low oxygen environments. While these methods are effective, they greatly limit access. The application of coatings to the surface of rubber objects can slow deterioration and greatly increase the ability of an institution to handle and display rubber objects. While numerous coatings for preventive and interventive treatment have been tested, none have been so successful to warrant routine use. The first section of this research highlighted the relationship between the inclusion of certain additives in natural rubber objects and the accelerated or slowed down overall degradation. In the second part of this research, the acrylic varnishes Golden Polymer Varnish with UVLS, Lascaux Acrylic Transparent Varnish-UV, Sennelier Matte Lacquer with UV Protection, and Liquitex Soluvar Varnish containing ultraviolet light absorbers or stabilizers were tested as a preventative coating for rubber. Through testing the visual and physical properties of the samples, as well as compound analysis the results of this research suggest that acrylic varnishes do provide protection, each to varying degrees. The results also provided insight into the behavior of rubber and these varnishes with continuing light exposure.</description>

   <description>Surveillance data from 105 countries indicates that 80% of 13-15 year-olds do not meet the public health guideline of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day. This is problematic as a lack of physical activity in young people is associated with physical, mental, and social health problems. Schools are a place where children and adolescents spend a large amount of their time and where they have several opportunities to engage in physical activity. The built and social environment of the school can influence the physical activity levels of students. The school built environment consists of the facilities that can encourage physical activity such as gymnasia, fields, and fitness rooms. This thesis looked at two aspects of the social environment: 1) school policies, programs, and practices (PPP) for physical activity, and 2) school social capital. School PPP includes things like having intramural sports. School social capital is based on the relationships formed at school. The purpose of this thesis was to determine whether selected features of the school social environment (social capital, school PPP for physical activity) changes the relationship between the school built environment and physical activity among 11-15 year-old Canadians. Information on the school social environment, school built environment and school time physical activity was gathered using a national representative survey called the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey (HBSC). The HBSC consists of a survey completed by grade 6-10 students in their classroom and a second 10 minute long survey completed by the principal of the participating schools. &#xd;
	Results of this thesis indicate that the school built environment and school social capital were positively associated with school time MVPA, while school PPP had a slight negative association. School PPP altered the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. Specifically, the strongest positive association was between the built environment and MVPA levels in schools with few school PPP. However, school social capital did not alter the relationship between the built environment and MVPA. &#xd;
	The results of this thesis can be useful in creating new school physical activity interventions.</description>

   <description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in communication and socialization, as well as by repetitive and stereotyped behaviours and interests.  The ASD phenotype is also characterized by impairments in cognition.  A growing body of literature points to attention and executive functioning as being key elements of cognition that are impaired in individuals with ASD.  It is very possible that these cognitive difficulties are related to the functional deficits in academic achievement, daily living skills and socialization that are experienced by individuals with ASD throughout their lifetime.  Associations between these cognitive and functional abilities have been identified in TD populations; however, this relationship is not well understood in ASD.  This is especially true for adolescents with ASD who are a vastly understudied population within the field.  The research in this thesis aimed to investigate the nature of cognitive and functional impairments in high-functioning adolescents with ASD, and to better understand the relationship between these deficits.  This study made use of a multi-method approach, by obtaining behavioural and parent-report data related to cognition and functioning for both ASD and TD populations.  The results indicated that adolescents with ASD may have some impairment in executive functioning, particularly with shifting and planning abilities, and score significantly lower than TD adolescents on measures of academic achievement, adaptive behaviour and social skills.  Surprisingly, no evidence was found for attentional deficits in the ASD group.  Multiple regression analyses did not reveal any significant predictive relationships of attention and executive functioning with academic ability, adaptive behaviour, or social skills. Limitations of this research are discussed.  The results may lend themselves to the development of theoretical frameworks for understanding functional abilities in adolescents with ASD.</description>

   <description>Astronomical and cosmological observations reveal that the majority of the matter in our universe is made of an unknown, non-luminous substance called dark matter. Many experimental attempts are underway to directly detect particle dark matter, which is very difficult to measure due to the expected low interaction rate with normal matter. DEAP-3600 is a direct dark matter search experiment located two kilometres underground at SNOLAB, in Sudbury, Ontario. DEAP-3600 will make use of liquid argon as the detector material, which scintillates as charged particles pass through. The work presented here is an investigation of expected background sources in the DEAP detector.&#xd;
Because DEAP-3600 is a noble liquid-based experiment, a thin film of [1,1,4,4]-tetraphenyl-[1,3]-butadiene (TPB) is coated on the detector walls to shift the scintillation peak from the UV to visible regime for detection. However, alphas passing through TPB produce scintillation signals which can mimic recoil events. Because scintillation properties can change with temperature, we have conducted an investigation of alpha-induced TPB scintillation at temperatures ranging from 300 K to 3.4 K. We were able to characterize the light yield and decay times, and demonstrated that these background events should be distinguishable from true recoil events in liquid argon, thus enabling DEAP-3600 to achieve higher dark matter sensitivity.&#xd;
Additionally, we investigate the performance of the liquid argon purification systems, specifically the activated charcoal used for radon filtration. Previous measurements with the DEAP prototype experiment have demonstrated the necessity of removing radon from the argon prior to filling the detector, due to the release of contaminates from the argon storage systems. Charcoal radon filters are extremely efficient, however, if the emanation rate of the charcoal is too high, there is the possibility of re-contamination. We performed a measurement of the radon emanation rate of a charcoal sample using a radon emanation and extraction system at Queens University. We demonstrated that the emanation rate of the charcoal was consistent with zero. We also show that the number of residual radon atoms which reach the detector would not be an issue for DEAP-3600.</description>

   <description>The UN Charter recognizes the right to culture as a human right and UNESCO mandates the preservation and enhancement of indigenous cultures – reflecting how the international community values cultural diversity. Ignoring the acculturating effects of education in foreign languages in indigenous societies comes in conflict with these mandates. Current research in the instructional languages of primary school education usually revolves around the learning advantages. But the focus on learning advantages has diminished the impact of instructional language on culture to relative oblivion, despite the acculturating effects visibly found in indigenous, multilingual, and pluralist societies; effects that threaten the existence of many indigenous cultures in the wake of globalization.  As remarked by Ngugi Wa Thiong’o in his book titled The Future of African Literature, language is “a system of communication” and “the carrier of culture”, therefore, striking a balance between its role in education and culture is essential. Indigenous culture and language should not be sacrificed by education that seeks to educate for inclusion in a world viewed as a global; the latter representative of the western culture and English language. Therefore, a strategy is needed to use education systems both as carriers of indigenous cultures and participation in a global world. This topic requires continuous research.&#xd;
The purpose of this study was to explore the role of mother tongue at the primary school level in the preservation of culture. For this purpose, the relationship of Pukhtunwali culture with Pukhtu language was investigated. This qualitative study consisted of interviews with six primary school teachers teaching grade five social studies curriculum in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. The teachers were asked to share their perspectives on the role of Pukhtu language used as a medium of instruction at the primary school level in the preservation of Pukhtun culture in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. Data analysis identified five themes that showed variations in the perspectives of teachers regarding the role of Pukhtu language in the preservation of Pukhtunwali if used as a medium of instruction in schools.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the role of accounting information in the automotive industry restructuring of 2008 and 2009 in Canada. The crisis in the automotive industry led to government-funded restructurings for two of the top manufacturers in North America, effectively adding the government as a third party to the negotiations. Following a series of negotiations that occurred between AutoCo and UnionA, I conduct a case study that examines the individual actors’ use of accounting inscriptions in negotiations, as well as explore the dynamic interaction between accounting and trust at the negotiation table. The use of actor network theory highlights the individual actors, their actor-networks, accounting inscriptions and the continuous translation process inherent in labour-management negotiations. Accounting inscriptions are shown to play a central role in negotiations, particularly as a forum for bringing the actor-networks together. Furthermore, I explicate the notion of tactical trust, as it emphasizes the assessment, monitoring, and adjustment inherent in decisions to trust actors within dynamic business contexts.&#xd;
	I also investigate the roles that the Canadian government played throughout the restructuring of the automotive industry. Through an in-depth case study of the restructuring from its antecedents through to outcomes, the research focuses on the roles of the government officials in the negotiations between the company and the unions, and their use of accounting information. The empirics highlight that the government not only acted at a distance but utilized sovereign power and direct intervention to achieve their objectives in the automotive industry restructuring. I find that the accounting served as the flexible substitute for the government’s presence at the negotiations table while they were acting at a distance and is used as an immutable parameter when the government directly intervened. This paper extends the governmentality literature by highlighting the coercive character of government actions, technologies and programs, and the notion of government in action. I consider the implications of these research findings on the labour-management negotiations, accounting, actor network theory and governmentality literature. In conclusion I also highlight various avenues of future research.</description>

   <description>Stay-In-Place (SIP) formwork systems are widely used for concrete slabs in industry due to their relative ease and speed of construction. Conventionally, corrugated metal sheets or precast panels are used as formwork. In recent years, the SIP formwork technique has been proposed in conjunction with Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites. The resulting system combines the construction advantages of SIP formwork with the durability and corrosion resistance of FRP materials. Bridge decks are a particularly enticing application due to their exposure to harsh environmental conditions and the need for rapid construction to minimize traffic disruptions. This study broadly evaluates FRP SIP formwork for concrete bridge decks both experimentally and numerically. In total, 9 full scale bridge deck sections, 32 small scale decks and more than 40 auxiliary tests were conducted, including the construction and testing of a full bridge at scale. Additionally, a numerical model was developed to predict punching shear failure based on the theory of plates and shells. Experimental testing was conducted on two FRP SIP form configurations, namely flat plates with T-shape stiffeners and corrugated plates, and used a variety of different detailing and geometries. Some of the investigated parameters included the width effect of bridge deck section tests, the effect of deck span, the effect of bond at the FRP-concrete interface, the panel-to-panel splice configuration, concrete strength, and boundary condition at support, including a monolithic connection with precise girders. Results of the study include the determination of a critical aspect ratio for bridge deck sections, optimization of the panel-to-panel splice detail, and an assessment of the in-plane restraint available to interior span bridge decks. The numerical model, based on the Levy solution for loaded plates, produces a flexural response for a variety of bridge deck configurations and geometries. A failure criterion was applied to establish the punching shear capacity. The model was evaluated against experimental results and provided good correlation. It was then used to investigate a variety of FRP plate thicknesses, spans and effective widths for full scale FRP SIP formwork bridge decks.</description>

   <description>The studies described in this thesis investigated the relationship between DNA repair mechanisms, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced DNA damage and carcinogenesis.   Mice deficient in 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1, the rate-limiting enzyme in repair of oxidized guanine), mice heterozygous for OGG1, and wild type mice, were exposed to a single tumourigenic dose (50 mg/kg) of AFB1.  Neither ogg1 genotype nor AFB1 treatment affected levels of oxidized guanine in lung or liver 2 h post-treatment.  ogg1 (-/-) mice had increased susceptibility to AFB1 toxicity, as reflected by increased mortality within one week of AFB1 exposure.  AFB1 treatment did not significantly increase lung or liver tumourigenesis compared to DMSO controls.  No difference was observed between ogg1 genotypes, although a non-significant trend towards AFB1-treated ogg1 (-/-) mice being more susceptible to tumourigenicity was apparent. Overall, deletion of ogg1 did not significantly affect AFB1-induced DNA damage or tumourigenicity, suggesting that oxidized guanine may not be a major contributor to AFB1-induced tumourigenesis.&#xd;
The effects of AFB1 on DNA repair were assessed in p53 (a protein implicated in regulation of DNA repair) wild type and heterozygous mice.  p53 (+/+) mice treated with 0, 0.2 or 1.0 ppm AFB1 for 26 weeks had increased nucleotide excision repair (NER) activities in lung and liver compared to control, which may represent an adaptive response to AFB1-derived DNA adducts.  In p53 (+/-) mice, the AFB1-induced increase in NER was significantly attenuated, suggesting that loss of one allele of p53 limits the ability of NER to up-regulate in response to AFB1-induced DNA damage.  &#xd;
 Twenty-six week exposure to AFB1 did not affect base excision repair (BER) in p53 (+/+) mouse lung or liver compared to control.  BER was significantly decreased in livers from mice exposed to 1.0 ppm AFB1 compared to those exposed to 0.2 ppm AFB1, a result that was not due to liver cell death or to altered levels of OGG1 protein.  In lungs and livers of p53 (+/-) mice, BER activity was unchanged by AFB1.  As such, the difference in BER response between 0.2 ppm and 1.0 ppm AFB1 treatment seen in the p53 (+/+) mice appears to be p53 dependent.</description>

   <description>Small diameter synthetic vascular grafts have yet to be clinically successful due to luminal narrowing from thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia. Current attempts to address this issue include the development of materials that support endothelialisation and protein modification to the material surfaces that reduce thrombosis. The extracellular matrix protein elastin has been found to be one of the least thrombogenic components of blood vessels, and its purified and recombinant forms have shown reduced thrombogenicity in both in vitro and in vivo models. Biomaterial coatings of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) recombinantly produced in the Woodhouse laboratory showed reduced fibrinogen adsorption, platelet adhesion, and platelet activity. However, the reason for their relative non-thrombogenicity is still not fully understood. In this work, the leukocyte response to ELP-coated materials was investigated. In particular, ELP1 and ELP4, which differ in molecular weight and sequence length, were physically adsorbed to a polyethylene terephthalate surface (MylarTM), yielding 0.22 ± 0.13 μg/cm2 and 0.37 ± 0.19 μg/cm2 surface coverage, respectively, as determined by the colorimetric assay, FastinTM Elastin. These surfaces were exposed to flowing citrated whole blood for surface and bulk evaluation of leukocyte activity using scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Little leukocyte activation was observed on the surface of the controls, low-density polyethylene and uncoated MylarTM. In the bulk, tissue factor (TF) expression (monocytes: ELP1 = 38.6 ± 16.3 %, ELP4 = 33.9 ± 18.1 %) and platelet-leukocyte aggregates determined by CD61 (monocytes: ELP1 = 63.1 ± 17.1 %, ELP4 = 61.8 ± 16.8 %; granulocytes: ELP1 = 62.7 ± 17.0 %, ELP4 = 60.5 ± 20.1 %) were both decreased compared to uncoated MylarTM, while CD11b upregulation (monocytes: ELP1 = 18.7 ± 2.2 %, ELP4 = 19.7 ± 2.7 %; granulocytes: ELP = 21.4 ± 3.7 %, ELP4 = 22.0 ± 3.2 %) was increased. The statistical dependence of TF expression and platelet-monocyte aggregates was tested; however, no correlation was found. Overall, platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation was reduced and there were conflicting results with regards to the reduction of leukocyte activation for the ELP coatings on MylarTM.</description>

   <description>This thesis is a collection of three essays. The first two study how ideas spread through a network of individuals, and how it an advertiser can exploit it. In the model I develop, users choose their sources of information based on the perceived usefulness of their sources of information. This contrasts with previous literature where there is no choice made by network users and thus, the information flow is fixed. I provide a complete theoretical characterization of the solution and define a natural measure of influence based on choices of users. I also present an algorithm to solve the model in polynomial time on any network, regardless of the scale or the topology. I also discuss the properties of a network technology from a public economic standpoint. In essence, a network allows the reproduction of ideas for free for the advertiser. If there is any free-riding problem, I show that coalitions of users on the network can solve such problem. I also discuss the social value of networks, a value that cannot be captured for profit. The third essay is completely distinct from the network paradigm and instead studies funding rules for public universities. I show that a funding rule that depends solely on enrolment leads to "competition by franchise" and that such behavior is sometimes inefficient. I suggest instead an alternate funding rule that allows government to increase welfare without increasing spending in universities.</description>

   <description>This study examines the role of things in the making of New Netherland in the seventeenth century and the formation of New York in the early eighteenth century. With an attention to the translations of form and transculturations of meaning for objects, which have often led peripatetic lives, I focus on previously marginalized crafts and everyday objects like books, tea tables, chairs, hearth tiles, and other domestic goods found in peoples’ homes, to describe the way things connected people and places in early modern Dutch trade networks. Through a careful analysis of objects of material culture and depictions of material culture I focus on how the colony was physically constructed and ideologically imagined internally by the colonists and externally by other interested parties throughout Atlantic world. &#xd;
My research on the making, circulation, and consumption of things in and from New Netherland develops intersecting narratives of the past, some of them regional and localized, others cross-cultural, transnational, and global. By connecting artifacts, objects, and things to larger narratives it is possible to write a new history of materiality and the making of New Netherland, primarily in the seventeenth century but also in later histories. In what follows, through the examination of increasingly mobile and hybrid material cultures in the Dutch Republic and New Netherland, I demonstrate that just like materialism and morality, worldliness and homeliness were not binary constructs, but mutually constructive and inextricably intertwined in the oud and nieuw Netherlands.</description>

   <description>Objectives: The purpose of this thesis was to identify risk factors for the development of mental health concerns in pre-teens and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and in particular the role of early childhood ASD symptomatology in their development.  Additionally, this thesis generated prevalence estimates for mental health concerns in Canadian adolescents with ASD.&#xd;
Methods: The parents of 390 individuals with ASD were invited to participate in a survey, either online or by mail. Sixty-seven parents completed and returned surveys.  Kendall tau b correlation coefficients were calculated for the association between age at assessment with ADI-R and score in each domain. Prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals were generated, and the Kappa statistic was used to determine the strength of agreement between parent-reported diagnoses and clinical CBCL scores. Finally, bivariate analysis was used to determine if childhood ASD symptomatology was associated with mental health in adolescence, followed by logistic regression modeling to evaluate the effect of other possible risk factors.&#xd;
Results:  Scores on two domains of the ADI-R were significantly associated with age at assessment, therefore, it was necessary to control for age at assessment with the ADI-R on these domains in the analysis conducted in Chapter Four. Forty-five percent of the study sample met case criteria for a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Anxiety, mood and attention-deficit disorders were the most common disorders in this sample. Early childhood ASD symptoms were not associated with the development of mental health concerns in adolescence.   Family history and female gender were associated with the development of mental health concerns in adolescence.&#xd;
Conclusions: Nearly half of the individuals in our sample have been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, or are experiencing clinically significant symptoms that may be indicative of such a disorder. Our findings of discrepancies between parent-reported diagnoses and CBCL scores, indicates that many individuals in our sample are experiencing clinically significant mental health concerns, but do not have an official diagnosis. Finally, as has been reported previously, family history of mental illness and female gender were found to be associated with the development of a mental health concern in adolescence.</description>

   <description>Water governance is a key policy issue for Israel primarily due to scarcity of water in the Country and broader regional environmental, economic, political and social challenges. In recent years a concerted effort to maintain water supply has lead to large-scale investment in alternative technologies such as desalination and treatment/reuse of grey water and wastewater. In addition, Israel prioritizes water allocations for agriculture, industrial and domestic uses. This research project seeks to shed light on these developments from an integrative sustainability assessment perspective. A sustainability analysis of this kind has not been previously completed for Israel. This project contributes to an initial sustainability assessment of Israel water policy through an evaluation of the Country’s most recent master plan. Using policy documents and primary observations from site visits to water infrastructure at Mekorot Visitor’s Centres this project evaluates water policy relating to resource maintenance and efficiency, as well as socio-ecological civility and democratic governance. Key recommendations include increasing public involvement in decision making, building social capacity for involvement in the water sector and clarifying plans for aquifer rehabilitation.</description>

   <description>The goal of this work is to investigate the influence of overburden cover on controlling recharge to a bedrock aquifer, specifically focusing on rapid recharge events. Rapid recharge events have been observed in a fractured rock site in eastern Ontario and fractured rock sites around the world. The mechanisms that cause these events are poorly understood. At a field site near Perth, Ontario, measurements of hydraulic head were obtained in the spring and summer of 2012 using 18 different monitoring wells. Rainfall and weather data were also collected. Infiltration experiments were performed in the summer period using a 10 m by 10 m rainfall simulator. A ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey was conducted around a piezometer to determine depth to bedrock. Permeameter tests were performed in the overburden layer. A piezometer which responds rapidly to rainfall was identified and field measurements and observations were used to numerically model the piezometer on an outcrop. Three-dimensional numerical simulations reproduced the response in the piezometer for both short (24 hour) and long (one month) timescales. An equivalent porous media (EPM) approach was taken to numerically model fractured rock. The numerical simulations for a month-long period required that evapotranspiration was accounted for and this was achieved by limiting applied rainfall to the area above the outcrop in the model. Numerical simulations were also used to determine what parameters have the greatest effect on controlling rapid recharge.&#xd;
Based on this study it was concluded that large magnitude head rises recorded in this piezometer are a result of recharge to the shallow aquifer. Hydraulic head rises rapidly because of transmissive vertical fractures connecting the low specific yield rock to the surface. A thin layer of overburden (0.4 m) can completely eliminate response in the well especially during times when evapotranspiration is high.</description>

   <description>von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, resulting from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Type 3 VWD is the rarest and most severe form of the disease. This thesis characterizes the phenotype-genotype correlations of a cohort of Canadian type 3 VWD patients and their family members. Three main findings are highlighted: 1) 50% of families showed evidence of co-dominant inheritance as opposed to recessive, 2) 42% of mutations identified were located in the VWF propeptide region (VWFpp), 3) index cases (IC) with mutations in the VWFpp had a more severe bleeding diatheses than IC with mutations elsewhere. &#xd;
We investigated two of the identified VWFpp mutations (ex4-5del and Cys633Arg) to elucidate their molecular mechanisms using two cellular models. Patient-derived blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) are ideal for studying the underlying molecular mechanism of VWF mutations as they represent the native vascular endothelium. BOEC were isolated from type 3 VWD IC and family members with the mutations of interest. A heterologous cellular system was also used to study the VWF mutations in vitro. The VWFpp mutations caused impaired VWF secretion, defective multimerization, qualitative and quantitative defects in Weibel-Palade body (WPB) formation, and resulted in VWF retention within the endoplasmic reticulum. We attempted to restore secretion and multimerization by co-transfecting each mutant with the wild-type VWF propeptide (VWFpp), which was unsuccessful.&#xd;
 Additionally, we investigated a third mutation, c.8419_8422dupTCCC, which is unique to the Canadian VWD population and is found at a high frequency in a specific geographic population. While we hypothesized that this mutation would disrupt dimerization due to its location in the C-terminal cysteine knot (CK) domain of VWF we did not find this to be true. &#xd;
The results presented within this thesis provide new insight into the genetics and pathobiology of type 3 VWD, the functional contribution of the VWFpp to type 3 VWD and highlight the utility of BOEC as a cellular model for evaluating the pathogenic mechanisms of VWF mutations.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-10-31 14:48:27.422</description>
   <description>Noise radar systems have become more prevalent over the past couple of decades due to their superior performance over conventional continuous-wave and pulsed-wave radar systems in certain applications.  However, one limiting factor of noise radar systems has been the generation of ultrabroadband waveforms.  This thesis proposes a novel application of programmable pseudo-random bit generators (PRBGs) for use in noise radar applications.  A long-sequence high-speed PRBG was designed using a low-cost and low-power complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology.  The proposed circuit has a sequence length of approximately 4.3 Gbits and was designed to operate at 1 GHz providing a data rate of 1 Gbit/s.&#xd;
&#xd;
This new waveform generation technique would eliminate the requirement of a large variable delay-line (transmission-line) and reduce the power required by noise radar systems.  It would allow such systems to become much more compact and create the opportunity for the move towards hand-held devices.  It would further allow easier implementation of bistatic radar systems where the transmitting and receiving sites are physically far from one another.  In addition, this programmable long-sequence PRBG could have applications in cryptology, communications, and other areas where the generation of high-speed random bit sequences is paramount.&#xd;
&#xd;
Unfortunately, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) design process documentation error rendered the fabricated IC's unusable.  The error was caused by not enabling the input pads of the IC, which required an undocumented edit to the gate-level design file generated by Synopsys \textit{Design Vision}.  Consequently, the circuit had to be realized on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which performed as expected, albeit at a lower frequency of 50 MHz.  The PSD of the FPGA implementation created the expected output of a sinc-squared function with the first null at the clock frequency.  This result proves that a LFSR PRBG is a viable noise source for use in noise radar systems.</description>

   <description>Raspberry-like polystyrene particles were fabricated through the covalent linkage of small epoxy-functionalized polystyrene particles (PS-GMA) with large amino-functionalized polystyrene particles (PS-NH2).  These covalent bonds yielded more stable and robust particle clusters than would be anticipated from non-covalent interactions.  While the structures of these raspberry-like particles provided them with a dual-scale hierarchical roughness and re-entrant sites, they were further functionalized with a fluorinated random copolymer to provide them a low surface tension. &#xd;
The fluorinated random copolymer used to functionalize these raspberry-like particles was poly(glycidyl methacrylate20%)-co-2(perfluorooctyl)ethyl methacrylate80%)25 or P(GMA20%-co-FOEMA80%)25, where the subscript 25 denotes the total number of the respective GMA and FOEMA units, while the subscript 20% and 80% denote the molar fractions of GMA and FOEMA, respectively.  The epoxy groups of the GMA units could react with the amino groups of the raspberry-like particles, thus incorporating the fluorinated polymer onto the surfaces of the raspberry-like particles.  In addition, the FOEMA component provided the particles with enhanced amphiphobicity.&#xd;
Subsequently, these fluorinated raspberry-like particles were cast onto glass slides to demonstrate their superamphiphobic properties.  These coatings exhibited superhydrophobic behavior when they were tested against water droplets.  Additionally, the oil-repellency of these coatings was tested against various liquids, including diiodomethane, cooking oil, and hexadecane.  The coatings exhibited superoleophobic behavior against diiodomethane and cooking oil, as well as highly oleophobic behavior against hexadecane.&#xd;
This work demonstrates a simple and efficient route for the fabrication of superamphiphobic surfaces.  Additionally, these surfaces are among the first examples of coatings prepared via self-assembly techniques that exhibited high repellency against hexadecane.  These materials could have potential in various applications that require protection of a surface against wetting by either water or oils.</description>

   <description>This thesis discusses art produced by holy women in New France and New Spain in addition to figural sculpture from the former and the Guaraní missions of Paraguay. The art produced in such disparate regions transcends the realities of the human body through a negation of natural physiognomies and emotive states in favour of stylized forms and serene expressions. Since no comparative studies yet exist for the arts of New France and colonial Latin America this thesis presents a crucial challenge and opportunity to explore commonalities.&#xd;
As the first female missionaries outside Europe nuns in New France strived to become living saints and martyrs. Some arts, particularly embroidery, operated as penance to aid women in achieving their quest for immortality. In Mexican nunneries women’s bodies became works of art through their integration in to multiple mediums, as seen in portraits of nuns in which bodies operate as canvases. Similarly, through performance the woman’s body in the Ursulines of Quebec City became a component of her embroidery which she embodied with her holy aura.&#xd;
The omission of suffering is a prominent feature in figures of Christ and the saints in Guaraní and French Canadian sculpture. These aspects are heightened through the carving of draperies assuming the emotion absent in the figures. With similar characteristics appearing in both locations this thesis discusses why two cultures vastly removed in distance display profound stylistic similarities. The colonizer’s art replacing that of the colonized is a myth perpetuated by the belief that indigenous cultures were eradicated through contact with Europeans. Similarly, we cannot assume a continuity of European artistic ideals among French settlers in New France. This presents another discourse on the convergence of cultures thoroughly separated from one another in the scholarly consciousness.</description>

   <description>Maintaining energy organismal homeostasis under changing physiological and environmental conditions is vital, and requires constant adjustments of the energy metabolism. Central to meeting energy demands is the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity. When demands increase, animals can increase mitochondrial content/enzymes, known as mitochondrial biogenesis. Central to mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis is the transcriptional master regulator PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), and the network of DNA-binding proteins it coactivates (e.g. nuclear respiratory factor 1 and 2 [NRF-1, NRF-2], estrogen-related receptor α [ERRα], thyroid receptor α [TRα-1], retinoid X receptor α [RXRα]). However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial content in lower vertebrates such as fish is controlled are less studied. &#xd;
In my study I investigate underlying mechanisms of the phenomenon that many fish species alter mitochondrial enzyme activities, such as cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in response to low temperatures. In particular, I investigated (i) if the phenomenon of mitochondrial biogenesis during cold-acclimation is related to fish phylogeny, (ii) what role PGC-1α and other transcription factors play in mitochondrial biogenesis in fish, and (iii) if mRNA decay rates are important in the transcriptional control of a multimeric protein like COX.&#xd;
This study shows that mitochondrial biogenesis does not follow a phylogenetic pattern: while distantly related species displayed the same response to low temperatures, closely related species showed opposite responses. In species exhibiting mitochondrial biogenesis, little evidence was found for PGC-1α as a master regulator, whereas NRF-1 is supported to be an important regulator in mitochondrial biogenesis in fish. Further, there was little support for other transcription factors (NRF-2, ERRα, TRα-1, RXRα) to be part of the regulatory network.&#xd;
Lastly, results on the post-transcriptional control mechanism of mRNA decay indicate that this mechanism is important in the regulation of COX under mitochondrial biogenesis: it accounts for up to 30% of the change in subunit transcript levels.&#xd;
In summary, there is no simple temperature-dependent mitochondrial response ubiquitous in fish. Further, the pathways controlling mitochondrial content in fish differ from mammals in the important master regulator PGC-1α, however, NRF-1 is important in regulating cold-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in fish. Lastly, COX subunit mRNA decay rates seem to have a part in controlling COX amounts during mitochondrial biogenesis.</description>

   <description>Water distribution utilities are responsible for supplying both clean and safe drinking water, while under constraints of operating at an efficient and acceptable performance level. The City of Kingston, Ontario is currently experiencing elevated costs to repair its aging buried water main assets. Utilities Kingston is opting for a more efficient and practical means of forecasting pipe breaks and the application of a predictive water main break models allows Utilities Kingston to forecast future pipe failures and plan accordingly.&#xd;
&#xd;
The objective of this thesis is to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to forecast pipe breaks in the Kingston water distribution network. Data supplied by Utilities Kingston was used to develop the predictive ANN water main break model incorporating multiple variables including pipe age, diameter, length, and surrounding soil type. The constructed ANN model from historical break data was utilized to forecast pipe breaks for 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year planning periods. Simulated results were evaluated by statistical performance metrics, proving the overall model to be adequate for testing and forecasting. Predicted breaks were as follows, 33 breaks for 2011-2012, 22 breaks for 2012-2013 and 35 breaks for 2013-2016. Additionally, GIS plots were developed to highlight areas in need of potential rehabilitation for the distribution system. The goal of the model is to provide a practical means to assist in the management and development of Kingston’s pipe rehabilitation program, and to enable Utilities Kingston to reduce water main repair costs and to improve water quality at the customer's tap.</description>

   <description>This comparative study explores the mechanisms of pollutant removal efficiency in cold-climate constructed wetlands (CWs) and investigates the benefits, standing and practicability of using these systems to treat wastewater in Canada and Northern China. Treatment efficiencies defined by the Canadian and Northern China experience vary considerably. Experience in both countries shows that the majority of effluent values are generally better than that required by discharge standards in Canada and China. A review of the available case studies on cold weather treatment in both countries indicates that this technology is feasible in Canada and Northern China, although further monitoring data are needed to optimize CW design and ensure that the effluent quality standards are consistently met.&#xd;
In both of these countries and around the globe, increasingly strict water quality standards and the growing application of treatment wetlands for wastewater treatment is an important motive for the development of better numerical models as predictive process design tools. An investigation of the SubWet 2.0 model, a horizontal subsurface flow modeling program used to predict the level of treatment that can be expected was conducted. It has been shown that SubWet can consider the influence of several factors at one time, where empirical equations are generally not able to consider more than two factors at one time and usually in isolation of the other influential parameters. Three different data sets, two from natural wetlands from the Canadian Arctic and one from a CW in Africa were used to illustrate how SubWet can be calibrated to specific wetlands. Compared to other models, it is suggested that SubWet provides one of the best modeling options available for natural tundra wetlands. Further calibration of SubWet with twelve municipal treatment wetlands in the Canadian Arctic clearly demonstrated its ability to model treatment performance within natural tundra wetlands and thus provide an additional predictive tool to aid northern stakeholders in the treatment of municipal effluents. It is anticipated that increased monitoring and the generation of additional measured data will help to better identify the level of year to year variability and improve the overall predictive capability of the model.</description>

   <description>Visual arts-based tasks have been used and continue to be used by educators to help support the learning needs of many students. Research findings pertaining to visual arts-based education have concluded that visual arts-based tasks can help to improve students’ social communication skills, support their learning in academic subject areas, and increase their learning engagement. In recognition of the potential benefits of integrating the arts into the curriculum, the Learning Through the Arts (LTTA) program provides students with opportunities to engage in arts-based activities. In 2003, the results of a national longitudinal study on the LTTA program revealed a strong relationship between students’ involvement in the arts and their learning and engagement. The investigators recommended that further research in this area was required; through my research, I sought to contribute to this area of study. It is within the setting of a visual arts-based LTTA program that this study was conducted. Data were collected to construct two multiple-perspective case studies—each involving a Grade 7 student with learning disabilities. Each multiple-perspective case study involved the student’s mother, classroom teacher, and LTTA artist-educator in order to explore the following research question: In what way did visual arts-based tasks incite the student’s learning attitude, engagement level, and feelings of academic self-efficacy within the subject area(s) being explored? Overall, the findings suggested that visual arts-based tasks incited positively each student’s learning attitude, engagement level, and feelings of academic self-efficacy within the respective subject area that the students identified as being one of their least favourite. Most notably, their engagement in the visual arts-based tasks activated each student’s meaningful processing skills and fostered their emotional engagement in the task and their learning. Limitations of this study and future research directions were considered.</description>

   <description>Ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) have been investigated as the basis for a new type of liquid crystal display because of their fast switching times.  In applications the layer contraction at the smectic A-smectic C transition is a severe problem that leads to buckling of the smectic layers and results in zigzag defects that drastically degrade the optical quality of FLC films. To solve this problem, researchers are focusing on a new class of liquid crystals with minimal smectic layer contraction at the SmA-SmC transition which is referred to as ‘de Vries-like’.&#xd;
In the first part of this thesis, we have developed a rational design strategy based on a concept of frustration between two structural elements, one promoting a SmA phase and another promoting a SmC phase. In this chapter, we show that one can further improve ‘de Vries-like’ properties by substituting the 2-phenylpyrimidine core in our first-generation siloxane-terminated mesogens with one stronger SmC-promoting core. We also address the hydrolytic instability of siloxane-terminated mesogens, by substituting the siloxane with a carbosilane end-group. As a result of this study, we found QL6-6 that forms a SmC phase at room temperature with ‘de Vries-like’ properties that are comparable to those of bona fide ‘de Vries-like’ liquid crystals.&#xd;
Next, the dialkoxy 2-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole core which is a very powerful SmC promoting element was investigated. We prepared the analogue of QL6-6, compound QL13-6, which only forms a SmC phase despite having a chloro-terminated alkyl chain. Making a ‘de Vries-like’ liquid crystal without carbosilane terminal side-chain was also attempted, although ultimately unsuccessful.&#xd;
The terminal group effect on the ‘de Vries-like’ properties was also investigated. We prepared a series of mesogens derived from 2-phenylpyridine core with different end-groups to investigate whether the X-group might interact with the core in a bilayer structure.&#xd;
Finally, we inves¬tigated the effect of mixing ’de Vries-like’ liquid crystals with conventional smectic liquid crystals. We show that binary mix¬tures of ‘de Vries-like’ and conventional SmC meso¬gens with a molecular length ratio of 1.34 undergo a SmA-SmC phase transition with a maximum layer contraction ranging from 1.0 to 1.9% depending on the mixture composition.</description>

   <description>The goal of this research is to explore the relationship between coercion and crime amongst street youths in Mexico. This research relies on Mark Colvin’s (2000) Differential Coercion Theory (DCT). Through semi-structured interviews with street youths in Mexico City, this research explores: (1) the various personal and structural factors that lead youths to the street; (2) the strategies of income generation used by the youths; (3) the youths experiences of victimization, substance use, criminal involvement and institutionalization; and finally, (4) the personal and structural reasons that contribute to youths’ inability to leave the street.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Results indicate that in most cases youths experience some form of physical, sexual, verbal, and/or psychological abuse that prompts them to leave home. In other cases, youths simply witnessed the abuse of a significant other or become subject to neglect. Some youths are thrown out of the home due to familial conflict. Results also indicate that on the street, youths are encouraged to display violent behaviours to avoid victimization. Further, youths face a number of needs and are compelled to engage in legitimate or illegitimate sustenance practices. On the street, youths are subject to theft, as well as physical and sexual victimization from peers and police officers. The results also suggest that youths are dependent on various substances as a way to cope with difficult situations. Results also indicate that as a result of crime or drug use, youths are likely to experience institutionalization where physical, verbal, and psychological victimization is experienced. Finally, youths attribute the freedom provided by the street and substance dependency as reasons to stay on the streets. Overall, the results suggest that Mexican street youths experience coercion in various settings. However, to explain the relationship between coercion and crime more research is needed on other explanatory factors.</description>

   <description>Background: Sedentary behaviour is waking activity in a seated or reclined position that involves little energy expenditure. It is gaining attention as an important cardiometabolic risk factor, independent of physical activity. Studies assessing the relationship between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic risk have not accounted for sleep duration as a potential covariate, although there is evidence that sleep duration may be related to both sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic risk.&#xd;
Objectives: To examine the associations between sleep duration and sedentary behaviour in adults, and determine if sedentary behaviour is related to the metabolic syndrome (MetS) after controlling for sleep duration. &#xd;
Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative sample of Americans. There were 1371 adults over the age of 20 that were studied. Average daily sedentary time and sleep duration were determined via 7-day accelerometry. Screen time (television, computer) was determined via questionnaire. The MetS was determined using standard criteria. Analysis of variance was used to examine relationships among sedentary time and screen time with sleep duration. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between total sedentary time, screen time, and sleep duration with the MetS after controlling for several covariates.&#xd;
Results: Sedentary time and screen time did not vary across sleep duration quartiles (p=0.08 and p=0.87, respectively), and therefore were unrelated to sleep duration. The relative odds of the MetS was significantly higher in participants in the highest quartile of sedentary time than in participants in the lowest quartile (OR=1.60, 95% CI:1.05-2.45).  The relative odds of the MetS was higher in participants in the highest screen time tertile than in participants in the lowest tertile (OR =1.67, 95% CI:1.13-2.48). Short sleep duration was not independently related to the MetS, but was borderline related to waist circumference (OR=1.25, 95% CI:0.85-1.84). &#xd;
Conclusion: Highly sedentary individuals and individuals with a high screen time are more likely to have the MetS, independent of sleep duration. Future studies in this area would benefit from using more advanced objective measures of sedentary behaviour and sleep duration and a prospective study design.</description>

   <description>The first part of this thesis intends to create a fuel processor model capable of generating 1kW power as output through the use of a solid oxide fuel cell system. The fuel processor system consists of a reformer, heat exchanger network, desulphurizer and an afterburner. Modelled in VMGSimTM, inlet diesel gas is provided at the mass flow rate of 0.2596kg/hour, with the oxygen to carbon ratio calculated at 0.31 and the steam to carbon ratio arbitrarily set to be 2.25.  The diesel fuel is preheated and mixed with air and steam and then fed to the auto-thermal reformer. The higher hydrocarbons are broken down and converted into hydrogen. The outlet of the reformer is fed into the SOFC where H2 is converted to generate energy which, in this case is approximately 1200W. The off gas is fed to the afterburner; where the remaining H2 is burnt and the energy is used to provide for steam generation and pre-heating through the heat exchangers. The project also focuses upon performing basic sizing calculations on components of the system. The fuel cell efficiency was found to be 62% and the system efficiency was calculated to be approximately 41%, which falls within the range given in literature.&#xd;
For the second part of this work, a ceramic porous tail-gas burner using a non-premixed feed of anode exhaust and air was modeled using COMSOL™. The reaction kinetics were experimentally assessed on the basis of COMSOL™ limitations and accuracy of the comparative results. Three performance metrics were evaluated in the analysis: i) velocity profile, ii) temperature profile, and iii) concentration profile. These metrics confirm the combustion reaction at the outer boundary of the porous ceramic in the burner. The spike of temperature and decrease of mass fraction of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane to approximately zero in the outlet exhaust confirms this study. This study was further validated by comparing results with the experimental data collected at NRC-IFCI. The results of COMSOL™ model agreed with the experimental results of NRC-IFCI.</description>

   <title>Sedimentology of the Catalina Dome and taxonomy of Mistaken Point small fronds</title>

   <description>Research carried out in the Ediacaran of eastern Newfoundland focused on two projects: sedimentology of the Conception and St. John’s groups exposed on the Bonavista Peninsula; and taxonomic descriptions of the small, stemmed frondose fossils at Mistaken Point on the Avalon Peninsula.&#xd;
Sedimentological study of the upper Conception and lower St. John's groups at Catalina Dome on Bonavista Peninsula extends our understanding of the Conception Basin, in which the oldest known complex, deep marine organisms lived, by a factor of two. Mudstone-rich turbidites dominate the succession, and a lack of wave-generated structures or other shallow-water indicators support the interpretation that the depositional environment was deep-marine. The basal part of the succession contains seismoturbidites that show no evidence of horizontal translation, implying that deposition occurred on a flat basin plain. Strata higher in the succession exhibit horizontally slumped beds, implying a transition into slope deposition. Turbidite ripple marks show a change in paleocurrent direction from eastward to southward in the Trepassey Formation, consistent with a change from convergent to strike-slip tectonics that occurred diachronously across the basin. Volcanic ash beds are more common in the Catalina Dome succession than on the Avalon Peninsula, reflecting deposition closer to the volcanic source. These volcanic beds are associated with diverse fossil assemblages rich in rangeomorphs that locally persist into the Fermeuse Formation, in contrast with the Avalon Peninsula where the Fermeuse Formation contains only simple discoid fossils. This taphonomic window lends support to the hypothesis that the form genus Aspidella represents the holdfasts of Ediacaran fronds.&#xd;
Stemmed small frond fossils from Mistaken Point, Avalon Peninsula, have often been informally referred to as “featherdusters”, but due to their small size and consequent poor preservation, they have not until now been formally described. The small, stemmed fronds are more diverse than previously realized, and include representatives of taxa described from elsewhere in Newfoundland, juveniles of other Mistaken Point fronds, and two new monospecific genera. This biodiversity suggests that the basal elevated tier that the small fronds occupied was competitive, with convergent evolution of frondose taxa showing distinct architecture and constructions, but broadly similar size and shape.</description>

   <description>Globally, there is a need for alternative building materials that require less energy to produce than conventional materials. These alternative materials have gained popularity in recent years, however there is a need to better understand their physical properties in order to increase confidence in their use. As such, a testing program was undertaken to investigate the structural properties of some of these materials. &#xd;
A series of compressed earth blocks made from a mixture of earth and cement compressed to 8 - 12 MPa were tested for their compressive capacity in masonry prisms. The blocks had been weathered for one to two years. The blocks with no cement had a capacity of 2.22 MPa, while cement stabilized blocks had a capacity of 8.11 MPa. Weathering did not result in any significant reduction in the strength of the blocks.&#xd;
Bales of high density straw were tested both with and without cement plaster skins. Unplastered bales exhibited a stiffness between 0.3 - 0.7 MPa when oriented Flat, and 1.2 MPa on edge. The bales had a dilation ratio between 0.1 - 0.3 in the Flat orientation and averaging 3.5 in the Edge orientation. The high density bales plastered with cement plaster exhibited ultimate strengths averaging 171.2 kN/m. Capacity was heavily dependent on plaster strengths, and when normalized for plaster strengths, high density bales had capacities lower than those of regular density bales tested previously (34.1 kN/m/MPa compared to 44.3 kN/m/MPa). &#xd;
Three walls made of straw with cement plaster were constructed with pin-ended conditions to study the effects of buckling in straw bale walls. The average capacity was 12.8 kN/m/MPa when normalized for plaster strength. Pin ends resulted in plastic hinges forming more easily in the walls, and pin ended specimens had a 75% reduction in strength compared to previous tests of "standard" end conditions. Taller walls also resulted in reduced strengths.</description>
