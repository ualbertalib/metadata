   <description>Character education is widely used in Ontario elementary schools (Winton, 2010, p. 220). Most educators are helping their students develop character traits like: respect, responsibility and honesty to name a few. The goal of this project was to investigate character education as it widely exists in various school boards in Ontario, Canada. Specifically, this project examines the implementation of character traits by institutions and organizations such as: elementary schools, families, and communities (stakeholders). Resources relating to each institution/organization that will support the alterations and change to a more authentic character education are highlighted. Lastly, a workshop proposal will be included for leaders who want to initiate, create change, and practice an intentional and structured character education program. An actual design of the workshop in PowerPoint will be included. In summary, the overall goal of this project is to examine how schools, families and communities can contribute cohesively towards educating children to be moral beings.</description>

   <description>In the summer of 2010, fieldwork was conducted in the Robertson Valley, Canadian Rocky Mountains, Alberta to assess the magnitude and controls of microbial nitrification in proglacial till and in supraglacial, subglacial, and proglacial streams.  Seasonal precipitation and glacial and proglacial runoff was sampled for hydrochemical and stable isotope analyses (δ18O and δ15N of nitrate [NO3-]).  Lower Ca:Mg ratios, higher mean Σmajor ions, and an increased importance of reactions with slower dissolution kinetics in subglacial streams and proglacial seeps indicated waters here experienced longer rock-water contact time than in dilute supraglacial streams.  Additionally, waters emanating from longer residence time flowpaths acquired substantial NO3- from nitrification reactions.  Using δ18O-NO3- in a simple end-member mixing model, the fraction of NO3- derived from microbial nitrification was estimated to be 44 to 56% in the two subglacial streams, and greater than 80% in proglacial seeps. These results show that atmospherically-derived nitrogen (N) in this glacial valley undergoes substantial biological cycling prior to export in surface runoff.  Water flowing from the east subglacial stream (RE) received a larger portion of its melt from a sediment-rich, slow drainage system and had a higher proportion of nitrified NO3- compared to the west subglacial stream (RW), where runoff was similar in composition to supraglacial runoff, indicating that the nature of subglacial flowpaths is an important factor in determining the amount of microbially-cycled nutrients that are exported from a glacier.  Sixteen 34-day in situ soil incubations revealed that net mineralization and net nitrification occurred at all four sampling sites in the glacier forefield along a 1.6 km chronosequence; however, there was no significant difference among these rates with time since deglaciation or temperature.  Instead, net mineralization and net nitrification rates were significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.05, n = 16) with measured physical and chemical soil variables, including total organic carbon, total N, bulk density, pH, and clay content, suggesting that substrate availability is a larger control on N-cycling processes than time since deglaciation.  High variability in inorganic soil N pools and N-cycling rates indicates that there are likely hot spots of biogeochemical activity within glacial till.</description>

   <title>A Study of Traffic Locality and Reliability in  Peer-to-Peer Video Streaming Applications</title>

   <description>The past decade has witnessed tremendous growth of peer-to-peer (P2P) video&#xd;
streaming applications on the Internet. For these applications, playback&#xd;
smoothness and timeliness are the two most important aspects of users' viewing&#xd;
experiences, whereas the amount of traffic is Internet service providers' main&#xd;
concern. According to the playback delay, video streaming can be classified into&#xd;
on-demand streaming, live streaming, and interactive streaming. P2P live&#xd;
streaming applications typically have an arbitrary number of users, tens of&#xd;
seconds of playback delay, and a high packet delivery rate, but their heavy&#xd;
traffic incurs great financial expenditure and threatens the quality of other&#xd;
services. Interactive streaming applications usually have a small group size,&#xd;
several hundreds of milliseconds of playback delay, and reasonable traffic&#xd;
volume, but cannot achieve a high packet delivery rate. The goal of this thesis&#xd;
is to study traffic locality and reliable delivery of packets in large-scale&#xd;
live streaming and small-scale interactive streaming applications, while keeping&#xd;
the playback delay well below the targeted applications' limits.&#xd;
&#xd;
For P2P live streaming applications, we first identify "typical" schemes from&#xd;
existing P2P live streaming schemes, investigate packet propagation behavior and&#xd;
the impact of neighboring strategies on system performance, and then propose&#xd;
innovative schemes that take both users' viewing experience and traffic locality&#xd;
into consideration. We show that the network-driven tree-based schemes with the&#xd;
swarming technique as a re-transmission error-correction mechanism are superior&#xd;
to the data-driven swarm-based or tree-based schemes, and a properly designed&#xd;
tree-based scheme can localize the traffic while maintaining a high packet&#xd;
delivery rate.&#xd;
&#xd;
For interactive streaming applications, we analyze the efficacy of systematic&#xd;
forward error-correction (FEC) codes against the bursty errors of Internet links&#xd;
when using peers to provide multiple one-hop paths between two communication&#xd;
parties.  We find that although using peers for path diversity often results in&#xd;
a lower post-FEC packet loss ratio, some conditions do apply.  The interplay of&#xd;
a number of factors, such as the Internet links' error ratio and burst length&#xd;
and the coding parameters, determines the performance of FEC.  We provide&#xd;
guidelines and computation methods to determine whether the use of peers for&#xd;
path diversity can be justified.</description>

   <title>Dyadic Green Functions and their applications in Classical and Quantum Nanophotonics</title>

   <description>Research in solid-state nanophotonics and quantum optics has been recently pushing the limits in semiconductor microcavity design. High quality microcavities that confine light into small volumes are now able to drastically alter the local density of states (LDOS). Plasmonic systems can provide smaller effective confinements, however it is unclear if the benefits of confinement are good enough to balance material losses due to non-radiative processes. This thesis presents a compendium of techniques for calculating photonic Green functions in various lossy, inhomogeneous magneto-dielectric systems. Subsequently we derive a rigorous theory of quantum light-matter interactions, valid in both weak and strong coupling limits, and show how the classical photonic Green function is developed to calculate Purcell factors, Lamb shifts, and the near and far field spectra from a single photon emitter. Using these techniques, this work investigates the classical and quantum optical properties of a variety of inhomogeneous structures, including their coupling to single photon emitters. This includes examining Purcell factors above negative index slabs and showing the convergence of many slow-light modes leads to a drastic increase in the LDOS along with large Lamb shifts. The optical trapping of metallic nanoparticles is examined above a negative index slab and a silver half-space, showing the importance of interparticle coupling on the optical forces. Then the interaction between a quantum dot and a metallic nanoparticle is studied where far-field strong coupling effects are observed only when the metallic nanoparticle is considered beyond the dipole approximation. Finally, this work addresses the issue of the LDOS diverging in lossy materials, which necessitates a description of spontaneous emission beyond the dipole approximation; the ``local field problem'' in quantum optics is revisited and generalized to include local field corrections for use in any photonic medium. The strength of finite-difference time-domain techniques is demonstrated in a number of cases for the calculation of regularized Green functions in lossy inhomogeneous media.  This thesis presents a comprehensive study of Green function approaches to model classical and quantum light-matter interactions in arbitrary nanophotonic structures, including quantum dots, semiconductor microcavities, negative index waveguides, metallic half-spaces and metallic nanoparticles.</description>

   <description>Prosopography seeks to learn about social patterns and establish relationships within a well-defined group of individuals, which is accomplished by studying their biographies and analyzing the data within defined parametres.  The adlection of provincials into the equestrian and senatorial orders started during the late Republic and continued into the early Principate.  It integrated provincials into Rome’s social and political systems and provides the opportunity to closely examine how their roles evolved as time passed during the early Roman Empire.  This thesis will show that Nemausus, a provincial tribal settlement in Gallia Narbonensis, was one of the most important towns of the Roman Empire during the early Principate and achieved its prominence through sustained production of senators from Augustus to Marcus Aurelius and, in particular, through its prominent role during the dynasty of the Five Good Emperors.  The role of its equestrians and their inability to attain the highest offices of their order will be discussed.  Chapter Three will focus on Nemausus’ physical transformation as it was converted from a Celtic settlement into a Roman colony, and will lay the groundwork for its rise in the established social structures.  Chapter Four will provide a detailed examination of Nemausian equestrians, evaluate their careers individually and illustrate how indispensable they were to Nemausus’ growth even if they did not attain the highest offices within their order.  Chapter Five will focus on Nemausian senators much in the same manner as the previous chapter.  Unlike their equestrian counterparts, Nemausian senators attained great heights in Rome, becoming generals, consuls, and advisors to the emperor.   Eventually they became the Imperial family itself, placing the provincial town at the forefront of the Western Roman Empire.  Chapter Five will also propose to narrow the scope of Syme’s Hispano-Narbonensian nexus to include only the towns of Italica and Nemausus due to their influence during the dynasty of the Five Good Emperors.  A variety of evidence will be used throughout the discussion, in particular epigraphical and literary sources.  By examining the careers of Nemausian elites, their impact on the Roman Empire and their native town’s increased status, will be discovered.</description>

   <description>The concept of responsibility is central to our moral practice. It is essential that any credible conception of responsibility appropriately tracks agency, that is, what an individual brings about as a consequence of their true self. The rational relations view is a contemporary theory of responsibility informed by recent work in the areas of practical reasoning and moral psychology, and offers a systematic and coherent account of the conditions for moral responsibility. However, the rational relations view faces challenges in deviating from concepts inherent in traditional responsibility theories, specifically the requirements of volitional control and a capacity for moral reasoning. I defend the rational relations view against these challenges, arguing first that volitional control is not a necessary (though sufficient) condition for ascribing responsibility, since such judgements track the evaluative commitment constitutive of our true selves, of which an agent need not be consciously aware. Consequently, against traditional volitional views of responsibility that characterize agents as authoring themselves, the rational relations view instead presents the practice as one of both self-discovery and self-creation. Next, I contend that no further capacity for moral reasoning beyond basic rational competence is required to be morally responsible, for being so simply consists in being answerable for one’s evaluative judgements. I argue those who require a further moral reasoning capacity commit the traditional mistake of conflating moral responsibility with blame, which I take to be distinct. In exploring this distinction, I make use of psychopathy as exemplifying a class of agents who seem to lack a capacity for moral reasoning. The rational relations view is ultimately advanced as an account tracking an agent’s true self without implying blameworthiness or praiseworthiness in its judgements of moral responsibility.</description>

   <description>Supergiant stars of spectral types B and A are characterized by variable and structured winds, as revealed by variability of optical and ultraviolet spectral lines. Non-&#xd;
radial pulsations and magnetically supported loops have been proposed as explanations for these phenomena. The latter hypothesis is tested using a time series of 65&#xd;
high-resolution (λ/∆λ ∼ 65, 000) circular polarization (Stokes I and V ) spectra of&#xd;
the late B type supergiant Rigel (β Ori, B8 Iae), obtained with the instruments ESPaDOnS and Narval at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Bernard Lyot Telescope, respectively. Examination of the unpolarized (Stokes I) spectra using standard spectral analysis tools confirms complex line profile variability during the 5 month period of observations; the high spectral resolution allows the identification of a weak, transient Hα feature similar in behaviour to a High Velocity Absorption event. Analysis of the Stokes V spectra using the cross-correlation technique Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) yields no evidence of a magnetic field in either LSD Stokes V profiles or longitudinal field measurements, with longitudinal field 1σ error bars of ∼ 12 G for individual observations, and a mean field in the best observed period of 3 ± 2 G. Synthetic LSD profiles fit to the observations using a Monte Carlo approach yield an upper limit on the surface dipolar field strength of Bdip ≤ 50 G for most orientations of the rotational and magnetic axes, lowered to Bdip ≤ 35 G if the mean LSD profile from the most densely time-sampled epoch (with an LSD SNR of ∼80,000) is used. A simple two-spot geometry representing the footpoints of a magnetic loop emerging from the photosphere yields upper limits on the spot magnetic fields of 60–600 G, depending on the filling factor of the spots. Given existing measurements of the mass loss rate and the wind terminal velocity, these results&#xd;
cannot rule out a magnetically confined wind as, for Bdip ≤ 15 G, η∗ ≥ 1. However, the detailed pattern of line profile variability seems inconsistent with the periodic wind modulation characteristic of known magnetic early-type stars, suggesting that magnetic fields do not play a dominant role in Rigel’s variable winds.</description>

   <description>Speciation is an important process that is responsible for the generation of biodiversity on Earth. The importance of gene flow during speciation is hotly debated; however, it can be investigated by studying the process of intraspecific population differentiation. Here, I investigate the mechanisms that influence population differentiation and gene flow in brown (Sula leucogaster) and red-footed boobies (S. sula). These species are congeneric, broadly sympatric, and ecologically similar; however, they differ in their marine habitat preference (inshore vs. pelagic). I hypothesized that: (i) gene flow is restricted by major physical barriers in both species, and (ii) gene flow in the absence of physical barriers is more prevalent in red-footed boobies due to their pelagic marine habitat preference.&#xd;
	First, I characterized the structure and function of the booby mitochondrial genome. Using extensive DNA sequencing and phylogenetic methods, I found that boobies have tandemly duplicated mitochondrial control regions that evolve in concert. I suggest that concerted evolution of duplicated control region may be common in seabirds.&#xd;
	To quantify matrilineal population genetic structure and gene flow, I sequenced one control region in 513 brown and red-footed boobies. Both species exhibited strong population genetic structure that was attributable to continental barriers to gene flow such as the Isthmus of Panama. In the absence of physical barriers, gene flow was more prevalent in red-footed boobies. I also used microsatellite and nuclear intron loci to perform multilocus phylogeographic analyses of brown and red-footed boobies. Individuals of both species could be grouped into four genetic populations that corresponded to oceanographic regions. In red-footed boobies, gene flow following secondary contact of previously isolated lineages was common, perhaps due to a pelagic habitat preference. In brown boobies, major genetic populations apparently diverged in the absence of gene flow. Despite this, Isla San Benedicto in the Eastern Pacific is a site of secondary contact between brown booby lineages that diverged approximately one million years ago, and hybrids are apparently fertile. These findings suggest that gene flow following secondary contact may be an important, but overlooked, component of speciation.</description>

   <title>Finding Middle Ground: Sex Radicalism, Radical Feminism and Prostitution Law Reform in Canada</title>

   <subject>Feminism</subject>
   <description>In March of 2012, the Ontario Court of Appeal struck down two provisions of Canada’s prostitution laws—those that prohibit common bawdy houses and living off the avails of prostitution. The political and legal debate leading up to the contentious decision reflects the longstanding battle between sex radical and radical feminists. This essay will situate the current debate within the context of historical feminist campaigns for law reform and demonstrate the ways in which sex radical and radical feminist arguments were utilized in Bedford v. Canada 2010, and the subsequent appeal. The essay will conclude by considering the implications of repealing the provisions that prohibit bawdy houses and living off the avails, and by assessing the possibility of combining sex radical and radical feminist aims at eliminating the harm experienced by women involved in prostitution.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Art History) -- Queen's University, 2012-04-29 18:26:13.056</description>
   <description>The following study examines the artistic strategies of the Italian Baroque painter Mattia Preti (1613-99) in conjunction with their early reception in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Italy. In addition to studying the first descriptions of the painter's art and his early biographers' characterization of his style, Bernardo De Dominici's comprehensive "Vita del Cavalier Fra' Mattia Preti" is analyzed in order to establish Preti's place in the history of Neapolitan Baroque painting. In so doing, descriptions of the painter's art are compared and contrasted with those of his contemporaries. Following the investigation of the early sources and biographies, the painter's strategies are studied through selected paintings executed between circa 1650 and 1680. These include such works as the Aquila 'Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew', the London 'Wedding at Cana', the Naples 'Feast of Absalom', and the Siena 'Canonization of St. Catherine'. The case studies highlight a number of practices the artist used to distinguish himself from his peers. In sum, this study argues that the early biographical accounts, while only partially conveying the breadth of the painter's art, function as a point of departure for accessing and comprehensively examining his representational strategies. Ultimately, this dissertation demonstrates that Preti was an artist who actively and continuously experimented with a range of pictorial possibilities.</description>

   <description>Mining operations exploit mineral deposits, processing a portion of the extracted material to produce salable products. The concentration of valuable commodities within these deposits, or the grade, is heterogeneous. Not all material has sufficiently high grades to economically justify processing. Cut-off grade is the lowest grade at which material is considered ore and is processed to create a concentrated commodity product. The choice of cut-off grade at a mining project can be varied over time and dramatically impacts both the operation of the mine and the economics of the project.&#xd;
The majority of literature and the accepted industry practices focus on optimizing cut-off grade under known commodity prices. However, most mining operations sell their products into highly competitive global markets, which exhibit volatile commodity prices. Making planning decisions assuming that a given commodity price prediction is accurate can lead to sub-optimal cut-off grade strategies and inaccurate valuations. Some academic investigations have been conducted to optimize cut-off grade under stochastic or uncertain price conditions. These works made large simplifications in order to facilitate the computation of a solution. These simplifications mean that detailed mine planning data cannot be used and the complexities involved in many real world projects cannot be considered.&#xd;
A new method for optimizing cut-off grade under stochastic or uncertain prices is outlined and demonstrated. The model presented makes use of theory from the field of Real Options and is designed to incorporate real mine planning data. The model introduces two key innovations. The first is the method in which it handles the cut-off grade determination. The second innovation is the use of a stochastic price model of the entire futures curve and not simply a stocastic spot price model. The model is applied to two cases. The first uses public data from a National Instrument 43-101 report. The second case uses highly detailed, confidential data, provided by a mining company from one of their operating mines.</description>

   <description>Developing high quality software is of eminent importance to keep the existing customers satisfied and to remain competitive. One of the most important software quality characteristics is performance, which defines how fast and/or efficiently a software can perform its operation.&#xd;
&#xd;
While several studies have shown that field problems are often due to performance issues instead of feature bugs, prior research typically treats all bugs as similar when studying various aspects of software quality (e.g., predicting the time to fix a bug) or focused on other types of bug (e.g., security bugs). There is little work that studies performance bugs.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we perform an empirical study to quantitatively and qualitatively examine performance bugs in the Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome web browser projects in order to find out if performance bugs are really different from other bugs in practice and to understand the rationale behind those differences.&#xd;
&#xd;
In our quantitative study, we find that performance bugs of the Firefox project take longer time to fix, are fixed by more experienced developers, and require changes to more lines of code. We also study performance bugs relative to security bugs, since security bugs have been extensively studied separately in the past. We find that security bugs are re-opened and tossed more often, are fixed and triaged faster, are fixed by more experienced developers, and are assigned more number of developers in the Firefox project. Google Chrome project also shows different quantitative characteristics between performance and non-performance bugs and from the Firefox project.&#xd;
&#xd;
Based on our quantitative results, we look at that data from a qualitative point of view. As one of our most interesting observation, we find that end-users are often frustrated with performance problems and often threaten to switch to competing software products.&#xd;
&#xd;
To better understand, the rationale for some users being very frustrated (even threatening to switch product) even though most systems are well tested, we performed an additional study. In this final study, we explore a global perspective vs a user centric perspective of analyzing performance data. We find that a user-centric perspective might lead to a small number of users with considerably poor performance while the global perspective might show good or same performance across releases.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results of our studies show that performance bugs are different and should be studied separately in large scale software systems to improve the quality assurance processes related to software performance.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2012-04-30 18:16:04.05</description>
   <description>Latent topic models are statistical structures in which a "latent topic" describes some relationship between parts of the data.  Co-maintenance is defined as an observable property of software systems under source control in which source code fragments are modified together in some time frame.  When topic models are applied to software systems, latent topics emerge from code fragments.  However, it is not yet known what these latent topics mean.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this research, we analyse software maintenance history, and show that latent topics often correspond to code fragments that are maintained together.  Moreover, we show that latent topic models can identify such co-maintenance relationships even with no supervision.  We can use this correlation both to categorize and understand maintenance history, and to predict future co-maintenance in practice.  The relationship between co-maintenance and topics is directly analysed within changelists, with respect to both local pairwise code fragment similarity and global system-wide fragment similarity.  This analysis is used to evaluate topic models used with a domain-specific programming language for web service similarity detection, and to estimate appropriate topic counts for modelling source code.</description>

   <description>Advances in smart technologies, wireless networking, and increased interest in contextual services have led to the emergence of ubiquitous and pervasive computing as one of the most promising areas of computing in recent years.  Smart Spaces, in particular, have gained significant interest within the research community. Currently, most Smart Spaces rely on physical components, such as sensors, to acquire information about the real-world environment. Although current sensor networks can acquire some useful contextual information from the physical environment, their information resources are often limited, and the data acquired is often unreliable.  We argue that by introducing social network information into such systems, smarter and more adaptive spaces can be created. Social networks have recently become extremely popular, and are now an integral part of millions of people’s daily lives. Through social networks, users create profiles, build relationships, and join groups, forming intermingled sets and communities. Social Networks contain a wealth of information, which, if exploited properly, can lead to a whole new level of smart contextual services. A mechanism is therefore needed to extract data from heterogeneous social networks, to link profiles across different networks, and to aggregate the data obtained. We therefore propose the design and implementation of a Smart Spaces framework that utilizes the social context. In order to manage services and sessions, we integrate our system with the IP Multimedia Subsystem. Our system, which we call SocioSpace, includes full design and implementation of all components, including the central server, the location management system, the social network interfacing system, the service delivery platform, and user agents. We have built a prototype for proof of concept and carried out exhaustive performance analysis; the results show that SocioSpace is scalable, extensible, and fault-tolerant. It is capable of creating Smart Spaces that can truly deliver adaptive services that enhance the users’ overall experience, increase their satisfaction, and make the surroundings more beneficial and interesting to them.</description>

   <description>We study bifurcations of periodic solutions with spatio-temporal symmetries of functional differential equations (FDEs). The two main results are: (1) a centre manifold reduction around a periodic solution of FDEs with spatio-temporal symmetries, and (2) symmetry-breaking bifurcations for symmetric rings of delay-coupled lasers.&#xd;

For the case of ODEs, symmetry-breaking bifurcations from periodic solutions has already been studied. We extend this result to the case of symmetric FDEs using a Centre Manifold Theorem for symmetric FDEs which reduces FDEs into ODEs on an integral manifold around a periodic solution. We show that the integral manifold is invariant under the spatio-temporal symmetries which guarantees that the symmetry structure of the system of FDEs is preserved by this reduction.&#xd;
 &#xd;
We also consider a problem in rings of delay-coupled lasers modeled using the Lang-Kobayashi rate equations. We classify the symmetry of bifurcating branches of solutions from steady-state and Hopf bifurcations that occur in 3-laser systems. This involves finding isotropy subgroups of the symmetry group of the system, and then using the Equivariant Branching Lemma and the Equivariant Hopf Theorem. We then utilize this result to find the bifurcating branches of solutions in DDE-Biftool. Symmetry often causes eigenvalues to have multiplicity, and in some cases, this could lead DDE-Biftool to incorrectly predict the bifurcation points. We address this issue by developing a method of finding bifurcation points which can be used for the general case of n-laser systems with unidirectional and bidirectional coupling.</description>

   <description>In this work we present a traffic information dissemination system that seeks to&#xd;
deliver relevant traffic information to drivers to help make their driving experience&#xd;
more efficient, pleasant and safe. The system uses the crowd of drivers as the main&#xd;
source of information. The crowd reports information about traffic either directly to&#xd;
our system’s central server or to social networks. In case the information is reported&#xd;
to a social network our system architecture allows the integration of social networks as&#xd;
a traffic information source. It also allows the integration of other traffic information&#xd;
sources such as local traffic monitoring agencies. Our system aggregates all traffic&#xd;
information and delivers it to drivers subscribed to the system when they demand&#xd;
it. In addition, our system provides an efficient navigation service that it takes&#xd;
into account the current traffic conditions when planning a route. Furthermore, it&#xd;
periodically checks if there are new traffic events that appear on the user’s current&#xd;
route in which case the system will automatically give the user an alternate route.&#xd;
We implement a prototype of our system that use the social networks as a traffic&#xd;
information source and through the prototype evaluation we show that the prototype&#xd;
of our system indeed delivers relevant traffic information to drivers and performs&#xd;
intelligent navigation.</description>

   <description>The grid connected PV plants comprising of the PV cells and the power electronic inverters are a widely used technology in distributed power generation systems based on renewable energy sources. Microinverters form an extensive part of the ongoing research in this field. This thesis focuses on the inverter section of the microinverter.  The cost and efficiency of the grid connected inverter is a chief contributing factor in the overall system price. &#xd;
&#xd;
The MOSFETs used in the DC/AC inverter are usually hard switched causing a lot of EMI noise and losses in the inverter. This is true for both, single and three phase inverters. A low switching frequency is desirable to increase the efficiency, which in turn imposes a large compromise in designing the output filter. In this thesis, switching losses have been minimized by incorporating zero voltage switching at switch turn on and variable dead-time control at switch turn off. The soft switching technique is based on control algorithms and involves no use of any auxiliary circuit. Also, the size of the output filter is reduced without increasing the switching frequency, by employing multiple paralleled inverters. The interleaving technique that is usually used in dc/dc converters is extended for dc/ac inverters and is well employed to maintain the quality of the current fed into the utility grid. In this way, at low switching frequency, high efficiency and reduced cost and sizes are achieved.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The study is validated through simulation and lab experiments. The novel control circuit was first implemented using analog circuitry. After assessing the performance of the analog version of the proposed controller, it was then digitally implemented through the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technique.</description>

   <description>There is an international effort to develop smart grids to overcome the problems caused by aging power grids. However, to immigrate to the new grid, the IT infrastructure has to be integrated with the current power grid. There is currently an ongoing debate surrounding what would be the best choice for smart grid communication technology. One of the promising communication technologies for smart grid realization is powerline communication (PLC). PLC provides utilities the opportunity of managing their own network infrastructure. Power cables are everywhere; even rural areas are covered with power cables. However, because of its noisy environment and the low capacity of narrowband powerline communication (NBPLC), its viability for smart grid realization is being questioned. To investigate this issue, smart grid communication network requirements and powerline communication technologies and channel models are studied. Then, using MATLAB and Network Simulator-2, powerline communication and a smart grid communication network (SGCN) are simulated. The performance of different powerline channels for smart grid realization is investigated and a viable PLC infrastructure for smart grid communication network is proposed. Furthermore, to have a better understanding of the viability of powerline communication for the smart grid, some future smart grid advanced applications are investigated and integrated to the system. It is shown that although two types of powerline channels do not perform well, the proposed powerline communication infrastructure, even under advanced traffic, is capable of providing the smart grid with its communication prerequisites.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-04-30 16:01:28.916</description>
   <description>Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is a dynamic technique that possesses tremendous potential for the synthesis of novel polymeric materials not possible through conventional free radical polymerization. However, its use on an industrial scale has been limited by the high level of transition metal complex required. Significant advances have been made in the last 5 years towards lowering the level of copper complexes used in ATRP, resulting in novel variants called “activator regenerated by electron transfer” (ARGET) and “single electron transfer-living radical polymerization” (SET-LRP).&#xd;
To fully realize the potential of ATRP, its use in industrially relevant processes must be studied. Continuous processes such as tubular flow reactors and stirred tank reactors (CSTR) can reduce waste, improve productivity and facilitate process scale-up when compared to common batch reactors. The combination of low copper concentration ATRP techniques and continuous processes are especially attractive towards the design of a commercially viable process. This thesis presents a study into ARGET ATRP and SET-LRP as applied to continuous tubular and stirred tank reactors for the production of acrylic and methacrylic polymers. &#xd;
The equilibrium which governs polymerization rate and control over molecular architecture is studied through batch ARGET ATRP experiments. The improved understanding of ARGET ATRP enabled the reduction of ligand from a 3 to 10 fold excess used previously down to a stoichiometric ratio to copper salts. ARGET ATRP was then adapted to a continuous tubular reactor, as well as to a semi-automated CSTR. The design of the reactors and the effect of reaction conditions such as reducing agent concentration and residence time are discussed.&#xd;
The use of common elemental copper(0) such as copper wire and copper tubing is also investigated with SET-LRP for room temperature polymerization of methyl acrylate. SET-LRP is adapted to a CSTR to observe the effects of residence time on reaction rate, molecular weight control as well as copper consumption rate. The use of copper tubing as a catalyst source for SET-LRP is demonstrated and the design of a continuous tubular reactor using a combination of copper and stainless steel tubing is discussed.</description>

   <description>The successful production of a wide range of polymer latex products relies on the ability to control the rates of particle nucleation, growth and coagulation in order to maintain control over the particle size distribution (PSD). The development of advanced population balance models (PBMs) has simplified this task at the laboratory scale, but commercialization remains challenging as it is difficult to maintain control over the composition (i.e. spatial distributions of reactant concentration) of larger reactors. &#xd;
&#xd;
The objective of this thesis is to develop and test a combined Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) -PBM hybrid modeling framework. This hybrid modeling framework can be used to study the impact of changes in process scale on product quality, as measured by the PSD. The modeling framework developed herein differs from previously-published frameworks in that it uses information computed from species tracking simulations to divide the reactor into a series of interconnected zones, thereby ensuring the reactor is zoned based on a mixing metric. Subsequently, an emulsion polymerization model is solved on this relatively course grid in order to determine the time evolution of the PSD. Examination of shear rate profiles generated using CFD simulation (at varying reactor scales) suggests that, dependent on conditions, mechanically-induced coagulation cannot be neglected at either the laboratory or the commercial scale. However, the coagulation models that are formulated to measure the contributions of both types of coagulation simultaneously are either computationally expensive or inaccurate. For this reason the decision was made to utilize a DLVO-coagulation model in the framework. The second part of the thesis focused on modeling the controlled coagulation of high solids content latexes. POLY3D, a CFD code designed to model the flow of non-Newtonian fluids, was modified to communicate directly with a multi-compartment PBM. The hybrid framework was shown to be well-suited for modeling the controlled coagulation of high solid content latexes in the laminar regime. It was found that changing the size of the reactor affected the latex PSD obtained at the end of the process.  In the third part of the thesis, the framework was adapted to work with Fluent, a commercial CFD code, in order to investigate the scale-up of a styrene emulsion polymerization reaction under isothermal conditions. The simulation results indicated that the ability to maintain good control of the PSD was inversely related to the reactor blend time. While the framework must be adapted further in order to model a wider range of polymerization processes, the value of the framework, in obtaining information that would otherwise be unavailable, was demonstrated.</description>

   <description>Sepsis-induced delayed gastric emptying is a significant clinical problem for patients in intensive care units worldwide. A series of studies were carried out to examine the nature and mechanisms of sepsis-induced delayed gastric emptying using a novel mouse model which used a standard food source&#xd;
and was devoid of upper gastrointestinal tract trauma and restraint.  Using this model, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection produced a dose-dependent decrease in&#xd;
gastric emptying which onset by one hour. LPS produced an alteration in mouse behavior and piloerection at 30 minutes, increased resting respiratory rate at 3 hours, and did not impact body temperature. The onset of sepsis-induced delayed gastric emptying was closer to those centrally-mediated&#xd;
clinical signs of sepsis (altered behavior and piloerection) than to the peripherally-mediated clinical signs (respiratory rate) suggesting a central mechanism. C-Fos activation of the area postrema (AP), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) was examined 30 minutes after LPS injection which is the onset time for sepsis-induced delayed gastric emptying. LPS exposure produced significantly more activated&#xd;
neurons in the AP and NTS, and less in the DMV. These results may suggest a central mechanism with the AP and NTS inhibiting the DMV. Examination of isolated strips of gastric antrum in a tissue bath showed a decreased contractile response to electrical field stimulation and carbachol after injection of LPS. This occurred at 18 hours&#xd;
post LPS injection, but not at 6 hours. Using the mouse model, sepsis-induced delayed gastric emptying was shown to be occurring at 6 hours when no difference in contractility was measurable suggesting&#xd;
intrinsic changes are not the cause.&#xd;
These studies suggest a new mechanistic paradigm for sepsis-induced delayed gastric emptying in which there is a biphasic response. This involves an initial rapid, centrally-mediated delay in gastric emptying occurring the first hour and followed by an intrinsic tissue-level response several hours later characterized by a decrease in gastric muscle contractility.</description>

   <description>The stratigraphic organization of clastic successions deposited during the early synrift phase is controlled by the rates of tectonic subsidence and the growth of the master faults, which, coupled with eustatic sea-level changes, control the generation of accommodation. The highly heterolithic, Lower Jurassic Upper Åre and Tilje succession (100 to 300 m thick), which occurs in the Halten Terrace of offshore Norway, represents an excellent example of ancient synrift deposits that accumulated within a NNE-SSW-oriented structurally controlled embayment where sedimentation was dominated by tidal currents, with secondary influence by river and wave processes. Overall, the Tilje was deposited in a deltaic setting near the lowstand shoreline, forming a shallowing-upward succession, which is organized in two, thick, tabular second-order sequences. These sequences are separated by two main sequence boundaries (SB2 and SB3) associated with two main rift-related tectonic pulses. The first pulse formed SB2 and is believed to have exerted a major regional control on the geomorphology of the basin, causing a change from an open, wave-dominated setting (upper Åre Fm.) to a funnel-shaped, tide-dominated setting in the Tilje Fm. SB2 shows shallow incision into the underlying Åre Fm., and the overlying sediment accumulated predominantly in a distributary-mouth-bar environment. Sequence 3 rests erosively on Sequence 2, and is characterized by proximal tidal-fluvial distributary-channel fills and mouth-bar deposits showing at least 2 main oblique to axial fluvial input points, one from the N-NW and a second one from the NE, with overall increase in wave influence and deepening toward the S. Local rapid subsidence of elongated narrow hangingwalls associated with the active master faults exerted a  subtle control on the succession thickness, as well as a local control on the location of the tidal-fluvial distributary channels by “tectonic axial funnelling” during the onset of the second-order base-level rises. The internal architecture and facies distribution are less complex than other thick tide-dominated successions worldwide, because the rate of creation of accommodation was sufficient to avoid channel amalgamation throughout most of the succession.</description>

   <description>Full-scale simulated live load tests were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting using a single-axle frame on 600-mm-inner-diameter reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) and corrugated steel pipe (CSP) when buried in dense, well-graded sand and gravel. Measurements of the RCP at nominal and working forces and beyond are reported for 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 m of soil cover above the pipe crown. The RCP experienced no cracking when buried at 0.3 m under nominal and working CL-625 and CL-800 single-axle design loads. At these loads, the vertical contraction of the pipe diameter was less than 0.08 and 0.10 mm and the largest tensile strains in the pipe were 75 and 100 με (50-60% of the cracking strain), respectively. A 0.15 (±0.05)-mm-wide axial crack developed at the inner crown in the presence of a 6 kNm/m circumferential bending moment (70% of the theoretical ultimate moment capacity) at the fully factored CL-625 load. This crack did not propagate or widen from 3 series of cyclic load-unload tests. At 1300 kN of applied load the change in pipe diameter was less than 3.5 mm. Increasing soil cover from 0.3 to 0.6 to 0.9 m reduced the circumferential crown bending moment from 6.0 to 3.9 to 2.1 kNm/m, respectively, at 400 kN of axle load. A 1.6- and a 2.8-mm-thick CSP were also subjected to axle loading. No yielding or limit states occurred in the 1.6-mm-thick CSP when buried 0.9-m-deep. However, at 0.6 m of cover a 300 kN axle load caused local yielding at the pipe crown. Increasing soil cover from 0.6 to 0.9 m decreased the vertical diameter change from -3.0 to -1.2 mm and the crown bending moment from 0.7 to 0.2 kNm/m (75% and 20% of the yield moment), respectively, at a 250 kN axle load. Deflections of the thicker CSP were less than the thinner pipe below the CL-625 single-axle load, however further increases in applied load produced a greater response in the thicker pipe, likely due to a haunch support issue. Shallow axle loading produced a greater 3-dimensional response and a larger bending effect in both CSPs.</description>

   <description>As Ontario is home to more than half of Canada’s immigrants (Statistics Canada, 2006), Ontario’s school enrolment is very diverse. Levin (2008) provided some statistics: 27 percent of the population of Ontario was born outside of Canada; 20 percent are visible minorities. Toronto, with approximately 40 percent of the province’s population, is one the most diverse urban areas in the world, and receives approximately 125,000 new immigrants each year from dozens of different countries. Accordingly, as the number of immigrant families in Toronto increases, it is increasingly important that teachers and administrators understand how immigrant parents want to be involved in their children’s education, and how to best support these parents’ needs and the needs of their children. The purpose of this case study was to examine the involvement of immigrant parents in one classroom. Specifically I examine: (a) how one school involved immigrant parents in their children’s education; (b) how immigrant parents perceive they have been involved; and (c) how immigrant parents want to be involved in their children’s education. This constructivist case study examined immigrant parent involvement from the perceptions of different stakeholders--the vice-principal, teacher and immigrant parents from the one teacher’s class. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the vice-principal and one teacher of one model middle school in the Toronto District School Board to elicit information about their school and their experiences related to immigrant parent involvement. In addition, a parent questionnaire was used to explore parents’ perceptions. The parent questionnaire was distributed to the one teacher’s class of parents (all but one who were immigrants). The data analysis revealed five core themes related to immigrant parent involvement. The educators suggested that parents lack the knowledge of how the Ontario education system functions, while the immigrant parents said that they were unaware of what is being asked of them or offered to them. No communications sent home to the parents were translated. Suggestions for future research and recommendations are offered to the school and school board in order to provide additional support to immigrant parents.</description>

   <title>Controls on lithofacies variability in Late Devonian, Cynthia Basin reefs, Nisku Formation, Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin</title>

   <description>The Late Devonian (Frasnian) Nisku Formation in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is a homoclinal ramp composed of four stacked carbonate cycles with reefs in both shallow-ramp and downslope settings. Nisku Formation deposits in the Cynthia Basin, a westward facing sub-basin, contain two distinctly different reef types. One is composed of well-developed coral communities, stromatoporoids, synsedimentary cement and few calcimicrobes whereas the other is composed of calcimicrobes, wafer stromatoporoids and little cement. Deposits along the northeastern rim of the Cynthia Basin, the focus of this study, contain diverse calcimicrobes including Girvanella, Rothpletzella and Renalcis. Twelve lithofacies are documented and consist primarily of calcimicrobe-dominated reef-building communities which typify the first type of Cynthia Basin reefs. These deposits lack the reef-building fauna of corals and massive stromatoporoids common in southern Cynthia Basin reefs and older successions. The difference between coral-stromatoporoid and calcimicrobial communities is interpreted to be a result of increasing nutrient levels during basin restriction and shelf progradation. The nutrification can be linked to relative sea-level change as well as basin geometry and is thought to have been sourced primarily from terrestrial runoff along the northern margin of the basin. This study provides evidence that trophic resource variation could have contributed more to the development of calcimicrobe-dominated lithofacies in Devonian systems than has been previously documented.</description>

   <description>The overall objective of this thesis was to understand better the mechanisms that shape the diversity in colour vision of fish, and to explore the adaptive significance of this divergence. Among the vertebrates, teleost fish show the greatest diversity in colour vision systems. The cichlid model system illustrates that the visual system of fish may differ among species, sexes, individuals, and life stages of individuals. The large number of available cone opsin genes, which have resulted from multiple opsin gene duplications, facilitates this high degree of variation in the mechanisms of colour vision. In general, cichlids possessed complements of four to five cone pigments, and these complements varied across species, sexes, and individuals. Additionally, lens transmission, cone pigment expression, post-receptoral sensitivity, and retinal circuitry differed across life stages of individuals. My results suggest that the diversification of colour vision across species and across life stages of individuals contributes to sensory adaptations that enhance both the contrast of zooplanktonic prey, and the detection of optical signals from conspecifics. Therefore, both natural and sexual selection may have worked in concert to shape colour vision in fish. Since light is more complex under water than on land, fish required four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signals reflected from aquatic objects. This suggests that the large number of cone pigments in fish have likely evolved to enhance the reconstruction of the complex colour-signals in aquatic environments. Taken together, these findings improve our understanding of the variable nature of fish colour vision, and, more generally, help unravel the evolution of photoreceptors and colour vision.</description>

   <description>Three dimensional laser scanning, also known as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has quickly been expanding in its applications in the field of geological engineering due to its ability to rapidly acquire highly accurate three dimensional positional data.  Recently is has been shown that LiDAR scanning can be easily integrated into an excavation sequence in an underground environment for the purpose of collecting rockmass and discontinuity information.  As scans are often taken multiple times of the same environment, the next logical application of LiDAR scanning is for monitoring for change and deformation.&#xd;
Traditionally, deformation and change in an underground environment is measured using a series of five or more permanent control points installed around the profile of an excavation.  Using LiDAR for profile analysis provides many benefits as compared to traditional monitoring techniques.  Due to the high density of the point cloud data, the change in profile is able to be fully characterized, and areas of anomalous movement can easily be separated from overall closure trends.  Furthermore, monitoring with LiDAR does not require the permanent installation of control points, therefore monitoring can be completed more quickly after excavation, and scanning is non-invasive therefore no damage is done during the installation of  temporary control points.&#xd;
The main drawback of using LiDAR scanning for deformation monitoring is that the raw point accuracy is generally the same magnitude as the smallest level of deformations that need to be measured.  To overcome this, statistical techniques for profile analysis must be developed.  This thesis outlines the development one such method, called the Elliptical Fit Analysis (EFA) and LiDAR Profile Analysis (EFA) for tunnel and shaft convergence analysis.  Testing of the EFA and LPA has proved the robustness of this technique in its ability to deal with accuracy and precision issues associated with LiDAR scanning.</description>

   <description>An ice nucleating protein (INP) with 66% amino acid sequence identity to the better-known INP of Pseudomonas syringae has been described in an environmental isolate of P. borealis and designated InaPb. Despite the fact that INPs are classified as ice-binding proteins, InaPb showed little affinity for pre-formed ice and showed incorporation rates similar to Ina- strains. Additionally, it appeared to lack in the ability to shape ice or limit its growth. However, it was an effective ice nucleator. Using the coding sequence for InaPb and a green fluorescent protein tag (GFP), an InaPb-GFP fusion protein construct was inserted into a broad host expression vector in order to visualize the expression and localization of the protein in E. coli and an Ina- strain of P.syringae. The InaPb-GFP protein appears to localize at the poles of E. coli, but the nucleation temperature for these cells was only marginally above -9°C, which indicated poor nucleation activity. When expressed in Ina- P. syringae, the proteins showed clustering throughout the cell and an increased ability to nucleate ice following cold conditioning. The ability to nucleate ice was further increased by the removal of the GFP tag resulting in an average nucleation temperature more consistent with that seen in the native host P. borealis. Since inaPb transcript levels did not appear to change after cold conditioning, the clustering seen using fluorescence microscopy was likely the result of increased aggregation of protein in the membrane. Most INP-&#xd;
producing bacteria are associated with plant disease, but experiments with P. borealis suggested that the Ina+ phenotype was not indicative of pathogenicity in this strain. It is hoped that my contribution to the functional characterization of this INP will lead to a better understanding of these special proteins and their importance to the handful of bacteria that exhibit this activity.</description>

   <description>This dissertation adds to the literature on international openness and economic growth by studying and quantifying the effects of openness to trade and multinational production using a model of endogenous innovation with firm heterogeneity. The first chapter discusses the contribution of this dissertation to the theoretical and empirical literature on international openness. The second chapter studies and quantifies the long-run effects of openness to trade and multinational production in the context of advanced economies using a model of endogenous innovation with firm heterogeneity. Counterfactual experiments conducted using a calibrated version of a theoretical model find that the US would experience a significant welfare cost in consumption terms by restricting openness to both trade and horizontal multinational production with other OECD countries, with the growth effect accounting for a substantial part of the cost.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapter Three extends the theoretical model presented in Chapter Two to include features specific to the North-South context. I show that allowing for the possibility that the South may switch from being an imitator to becoming an innovator is essential for examining the long-run growth effect of stronger intellectual property rights. In particular, the North and the South both prefer stronger intellectual property rights because this will achieve the fastest long-run economic growth. If the South is an imitator country, the North needs to maintain its absolute advantage in technology creation by maintaining a sufficiently large pool of uncopied ideas. Otherwise both countries will fall into a slow-growth equilibrium in the long run.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter Four, I account for transitional dynamics and study the gains from openness and stronger intellectual property rights that arise in the North-South context. Counterfactual experiments based on a calibrated version of the model presented in Chapter Three find that the transitional welfare gains from further trade openness between China and the OECD countries can be significant. In contrast to the existing growth literature, a deterrence of imitation has limited welfare effects when the South can switch from being an imitator to becoming an innovator country. This points to a source of potential bias in the welfare estimates provided by the existing literature.</description>

   <description>Henrietta Maria and Marie Antoinette: Queenship and Revolution in Early Modern Europe analyzes Henrietta Maria and Marie Antoinette in a thematic framework, focussing on the dialogue between their perceptions of themselves as heads of households, wives, and mothers and the expectations of their husbands’ subjects concerning the Queen Consort’s performance of these roles. The public nature of the Queen Consort’s position transformed the choices Henrietta Maria and Marie Antoinette made as wives and mothers into political acts with lasting implications for their respective royal houses. Both Queens approached their roles in a manner that ultimately contributed to the collapse of monarchical government. The question of the Queen’s actual activities and her contribution to popular discourse has been particularly neglected as the symbolism of Henrietta Maria, and especially Marie Antoinette has received more recent scholarly attention while discussion of each Queen’s actual motives has been relegated to popular biographies. The juxtaposition of the Queen’s own intentions with the expectations of her husband’s subjects provides a more complete picture of the ideological conflicts centering on the consort.&#xd;
These points of similarity and the comparative structure deepen the understanding of Henrietta Maria’s impeachment and Marie Antoinette’s trial because the juxtaposition of the two events reveals the continuous presence of the Queen Consort as a divisive figure throughout the Early Modern period. The comparison also demonstrates that both Queens attempted to actively shape their reputations according to the perceived extent of the public sphere in their lifetimes. Each Queen’s engagement with the charges levelled against her reveals the boundaries of public life in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Comparative analysis of the experiences of the two Queens illuminates changes in the perception of monarchy, the place of women within their families, the public sphere and ideas of foreignness that occurred over the course of Early Modern European history.</description>

   <title>A Computational Approach to Predicting Distance Maps from Contact Maps</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2012-05-23 13:59:28.12</description>
   <description>One approach to protein structure prediction is to first predict from sequence, a thresholded and binary 2D representation of a protein's topology known as a contact map. Then, the predicted contact map can be used as distance constraints to construct a 3D structure. We focus on the latter half of the process and aim to obtain a set of non-binary distance constraints from contacts maps. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis proposes an approach to extend the traditional binary definition of “in contact” by incorporating fuzzy logic to construct fuzzy contact maps from a set of contact maps at different thresholds, providing a vehicle for error handling. Then, a novel template-based similarity search and distance geometry methods were applied to predict distance constraints in the form of a distance map. The three-dimensional coordinates were then calculated from the predicted distance constraints. Experiments were conducted to test our approach for various levels of noise. As well, we compare the performance of fuzzy contact maps to binary contact maps in the framework of our methodology.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our results showed that fuzzy contact map similarity was indicative of distance map similarity. Thus, we were able to retrieved similar distance map regions using fuzzy contact map similarity. The retrieved distance map regions provided a good starting point for adaptation and allowed for the extrapolation of missing distance values. We were thus able to predict distance maps from which, the three-dimensional coordinates were able to be calculated. Testing of this framework on binary contact maps revealed that fuzzy contact maps had better performance with or without noise due to a stronger correlation between fuzzy contact map similarity and distance map similarity. Thus, the methodology described in this thesis is able to predict good distance maps from fuzzy contact maps in the presence of noise and the resulting coordinates were highly correlated to the performance of the predicted distance maps.</description>

   <description>The aim of this thesis is to determine the feasibility of an injectable delivery system based on 5-ethylene ketal ε-caprolactone for localized delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for treating critical limb ischemia. HGF and VEGF were chosen because of their ability to simultaneously stimulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, to initiate the formation of blood vessels and the recruitment of pericytes to stabilize the blood vessels. Homopolymer of 5-ethylene ketal ε-caprolactone and its copolymer with D,L-Lactide were synthesized by ring opening polymerization using hydrophobic initiator (octan-1-ol) or an hydrophilic initiator (MPEG), and stannous octanoate as a co-initiator/catalyst. The resulting polymers were amorphous and viscous liquids at room temperature. The viscosity, biodegradation rate, and release rate were varied by copolymerizing with D,L-lactide and/or initiating with MPEG or octan-1-ol.  In vitro, the polymers degraded with surface erosion characterized by a nearly linear mass loss with time with no significant change in number average molecular weight and glass transition temperature.  The ratio of EKC to DLLA in the copolymer remained the same throughout the degradation studies. A similar degradation mechanism was observed in vivo when the copolymer initiated with octan-1-ol was implanted subcutaneously in rats. In vivo, the polymer exhibited a moderate chronic inflammatory response, characterized by the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts and fibrous capsule formation. The inflammatory response decreased with time but was still on going after 18 weeks of subcutaneous implantation. Protein release from the polymer was transported by convection through the hydrated polymer region, at a rate determined by the osmotic pressure generated and the hydraulic conductivity of the polymer. Highly bioactive VEGF and HGF were released in a sustained manner, without burst effect for over 41 days when delivered simultaneously, using the osmotic release mechanism. VEGF was released at the rate of 36 ± 7 ng/day for 41 days, while HGF was released at the rate of 16 ± 2 ng/day for 70 days. Factors that influenced release of proteins were their solubility in the concentrated trehalose solution and hydraulic permeability of the polymer. This delivery system can serve as a potential vehicle for controlled release of VEGF and HGF for treating critical limb ischemia or the controlled release of other proteins for other clinical applications.</description>

   <description>Diarylamines (Ar2NH) and phenols (ArOH) comprise the bulk of radical-trapping antioxidant (RTA) additives to petroleum-derived products, owing to their ability to slow hydrocarbon autoxidation through rate-controlling inhibition reactions. While much work has been done to optimize and understand structure-activity relationships of phenolic antioxidants, optimization of highly-reactive diarylamine antioxidants has been comparatively difficult due to their propensity to undergo one-electron oxidation with molecular oxygen.  Recently, it was demonstrated that incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the aromatic ring of phenolic antioxidants greatly improves their stability to one-electron oxidation without compromising their antioxidant efficacy. Given these results, it was our supposition that this approach could be extended to the development of highly reactive diarylamine RTAs.&#xd;
Herein we describe the synthesis of a small library of pyridine- and pyrimidine-containing diarylamines and characterize their thermodynamic properties (standard potentials (E°) and N-H bond dissociation enthalpies) as well as their kinetic properties (rate constants for reactions with peroxyl and alkyl radicals) – demonstrating that the approach of N-atom incorporation is also very effective at increasing diarylamines’ stability to one-electron oxidation without compromising their antioxidant efficacy. In fact, the diarylamines described herein are among the best peroxyl-radical trapping antioxidants known, having inhibition rate constants ca. 200-fold greater than the current industry standard.  Through a series of mechanistic studies (measuring Arrhenius parameters, kinetic solvent effects, deuterium kinetic isotope effects and transition state calculations) we have provided strong evidence that reactions between electron-rich diarylamines and peroxyl radicals occur by a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism.&#xd;
The reaction of diarylamines with peroxyl radicals at elevated temperatures (>160 °C) is highly relevant industrially, as this reflects the operating environment of lubricants in engine applications. At these temperatures, diarylamines are known to react catalytically as peroxyl trapping RTAs, although the mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated for this important chemistry. Current methods of studying high temperature oxidations suffer from time-consuming and/or air-sensitive analytical methods (e.g. iodometry, GC analysis). To enable rapid, accurate mechanistic studies at high temperature, we have improved the analytical component by developing a fluorescent dye that can be applied in an assay to determine hydroperoxide concentrations in solution in real-time.</description>

   <description>With continually increasing concern over anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and their effect on global climate, the search for alternative fuels, especially for mobile applications such as in vehicles, is of immediate concern. Herein, research towards hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier is discussed; first, with the investigation of “hybrid” hydrogen storage systems that are meant to provide hydrogen for a fully fuel cell powered vehicle via a chemical reaction; and second, that of a thermally regenerative fuel cell system (TRFC) to partially supplant the energy needs of transport trucks by harnessing engine waste heat.&#xd;
Hybrid storage systems are comprised of a heterocyclic carrier that undergoes endothermic hydrogen release (indoline) and an organic hydride that undergoes exothermic release (amine boranes).  Different embodiments are considered, varying in the mechanism of exothermic release (thermolysis vs. hydrolysis) and the mode of combination (physical vs. chemical).  A thorough investigation into the effect of catalyst, sterics and temperature on the heterogeneously catalyzed dehydrogenation rate of N-heterocycles was executed.  A number of trends with respect to the catalyst identity and the level of steric protection around the nitrogen atom were observed. &#xd;
The study towards a TRFC involved an investigation of the heterogeneous hydrogenation of benzylic ketones.  Screening of a myriad of different catalysts was performed, including those with various supports, metals and modifications, and the examination of how both the sterics and electronics of the ketone affect the hydrogenation rate.  A rapid hydrogenation at relatively low metal loadings and hydrogen pressures with extreme selectivity (>99.9%) is required.  To date, however, such a combination has been elusive.  The best selectivity was obtained with commercial Pd/SiO2 (99.99%), yet at a low conversion of 6%, after 1 h under 1 atm of H2 at 100 ˚C.  In addition to the poor conversion, SiO2 is not electronically conductive and is therefore not fit for this application.  The best viable catalyst, then, was a Pd/Vulcan XC-72 (carbon) catalyst made by the author with an observed 14% conversion and 98% selectivity under the same conditions.  However, trends in activity and selectivity with respect to the catalyst and ketone have been characterized herein.</description>

   <description>Professional development includes the planned and unplanned activities that teachers engage in throughout their career to enhance the quality of instruction in their classrooms (Day, 1997). The attentive processes of engagement are described as being physically, emotionally, and cognitively present (Kahn, 1992). Engagement in professional development is strongly related to the level of commitment teachers have to their teaching profession (Rothwell &amp; Herbert, 2007). Being engaged in professional development is necessary because it requires that teachers take responsibility for their learning, and believe that professional development practices will positively contribute to their career (McDonald, 2009).  &#xd;
The purpose of this research was to understand the role of colleagues in teachers’ engagement in professional development. This study is situated within the conceptual framework of school culture. School cultures are sustaining patterns built over time through rituals, traditions, and accomplishments that enforce actions, feelings, and thought patterns of members (Deal &amp; Peterson, 2009). One cannot have strong and effective professional development without a thick culture (Hopkins, 1994; Little, 1982). Thickness in culture is often forgotten but foundational for engagement in professional development activities (Glover &amp; Coleman, 2005).  &#xd;
This study is an examination of teachers’ perceptions in two schools: one school that showed exemplary collaboration among its staff and one school that was becoming a more collaborative school. Collaboration is understood as working in cohesion to achieve a common goal (Deal &amp; Peterson, 2009; Fullan &amp; Hargreaves, 1996; Little, 1982; Schlechty, 2009). One focus group with teachers at each school, with follow-up individual interviews, provided the data explaining colleagues’ influences on engagement in professional development.  &#xd;
The findings of this study suggest that colleagues have an important effect on teachers’ engagement in professional development. Participants indicated that colleagues were a factor of engagement because they increased engagement through fulfilling their desire for face-to-face instruction, through their appreciation of being worked with, rather than worked on (Morewood &amp; Bean, 2009), and through networking. As teacher participants worked together in professional development, they increased their school’s organizational capacity (Mitchell &amp; Sackney, 2001).</description>

   <description>Background:&#xd;
     Vaccines have been hypothesized in the etiology of autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes.  There are cases of diabetes reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following the administration of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, however this potential association has yet to be investigated.  The objective of this thesis was to determine whether there is an association between immunization against HPV and the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus in grade 8 girls eligible for Ontario’s vaccination program.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods:&#xd;
     A retrospective, population-based, cohort study of girls residing within an Ontario health unit and eligible for the province’s publicly funded school-based HPV vaccination program between 2007 and 2010 was executed using provincial administrative health databases and the Immunization Recording Information System (IRIS) database.  To control for known, unknown and unmeasured time-independent confounders, a self-controlled case series analysis was conducted.  The relative incidence and 95% confidence interval were estimated using conditional Poisson regression.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Results:&#xd;
     The study cohort was comprised of 3465 girls with a mean age of 13.2 years at cohort entry (range 12.7 to 13.6 years).  The mean duration of follow up was 2.7 years and ranged from 1.6 to 3.6 years.  The proportion of girls who received at least one dose of the qHPV vaccine during the observation period was 58.3% (n=2020).  During the study follow-up 15 cases of new onset type 1 diabetes were observed, six of which were classified as etiologically exposed to the qHPV vaccine.  Using an indefinite risk window, immunization with the qHPV vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes (age and season-adjusted RI 0.15; 95% CI 0.02-1.32).  &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions:&#xd;
     The results of this thesis regarding the risk of type 1 diabetes following immunization with the qHPV vaccine are inconclusive as a consequence of the small number of cases identified.  However, the random distribution of cases across time and across exposure status suggests that there is no association.  Before a definitive conclusion is reached the analysis must be re-conducted on a larger cohort.</description>

   <description>This work examines what constituted 19th century American military science, why it was framed within government policy and taught within the United States Military Academy, and how it became the early American way of war. The work uses as evidence a wide array of documents including biographical records of 2046 West Point graduates. It tracks the evolution of military science from Enlightenment Europe to the United States during the American Revolution and its relative obscurity until after the War of 1812. It then explains why a deliberate decision was made to transplant a French Napoleonic version of military science to serve as the curriculum of the military academy and to support the formulation of a national defense policy that called for militarized coastal frontiers and an “expansible army.” The work then follows how and why military science was modified during the period 1820-1860 in response to changes to the threats to the United States, changes related to state and federal plans for “internal improvements,” Indian wars, westward expansion, war with Mexico, and advances in military technology. Specifically it tracks how the doctrine of military science evolved from the teaching of specific Napoleonic applications to embrace subjects needed for war in North America. Inculcation in this American military science eventually came to provide the army with an officer corps that shared a common all-arms doctrine and common skill in using mathematics for military problem-solving. The majority of long-service graduates went on to spend years of their career fulfilling general staff, engineering, or academy instructor functions. The proliferation of military science through their work, and through published texts available to state volunteers, ensured that on the eve of the Civil War there existed a distinctly American, and scientific, way of war. This work challenges two  late 20th century liberal arts revisionist schools, championed by Samuel Huntington and Russell Weigley, that have unfairly reduced military science to near oblivion.</description>

   <description>The performance characteristics of a diesel fuel piloted syngas compression ignition engine are presented in this thesis. A stock Hatz 1D81 engine was converted to operate in dual fuel mode through the elimination of the governor system and addition of an in-cylinder pressure transducer and custom intake system to facilitate the mixing of the gaseous fuel and combustion air. The engine was run on a Superflow water brake dynamometer and benchmarked with diesel to compare against manufacturer specifications. This was followed by dual fuel operation on methane and syngas, with the results being compared through performance characteristics.&#xd;
When operated on methane, the engine attained higher peak in-cylinder pressures along with higher torque, power, and thermal efficiency values for equal equivalence ratios.  It was necessary to use greater amounts of syngas to reach comparable results with methane due to the lower energy content of syngas. The ignition delay was greater for syngas, and the onset of knock occurred earlier with syngas in comparison to methane. The heat release, Q, was comparable for both fuels and the exhaust gas emissions were significantly lower for operation with syngas. &#xd;
With emphasis on clean engine operation, syngas operation proved to be viable due to its renewable nature, significantly lower exhaust gas emissions, equal heat release characteristics, and larger useable operating range when compared to methane.</description>

   <title>EFFECTIVE READ-ALOUD PRACTICES: DEVELOPING ELEMENTARY STUDENTS’ VOCABULARY KNOWLEDGE THROUGH EFFECTIVE CLASSROOM READ-ALOUD PRACTICES</title>

   <description>The Ontario Ministry of Education (2003a, 2003b) mandates a daily teacher-led oral reading, known as a “read-aloud”.  A read-aloud is an oral delivery of a written text that involves teacher modeled or facilitated reading comprehension strategies before, during and after the reading (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2003a).  Providing students with new vocabulary is a purpose for reading-aloud that is outlined in the “Early Reading Strategy: The Report of the Expert Panel in Early Reading in Ontario” (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2003b).  As an integral part of literacy education, reading-aloud lacks specific instructional guidelines in key reading documents, and thus has the potential to vary in delivery and effectiveness.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The identification of vocabulary as a subcomponent skill of, and correlate to, reading comprehension (Biemiller, 2005; Oullette &amp; Beers, 2001; Wise et al., 2007) is the justification for focusing on students’ word knowledge.  A literature review on the connection between vocabulary and reading comprehension will demonstrate the research significance for using a read-aloud to develop student vocabulary.   &#xd;
&#xd;
A literature review describing read-aloud practices demonstrates that specific classroom practices correlate with increased vocabulary development.  These recommendations will be used to create a framework with which teachers can use their Ontario Curriculum Expectations as the foundation for their instruction, while ensuring a clear focus on the development of their student’s vocabulary knowledge.</description>

   <description>Learning and memory mechanisms that are normally related to natural rewards, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), may be usurped by the voluntary intake of drugs of abuse. The maladaptive behaviour that characterizes addiction is thought to arise from persistent changes in excitatory synaptic function in brain reward circuits. The oval region of the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBST) is one such region susceptible to drug-induced synaptic remodeling and is implicated in drug-driven behaviors, reinforcement and stress-induced relapse to drug-seeking. Using whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of ovBST neurons in brain slices prepared from adult Long-Evans rats, we demonstrated an unrestrained increase in AMPAR-mediated excitatory transmission with maintenance of cocaine self-administration. This is unlike self-administration of a natural reward, in which we observed an enhancement and then decline of AMPAR-mediated transmission with continued intake. Additionally, we demonstrate impairment in NMDAR-mediated LTD in ovBST neurons with cocaine self-administration. This impairment may be due to resilient GluN2B-containing NMDARs, as application of a GluN2B-antagonist rescued impaired LTD. Based on models of NMDAR-mediated bidirectional plasticity we suggest that a drug-induced de-regulation between GluN2A and GluN2B subunits impairs LTD, which may underlie the enhancement AMPAR-mediated transmission.</description>

   <description>This qualitative study explored the experiences of itinerant teachers supporting students who are Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing develop literacy skills using auditory and verbal strategies and specific visual teaching systems. Data was collected during semi-structured interviews which examined the experiences of the participants and how they accommodated Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students to acquire phonemic awareness and phonological processing. The data was analyzed and revisited until categories and sub-categories emerged.&#xd;
The findings are presented of four itinerant teachers who described their experiences supporting Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students educated within mainstream classroom settings. The participants supported Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students within a mainstream educational model with intervention-based support. Intervention was provided based upon student need. As well, the data revealed the participants provided education in-servicing to other teachers to help meet the needs of their Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students. Participants reported providing progress monitoring of students with lesser needs and servicing of assistive equipment. Data revealed the participants used an auditory and verbal approach to teaching literacy to Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students. This aligned with their school boards’ educational model and instructional approach.&#xd;
The pursuit of linguistic education within the Deaf community is distinctly different from that of the hearing world. Future research should investigate the experience of teachers in a provincial school for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing where a bi-cultural approach to literacy is found. Further, the influence of assistive technology, restorative technology, and hearing devices will interact with acquisition of phonemic&#xd;
iii&#xd;
awareness and phonological processing. How technology interacts and influences Deaf culture in relation to the persistence and continuation of American Sign Language as a form of communication may interest future researchers.</description>

   <description>Since the attacks of September 11th, 2001, the literature of the United States has become increasingly concerned with telling tragic stories. While the literature written about the attacks is considerable and operates as the climax in this dissertation, the literature of the ensuing decade has been marked by a return to tragic terror more broadly. A distinct feeling of anxiety and fear continues to animate a strong tragic tradition in the contemporary novel. Through an analysis of motifs, figures, and metaphors derived from classical dramatic sources and the attendant philosophical tradition, this dissertation investigates the complex formal processes through which tragic American lives occur and their political contexts. This dissertation argues that American literary production in the first decade of the twenty-first century requires a critical return to the so-called Myth and Symbol School that inaugurated American Studies and established an American literary tradition with New England Transcendentalists. Emerson’s claim that America must be made great through and by its ability to perceive “the terror of life” resonates in today’s post-9/11 political and economic climate. This study illuminates the ways that the contemporary novelists have seen fit to incorporate classical tropes and narratives into traditional stereotypes of identity and nationhood. Linguistic life, it might be said, directly influences political life. Tragic America is an aggregation of tragic manifestations that finds political extensions and interpretive applications through provisional and figurative relationships. Relationships negotiated through this metaphoric sensibility are, I believe, the only honest means of comparison in our radically heterogeneous culture.</description>

   <description>Given the current global crisis of deteriorating infrastructure, structural rehabilitation has been the focus of much recent research in the field of civil engineering.  Consequently, Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP’s) are becoming an increasingly common method for retrofitting deficient structures.  However, skepticism regarding the structural performance of FRP’s during fire is preventing their widespread implementation in building applications.  Because of the degradation of FRP material properties during heating, most current design codes completely neglect their structural contributions in fire design.  The intention of this research thesis is to investigate the thermal and mechanical behaviour of insulated FRP retrofitted reinforced concrete structures at elevated temperatures.&#xd;
Two intermediate-scale reinforced concrete slabs were first strengthened with FRP and protected with spray-on insulation.  Thermal results from fire testing of the slabs provided a basis on which to develop insulation schemes for larger specimens.  These larger specimens consisted of two full-scale T-Beams and two full-scale columns, which were also strengthened with FRP and insulated.  All of these specimens succeeded in obtaining four hour fire ratings upon fire testing.  Though the FRP strengthening systems were compromised quickly during heating, the insulation provided sufficient protection to the T-beams and columns for them to resist the applied service loads throughout the duration of fire exposure.  Detailed calculations were also conducted using thermal data from the full-scale specimen fire tests in order to predict the change in capacity of these structures with time. This thesis shows that, with careful considerations towards insulation and anchorage design, FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete structures are able to obtain fire ratings in excess of four hours.</description>

   <description>Cutaneous melanoma is an increasingly common skin cancer characterized by aggressive metastatic growth and poor prognosis. The mechanisms behind melanoma progression are not fully understood, but emerging evidence suggests that a group of newly discovered small regulatory RNAs, named microRNAs (miRNAs), plays an important role. miRNAs are ~ 22 nucleotide single strand non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to mRNA degradation and translation inhibition. Abnormal expression of miRNAs has been observed in human malignancies and is associated with tumorigenesis.  The main goals of this thesis are to investigate miRNA dysregulation in melanoma and to identify potential miRNAs involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Initially, the expression of 470 miRNAs was profiled in 8 metastatic melanoma and 8 benign nevus tissue samples. We discovered unique miRNA expression profiles and identified differentially expressed miRNAs in melanomas as compared to nevi. miR-193b was one of the most significantly downregulated miRNAs in melanoma, and its function and regulatory targets were unknown.  Subsequently, in vitro functional studies revealed that ectopic expression of miR-193b in melanoma cells drastically repressed cell proliferation and migration. Although it does not directly induce apoptosis in melanoma cells, miR-193b does sensitize these cells to ABT-737-mediated cell death. In concert with functional studies, gene expression analysis and in silico target prediction were performed to globally screen for mRNA targets of miR-193b. We identified eighteen genes as candidates in that they were downregulated by miR-193b and contained predicted miR-193b binding sites. Based on their known biological functions, three genes were particularly interesting: cyclin D1 (CCND1), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), and stathmin 1 (STMN1). CCND1 and Mcl-1 are two well-known melanoma oncogenes, and we validated their role in cell proliferation and apoptosis respectively. Furthermore, using similar approach, we were the first to identify STMN1 as a novel melanoma oncogene. We demonstrated that CCND1, Mcl-1, and STMN1 were directly regulated by miR-193b. During melanoma progression, reduced expression of miR-193b may promote cell proliferation, migration and survival.  Taken together, this thesis describes the dysregulation of miRNAs in melanoma and demonstrates that miR-193b functions as a tumor suppressor.</description>

   <description>Intimate relationships function not in isolation, but within a broader social network and social environment, in which the opinions and actions of close network members can play a role in how a relationship develops. The current study investigated how perceiving support for one’s relationship (including same-sex and mixed-sex relationships) from friends and family is associated with not only relationship well-being, but also the mental and physical health of the individuals within the relationship. After establishing that social support specifically for a relationship was indeed a separate and unique construct as compared to more general social support for an individual, the study tested a hypothesized model using structural equation modeling, finding evidence for a model in which the association between support for a relationship and the health outcomes for an individual is fully mediated by relationship well-being. Relationship type (i.e., same-sex versus mixed-sex) was not a significant moderator, indicating that regardless of relationship type, individuals who perceive more support for their relationship are also more likely to report greater relationship satisfaction and better mental and physical health. Furthermore, participants provided data up to three times over a period of three years, allowing for an examination of how social support for a relationship functions as a predictor of relationship well-being and health outcomes over time. Perceived social support for a relationship at Time 1 was found to be a significant predictor of the rate of relationship dissolution over the course of the study as well as relational and health outcomes at later points in time. With respect to the source of support for the relationship, evidence was found that support from parents and friends both have associations with relationship outcomes, but these findings were inconsistent across analyses with support from parents having stronger associations in some analyses and support from friends having stronger associations in others. Reasons for these discrepancies are discussed, as well as theoretical implications concerning the role that perceived social support for relationships plays in the prediction of relationship well-being and mental and physical health.</description>

   <description>The value of hierarchy as an essential trait of concept maps and a way to enhance recall is explored in this thesis. Undergraduate students (N = 40) were randomly assigned to one of two groups and completed an 18-question multiple-choice pre-test about the concept of animal physiology. Then each group studied one of two visual organizers that varied in the level of hierarchy used and finally both groups completed the same multiple-choice test. This research was guided by the following two research questions: Do undergraduate science students using expert-created concept maps differ in their ability to enhance their recall of information about animal physiology when compared to students using visual organizers with limited hierarchy?  How does prior knowledge affect the recall of students using concept maps and other visual organizers with limited hierarchy? &#xd;
    The data collected from the two groups was analyzed using regression analyses, ANOVA, and repeated-measures ANOVA. It was found that the hierarchical concept-mapping group grew more in their recall of information about animal physiology than the visual-organizer group [F(1,38) = 7.70, p = .009]. The results of these analyses were interpreted using the conceptual framework of cognitive load theory. This theory deals with the encumbrance on working memory that subsequently affects how one recalls information. The findings support the contention that hierarchical concept maps confer an advantage in the recall of science concepts when compared to visual organizers with limited hierarchy. This study lays the ground work for a doctoral study with 200 participants separated into four experimental groups (n = 50), with participants separated by high and low prior knowledge and the aforementioned visual organizers.</description>

   <title>Purinergic Component Involved in Long Vasodilatory Reflex in the Guinea Pig Small Intestine</title>

   <description>Submucosal arterioles in the small intestine are the main point of control for gastrointestinal (GI) circulation as they are the final resistance vessels feeding the highly perfused mucosal layer. Ischemia can lead to pathophysiology of a variety of GI tissues. In chronic intestinal inflammation, alterations in blood flow have been purported to be involved in disease etiology. The aim of this study was to characterize purinergic neurotransmitter pathways involved in physiological submucosal arteriole diameter control by the enteric nervous system long vasodilatory reflex (LVD) and to establish a protocol to determine how inflammatory neural changes affect vasodilation in the small intestine.&#xd;
Following euthanasia, segments of small intestine were harvested from adult male guinea pigs and changes in nerve stimulated small intestine submucosal arteriole diameter were identified using videomicroscopy techniques; vessels were preconstricted and nicotinic cholinergic transmission was blocked with hexamethonium. Purinergic receptor antagonists were applied. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to identify P2Y1 receptors localization. In a subset of experiments sensory neuronal excitability was initiated using phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) shown previously to induce hyperexcitability in the sensory neurons similar to changes found in intestinal inflammation. In these experiments, intestinal segments were placed into a novel dual chamber bath separated into two portions and PDBu was applied unilaterally. &#xd;
Blood vessel vasodilation was either abolished or decreased by both suramin (100 μM, n=6), a non-specific P2 purinergic antagonist. MRS 2179 (10 μM, n=5), a P2Y1 specific antagonist, also decreased vasodilation, which suggests that there is a purinergic neurotransmission component to the LVD mediated by P2 receptors, including the P2Y1 subtype. Immunohistochemistry identified P2Y1 receptor staining that was uniformly punctated in both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses but specific neuronal locations of the receptor could not be identified. Nerve stimulated vasodilation was not altered by application of PDBu suggesting that neuronal hypersensitivity did not modify vessel dilation. &#xd;
Taken together these data suggest that purinergic receptor pathways contribute to the LVD reflex under normal conditions however more experiments are still required to fully elucidate how these  pathways are affected /altered by intestinal inflammation.</description>

   <description>Working memory is the ability to store relevant information temporarily to guide future thought and behavior. It is a basic cognitive function instrumental to processes such as learning, reasoning, comprehension and mental arithmetic. Central to mental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are impairments in cognition including working memory. It is essential to understand working memory, if we want to understand human cognition and mental disorders.&#xd;
	A neural correlate of working memory has been identified as selective persistent activity during the retention intervals of tasks that probe working memory. The signal-to-noise ratio of persistent activity can be modulated by catecholamines, neuromodulators that are depleted in many mental disorders, including ADHD. Such modulations should be evident at the level of behavior, particularly as the demands imposed on working memory are increased. To test the contribution of catecholamines to working memory, we opted to administer methylphenidate to three female macaque monkeys. Methylphenidate is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that effectively increases their availability in the brain. By having monkeys perform a visual sequential comparison task, which allows the systematic manipulation of working memory load, we tested the hypothesis that increased catecholamine levels modulate task performance in a dose- and memory load-dependent way.&#xd;
	Systematic administration of a wide range of doses of methylphenidate (0.1 – 9 mg/kg) did not affect performance on the visual sequential comparison task in either a dose- or memory load-dependent manner. Given these results, we further tested the effects of methylphenidate on overt attention in a visual search task. Again, we did not observe a dose-dependent effect on performance. Nevertheless, methylphenidate was found to generally increase the monkeys’ motivation.&#xd;
	We suggest that the positive effect on motivation, elicited by an increased level of catecholamines, might have led to changes in performance observed in previous literature, but not to changes in the ability of retaining visual information per se. These findings question the previously suggested influence that catecholamines exert on cognition, and suggest that the role of catecholamines in working memory should be reevaluated.</description>

   <description>The invariant four-volume ($\mathcal V$) of a complete four-dimensional black hole (the volume of the spacetime at and interior to the horizon) diverges. However, if one considers the black hole resulting from the gravitational collapse of an object and integrates only a finite time to the future of the collapse, the resultant volume is well-defined and finite.  We show that for non-degenerate black holes, the volume in this case can be written as $\mathcal V \propto \ln|\lambda|$, where lambda is the affine generator of the horizon and we define our volume $\mathcal V^*$ to be the constant of proportionality.  In spherical symmetry, this is the Euclidean volume divided by the surface gravity ($\kappa$).&#xd;
&#xd;
More generally, it turns out that $\mathcal V^*$  is the Parikh volume $({}^3 \mathcal V^*)$ divided by $\kappa$.  This allows us to define an alternative local and invariant definition of the surface gravity of a stationary black hole.  It also encourages us to find a generalization of the Parikh volume (which depends on the existence of an asymptotically timelike Killing vector) to any region of space or spacetime of arbitrary dimension, provided that this space or spacetime contains a Killing vector.  We find some properties of this generalized ``Killing volume'' and rewrite our volume as a Killing volume for a particular Killing vector.&#xd;
&#xd;
We revisit the laws of black hole mechanics, considering them in terms of volumes rather than areas, by writing out our volume and the Parikh volume of Kerr-Newman black holes and then considering their variation with respect to the parameters $M$, $J$ and $Q$ to find a modified BH mechanics first law.  We also use our new definition of $\kappa$ to develop an alternate demonstration of the BH mechanics third law.  We note that the Parikh volume of a Kerr-Newman black hole is equal to $A r_+/3$, where $A$ is the horizon surface area and $r_+$ the value of the radius at the horizon, and we offer some interpretations of this relationship. We review some other relevant work by Parikh as well as some by Cveti\v{c} et al. and by Hayward.  We point out some possible next steps to follow up on the work in this thesis.</description>

   <description>Background: In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified long-term shift work as a probable human carcinogen; however, the mechanism through which shift work potentially increases cancer risk is not known. One hypothesis is that diminished melatonin production may be involved, possibly as a result of exposure to light during night work. Experimental studies suggest a link between melatonin and peptides in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family, also implicated in carcinogenesis. This research aimed to describe the distributions of circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and their associations with urinary melatonin as possible intermediates in the pathway between work at night and breast cancer.&#xd;
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 85 premenopausal nurses working a rotating shift pattern of two 12-hour days, two 12-hour nights, and five days off. Once during both the summer and winter seasons, melatonin metabolites were measured in urine samples and circulating concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were determined from serum samples. Weight and height were measured by the study coordinator, while a questionnaire and study diaries were used to collect all other covariate information. Predictors of IGF levels were identified using multivariate mixed effects modeling and relationships between melatonin and the IGFs were investigated using Spearman’s rank correlation and multivariate mixed effects modeling. &#xd;
Results: Both age (β = -3.6, p &lt; 0.0001) and current OC use (β = -40.8, p = 0.003) were associated with decreases in circulating IGF-I, while levels of IGF-I were increased in the winter months (β = 26.3, p = 0.02). A positive relationship between recent alcohol consumption and serum IGFBP-3 was also suggested (β = 197.8, p = 0.05). Neither Spearman’s rank correlations nor mixed effects modeling indicated that urinary melatonin was a determinant of serum IGFs.&#xd;
Conclusions: Age, season, and current OC use were observed to predict circulating IGF-I, while recent alcohol consumption was a determinant of IGFBP-3 levels. A relationship between melatonin and IGFs, theorized as a component of the mechanism linking shift work and cancer, was not supported by the results of this project.</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: The ventricular septal defect (VSD), a hole between the ventricles of the heart, is the most common birth defect. Despite its commonality, little is known about related in utero functional deficits. Furthermore, although about 80% of clinical VSD resolve within a year, the long-term effects after their resolution are unknown due to lack of clinical follow-up. Chemical treatment was used to induce VSD in the rat and to investigate their functional consequences both in utero and postnatally. METHODS: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered six 300mg/kg doses of dimethadione (DMO) by oral gavage every 12 hours beginning at 19h00 on gestational day (GD) 8 (Weston et al., 2011). DMO is the N-demethylated metabolite of the anticonvulsant trimethadione, a potent inducer of VSDs clinically and in laboratory animals. Fetal heart structure and function were examined with high-resolution ultrasound on GD 14, 15, 16, 17, and 21. A separate cohort of rats was dosed using the described paradigm, but offspring were allowed to reach parturition and mature naturally. Postnatal heart structure and function were assessed using telemetry (70 days postnatally), high-resolution ultrasound, and electrocardiography (ECG) (one year postnatally). RESULTS: Relative to controls, DMO-treated fetal rats had structural defects including VSD, an increased incidence of bradycardia (23 vs. 45%) and dysrhythmia (1.2 vs. 11%), and a reduction in cardiac output, stroke volume, and mean heart rate. Adult rats exposed to DMO in utero were more physically active, had elevated blood pressure, and had a higher incidence of dysrhythmia associated with ECG disturbances compared to controls. Both in utero and postnatal functional deficits occurred independent of septum patency. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational exposure to DMO disrupted cardiac function both in utero and postnatally, even in the absence of gross structural defects, indicating chemical exposures in utero may have permanent pathophysiological consequences on the heart.</description>

   <description>Children transform different spaces into their own special places by interacting with the physical and social environment (Hart, 1979; Rasmussen, 2004; Sobel, 1993/2002).  Special place research has focused largely on children’s place–making in neighbourhoods, including the process of finding and constructing forts, playhouses and dens in outdoor environments (Benson, 2009; Hart, 1979; Kylin, 2003; Sobel, 1993/2002).  The significant presence of schools in children’s everyday lives (Rasmussen, 2004), however, has encouraged some researchers to investigate what environmental conditions foster learning (Derr, 2006; Maxwell, 2006; O’Dell, 2011; Upitis, 2007), as well as how children use and experience social and physical aspects of these places (Einarsdottir, 2005; Peterson, 2009; Rathunde, 2003).  &#xd;
Although researchers recognize that learning environments have the potential to enhance learning by the presence of specific design elements, little is known about what constitutes places that elementary students characterize as special, and to which they become attached.  Some schools, including Montessori, claim to offer a uniquely prepared learning environment that enhances students’ development, though empirical studies that involve Montessori elementary programs predominantly use academic standardized test scores to compare them to other programs (Baines &amp; Snortum, 1973; Lopata, Wallace, &amp; Finn, 2005).&#xd;
The purpose of this study was to explore places at school that students characterized as special and to describe what aspects made them special.  This study used photo elicitation interviews, walking tours, and focus groups to explore 11 Grade 2 students’ special places in two Ontario learning environments: a privately funded, not-for-profit Montessori school and a publicly funded school.  &#xd;
Results demonstrated that Grade 2 students in both schools identified special places, both indoors and outdoors, for developing a sense of placeness; engaging in types of play; fostering and engaging in friendships; and having solititude and tranquility.  Further analysis revealed two underlying themes: places were special because they afforded students opportunities to be interdependent or independent.  Future research is necessary to determine the long-term significance of students’ special places in different learning environments.</description>

   <description>This thesis constructs a triangular model of the interrelationship between Deweyan Pragmatism(hereinafter referred to as DP), Confucianism and Marxism / Maoism by way of chronological analysis of three historical periods spanning the past nine decades, and discursive comparisons and contrasts between these ideologies. Specifically, this thesis examines the confrontation, denunciation, displacement, reconciliation and co-optation that have transpired between the three ideologies over the past ninety years. &#xd;
On the basis of the triangular push-or-pull model, propositions regarding the parameters and confines of DP application in contemporary Chinese education are put forward in order to extricate the Deweyites who are intent on transplanting DP to China in a wholesale manner out of their current theoretical paradox and methodical dilemma. &#xd;
The conclusion of this thesis is that the optimal roles for DP to play in contemporary Chinese education are supplementary tweaks at the technical level to the existing Confucian system, and DP will be effective only to the extent that the cumulative impact of Deweyan practice is not perceived as a challenge to the Chinese educational establishment.</description>

   <description>The toxic, persistent pesticide dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) was used liberally prior to and during the World Exposition of 1967 (Expo 67) on Île Sainte-Hélène in Montréal to reduce the population of nuisance Trichoptera insects (also called caddisflies or shadflies) in the area. Sixteen thousand kilograms were applied over six periods in two years. Despite reports by the project leaders that the practice was not detrimental to the ecosystem and that DDD was not detected downstream in significant concentrations following applications to the river, further investigation was required to determine the occurrence of the pesticide, and its concentrations. Given the large volume of pesticide that was applied to the river, I hypothesized that there would be a strong DDD signal in sediments downstream of the Expo 67 site. I obtained a sediment core from the bay of Île de Grâce at the mouth of Lac St Pierre in the St. Lawrence River, downstream of Montréal. The core was sliced, dated radioisometrically, and analysed for the presence of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and related pesticides using gas chromatography. The isotopes cesium-137 (137Cs), radium-226 (226Ra), and lead-210 (210Pb) were used to establish dates of sediment deposition. Loss on ignition was used to determine organic carbon content. Stable lead content was analysed because it may also support sediment ages. Concentrations of DDT, DDD, and dichlorodiphenylethylene (DDE) ranged from below the detection limit to 3.3 parts per billion (ppb), 57.7 ppb, and 17.1 ppb, respectively. Adjusting the concentrations to reflect organic carbon content did not significantly affect the trend in concentration by depth. Peaks in DDD concentrations and related compounds were discovered that correspond to the Expo 67 applications. These findings demonstrate that DDD was present in unusually high concentrations (well above the probable effect level of 8.51 ppb (Ontario Ministry of the Environment)) in the St. Lawrence River in 1967, potentially exposing a wide variety of organisms. This finding may also be used to inform future decisions regarding the management of the St. Lawrence Seaway. I also investigated the role of fragmentation, specialisation, and interdisciplinarity in this research, and critically examined the historical context of this project in order to pursue knowledge of this field with as full an understanding of it as possible.</description>

   <description>Maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is associated with alterations in fetal development that negatively impact the offspring causing neurochemical and neurobehavioural dysfunction termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; the most severe outcome is fetal alcohol syndrome.  Changes in maternal and fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, induction of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) enzyme activity and alterations in micronutrient status, including folate, following chronic ethanol exposure (CEE) are key contributors to the neuroendocrine and neurobehavioural effects observed in offspring.  This study tested the following hypotheses: Maternal consumption of ethanol throughout pregnancy can: alter maternal and fetal HPA axis function and induce CYP2E1 enzyme activity in the third-trimester-equivalent; decrease folate status in the maternal-fetal unit, which can be mitigated by folic acid supplementation; and cause neurobehavioural deficits in offspring at low-moderate dose of maternal ethanol consumption.  These hypotheses were tested in the guinea pig, a well established model of ethanol neurobehavioural teratogenicity.  CEE had no effect on maternal HPA axis function at any gestational day (GD).  Fetal cortisol was unaffected by CEE, but did increase with gestational age in both CEE and control.  CEE increased maternal and GD 65 fetal liver CYP2E1 enzyme activity. Maternal supplementation with folic acid did not mitigate CEE fetal growth restriction, but did increase maternal red blood cell (RBC) folate at term.  At term, maternal supplementation prevented the CEE-induced decrease in fetal liver folate, did not affect fetal RBC folate, and did not mitigate the nutritional-deficit-induced decrease in fetal hippocampal folate.  Maternal consumption of 5% (v/v) ethanol decreased offspring birth weight, increased spontaneous locomotor activity, increased preference for ethanol, and delayed learning on day two of Morris water maze testing in young adult offspring.  These data indicate that, in the guinea pig: there is a threshold blood ethanol concentration for HPA axis activation; CEE can induce CYP2E1 in the GD 65 fetus; folic acid supplementation is not protective in this model of CEE; and low-moderate CEE can cause neurobehavioural perturbations in offspring.</description>

   <description>Road mortality threatens the long-term viability of some wildlife populations, particularly herpetofauna.  Wildlife road mortalities were recorded during regular bicycle-based surveys of the 1000 Islands Parkway in south eastern Ontario during 2010 and 2011. These data were grouped with similar data collected in 2008 and 2009 to determine when and where animals were killed along the Parkway to better inform mitigation options. Temporal and spatial clustering was significant for five taxonomic groups: snakes were found dead on the road primarily in September, turtles in June, frogs in July, and birds and mammals in June and July.  The majority of turtles found on the Parkway were adult females, which may have implications for long-term population demographics and persistence.  Regression tree analysis indicates day-of-year as the most important variable in explaining wildlife road mortality for all taxonomic groups, with higher road mortalities coinciding with higher minimum daily temperature.  Precipitation and traffic accounted for little variation in snake road mortality, and had no effect on turtle, frog, bird or mammal road kills.  Spatial clustering was found for all taxonomic groups with overlapping areas of significant clustering between years identified as hot spots. In addition, the potential for drainage culverts to reduce wildlife road mortality was tested with two experimental treatments in 2010: (1) blocked culverts to prevent wildlife use, and (2) drift fence installation adjacent to culverts to encourage wildlife use. Wildlife road mortalities at these locations as well as control culverts were compared with 2008 wildlife road mortalities when there were no culvert treatments.  The number of road kills in the area of treatments was too low to measure changes for all taxa but frogs, which showed no significant changes in road kills for any culvert treatment. The results of the study are used to evaluate a list of potential options for mitigating wildlife road mortality along the Parkway, and a list of implementable actions is identified.</description>

   <description>As the depth of mining increases, so does the risk of fault slip related rockbursts.  Currently, there is no way to evaluate this risk, however the need for such a system is clear.  Fault behaviour in mining environments is the result of a complex interaction between the mining system and the geological system.  Although numerous models exist, the wide spectrum of fault behaviour cannot be fully explained.  Additionally, these models are phenomenological, resulting in a disconnect between observable parameters and the models of faults.  Fault behaviour is dependent upon the strength of the fault, the stresses acting along the fault, the boundary conditions and fault-system stiffness.  Significant work exists in the field of earth science attempting to relate properties of the geological system to fault behaviour.  In mining environments, these relationships become increasingly difficult to determine due to the time variable nature of mining activities.  In order of importance, the following factors influence fault behaviour: excavations, tectonic history and in situ stress, fault system, fault zone geometry, pore pressure, fault zone slip surface and core, blasting, fault zone damage zone and wall rock and temperature.&#xd;
&#xd;
Numerical stress analysis models were created to evaluate the influence of excavations, tectonic history and in situ stress and the fault system on fault behaviour.  Excavations were placed in various locations in a fault system.  Results showed that there was no clear relationship between excavation location and fault behaviour; small perturbations in the initial state caused significantly different outcomes.&#xd;
&#xd;
The architectures of many classification and decision support systems were evaluated for purposes of a fault slip classification system.  Due to the chaotic nature of fault behaviour and the time variable nature of the factors that influence fault slip, a typical classification system is not an appropriate architecture.  Instead, it is recommended that a fault slip risk identification system be created, allowing for the incorporation of historical and live data to create a real time response.  Artificial neural networks, numerical stress analysis, data from the identified important factors, and seismic data is recommended to form the basis of the fault slip risk identification system.</description>

   <description>Background: Exemestane is a drug of great interest for breast cancer prevention, because it inhibits estrogen production. Estrogen may operate by increasing breast density, a well-established biomarker for increased breast cancer risk. The NCIC CTG MAP.2 trial examined the efficacy of exemestane in decreasing breast density. Menopausal health-related quality of life (HRQL) and adverse events were also carefully monitored during the study.&#xd;
Purpose: To elucidate the impact of exemestane on menopausal HRQL and to examine the relationship between clinician and participant methods of reporting side effects.&#xd;
Methods: 98 postmenopausal women with increased breast density were randomized to exemestane or placebo daily for one year. HRQL was measured with the MENQOL questionnaire, which has four domains. Mean changes in MENQOL domain scores from baseline were compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The difference between groups in the proportion of women with a clinically meaningful decline was compared by domain with the Chi-square test; change scores were considered worsened if increased by ≥ 0.5 points. The association between time-to-decline in menopausal HRQL and treatment was evaluated using Cox PH regression. The kappa statistic quantified the level of agreement between participant-reported and clinician-reported symptoms. Kaplan-Meier estimates of time-to-decline as communicated by clinicians and participants were compared, using three thresholds to define meaningful change.&#xd;
Results: No significant differences in mean change scores were detected, however, a significantly greater proportion of women on exemestane experienced a clinically meaningful decline in physical menopausal HRQL at three months (absolute difference=19%, p= 0.03), while the absolute difference approached significance for vasomotor menopausal HRQL at six months (21%, p= 0.05), and at nine months (21%, p=0.06). The rate of decline in physical menopausal HRQL was 2.08 times greater (95% CI 1.10-3.94) in the exemestane group compared to the placebo group. Agreement between raters was low for all symptoms except hot flashes; in general participants detected symptoms more rapidly than clinicians, regardless of the defined cut-off for meaningful change on the MENQOL.&#xd;
Conclusions: A subset of women on exemestane experienced significant declines in physical and vasomotor symptoms. Generally, participants reported symptoms more frequently and faster than clinicians.</description>

   <description>The objective of this research project was to gain a better understanding of the language, policies and collaborative actions undertaken by planning and public health professionals that are relevant to the design of active communities. The overarching aim of this research was to develop resources to facilitate the collaborative efforts of planners and public health professionals working together to create active communities. To this end, three studies were undertaken. In the first study, publicly available documents, websites, and published reports from five Government of Ontario ministries were reviewed.  The review produced 136 terms for inclusion in a joint glossary of terms for planners and public health professionals. In the second study legislation/strategies from the same five government ministries were reviewed and interviews were conducted with 10 government policy-makers to identify priorities, challenges and inter-sectoral collaboration to enhance the design of active communities. This process produced a policy inventory of 39 Ontario laws/strategies that govern planners and public heath professionals working to enhance the design of active communities and identified challenges related to achieving inter-ministry collaboration and coordination towards a provincial active communities’ agenda. The third study recruited planners and public health professionals working in the province of Ontario to participate in a concept mapping process to identify ways they currently work together to enhance the design of active communities. This process generated 72 actions that represent collaborative efforts planners and public health professionals engage in when designing active communities. These actions were then organized by importance and feasibility, resulting in the development of a coordinated action framework that features four planning actions for planners, nineteen proximal and six distal coordinated actions for planners and public health professionals and six public health actions for public health professionals.&#xd;
Collectively, results from these three studies contribute to our understanding of the language, policies, and collaborative actions employed by planning and public health professionals that are relevant to the design of active communities. The resources developed from this project are intended to support and facilitate the collaborative efforts of planners and public health professionals working to create active communities.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we report on remote interaction techniques for horizontal and vertical large displays. For vertical large displays, we present MultiPoint, a set of perspective-based remote pointing techniques that allows users to perform bimanual and multi-finger remote manipulation of graphical objects on large displays. We conducted two empirical studies that compared remote pointing techniques performed using fingers and laser pointers, in single and multi-finger pointing interactions. The MultiPoint techniques were found suitable for interacting with vertical large displays. We explore techniques that are well suited for exclusively single-point use cases as well as for multipoint scenarios.&#xd;
With Pointable, we also explored perspective-based pointing with in-air gestures, but in a tabletop scenario. We conducted 3 experiments; the first showed that pointing at a distance using Pointable has a Fitts’ law throughput comparable to that of a mouse. In the second experiment, we found that Pointable had the same performance as multi-touch input in a resize, rotate and drag task. In a third study, we observed that when given the choice, over 75% of participants preferred to use Pointable over multi-touch for target manipulation. In general, Pointable allowed users to manipulate out-of-reach targets, without loss of performance, while minimizing the need to lean, stand up, or involve collocated collaborators.</description>

   <description>Food and nutrition are an integral part of daily life and can have an effect on social,&#xd;
cognitive, and physical development as well as the prevention of negative health outcomes. The development of the School Food and Beverage Policy was targeted to both elementary and secondary schools in Ontario as a proactive approach to health and wellbeing by eliminating the sale of foods that do not meet nutrition criteria. School food policies can play an important role in students’ overall health and wellbeing, but little is known about schools’ readiness for implementing these policies. The purpose of this study was to examine schools’ readiness to implement the policy with an organizational readiness lens. This study consisted of a policy analysis and qualitative interviews with 8 administrators who were directly involved in the planning and preparation for the policy and 4 teachers who were recommended by their respective principals as key stakeholders in assisting in the process. Policy analysis uncovered the inconsistencies within the policy, while interview data revealed emergent themes surrounding: pre-implementation planning, policy technicalities, and challenges of confronting implementation. The variability in perspectives of readiness illustrates the complexity of preparing for policy implementation across schools and even within schools. Findings suggest that there is a need for more effective dissemination, in-service training, and education for school stakeholders in order to engage and stimulate interest and compliance of the nutrition standards. Having appealing and nutritious foods that students will enjoy is an area that requires more work. Developing supportive partnerships within and outside the school to reinforce consistent messages to students is also an area that needs attention. The results of this research serve as a framework for potential solutions to school nutrition policies, strategies, and interventions and may also inform key stakeholders and policy makers in adapting and refining policies as a means of supporting the implementation process for successful outcomes.</description>

   <description>The effect of waveform shape and extension of negative flowrate are studied at two Reynolds numbers (Re = 80, Re = 200) on stented channels by looking at the kinematics and dynamics of the flow. The waveforms are reconstructed by Fourier decomposition of a waveform corresponding to left anterior descending (LAD) of coronary artery. The stents are modeled by an immersed boundary method. Two stent geometries are created which are the idealizations of two clinical ones. The first geometry is an idealization of XIENCE V stent which is called  Lambda stent and the second one is the idealization of Endeavor stent and is called X stent. The former has larger inter-strut spacing and smaller thickness than the latter one. The use of immersed boundary method for creating the stents is validated, and the spatial resolution requirements are determined. The shape of the waveform is changed by systematically  filtering out the higher modes of Fourier decomposition and the negative flowrate extension is reduced by shifting the waveform to the positive flowrate. The presence of the stent causes vortical structures to be created between stent struts. These vortices are migrating to the centre of the channel and disappear. It is observed that the confined geometric feature of X stent and its larger thickness, leads to larger areas of flow recirculation which causes smaller wall-shear-stress parameters with respect to  Lambda stent and more deviation of the flow from a healthy vessel. The importance of the convective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations was studied at the two Reynolds numbers for both stents. It is observed that at high Reynolds number (Re = 200), the convective terms play significant role throughout the waveform cycle while at low Reynolds number (Re = 80),&#xd;
the effect of convective terms become negligible during negative flowrate. Moreover the convective terms become more significant for flow in a channel with  Lambda stent than X stent due to the specific shape and size of the stents. The kinematics of the flow corresponds to the study of vortex timing. It was found that this timing is mainly affected by the waveform and Reynolds number rather than the stent geometry. The time at which vortex creation occurs is coincident with the time at which wall shear stress changes its sign in an unstented channel. Therefore the analytical solution of unsteady channel flow can be used as a tool for analysing the kinematics of the flow,</description>

   <description>New polymer cure chemistry is described, wherein the onset of free radical cross-linking is delayed without compromising cure yields. The addition of an acrylate-functionalized nitroxyl, 4-acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (AOTEMPO), to a peroxide-cure formulation quenches free radical activity during the initial stages of the cross-linking process, trapping alkyl radicals as alkoxyamines that bear acrylate functionality. Polymer cross-linking by macro-radical combination is suppressed until all nitroxyl is consumed, at which point radical oligomerization of polymer-bound acrylate groups generates the desired covalent network. As a result, cross-link density losses incurred during radical trapping are recovered during the oligomerization phase of the process. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated for a range of polymers, peroxide initiators, reaction temperatures and reagent loadings. Furthermore, AOTEMPO formulations are compared directly to other delayed-onset additives that are used in commercial practice.</description>

   <description>The overall objectives of this thesis were to (1) describe the sedentary behaviour levels of young people; (2) examine the impact of sedentary behaviour on obesity and other physical health outcomes among young people; and (3) examine the influence that individual, social, and environmental factors have on the sedentary behaviour of young people. Six manuscripts addressed these objectives.&#xd;
Manuscript one assessed the proportion of 0- to 4-year-olds meeting the new Canadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for the Early Years in a sample of pre-school children. More than half of the children exceeded the guidelines and the majority of their parents believed that their child did not engage in excessive screen time. &#xd;
Manuscript two examined the association between types, overall volume, and patterns of sedentary behaviour with cardio-metabolic risk factors in a sample of children and adolescents. Television viewing predicted cardio-metabolic risk factors independent of moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity. No associations were observed for the other sedentary behaviour components.&#xd;
Manuscript three examined whether the relationship between television viewing and obesity in a sample of youth was mediated by dietary habits. While a positive association was observed between television viewing and body mass index, it was not explained by dietary habits.&#xd;
Manuscript four examined urban-rural differences in screen time in two samples of youth. Rural American youth were the most likely to be excessive television users and the least likely to be excessive computer users. Conversely, urban Canadian youth were the least likely to be excessive television users and the most likely to be excessive computer users.&#xd;
Manuscript five examined the association between neighbourhood disorder and screen time in a sample of youth. Participants in neighbourhoods with high social and high physical disorder were the most likely to engage in excessive screen time.&#xd;
Manuscript six examined associations between factors within the home setting and screen time among a sample of pre-school children. Several factors collectively explained 64.1% of the variance in television viewing including parental cognitive factors, which explained 41.0%.&#xd;
The findings of this thesis have important implications for future public health interventions and initiatives as well as future research in this area.</description>

   <title>Numerical model of Ni-infiltrated porous anode solid oxide fuel cells</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-06-13 13:09:49.182</description>
   <description>A numerical model for solid oxide fuel cells with Ni-infiltrated porous anode has been described. The novel contribution of the work is the development of a semi-continuous film model to describe the infiltrated Ni-phase. This model relates experimentally controllable parameters, namely, Ni- loading, porosity and pore size to the effective electronic conductivity of the Ni-phase and the number of active reaction sites or the triple phase boundary (TPB). The semi-continuous film model was incorporated in a two-dimensional (2D) SOFC model. The 2D model considers the coupled gas-phase transport, charge transport and electrochemical kinetics to directly examine the effect of Ni loading and porosity on the electrochemical performance of Ni-infiltrated SOFC anodes. From the semi-continuous film model, an optimal Ni loading that corresponds to a maximum in TPB length was identified. Comparison of effective electronic conductivity and TPB length for a Ni-infiltrated anode with those for a composite Ni-YSZ anode suggests that an infiltrated Ni anode with adequate electrical conductivity and sufficiently high TPB length can be fabricated even at a very low Ni loading. Comparison of various porous anodes with varying Ni loading, it was determined that maximum electrochemical performance does indeed correspond to anode with maximum TPB length. It was also determined that an infiltrated anode will have higher performance capabilities when compared to the conventional composite electrodes. However, degradation of performance may result due to degradation of connectivity in the infiltrated Ni. The methodology to model the latter effect was also proposed.</description>

   <description>Earthquakes in western Quebec and southern Ontario present a major contribution to the natural hazards in south eastern Canada due to their proximity to major population centres. However, the seismic characteristics of the events in these regions have not been well documented. Improved knowledge of earthquake distribution and seismic controlling mechanisms provides a great benefit for earthquake hazard analysis in eastern Canada.&#xd;
The available information about the tectonic stress indicators, including focal mechanisms, was compiled for Canada prior to 1994. The present research is concentrated mainly on determination of the focal mechanisms and hypocentre locations of the earthquakes after 1993 with M > 3.5 to characterize the present-day regional and local stress fields in southern Ontario and western Quebec. An attempt was also made to differentiate local zones with comparatively homogeneous tectonic stresses orientation and seismic regimes, thus providing information for future re-assessment of the seismic hazard in each region.&#xd;
Considering seismic parameters such as the trend of the epicentres, focal depths and the state of stress of the events along with their tectonic settings, ten distinct clusters have been proposed for western Quebec and two clusters of events were determined for southern Ontario with comparatively consistent focal mechanisms. The locations and characteristics of seismicity clusters appear to be consistent with the hypothesis that they are near the locations of large historic and prehistoric events, and represent exceptionally persistent aftershocks of past large earthquakes.</description>

   <description>This thesis develops a new methodological approach to test for threshold cointegration. It determines the threshold locations, the number of thresholds, and tests the null hypothesis of a unit root against the alternative of a stationary threshold process using p-values based on a residual-based block bootstrap for the nonlinear threshold autoregressive specification (TAR). Chapter 2 describes the methodological approach which combines Gonzalo and Pitarakis (2002) and Seo (2008). Chapter 3 employs Monte Carlo analysis to investigate the properties of the new approach. The results indicate that the methodology performs well and is suited for application to real world time series. Chapter 4 applies the new approach in combination with a threshold error correction model (ECM) to determine the spatial relationships among three crude oil prices: WTI, Brent, and Oman, from 2008 through 2011. The results indicate that the crude oil benchmarks are tied together by a long run relationship; however, the recent reversal in price premium between the two main crude oil benchmarks, WTI and Brent, is an anomaly that has resulted in a time period in which the series do not have a tendency to move back toward their long run relationship. Chapter 5 applies the new approach, in combination with threshold ECMs, with regime switches being triggered by the upstream markup margin to determine the vertical relationships between the crude oil, rack, and retail gasoline prices for six cities across North America. The results using both daily and weekly data between 2008 and 2011 suggest that upstream and downstream prices are cointegrated. There is evidence of band-TAR in which the crude, rack, and retail prices are free to diverge until the markup margin is squeezed or stretched beyond a lower or upper threshold. This suggests that abnormally high margins cannot be sustained indefinitely. The threshold ECMs indicate that there is no systematic relationship between the speed of adjustment and the markup margin; however, the residuals exhibit a leverage effect in which volatility and price changes are negatively correlated. Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of Chapters 2 through 5 and makes suggestions for future research.</description>

   <description>In this dissertation, using the tool of a political economy of communication analysis gives us an important way to conceptualize the challenges confronting Chinese media workers, especially editors, due to media reform and social transformation. I will accomplish this by examining three different but inter-related processes: commodification, structuration, and spatialization.&#xd;
First, I will analyze the ways in which the deepening of the media commodification process has forced Chinese media workers to serve the political interests of the state, and at the same time, to generate profit for their companies and promote political and social reforms. Second, I will explore the structuration process by analyzing how fundamental social, technological, political, and economic changes—especially those in class relations and power dynamics—have produced five critical problems for the Chinese media workers. Third, I will explore the media spatialization process by addressing its three indispensable components: globalization, neoliberalism, and the global division of labour. When China is increasingly integrated into the global political economy, most Chinese media workers have faced great changes in their value systems and their daily work processes. As a result, the privileged existence of workers as the “masters” of the Communist society has been transformed in many ways (Rocca 2003). &#xd;
In the last chapter, I will suggest plausible solutions to the problems of Chinese media workers, addressing the benefits of labour convergence, the basic functions and major limitations of worker organizations and trade unions, and how they can further help Chinese media workers better deal with the challenges associated with current media reform when labour unrest is on the rise. &#xd;
To conclude, this dissertation concentrates on the trajectories of the labour process transformation of Chinese media workers; their changing social, economic, and political roles; and their dilemma, challenges, and opportunities associated with current social reform and China’s more integration into the global political economy. Through the political economic analysis of Chinese media workers, I aim to better understand the broader social and economic transformations, particularly the network of power relations and institutional contexts in which Chinese media workers are situated, that have been taking place in China since the late 1970s.</description>

   <description>A new electron-transport material using a triarylboron-functionalized 2,4,6-triphenyltriazine core has been synthesized. This compound exhibits reversible reduction with low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels, as well as a high-energy triplet state. Preliminary experiments incorporating this material into phosphorescent OLEDs as an electron transport layer gave devices with high current and external quantum efficiencies at brightness levels appropriate for applications in the display industry. &#xd;
Furthermore, a nitrogen-containing alkynyltriarylboron compound, 2-(2’-(dimesitylboryl)phenylethynyl)pyridine, has been found to undergo a facile alkyne hydration reaction in the presence of copper(I) iodide and triethylamine. The copper(I)-catalyzed addition of water occurs at room temperature, and produces a brightly luminescent boron-enol compound that is stable under air. Studies of the reaction mechanism were carried out by monitoring product formation under different conditions using 1H NMR. The cooperativity between the Lewis acidic triarylboryl group and Lewis basic pyridyl group is determined to be vital in promoting the hydration process and in stabilizing the enol structure of the product.&#xd;
Finally, we have discovered that diarylplatinum(II) complexes of 2-(2’-(dimesitylboryl)phenylethynyl)pyridine are capable of undergoing an unusual intramolecular double aryl migration/cyclization reaction, resulting in the formation of a unique bicyclic organometallic scaffold. The structures of these remarkable products have been characterized by X-ray crystallography, as well as by 1D and 2D 1H NMR. The reaction mechanism was established by 1H NMR studies and by DFT calculations. The complementary electronic properties of the electron-deficient triarylborane and the electron-rich platinum centers were found to play a key role in this unprecedented transformation.</description>

   <description>Behrad Dehghan: Position Control of a Pneumatic System using Adaptive Intelligent Methods.&#xd;
M.A.Sc. Thesis, Queen’s University, June, 2012.&#xd;
A large body of research is devoted to the development of advanced control techniques to improve the positioning performance of pneumatic systems, which are known to be highly nonlinear systems. Although model based controllers show good results, the requirement for a system model makes these methods difficult to implement. So-called intelligent algorithms, such as neural networks and fuzzy rule based controllers, are attractive since they do not require a model. The performance of these controllers can be enhanced by adding an adaptive mechanism to adjust controller parameters in a continuous on-line fashion.&#xd;
The objective of this thesis was to explore different adaptive intelligent controllers for position control of a pneumatic system. The application was the x-axis and z-axis of a pneumatic gantry robot. They were tested independently for their ability to track step and sine wave trajectories.&#xd;
The rodded x-axis cylinder was an example of a short stroke low friction application. The rodless z-axis cylinder was an example of a long stroke high friction application.&#xd;
Five different controllers were tested: 1) PID, 2) Fuzzy, 3) PID+Adaptive Neural Network Compensator (ANNC), 4) ANNonly and 5) Fuzzy Adaptive PID (FAPID). Results with FAPID and  PID+ANNC showed improvement in tracking performance over PID by 60% for the rodded and 35% for the rodless cylinder. This level of improvement was expected given the adaptive nature of the controller. Unfortunately, both required significant effort to setup and tune.&#xd;
In order to reduce the tuning effort, a second adaptive mechanism was added to FAPID, to adjust output weights. Results with adaptive PID and modified FAPID (MFAPID) showed further improvement performance over PID by 87% for the rodded and 70% for the rodless cylinder (in addition to being easier to tune). To provide a measure of robustness, experiments were conducted at two supply pressures and three tracking frequencies. The fact that MFAPID was able to improve performance for both cylinders,  is considered further evidence of its robustness. MFAPID is considered novel for two reasons: 1) fuzzy rule set is reduced in size relative previous work and 2) addition of an adaptive mechanism  for output weights is new.</description>

   <description>This dissertation analyzes what a corporate brand is and what motivates it. Using qualitative methods the corporate brand of IBM is investigated from the viewpoint of many of its stakeholders. It is discovered that IBM’s corporate brand is outside the control of IBM, and is a social construction of IBM and its stakeholders. It is a special type of story – a saga – to which not only the company contributes to the storyline, but also its stakeholders. As such, the corporate brand is a dynamic process driven along by IBM’s attempt to be authentic. That is, as IBM shapes its identity in response to the expectations of its stakeholders, and tries to be true to its identity, it is constantly changing. From this process the corporate brand emerges and is propelled and motivated by the force of authenticity. These findings contribute to the marketing literature by providing a revised view of the corporate brand. Not only does this have theoretical implications, but it also significantly changes how managers deal with and try to manage their corporate brands as they now recognize that they are only one of the contributors to the ongoing saga.</description>

   <description>Science and technology have become indispensable elements of virtually every public debate. While nations strive to employ the best experts to make timely decisions, discontented citizens increasingly demand better accountability and democratic legitimacy through broad and direct public consultation. Participatory decision-making, on the other hand, is often met by the worry that sound science might drown in a sea of ignorance. As science and technology studies (STS) attempts to navigate these conflicting concerns, it sometimes draws heavily, albeit often uncritically, upon contemporary political philosophy. In this dissertation, I explore links between H. M. Collins and Robert Evans’s account of the appropriate role of public participation in technical policy debates, and Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson’s liberal theory of deliberative democracy. Both views exemplify what I call the “gatekeeping paradigm”, a tendency to employ rigid constraints on admissible inputs as the primary means to direct democratic processes toward outcomes that are independently judged to be desirable. I argue that such an approach not only fails to account for the complexi-ties of public discourse in modern societies, but also reflects an impoverished conception of deliberative democracy as a black box. As an alternative to the gatekeeping paradigm, I develop and defend a social construc-tivist theory of democratic governance based on the ideas of Alan Irwin, Sheila Jasanoff, and Brian Wynne in STS; and John Dryzek in political philosophy. The constructivist view focuses less on externally imposed input-constraints and more on internal processes of self-regulation within shifting and heterogeneous discourses. Although this approach will need to be further developed and augmented with much empirical research before its efficacy can be determined, I suggest that constructivism offers a promising framework for the governance of science and technology as well as for thinking about deliberative democracy generally.</description>

   <description>Collaborative care is a philosophy which guides the work of interdisciplinary teams and patients and their families internationally. It has been demonstrated to improve quality of care, safety, and patient and staff satisfaction, yet applying this philosophy still requires much investigation. This thesis describes processes of change directed towards a vision to enhance collaborative care relationships with patients and families within one hospital site of a non-acute academic health science centre in Ontario, Canada. By building focused conversations around existing patient and family centred education and using an initial conceptual framework of customer service, healthcare providers, mid- and senior level leaders shared their perspectives, negotiated meanings and created innovations to enhance collaborative relationships within the organization. Based within the critical paradigm, a critical collaborative ethnography was constructed with the use of sequential and mixed research methodologies. The ethnography evolved over three phases in a step-wise and additive design during the three year period of study. Phase 1 examined the perspectives of healthcare providers in an exploratory case study which contributed to mid-level leaders’ discussions in Phase 2. Cumulative findings from Phases 1 and 2 were brought to discussions with senior leaders in Phase 3. Members of a participative action research team assisted with research design and study processes. Shared meanings and innovative change ideas were developed and captured through the use of semi-structured focus groups and interviews, survey, participant observation and inductive analysis. A conceptual framework of ‘partners-in-care’ emerged and was used to assist participants to make sense of the values and factors important in their work with respect to collaborative relationships. The research processes facilitated the development of many innovations to enhance collaborative practice within the hospital. The organization was described by the research as undergoing directed change to enhance collaborative care as evidenced through participant self-reports, observed initiatives and the ethnographic descriptions.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2012-06-26 10:17:59.252</description>
   <description>In this dissertation, I argue that accounts of cosmopolitan literature tend to equate cosmopolitanism with sympathetic feeling. I further contend that sympathy is in fact implicitly central to a wider body of contemporary cosmopolitan theory. I distinguish between two strains of cosmopolitan thought that depend upon two distinct models of feeling: “critical cosmopolitanism,” which depends upon a cognitive-evaluative model of sympathy, and “affective cosmopolitanism,” which depends upon a relational model. Both branches of cosmopolitanism envision sympathy as perfectly human or humane; they gloss over the potential for feeling shame in cosmopolitan encounters. The minority of scholarship that does consider shame in relation to cosmopolitan practice also reifies shame as ideally human or humane. Whether through sympathy or shame, cosmopolitan subjects become cosmopolitan through feeling. I offer readings of J.M. Coetzee’s later fiction in order to critique the idealization of feeling as distinctly cosmopolitan. Coetzee’s work, I conclude, suggests another model for cosmopolitanism, one which foregrounds the limits of feeling for realizing mutuality and equality.</description>

   <description>The distinctive household registration (hukou or huji) system of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) divides the population into two groups whose political rights and legal status are unequal. This thesis focuses on Shanghai to examine the establishment of the hukou system in the 1950s in the course of the rural and urban reforms led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Although the system has been explained as a result of the CCP’s industrialization strategy, my investigation has led me to conclude that the hukou system was an indirect rather than direct consequence of industrialization. My examination also shows that “rural” and “urban” in the PRC are essentially neither residential nor occupational categories; rather they are closely connected with political privileges.&#xd;
The first part of this study focuses on the consequences of the CCP’s land reform and collectivization campaigns after 1949. During this period, a large number of people who had moved freely between urban and rural areas, playing active roles in both, were uprooted from the countryside. At the same time, the CCP carried out a series of expulsions from Shanghai and other cities. Hundreds of thousands of urban residents, particularly those lacking secure employment, were removed after being labeled as “undesirable.” Thus CCP policies turned the cities and the countryside into two separate worlds. Next the dissertation outlines how the PRC state evolved after 1949, focusing on those directly maintained on the government’s payroll in Shanghai. This group was small in the beginning but soon began to expand. During the 1950s, after taking over almost all public-service institutions, the state took steps to absorb private enterprises through the policy of “public-private joint operation.” A large cohort of workers was thus added to the state payroll. Following these changes, the cities had become home mainly to employees of the party-state, together with their dependents. The state provided various benefits to its insiders. At the same time, it reduced most of the rural population to a kind of serfdom, while putting in place a set of mechanisms to secure the boundary between insiders and outsiders.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-06-27 14:59:33.941</description>
   <description>Since World War I, the area of acoustic undersea warfare has witnessed several research activities targeting the development of advanced systems to accurately detect and localize underwater moving targets. One of the main categories of these systems is the passive sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) that searches for the location of the ships and submarines by listening to the radiated noise produced by their propellers, machinery, and flow dynamics. The performance of the passive sonar highly depends on the particular array signal processing algorithms used in practice. Presently, one of the main challenges is to accurately estimate the target direction of arrival (DOA) in severe underwater environments. This thesis is proposed to enhance the DOA  estimation in two distinct applications. This first application is to improve the spatial resolution of the uniform linear towed arrays. This is done by applying new spatial extrapolation techniques called 2D- and 3D- fast orthogonal search (FOS) for both uniform linear and rectangular arrays, respectively. The presented methods show better performance than the conventional methods with respect to signal to noise ratio  (SNR), number of snapshots and angular separation. Moreover it reduces the computational complexity required by the spatial  extrapolation methods based on linear prediction approach.&#xd;
The other application concerns with developing a new DOA estimation that provides better spatial spectrum than the one provided by conventional beamforming (CBF) when a nonuniform linear array of directional frequency analysis and recording (DIFAR) sonobuoys is employed. The  introduced technique or the so called fourth order cumulant beamforming (FOCBF) and shows an outstanding performance compared to CBF especially in low SNR.&#xd;
Furthermore, a warping FOC-BF (WFOC-BF) method obtained by augmenting a warping beamforming technique with FOC-BF is proposed to reduce the required computational complexity by FOC-BF while preserving the same performance.</description>

   <description>This study augments an expanding body of research literature examining the complex process of integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and introducing ICT-related literacy skills into English Language Arts classrooms. Widespread social changes related to ICT are impacting the literacy practices of people in everyday society. These changes in literacy practices represent challenges to teachers who have never used these literacy skills and have never seen them taught. &#xd;
Through two case studies, this hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry examines the experiences of two teachers who learn and lead learning using wikis. Data collection was conducted in two Grade 6 classrooms: one in an Ontario public school and one in a private international school in Mexico and consisted of observations, informal and formal interviews with the teachers as well as observations and focus group interviews with their students. &#xd;
The complex phenomenon of learning ICT and almost simultaneously having to teach it is documented and analyzed. The research involved teaching the teachers how to use a wiki and then co-planning and observing them teach a creative writing unit on the wiki. Data was analyzed and discussed with reference to Lankshear and Knobel’s (2011) Paradigms.&#xd;
Findings indicated that the two teachers held largely Paradigm 1(linear, individualistic and bounded) conceptions of literacy while the multimodal writing students were producing on the wiki represented Paradigm 2 practices (non-linear, collaborative and unbounded.) Also, the context of school was an insurmountable hurdle in the teachers’ efforts to integrate ICT into their English Language Arts classrooms in both cases. This study sheds light on the specific moments when this contrast between Paradigm 1 and Paradigm 2 perspectives impeded deep student engagement in digital literacy skills related to the wiki.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we document a comprehensive study of the cation-directed self-assembly of three guanosine derivatives: i) guanosine 5'-monophosphate (5'-GMP), ii) guanosine 5'-thiomonophosphate (5'-GSMP), and iii) 2',3',5'-O-triacetylguanosine (TAG). We discovered that, under the neutral pH condition, Na2(5'-GMP) molecules self-assemble into a right-handed helix structure consisting of alternating all-C2'endo and all-C3'endo planar G-quartets stacking on top of each other with a 30° twist. This self-assembled supramolecular structure uses multiple non-covalent forces (e.g., hydrogen-bond, phosphate-hydroxyl, pi-pi (base-base) stacking, ion-carbonyl, and ion-phosphate) to align individual monomers in a way that resembles RNA and DNA sequences in which covalent bonds are used to link monomers. Na+ ions are located in the channel and surface sites of the G-quadruplex. In contrast, under acidic pH conditions, Na2(5'-GMP) molecules self-assemble into a continuous right-handed helix where guanine bases are hydrogen-bonded in a lock-washer fashion with only C3'-endo monomers. Na+ ions are absent in the channel site due to smaller channel radius and lesser repulsions between phosphate groups (-1 vs. -2 charge under neutral pH) contribute to the stronger stacking mechanism. In Na2(5'-GSMP), a longer phosphate bond compared with Na2(5'-GMP) allows stronger P-O-…Na+…-O-P interactions to occur, thus enhancing self-assembly. Solid-state NMR, FT-IR, powder x-ray diffraction, model building, and calculation showed that Na2(5'-GSMP) forms the same self-assembled structure as Na2(5'-GMP) but with significantly greater tendency. This study proves that single-bond modification can enhance stacking in G self-assemblies, and shows direct evidence that Na+ ions reside at the surface (phosphate) sites. Lastly, using lipophilic TAG, we were able to show for the first time that trivalent lanthanide metal ions can facilitate G-quartet formation. A new mode of metal ion binding in G-quartet structures (i.e., a triple-decker G dodecamer containing a single metal ion in the central G-quartet) is reported. We also report the first 1H and 43Ca NMR characterization of Ca-templated G-quartet formation in a [TAG8-Ca]2+ octamer.</description>

   <description>Isobutylene-rich elastomers bearing functional groups that engage N-arylmaleimides in C-H bond addition and/or alternating copolymerization are described.  While inactive to cross-linking when treated at high temperature with peroxide alone, these co-curing elastomers can be cross-linked substantially when combined with bis-maleimide coagents such as N,N’-m-phenylene dimaleimide (BMI).  Poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) (IIR) samples containing relatively high amounts of residual isoprene unsaturation are shown to provide relatively low coagent cure reactivity, whereas IIR derivatives bearing pendant polyether or vinyl ether functionality are shown to provide exceptional cross-linking rates and extents when treated with identical BMI formulations.  The design of such co-curing elastomers is discussed, along with the physical properties of the resulting vulcanizates.&#xd;
Isobutylene rich elastomers bearing oligomerizable (C=C) functional groups, macromonomers, that are activated in the presence of free-radical initiators are described. The criteria for determining the macromonomers that are best suited for preparing thermosets of IIR is discussed. While IIR derivatives bearing pendant acrylic, styrenic and maleimide functionality are shown to provide exceptional cross-linking rates and extents, they are also shown to suffer from instability in the absence of peroxide. IIR carrying pendant methacrylic and itaconate functionality are shown to provide a good balance of cure rates and stability. Nitroxyl based radical trap that provides scorch protection to the macromonomers while regenerating the cure extent is discussed.&#xd;
Functional macromonomer derivatives of IIR bearing containing multi-functional pendant groups are discussed. IIR derivatives with itaconate and low amounts of BHT pendant groups is shown to act as bound anti-oxidant while IIR containing pendant fluoro groups are shown to have reduced surface energy. Ionic coagents are used to cross-link IIR containing itaconate pendant groups and their physical properties are discussed.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research was to examine how attachment anxiety and rejection-salience interacted to influence condom use intentions and beliefs. I manipulated rejection-salience specific to a sexual encounter (Study 1) and rejection-salience in general (Studies 2 and 3). I hypothesized that among women who were high in anxiety, those in the rejection-salient condition would report riskier sexual tendencies related to condom use compared to those in the control condition. I did not expect rejection-salience to influence the sexual tendencies of women who were low in anxiety. In Study 1, I manipulated potential partner rejection and found that attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and rejection-salience interacted to influence intentions to engage in unprotected sex. As expected, among women who were high in anxiety and low in avoidance, those in the rejection condition reported stronger intentions to have unprotected sex than those in the control condition. Unexpectedly, the same was true for women who were low in anxiety and high in avoidance. In Study 2, I manipulated general rejection-salience and asked women to indicate how many weeks into a relationship would be appropriate before switching from having protected to unprotected sex. Consistent with the results of Study 1, among women who were high in anxiety, those in the rejection-salience condition reported less time before switching compared to those in the control condition, demonstrating more risky sexual tendencies. In Study 3, I manipulated general rejection-salience and asked women to report how many weeks into a relationship unprotected intercourse should occur. Inconsistent with my predictions, as well as from the results of Studies 1 and 2, among women who were high in anxiety and low in avoidance, those in the rejection-salience condition reported that unprotected sex belonged later in a relationship timeline compared to those in the control condition. Study 4 explored how the exposure to positive relationship thoughts may act to buffer the influence of rejection-salience on risky sexual tendencies among highly anxious women. Some preliminary support for this hypothesis was found. Future research directions and implications for the literature on condom use and for sexual health promotion are discussed.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a strategy designed to determine how Thi1 and Thi5 may differentially regulate thiamine production and the vegetative and sexual life cycles in fission yeast.  Fission yeast cells regulate the cell cycle and development in response to available nutrients. Thiamine, vitamin B1, is an essential vitamin and its active form, TDP (thiamine diphosphate), is an important co-factor for many metabolic enzymes.  It also acts as an inhibitor of meiosis and zygote formation in fission yeast.  The thiamine biosynthetic pathway in fission yeast  is repressed by the presence of thiamine.  The transcription factors, Thi1 and Thi5, are independently capable of positively regulating the nmt1 (no message in thiamine) promoter in fission yeast and both factors are required for wildtype nmt1 expression.  Although Thi1 and Thi5 regulate the same promoter in thiamine biosynthesis, it has been previously found that Thi1 and Thi5 antagonistically regulate different aspects of meiosis.  Thi1 and Thi5 are both Zn(II) 2Cys6 transcription factors.  Since zinc finger transcription factors are known to homo- and hetero-dimerize, I hypothesize that the synergistic and antagonistic attributes of Thi1 and Thi5 may be due to this process.  To examine their potential interaction in vegetative and meiotic cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as well as co-immunoprecipitation, tagged versions of these proteins have been constructed.  For FRET analysis Thi1 and Thi5 have been successfully tagged with CFP and YFP and are able to rescue the thiamine auxotrophy of strains lacking thi1 and thi5.  To perform co-immunoprecipitation Thi1 and Thi5 have been tagged with His6. I was able to detect the tagged versions of Thi1 and Thi5 using commercially available antibodies against the fluorescent tags CFP and YFP and the His6 tag.  The use of these constructs to address the interaction between these proteins is currently underway.</description>

   <description>Background: Moderate-to-vigourous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is among the few modifiable factors known to reduce breast cancer risk. However, the independent effects of leisure-time, household, and occupational MPVA by age period across the life course remain poorly understood. Whether these effects differ by menopausal status and by tumour subtypes defined by the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is unknown. An understanding of these issues will help advance policy and public health action targeting breast cancer prevention through physical activity.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: A case-control study of 1,011 incident breast cancer cases and 1,014 cancer-free controls aged 40-80 years was conducted from 2006-2010 in Vancouver, British Columbia (BC). Lifetime leisure-time, household, and occupational MVPA were assessed by questionnaire and mean MET-hrs/week of each were calculated for age periods 12-17, 18-34, 35-49, and ≥50 years and the total lifetime. Odds ratios for pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer risk associated with each activity domain across age periods were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, and odds ratios for risks of ER/PR-defined and ER/PR/HER2-defined breast tumours were estimated using unconditional polytomous logistic regression.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Among post-menopausal women, lifetime leisure-time and household MVPA reduced breast cancer risk by approximately 50% at volumes equal to 3 hours per week of running and 21 hours per week of active household work. MVPA reduced risk at all age periods across the life course, particularly during adulthood. Effects of leisure-time MVPA appeared restricted to HER2- tumours. Household MVPA reduced risk for ER/PR+ tumours, regardless of HER2 status. MVPA was not associated with pre-menopausal breast cancer risk, except occupational MVPA performed during ages 18-34 was associated with a doubling in risk.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: MVPA is a lifestyle factor women may engage in to reduce post-menopausal breast cancer risk. Results suggest HER2 may be implicated in anti-breast carcinogenic effects of leisure-time MVPA. Increased risk associated with occupational MVPA may be due to occupational exposures related to job intensity. Further research on specific aspects of weekly MVPA energy expenditure dose required to reduce breast cancer risk will aid in refining physical activity recommendations for breast cancer prevention.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this mixed methods study was to document and examine the beliefs held by preservice elementary teachers prior to entering a teacher education program concerning the nature of mathematics and their perceptions about the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) for mathematics instruction. Through an online questionnaire (N=132) followed by interviews of purposefully selected respondents (n=8), the following questions were addressed: (1) What beliefs do preservice elementary mathematics teachers hold upon entering teacher education programs regarding the nature of mathematics? (2) What beliefs do preservice elementary mathematics teachers hold upon entering teacher education programs about how ICT should be used in the classroom? and (3) How do preservice elementary mathematics teachers’ beliefs about the nature of mathematics relate to their views about the use of ICT in teaching mathematics?&#xd;
	Video-elicitation was used in the interviews to determine how respondents perceived various uses of interactive whiteboards. Respondents were grouped based on their beliefs about the nature of mathematics and their reactions to the videos that they were shown. It was discovered that interview respondents who held contrasting views about the nature of mathematics also held differing beliefs about teaching and learning as well as the benefits of ICT. Respondents who saw mathematics as a set of fixed naturally occurring rules, an Absolutist view, favoured teacher directed use of ICT to support the transmission of knowledge. On the other hand, those who viewed mathematics as a human construct, a Fallibilist image, were more in favour of ICT use to support student mathematics investigation and talk. The existence of a potential hidden curriculum was also discovered. Although all interview participants were shown the same videos, respondents in the two groups perceived roles of the teacher and students in the videos that were aligned with their beliefs about the nature of mathematics and teaching and learning.</description>

   <description>Intact geomembranes are barriers to advective aqueous flow and are often a key component in the design of composite bottom liner and cover systems.  During installation, the combination of solar heating, a high coefficient of expansion, and the stiffness of high density polyethylene (HDPE) causes the geomembrane to expand and buckle, forming wrinkles (waves).  Up to 20 – 30% of the area of the geomembrane may be below hydraulically connected wrinkles, which could substantially increase leakage through the composite liner if there is a hole on or near a wrinkle in the connected network.  To quantify wrinkles at the field scale, a technique for low altitude aerial photography and photogrammetric correction was developed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Wrinkles were quantified for nine field cases involving a variety of installation (area, geomembrane thickness and texture, orientation, subgrade) and weather conditions.  The technique was used to quantify the geometry of individual wrinkles (length, width and area) and, more importantly, the length of the longest hydraulically connected wrinkle at each time.  Hand measurements of height and width were conducted at five of the cases.  Air temperature, solar radiation, and geomembrane surface temperature was recorded as permitted by site conditions and instrumentation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The longest measured connected wrinkle was 5330 m on a 0.61 ha slope.  For a 1.5-mm-thick geomembrane, the average wrinkle width over a GCL was 0.20-0.23 m and 0.24 – 0.32 m over a CCL.  The average hand-measured wrinkle height was 0.06 m, and the tallest wrinkle measured was 0.18 m.  The longest connected wrinkle length was &lt;200 m when the sum of the wrinkle lengths was &lt; 580 m (&lt;8% of the area of the geomembrane was wrinkles).  The reported connected wrinkle lengths are significantly longer than previously reported values. When used as input into an existing theoretical leakage solution, these very long wrinkles can explain previous large field measurements of leakage. The results also suggest that simply limiting the time of day when cover soil is placed and/or reducing the area in which wrinkles can form may greatly reduce the length of connected wrinkles after covering.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I investigate the behavior of rational individuals making decisions involving externalities and explain why seemingly irrational behavior can be the result of the decisions of rational individuals. In particular, I consider two kinds of externalities: an information externality and an action externality.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter two, I characterize the equilibria of a dynamic game with an information externality and an action externality where players with private information make decisions in a sequential but exogenous order. I investigate the effects of different job evaluation criteria on the players' behavior in a two-stage model. I find that if the evaluation is based on a relative measure instead of an absolute measure, herding may occur much earlier, resulting in less efficient information aggregation and heavier loss in social welfare.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter three, I characterize the asymmetric pure strategy equilibria of a dynamic game with a pure information externality where players choose whether to invest as well as when to invest. I find that any asymmetric pure strategy equilibrium is more efficient than the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium which is the focus of the existing literature. I also find that when players become very patient, the least efficient asymmetric pure strategy equilibrium resembles those equilibria in an exogenous timing model where players make decisions one by one in an exogenous order.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter four, I analyse the voters' decision to vote in large elections. I reexamine the paradox of voting by incorporating modern psychological and sociological findings and model elections as something similar to spectator sports events. I find that in large elections, the voting rate is significantly different from zero, and thus voting in large elections is justified. Moreover, the voting rate is higher for the candidate who has more supporters. Using the polls before the election as a proxy for the number of supporters a candidate has, I show that the data from the 2004 US Presidential Election support this theory.</description>

   <description>The darkbarbel catfish (Peltoebagrus vachelli) is a small bodied benthic fish that inhabits the Yangtze River in China and is commercially valued as food.  The objectives of this project were to develop the first set of microsatellite primers specific to P. vachelli and use them to examine the levels of genetic variability and population structure of three populations collected at three sites (Yibin, Luzhou, and Song Ji) along an unfragmented stretch of the upper Yangtze River.  Microsatellite primers were designed from an enriched library of genomic DNA and a total of eight primer pairs were optimized to produce reliable polymorphic PCR amplicons on a LI-COR 4200 IR2 platform.  A high level of variability was detected amongst the isolated loci with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 14 – 29 and mean observed and expected heterozygosity values of 0.84 and 0.90 respectively across the entire sample set.  Overall levels of genetic diversity were high within the three populations with mean observed and expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.823 – 0.869 and 0.864 – 0.921 respectively.  Little evidence of genetic structure was detected (global FST = 0.0065, p &lt; 0.05) within the sampled region and pairwise tests of differentiation were not significant (all FST p > 0.05).   These results imply historically large populations of P. vachelli in the upper portion of the Yangtze River that, in the absence of artificial barriers, are part of a single panmictic unit.  As plans have been put forth for construction of hydroelectric installations within the sampled region, this study provides a baseline estimate of the levels of genetic variation present in P. vachelli within the remaining undammed stretch of the Upper Yangtze River which will serve as a foundation for future analyses on the effects of river fragmentation within this region.  Additionally the isolation and characterization of the microsatellites will provide useful molecular markers for a variety of other applications in this and closely related species such as parentage analysis, determination of stocks, and maintenance of genetic variation in stocking practices.</description>

   <description>Research on English Language Learners’ (ELL) test performance in relation to their language use at home and attitudes towards mathematics have rarely been investigated. This study examines the effects of different test formats and constructs, learner characteristics, and attitudes towards mathematics on ELLs’ performance in the Education Quality Accountability Office (EQAO) Grade 9 mathematics test. The participants include a total of 2867 ELLs in Grade 9 who participated in the EQAO Grade 9 mathematics test (1887 from the academic course and 980 from the applied course).&#xd;
The overall results of the study supported the following conclusions. First, ELLs tend to score better in Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) over Open Response Questions (ORQ), and language use at home has interaction effects on their performances on various test formats and constructs. Secondly, significant interactions occurred between language use at home and ELLs’ performance of test formats and constructs. In addition, ELLs who speak another language (only another language) scored higher in performance in both test formats and constructs than ELLs who spoke only English at home. From the ELLs’ questionnaire responses at both the academic and applied levels, two learner characteristics were derived from the section of the questionnaire measuring attitudes towards mathematics: perceived mathematics competency and mathematics interest. The questionnaire also revealed that ELLs in the academic level viewed mathematics in separate constructs (i.e., numerical and spatial mathematics), whereas ELLs in the applied level viewed mathematics as a whole. By extracting from learner characteristics, perceived mathematics competency was found to be the significant predictor for mathematics test performance of ELLs in the academic and applied levels. Moreover, perceived numerical and spatial mathematics ease are significant predictors for mathematics test performance in the academic level. On the other hand, perceived mathematics ease was found to be a significant predictor for the applied level. Results are discussed in relation to second language development, mathematics teaching and learning, and cultural differences. Limitations of the present study were presented where implications for research, test development, and practice are suggested for future research.</description>

   <description>This research project compared the performance of two subsonic air-air ejectors with multi-ring entraining diffusers. The first ejector system was investigated by Qi Chen in his thesis. It consists of a nozzle, mixing tube, and a Full Entraining Diffuser. The Full Entraining Diffuser was found to cause drag forces in an airplane because it protrudes out of the engine cowling. In order to make a streamline fit in the engine cowling, the Full Entraining Diffuser needs to be cut. The second ejector system was then designed by the author to investigate the effect of cutting the diffuser on a 30o incline on the performance of the ejector. This study involves experimental and numerical investigation on how cutting the diffuser affects the performance of the ejector. &#xd;
The experiments were conducted at the Hot Gas Wind Tunnel (HGWT) at Grant Timmins Lab. Both ejector systems were tested, but the Ejector with Full Diffuser was only tested under 20o inlet swirl condition to compare with Chen’s experimental data. Four different inlet swirls (0o, 10o, 20o, and 30o) were applied on the Ejector with Cut Angled Diffuser. &#xd;
Numerical studies using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were also conducted for both ejector systems. Gambit 2.4.6 and Fluent 6.3.26 were used to generate mesh and run the CFD simulations for all cases. The numerical studies were conducted to conclude which flow features CFD can or cannot predict and how important they are in terms of predicting the overall ejector performance (pumping, pressure recovery, velocity and temperature distributions at the diffuser outlet). &#xd;
The experimental results showed that the inlet swirl had similar effect on the Ejector with Cut Angled Diffuser to the Ejector with Full Diffuser. In general, cutting the diffuser on a 30o incline does not affect the overall performance of the ejector. For the CFD simulations, RNG k-ε with Enhanced Wall Function was found to give reasonable prediction on the bulk flow properties, such as total pumping, pressure recovery in the diffuser, wall temperature, and velocity profiles at the diffuser outlet.</description>

   <description>In the present doctoral work we have developed and tested a model for dissolved oxygen (DO) transfer from water to underlying flat and cohesive sediment beds populated with DO-absorbing bacteria. The model couples Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent transport in the water-column, a biogeochemical model for DO transport and consumption in the sediment, and Darcy’s Law for the pore water-driven solute dispersion and advection. The model’s predictions compare well against experimental data for low friction-Reynolds numbers (Re). The disagreement for higher Re is investigated by progressively increasing the complexity of the model. A sensitivity analysis shows that the sediment-oxygen uptake (or demand, SOD) is approximately proportional to the bacterial content of the sediment layer, and varies with respect to fluid dynamics conditions, in accordance to classic high-Schmidt-number mass-transfer laws. The non- linear transport dynamics responsible for sustaining a statistically steady SOD are investigated by temporal- and-spatial correlations and with the aid of instantaneous visualizations: the near-wall coherent structures modulate the diffusive sublayer, which exhibits complex spatial and temporal filtering behaviours; its slow and quasi-periodic regeneration cycle determines the streaky structure of the DO field at the sediment-water interface (SWI), retained in the deeper layers of the porous medium. Oxygen depletion dynamics are then simulated by preventing surface re-areation with turbulent mixing driven by an oscillating low-speed current — an idealization of hypolimnetic DO depletion in the presence of a non-equilibrium periodic forcing. The oxygen distribution exhibits a self-similar pattern of decay with, during the deceleration phase, oscillations modulated by the periodic ejection of peaks of high turbulent mass flux (pumping oxygen towards the SWI), generated at the edge of the diffusive sublayer at the end of the acceleration phase. These fronts of highly turbulent mixing propagate away from the SWI, at approximately constant speed, in layers of below-average oxygen concentration. Finally, the model has been tested in a real geophysical framework, reproducing published in-situ DO measurements of a transitional flow in the bottom boundary layer of lake Alpnach. A simple model for the SOD is then derived for eventual inclusion in RANSE biogeochemical management-type models for similar applications.</description>

   <description>Optically active helical microparticles are studied in the forms of thin films, suspensions and powders. From fabricated helical porous thin films, microparticle suspensions are obtained by removing the microparticles (film columns) from their substrates and dispersing them into water. For removing microparticles, four methods are explored and compared: sacrificial NaCl layer, gold (Au) layer, buffered oxide etching, and direct ultrasonic agitation. The primary film material studied in this work is amorphous silicon (Si). Physical morphology of the microparticles is examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Methods employed to characterize optical activity of the microparticles include: polarimetry, spectrophotometry, and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The produced chiral microparticles exhibit optical activity: optical rotation (OR) and circular dichroism (CD - in the form of differential circular transmission (DCT)). Significant findings include: (a) we observe the largest optical rotatory power ever reported in scientific literature, 11◦/μm at 610 nm wavelength for a Si film; (b) for the helical thin films, there is one dominant DCT band in the measured wavelength range; however for microparticle suspensions and powders, there exist two DCT bands: one broad band at long wavelengths, and one narrow band in the short wavelength range; compared to their thin film forms, microparticle suspensions and powders have inverted sign for the broad DCT band. A discrete dipole approximation (DDA) model is employed to calculate optical response (e.g. extinction, scattering, and absorption cross-sections) of the microparticles, so as to enable us to understand the effects of different structural parameters of the microparticles on their optical response. Calculation confirms that optical activity of chiral microparticles is due to coherent light scatterings with the chiral structures of the particles. The inversion in sign of the broad DCT bands of microparticle suspensions and powders is likely due to the averaging effect from random orientation of the helical microparticles, as is indicated both from experimental results and from calculation.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a novel Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) approach in a grid connected single-stage flyback inverter without using any additional auxiliary circuits. The soft-switching of the primary switch is achieved by allowing negative current from the grid-side through bidirectional switches placed on the secondary side of the transformer. Basically, the negative current discharges the MOSFET’s output capacitor thereby allowing turn-on of the primary switch under zero voltage. In order to optimize the amount of reactive current required to achieve ZVS a variable frequency control scheme is implemented over the line cycle. In addition, the bi-directional switches on the secondary side of the transformer have ZVS during the turn-on times. Therefore, the switching losses of the bi-directional switches are negligible. A 250W prototype has been implemented in order to validate the proposed scheme. Experimental results confirm the feasibility and superior performance of the converter compared to the conventional flyback inverter.</description>

   <description>Erasmus Darwin’s task as a Deistic Dissenter poet who wished to promote science education to a mixed audience was complex. There was mainstream concern over what Deists and Dissenters actually believed about God, their involvement in science, and, especially, how their published works, whatever the subject, might affect public morality and politics. I argue that Darwin’s poetry is primarily in the genre of Lucretian didactic epic but that it also involves elements of other written traditions (literary and non-literary). I focus on English didactic poetry, the theological written traditions of Dissent and Deism, and a particular tradition of erotic satire. The genre of Lucretian didactic epic and the tradition of English didactic poetry are non-identical. In Darwin’s Lucretian didactic epic, resemblances to such poems as Pope’s Essay on Man challenge ideas about what kind of narrative a didactic poem in the English language can deliver.  Techniques from the theological written traditions of Dissent and Deism reflect Darwin’s affiliations, signal that science education fits within a larger debate about intellectual freedom, and promote tolerance for differences of opinion about nature. Mimicry of a particular tradition of erotic satire helps to downplay the address to a mixed audience while satirising some common misconceptions about poetry, botany, and women in the period. Darwin’s poetry challenges ideas about what people from his community of belief meant to communicate or transmit by writing for the general public, what the general public was entitled to learn, and what poetry was able to teach. Perhaps Darwin’s biggest modification of Lucretian didactic epic was that he did not tell his readers exactly what to think, but how.</description>

   <description>Cutaneous melanoma is an increasingly common aggressive malignancy. The molecular mechanisms responsible for melanoma’s initiation and progression are still unclear, but new evidence suggests microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that have been shown to act as either oncogenes or tumour suppressors. These short, ~22 nucleotide long, single stranded RNA molecules regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, through complementary binding to target messenger RNA (mRNA), and mediate mRNA degradation and translational repression. Our laboratory has previously shown that miRNA expression levels are altered through the different stages of melanoma tumourigenesis and has identified numerous significantly dysregulated miRNAs. miR-205 expression is significantly decreased in both primary and metastatic melanoma. Because of this decrease in miR-205 level with increasing cancer aggressiveness, we originally hypothesized that miR-205 may act as a tumour suppressor in melanoma. Unexpectedly, miR-205 re-expression in metastatic melanoma cells has shown oncogenetic potential. Through functional assays, we determined that miR-205 plays a primary role in promoting cellular migration and invasion, and in repressing adhesion. A gene expression analysis was conducted and the target prediction algorithm TargetScan was utilized to determine potential mRNA targets for miR-205. CADM1, PTPRJ and SHIP2 were three of the targets investigated, because of their known functional role in migration and cellular adhesion. CADM1 and PTPRJ were both verified to be directly targeted by miR-205 in an in vitro melanoma system using a luciferase reporter assay. In summary, we have demonstrated a surprising functional role for miR-205 in melanoma. The re-expression of miR-205 promotes malignant phenotypes and therefore is functioning with oncogenic potential within our metastatic melanoma cell culture system.</description>

   <description>Production downtime caused by machine faults presents a major area of concern for the manufacturing industry and can especially impact the productivity of assembly systems.  Traditional fault detection systems use a variety of conventional sensors that measure operating variables such as pressure, force, speed, current and temperature.  Faults are detected when a reading from one of these sensors exceeds a preset threshold or does not match the predicted value provided by a mathematical model of the system.  The primary disadvantage of these methods is that the relationship between sensor reading and fault is often indirect (if one exists at all).  This can lead to time delays between fault occurrence and ‘fault reading’ from a sensor, during which additional machine damage could accumulate.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis describes progress with a project whose goal is to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of using machine vision to detect ‘visually cued’ machine faults in automated assembly equipment.  It is proposed that machine vision technology could complement traditional methods and improve existing detection systems.  Two different vision-based fault detection methods were developed and tests were conducted using a laboratory-scale assembly machine that assembles a simple 3-part component   Typical faults that occurred with this machine were targeted for inspection.     &#xd;
    &#xd;
The first method was developed using Automated Visual Inspection (AVI) techniques that have been used extensively for quality inspection of manufactured products.  The LabVIEW 2010 software was used to develop the system.  Test results showed that the Colour Inspection tool performed the best with 0% false negative and false positive fault detection rates.  Despite some success, this approach was found to be limited as it was unable to detect faults that varied in physical appearance or those that had not been identified prior to testing.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second method was developed using a video event detection method (spatiotemporal volumes) that has previously been used for traffic and pedestrian monitoring.  This system was developed with MATLAB software and demonstrated strong false negative and false positive fault detection rates.  It also showed the ability to detect faults that had not previously been identified as well as those that varied in appearance.  Recommendations were made for future work to further explore these methods.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-16 12:09:35.842</description>
   <description>The Nullarbor Plain in southern Australia is an uplifted succession of Cenozoic marine carbonates whose surface has been exposed for ~14 m.y. This succession of limestones, particularly in the surfical middle Miocene Nullarbor Limestone, hosts a complex and prolonged record of meteoric diagenesis. Alteration took place through 3 broad phases of diagenesis encompassing 8 stages that are interpreted to have taken place over a dramatic regional climate change.  Phase 1 diagenesis occurred under a humid middle Miocene climate and involved mineralogical equilibration with meteoric fluids, calcite cementation, widespread microkarst, and regional lacustrine and palustrine sedimentation producing copious amounts of ooids.  These ooids are interpreted to have formed via microbial secretions and sediment aggradation over multiple seasons of changing rainfall and soil hydration states.  Cortical laminations are proposed to represent microbial mucus envelopes during wet seasons alternating with dehydration during dry seasons and precipitation of fibrous clay minerals and CaCO3 that preserve the pre-existing microbial fabrics.  Phase 2 alterations took place under a more temperate climate from the late Miocene to Pliocene with a later pronounced humid interlude.  This phase encompassed ~8 m.y. and was dominated by karst process where deep cave dissolution occurred at depressed water tables related to globally low sea levels and later shallow caves developed during a Pliocene sea level highstand.  Phase 3 has occurred since the late Pliocene and is indicative of the onset of modern semi-arid climatic conditions.  This final phase involved the creation of subsoil hollows filled with blackened limestone lithoclasts, deep and shallow dolines, and indurated pedogenic calcrete that now forms much of the surface of the Nullarbor Plain.  Blackened limestone clasts have been shown to form at the B-C boundary in soil profiles where roots have their cellular structures calcified and during this process incorporate trapped organics that ultimately produce the distinctive black colouration. The importance of this comprehensive diagenetic record is its direct applicability to the understanding of ancient subaerial exposure surfaces.</description>

   <description>The need to compactly represent 3D data is motivated by the ever-increasing size&#xd;
of these data. Furthermore, for large data sets it is useful to randomly access and&#xd;
process a small part of the data. In this thesis we propose two methods of compactly&#xd;
representing 3D data while allowing random access.&#xd;
The first is the multiresolution sphere-packing tree (MSP-tree). The MSP-tree is a&#xd;
multiresolution 3D hierarchy on regular grids based on sphere-packing arrangements.&#xd;
The grids of the MSP-tree compactly represent underlying point-sampled data by&#xd;
using more efficient grids than existing methods while maintaining high granularity&#xd;
and a hierarchical structure that allows random access.&#xd;
The second is distance-ranked random-accessible mesh compression (DR-RAMC).&#xd;
DR-RAMC is a lossless simplicial mesh compressor that allows random access and&#xd;
decompression of the mesh data based on a spatial region-of-interest. DR-RAMC encodes&#xd;
connectivity based on relative proximity of vertices to each other and organizes&#xd;
both this proximity data and vertex coordinates using a k-d tree. DR-RAMC is insensitive&#xd;
to a variety of topological mesh problems (e.g. holes, handles, non-orientability)&#xd;
and can compress simplicial meshes of any dimension embedded in spaces of any dimension.&#xd;
Testing of DR-RAMC shows competitive compression rates for triangle&#xd;
meshes and first-ever random accessible compression rates for tetrahedral meshes.</description>

   <description>Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are produced by a variety of organisms to either protect them from freezing or help them tolerate being frozen. Recent structural work has shown that AFPs bind to ice using ordered surface waters on a particular surface of the protein called the ice-binding site (IBS). These 'anchored clathrate' waters fuse to particular planes of an ice crystal and hence irreversibly bind the AFP to its ligand. An AFP isolated from the perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne (LpAFP) was previously modelled as a right-handed beta helix with two proposed IBSs. Steric mutagenesis, where small side chains were replaced with larger ones, determined that only one of the putative IBSs was responsible for binding ice. The mutagenesis work also partly validated the fold of the computer-generated model of this AFP. In order to determine the structure of the protein, LpAFP was crystallized and solved to 1.4 Å resolution. The protein folds as an untwisted left-handed beta-helix, of opposite handedness to the model. The IBS identified by mutagenesis is remarkably flat, but less regular than the IBS of most other AFPs. Furthermore, several of the residues constituting the IBS are in multiple conformations. This irregularity may explain why LpAFP causes less thermal hysteresis than many other AFPs. Its imperfect IBS is also argued to be responsible for LpAFP's heightened ice-recrystallization inhibition activity. The structure of LpAFP is the first for a plant AFP and for a protein responsible for providing freeze tolerance rather than freeze resistance. &#xd;
	To help understand what constitutes an IBS, a non-ice-binding homologue of type III AFP, sialic acid synthase (SAS), was engineered for ice binding. Point mutations were made to the germinal IBS of SAS to mimic key features seen in type III AFP. The crystal structures of some of the mutant proteins showed that the potential IBS became less charged and flatter as the mutations progressed, and ice affinity was gained. This proof-of-principle study highlights some of the difficulties in AFP engineering.</description>

   <description>In recent years Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been extensively used in the study of the indoor environment and the thermal comfort conditions for the design of modern buildings, however, there remains the need to thoroughly evaluate the accuracy of the results given by CFD methods. In the present work, numerical investigations of the indoor thermal environment in the atria of two existing buildings and in a simple three-storey atrium building design have been undertaken using CFD techniques. &#xd;
	The initial work involved the evaluation of various turbulence models and a radiation model used in CFD simulations for the prediction of the thermal environment in atria of different geometrical configurations in two buildings for which experimental data is available. The airflow patterns and temperature distributions were determined, under both forced and hybrid ventilation conditions and thermal comfort conditions were evaluated. The numerical predictions were compared with the available experimental measurements and, in general, good agreement was obtained between the numerical and experimental results.		&#xd;
	After the evaluation of the adequacy of available turbulence models and the validation of the accuracy of the CFD model used, a simple full-scale three-storey atrium building was modeled to explore the potential of using buoyancy-driven natural ventilation. The validated CFD model was used to determine the ventilation flow rates, airflow patterns, and temperature distributions in the building. The dynamic effect of the thermal mass of the external walls on the performance of the building was also investigated using transient CFD simulations. &#xd;
	Atria with various geometrical configurations were studied in order to investigate the effect of atrium design changes on the air flow and temperature distributions in the simple atrium building considered. A parametric study was carried out to assess the sensitivity of the ventilation performance to the change in various geometric and solar parameters. On the basis of this parametric study, a few changes were carried out in the design of the building to examine their effect on ventilation performance. Finally, the use of night ventilation in the atrium building was explored and it was found that night ventilation can be increased by using hot water circulation in the chimney walls.</description>

   <description>Background: Chronic conditions comprise a significant amount of healthcare utilization. For example, people with chronic diseases account for 51% of family physician encounters. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms based on comprehensive clinical records could be a rich resource for clinicians, researchers and policy-makers. However, limitations such as misclassification warrant the need for examining the accuracy of these algorithms. &#xd;
&#xd;
Purpose: To investigate and enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic algorithms for five chronic diseases in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: DESIGN: A validation study using primary chart abstraction. SETTING: A stratified random sample of 350 patient charts from Kingston practice-based research network. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnostic algorithms. ANALYSIS: A multiple logistic regression model along with the receiver operating characteristic curve was employed to identify the algorithm that maximized accuracy measures.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: The sensitivities for diagnostic algorithms were 100% (diabetes), 83% (hypertension), 45% (Osteoarthritis), 41% (COPD), and 39% (Depression).  The lowest specificity was 97% for depression. A data-driven logistic model and receiver-operating characteristic curve improved sensitivity for identifying hypertension patients from 83% to 88% and for osteoarthritis patients from 45% to 81% with areas under the curve of 92.8% and 89.8% for hypertension and osteoarthritis, respectively.  &#xd;
Conclusion: The diagnostic algorithms for diabetes and hypertension demonstrate adequate accuracy, thus allowing their use for research and policy-making purposes. A multivariate logistic model for predicting osteoarthritis diagnosis enhanced sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. This approach can be used towards further refining the diagnostic algorithms for other chronic conditions.</description>

   <description>Voltage-dependent channels on the dendrites of motoneurons provide additional current that amplifies or dampens synaptic current en route to the soma. The specific consequences will depend on the density and distribution of the voltage-dependent channels. HCN channels generate a positive inward current in response to hyperpolarization. HCN channels are responsible for a resonance phenomenon in motoneurons where inputs of certain frequencies are preferentially amplified. Modelling studies indicate that this resonance behaviour only occurs if HCN channels are uniformly distributed on the dendritic tree. However, the distribution of HCN channels on the dendrites of motoneurons is unknown. Furthermore, current techniques for measuring channel density on dendrites suffer from methodological limitations that prevent sampling on a scale necessary to map the distribution of voltage-dependent channels across the dendritic tree. The goal of the present study is to develop a high throughput method for measuring the membrane-associated density of voltage-dependent channels using immunohistochemical, confocal and three-dimensional image analysis techniques. Secondly, the proximal to distal distribution of membrane-associated channels formed by the HCN1-subunit on the dendritic trees of trapezius motoneurons in the adult feline will be compared. Antidromically identified motoneurons innervating the trapezius muscle were intracellularly stained in order to visualize the entire dendritic tree. HCN1-subunit containing channels were labeled with a specific antibody. Dendritic segments (n=27 to 92) of ten trapezius motoneurons at different distances from the soma were acquired using confocal microscopy and rendered into a three-dimensional volume. The perimeter of the intracellular stain was used to define the membrane-cytoplasmic border. Analysis of the HCN1 immunoreactivitywas constrained to this perimeter. This technique provides a means of extracting membrane-associated HCN1 labeling and therefore the functional distribution of HCN1 channels. The density of membrane-associated HCN1 immunoreactvity across the dendritic tree was either uniform or increased with distance from the soma among the ten trapezius motoneurons. The increase in HCN1 density with distance from the soma was inversely related to the density of HCN1 on the soma and proximal dendrites. Lastly, the change in HCN1 density with distance from the soma was inversely related to the total input conductance of the motoneuron.</description>
