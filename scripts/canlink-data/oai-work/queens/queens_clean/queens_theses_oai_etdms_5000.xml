   <description>AC-DC power conversion is the first power stage for all offline electronic devices. To maximize AC power transformer utilization, the power factor of AC-DC converters must be improved. The method that AC-DC converters use to improve the power factor is known as Power Factor Correction (PFC). This improvement of power factor, which can be quantified in terms of the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the converter, almost always is a trade-off for a reduction in overall converter efficiency. With increasing requirements for greater efficiency and lower THD, especially at output power loads much less than the rated output power of the AC-DC converter, new methods have been developed to meet either or both requirements. Many methods, however, can improve light load efficiency, but increase THD. Other methods, can reduce THD, but worsen light load efficiency. Some methods can reduce THD and improve light load efficiency, but at significant complexity and cost.&#xd;
A new method for improving light load efficiency and THD, called Line Cycle Skipping (LCS) is proposed. This method improves the light load efficiency and THD without increasing complexity or cost. LCS can achieve this by conducting higher power over one or one-half line cycle, and then skipping or not conducting power over the next one or more line cycles. This allows the output power to remain constant at light load, while conducting higher input power over one or one-half line cycles. By conducting higher input power over a portion of the entire LCS period, the efficiency and the THD can be improved at lower output power levels, thus improving the light load performance of PFC converters.&#xd;
LCS is implemented in digital control using a low-cost 8-bit microcontroller on a 100W PFC converter operating in critical conduction mode (CRM). Simulation results were verified by the experimental prototype waveforms. Experimental results showed significant improvement in efficiency and THD across the light load power range, proving that LCS has potential to be implemented in existing PFC converters with low cost to improve the light load efficiency and THD performance.</description>

   <description>Adipose tissue is actively involved in both the inflammatory response associated with obesity and in the determination of whole body substrate selection. In humans, evidence suggests that exercise improves adipose tissue function by reducing adipocyte inflammation; however, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. It has been suggested that exercise may improve adipose tissue function by reducing adipose cell size. It remains unknown whether exercise influences adipose tissue function independent of reductions in adipocyte size. Elevated levels of circulating TNF-α and IL-6 are both associated with adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to examine whether four weeks of sprint-interval training (SIT) was an effective means of reducing elevated circulating TNF-α and IL-6 independent of altering abdominal adipose cell size in men.  8 overweight healthy men (age: 25.13 years, weight; 113.5kg). Methods: VO2peak (L/min), adipocyte size, serum IL-6 and serum TNF-α were measured before and after 16 sessions of sprint interval training over four weeks. Results: The key findings of this experiment included that exercise significantly reduces circulating TNF-α (p=0.03) and IL-6 (p=0.05) independent of changes in weight, waist circumference and abdominal adipocyte size in overweight men. VO2 peak also significantly (p=0.04) improved after the four-week protocol. These results confirm that exercise can improve adipose tissue function independent of weight loss or changes in abdominal adipocyte size.</description>

   <title>Hope in Western Philosophy</title>

   <subject>Belief</subject>
   <subject>Virtue</subject>
   <description>This project explores hope in Western philosophy through the examination of particular beliefs and teachings concerning the works of philosophers working in the ancient, medieval, and modern eras. In the second chapter I explore Aristotle using representative primary and secondary sources in order to come to an understanding of what we can make of Aristotle’s hope secondly I discuss selections from the work of St. Augustine, a medieval thinker. The third chapter introduces Immanuel Kant, and Søren Kierkegaard into the discussion of hope. In the fourth chapter I explore hope as portrayed by Albert Camus and Jayne Waterworth. I have chosen Camus to represent the modern non-sectarian era because of his posing and answering important philosophical questions of the day. He explored the human being’s capacity to know and to act ethically and our ability to reconceptualize the physical and social worlds without appeal to God or in terms of the human being’s apparent purpose, directive principle, or goal. His articles and novels articulated a critique of religion and of the Enlightenment. Camus’ notion of the place of hope in our human condition is taken from his texts, The Stranger, The Myth of Sisyphus, and The Rebel. Jayne Waterworth is a philosopher working today and her work specifically explores the nature of hope.&#xd;
The fifth chapter of this thesis provides my explanation of what hope is from a non-sectarian, non-medical, philosophical vantage. It shows that hope can be understood on a day-to-day trivial basis such as, “I hope it will not rain on my birthday” to a profound level: “I hope my child will live through this risky surgery.” I argue that profound hope is a type of coping mechanism or ego-defense. Finally, I argue that there is no necessary reason to hope, because in some cases it can be deleterious to one’s overall well-being.</description>

   <description>Businesses look at Big Data as an opportunity to gain insights for improving their services. The derivation of such insights requires using different data mining techniques. Mature data mining tools like WEKA or R have been in development for years. They implement a large number of data mining algorithms and can support sophisticated Analytics. However, these mature tools are designed to run on a single machine making them unsuitable to handle Big Data. Using these tools requires data mining and statistics knowledge, and some of them, like R, are hard to learn. &#xd;
Businesses do not always have the technical skills required to carry on such Analytics. Even if they do, it is challenging to find a tool with the needed algorithms that supports distributed processing to handle the Big Data high arrival velocity and large volumes. The Businesses’ analytical requirements can be addressed by Consumable Big Data Analytics, that is, solutions that allow businesses to do Big Data Analytics themselves using their in-house expertise. &#xd;
In this work, we provide a Consumable Analytics solution to meet the businesses’ analytical needs. First, we conduct a survey of existing Analytics solutions to identify possible areas of improvement to provide Consumable Analytics. Second, instead of developing distributed data mining algorithms to handle Big Data, we develop the Data Mining Distribution (DMD) algorithm and the Label-Aware Disjoint Partitioning (LADP) algorithm to distribute the execution of all existing single-machine data mining algorithms without rewriting a single line of their code. This gives users the flexibility to use any available data mining library, have algorithms like Hoeffding Tree run 70% to 95% faster and achieve up to 18% increase in prediction accuracy. Third, we develop the free and open source QDrill solution to implement our DMD and LADP algorithms for distributed Analytics. QDrill implements our proposed Distributed Analytics Query Language (DAQL) interface that adds Analytics capabilities to the regular SQL syntax and allows integration with Business Intelligence (BI) tools. This allows businesses to use their in-house expertise to do Big Data Analytics using the spreadsheets and visualizations of their BI tools.</description>

   <description>This dissertation studies the ways in which Correggio’s two altarpieces for Modena, the Madonna di San Sebastiano (c. 1524) and the Madonna di San Giorgio (c. 1530), were received in their confraternity settings. Each altarpiece is examined as a separate case study in order to place it within its individual historical, social, and religious context before it was acquired by Duke Francesco I d’Este in the middle of the seventeenth century. In the introductory chapter, I consider the historiography of Correggio’s two altarpieces for Modena and discuss recent approaches to the reception of his work. The second chapter introduces the Madonna di San Sebastiano by presenting it together with the foundation legend and long-term purpose of the confraternity that commissioned it. Then, I consider the history and most likely appearance of the oratory in which the San Sebastiano Altarpiece was displayed in order to shed light on the ways in which the painting functioned to promote the corporate identity and devotional focus of the company. Finally, I examine the ways in which members of the public reacted to the Madonna di San Sebastiano, especially leading up to its acquisition by Francesco I d’Este before 1657. The fifth chapter introduces the Madonna di San Giorgio and the history of the Confraternita di San Pietro Martire. Then, using archival documents, I consider the ways in which the confraternity members incorporated the Madonna di San Giorgio into a series of distinct ephemeral displays (rappresentazioni), each of which demonstrate that they reinterpreted the devotional function of the painting according to their fluctuating spiritual needs. Finally, an examination of chronicle entries and correspondence reveals the ways in which the brothers of San Pietro Martire reacted to several requests to copy their beloved altarpiece, and provides an intimate account of how they responded to its absence after Francesco I purchased it in 1649. The dissertation concludes with a comparison of the reception of each altarpiece in its confraternity setting, in light of the availability of primary source materials. The appendices contain transcribed versions of archival documents that are examined here for the first time.</description>

   <description>1,2,3-Triazolylidene carbene stabilized borenium ions were investigated as frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) type hydrogenation catalysts and were found to be able to effect the hydrogenation of imines and N-heterocycles at ambient and near ambient pressures and temperatures. The unprecedented activity of our MIC-borenium ion catalysts was attributed to the high σ-donating ability of 1,2,3-Triazolylidene-based carbenes producing an exceptionally stable and active borenium ion catalyst.&#xd;
Several modifications to the original catalyst structure were employed in an attempt to develop an enantioselective variant of our MIC-borenium ion catalyst. One of the modification to impart asymmetry into the reaction manifold that was investigated in this thesis was the use of a chiral borane, specifically the 9-borobicyclo[3.3.2]decanes (BBDs), in place of the achiral 9-BBN present in the original catalyst design. Disappointingly catalyst stability proved to be highly problematic leading to a difficulty in synthesizing the necessary carbene-borane and resulting in a highly unstable and ineffective catalyst.&#xd;
During the course of our studies into enantioselective borenium ion catalyzed hydrogenations we became concerned with the facility of hydride abstraction by MIC-borenium ions and whether or not this would result in the racemization of enantioenriched α-N sp3 C–H centres. NMR studies revealed that our MIC-borenium ion catalyst was not able to abstract hydrides from α-N sp3 C–H’s at ambient temperatures and only appreciable rates of hydride abstraction were observed at elevated temperatures of 60 °C. This led us to conclude that the reversibility of the hydride addition could not account for poor enantioselectivity observed for chiral borenium ion catalyzed hydrogenations and showed that an enantioselective MIC-borenium ion catalysts should be possible.&#xd;
The MIC-borenium ions were also investigated for their ability to activate Si–H bonds, and if they could be used to catalyze the hydrosilylation of C=N functionalities. The MIC-borenium ions were found to be highly active hydrosilylation catalysts, able to tolerate a variety of functional groups and able to effect the rapid reduction of imines under ambient conditions.&#xd;
Finally BBD based borohydrides were also investigated as enantioselective nucleophilic hydrosilylation catalysts. Although they were able to effect the hydrosilylation of ketones, the BBD’s were only able to impart minor enantioselectivity into the catalytic manifold.</description>

   <description>Background: Psychosis is a disabling condition which results in an individual losing contact with reality. The first episode of psychosis (FEP) often emerges during adolescence or early adulthood, when individuals are pursuing important educational and career milestones, which can become derailed due to the development of major impairments. Knowledge of the career decision-making processes of individuals with FEP is limited. This information would enable vocational rehabilitation services to improve the social and career participation of individuals with FEP. Thus, this study advanced a model of the career decision-making processes of individuals with FEP and the influences that impacted these processes. &#xd;
Method: Strauss and Corbin’s Grounded Theory method was used to guide the study design, sampling and analysis. Three early intervention programs in Ontario, Canada were included in this study. Participants included 36 individuals who were either treated for FEP by an early intervention team, program staff who had direct client contact, or family members of individuals with FEP. Data collection included sociodemographic questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, program documents, case-based memos, and a reflexive journal. Analysis began with open coding, proceeded to axial coding, and terminated with selective coding, which resulted in an explanatory model.&#xd;
Results: The career decision-making processes of individuals with FEP is a multi-staged, iterative process of making a career choice based on exploration, evaluation of options, and taking actions that moves them towards their career goals. These processes unfolded over five phases of illness and recovery and are impacted by internal and environmental influences. During the onset of symptoms, participants disengage from career decision-making but reengage during recovery. For individuals with substance abuse issues or co-existing conditions active engagement in career decision-making stalled until they quit using substances or co-existing conditions are managed. &#xd;
Implications: This study’s findings suggest that vocational outcomes of individuals with FEP could be improved, if initiatives consider an individual’s phase of illness and stage of career decision-making. Future studies should assess the comprehensiveness of this model in other jurisdictions, and explore the impact of gender, psychosis onset, and vocational interventions on career decision-making.</description>

   <description>Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) caused by eutrophication seriously impact aquatic ecosystems and human health. Biomanipulation using foraging organisms to regulate and eradicate harmful algal growth has been receiving considerable attention. However, successful cases are limited to small scale operations, and organisms have included only herbivorous fish and zooplankton. Freshwater gastropods are diverse and abundant, and can be used in biomanipulation because they are easily collected and transported. The aim of this dissertation is to investigate the freshwater gastropod, Bellamya aeruginosa, in controlling CHABs. Results showed: 1) B. aeruginosa use suspension filtration to capture floating colony-forming cyanobacterial species Microcystis aeruginosa and produce pseudofaeces containing M. aeruginosa removing them from the water column; 2) Rate of suspension filtration depends on distribution overlap of B. aeruginosa and M. aeruginosa; 3) The suspension filtration is not detrimental to M. aeruginosa as the pseudofaeces containing M. aeruginosa float, decompose rapidly, and release viable Microcystis back to the water body; 4) B. aeruginosa showed low grazing ability to floating pseudofaeces, but it can graze on pseudofaeces that remain on the bottom; 5) Faeces produced by Bellamya have as low density as pseudofaeces, ruptured rapidly and subsequently released undigested Microcystis back to the water body causing secondary blooms. The combined effect of points 2 - 5 resulted in a low control efficiency; 6) Silt or turbidity significantly improved control efficiency on Microcystis due to alterations in pseudofaeces and faeces. Suspended particles and silt increased the density of pseudofaeces and faeces, respectively, so they settled to the bottom allowing increased grazing and ingestion rates, and led to significantly increased digestion. In addition, silt and suspended particles wrapped with M. aeruginosa in the pseudofaeces and faeces enhanced structural robustness, significantly increasing decomposition time, and therefore reduced M. aeruginosa viability. These findings were validated in a whole-lake experiment that successfully controlled CHABs through B. aeruginosa.&#xd;
B. aeruginosa’s digestive ability is not the major factor determining control efficiency over Microcystis, but rather the properties of the pseudofaeces and faeces. These findings suggest that instead of manipulating food-chains at different trophic levels by introducing remediating species to where cyanobacterial infestations are located, relocation of Microcystis to lake bottoms may keep it in check by co-habituating organisms.</description>

   <title>Defending Against DDoS and Unauthorized Access Attacks in Information Centric Networking</title>

   <subject>Information Centric Networking</subject>
   <subject>Network Security</subject>
   <description>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new communication paradigm that focuses on content retrieval from the network regardless of the content storage location. ICN changes the security model from securing the path to securing the content, which is available to all the ICN nodes as ICN users could benefit from any available copy. Existing security solutions cannot be applied directly to ICN architectures because of unique ICN attributes.&#xd;
In this research, we propose a security framework for ICN traffic management that includes the required functions of three components: availability, access control, and privacy. Our framework has the following attributes: be integrated within the architecture; deliver contents with high availability; transfer contents securely to legitimate users; and preserve the privacy of ICN users and contents. In this thesis, we focus on the availability and access control components.&#xd;
To build the proposed framework, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of ICN attacks and their classification. In our research, we identify unique attacks to ICN architectures and other generic relevant attacks that have impacts on ICN. The attacks can be classified into four main categories: naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous&#xd;
attacks. We study the impacts of ICN attacks on ICN attributes and security services.&#xd;
An attacker can easily send a large number of malicious requests or publish invalid contents or routes to cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and cache pollution.Hence, we propose a solution for Defending Against DDoS in ICN routing and caching (DADI). DADI limits malicious requests, selects top-ranked contents and publishers, marks malicious routes, and caches the most popular contents. We evaluate DADI using various attack scenarios and under different ratios of attackers to legitimate users.&#xd;
To prevent unauthorized access attacks, we propose Elliptic Curve based Access Control (ECAC) solution. In this protocol, fewer public messages are needed for access control enforcement between ICN subscribers and ICN nodes than the existing access control protocols. We perform security and performance analysis for ECAC.We evaluate ECAC using various scenarios and under different request rates and number of attackers with respect to the number of legitimate users.</description>

   <description>The Kinarm assessment, which is the focus of my study, is a robotic standardized assessment tool that measures brain function and memory in elderly patients. The Kinarm assessment remakes bodies in the process of turning bodies into research data. The assessment disassembles bodies in the process of rendering bodily components and functions useless and impossible, and then, reassembles bodies by enabling and constructing new components and different functions. Some elderly patients in my study experienced feelings of fear and discomfort during the assessment. Those who did not, acknowledged the legitimacy of such negative feelings, although they emphasized that they did not experience these feelings themselves. As such, research assistants on the Kinarm assessment project were well trained to perform emotional labour to improve the patients comfort level and overall experience. However, this was not enough. Patients needed to talk about and make sense of their experience in the assessment. Patients appropriated my role as principal investigator/interviewer into primary emotion worker so that they could discuss their feelings and experience in the assessment, thereby, making sense of their bodies, their role, and their feelings in the assessment. The goal of my study is to reveal patients’ feelings, beliefs and experiences when technology, specifically the Kinarm robot, is part of their healthcare experience. My findings indicate that elderly patients may experience feelings of fear, discomfort, and nervousness when faced with unfamiliar technologies in a healthcare setting. Patients think differently about their bodies in the Kinarm assessment and their comfort with the robot determines to a large extent how they perform the assessment. I recommend that elderly patients be debriefed following medical procedures that involve technologies that are unfamiliar to them.</description>

   <description>Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) micro-ring resonators coated with bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl] tetrasulfide (TESPT) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) co-condensation mesoporous silica coatings are reported as chemical sensors to detect Pb(II) and Hg(II) ions in aqueous solutions. The sensors were based on the interaction of the evanescent field of the guided light with the functionalized mesoporous silica films. Upon adsorption of heavy metal ions (Pb(II) and Hg(II)), the refractive index of the film increased, leading to observable shifts in the resonant wavelengths of the micro-resonators. The tetrasulfide groups were placed into some of the silica films to increase the films’ affinity to Pb(II) and Hg(II) ions. &#xd;
	The sensors were exposed to aqueous solutions of Pb(II) and Hg(II) ions at different concentrations and time-resolved adsorption-desorption curves were recorded and analyzed. It was found that two distinct binding sites with different affinities for metal ions were present in the S4-TEOS silica films, corresponding to the tetrasulfide groups and the silanol groups. The rate constants for the absorption and desorption processes as well as the equilibrium constants were determined for each of the binding sites and ions. The initial adsorption rates of the Pb(II) and Hg(II) uptake processes changed linearly with Pb (II) and Hg(II) concentrations from 10 ppb to 1 ppm and could be used to quantify metal ions at the 30 ppb level.&#xd;
	The adsorption and desorption processes of other ions on the same tetra-sulfide film were reported to test for possible chemical interferences – specifically of Na(I), K(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Fe(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Fe(III). In addition, Pb(II), Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Fe(II), and Fe(III) solutions were tested on mesoporous silica films without the tetrasulfide groups to test their adsorption and desorption to bare silica. These test results fitted well with a single-adsorption-site model for TEOS silica film, which confirmed the double-adsorption-site model for the S4-TEOS silica films, where the deprotonated silanol groups and the tetrasulfide groups acted as the two adsorption sites. A single-adsorption-site model was developed for the TEOS silica film, with the deprotonated silanol groups as the only adsorption sites. Tap water and seawater spiked with Pb(II) were also tested on S4-TEOS silica films.</description>

   <description>Photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs) are nano-scale devices offering an exciting platform for exploring and exploiting enhanced linear and nonlinear light-matter interactions, aided in-part by slowing down the group velocity (vg) of on-chip photons. However, with potential applications in telecommunications, bio-sensing and quantum computing, the road to commercialization and practical devices is hindered by our limited understanding of the influence of structural disorder on linear and nonlinear light propagation. This thesis refines and develops state-of-the-art mathematical and numerical models for understanding the important role of disorder-related optical phenomena for PCWs in the linear and optical nonlinear regime. The importance of Bloch modes is demonstrated by computing the power loss caused by disorder-induced scattering for various dispersion engineered PCWs. The theoretical results are found to be in very good agreement with related experiments and it is shown how dispersion engineered designs can minimize the Bloch fields around spatial imperfections resulting in a radical departure from the usual assumed scaling vg^−2 of backscattering losses. We also conduct a systematic investigation of the influence of intra-hole correlation length, a parameter characterizing disorder on backscattering losses and find the loss behaviour to be qualitatively dependent on waveguide design and frequency.&#xd;
We then model disorder-induced resonance shifts to compute the ensemble averaged disordered density of states, accounting for important local field effects which are crucial in achieving good qualitative agreement with experiments. Lastly, motivated by emerging experiments examining enhanced nonlinear interactions, we develop an intuitive time dependent coupled mode formalism to derive propagation equations describing nonlinear pulse propagation in the presence of disorder-induced multiple scattering. The framework establishes a natural length scale for each physical interaction offering considerable insight and we develop and implement a stable implicit finite-difference scheme to solve the propagation equations. Our results also reproduce some hitherto unexplained features in recent experiments and the general theory can be extended to include a wide range of other nonlinear optical effects such as three- photon absorption and four wave mixing.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the ties of kinship and affinity in the lives of sex or gender non-complying individuals, or sexual dissidents, in Muslim contexts in an era globally marked by the racialization of Islam, the rise of neoliberalism, and queer liberalism. Starting from a transnational perspective, it maps the field of queer globalizations and takes Turkey, a Muslim majority and secular nation state grappling with the influences of neoliberalism and the rise of authoritarianism, as a case study. At the local level, the project analyses the heteropatriarchal sex/gender system as one of the pillars of the nation state as opposed to the struggles of a young but vivid LGBT movement. Within this context, the dissertation specifically looks into the ties of ‘familial’ belongings among the community of sexual dissidents in Turkey, as well as how sexual dissidents who are involved in the practice of mothering among them situate themselves at the nexus of the hegemonic discourse on motherhood and their sense of belonging to this imagined ‘queer’ community. Following a queer ethnographic methodology, the analysis engages with the findings from fieldwork based on participant observation, focus group interviews with LGBT activists, and in depth interviews with sexual dissidents with children. &#xd;
An engaged analysis of the LGBT movement in Turkey reveals that the activists are in a constant process of negotiation with the neoliberal policies imposed on them by the local governance and the international agencies that provide funding to their projects regularly. While NGOization stirred the activist scene in the country, the legal recognition was contingent on restructuring the groups in line with this rigid model and there has been a proliferation of LGBT associations. Only time will tell if these organizations will turn to single-issue oriented, rights based approaches in line with the rise of queer liberalism in Western locations. While the activists find feelings of family and kinship within their organizations, in their larger community, the camia, life has a different pace. The sexual dissident parents engage in a bargain with the sex/gender system in place and thread the heteropatriarchy strategically in different moments of their lives.</description>

   <description>SuperCDMS searches for Dark Matter in the form of WIMPs.  SuperCDMS is able to reject most common background events by discriminating between electron and nuclear recoils.  In the CDMS low ionization threshold experiment mode, electron recoil discrimination is sacrificed when applying a stronger electric potential across the detector.  The electric field associated with this potential is not uniform, and the amplification of the phonon signal caused by drifting charges through this potential creates a radial dependence on the reconstructed energy.  This thesis explores a new method of identifying and rejecting events at the edge of the detector in order to improve the ratio of signal to background by excluding background events with improperly reconstructed energy.</description>

   <description>The extent to which athletes from various sports and competition levels overcome adversity has been a topic of interest in sport psychology for some time.  In recognizing the theoretical and practical implications derived from this line of inquiry, the current study sought to further our understanding by investigating a sample of elite athletes who were expected to share long-term objectives, and who had experienced a common adversity.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 professional athletes (Mage = 27.25; SD = 3.28) who had reached the National Hockey League (NHL; i.e., long-term objective) despite not being selected in the annual NHL Amateur Entry Draft (i.e., common adversity).  As a general summary, four higher-order themes were gleaned from participant responses, including information pertaining to experienced adversities and stressors (e.g., organizational stressors), long-term objectives of playing in the NHL, psychological attributes (e.g., passion, focus) and mechanisms for goal attainment (e.g., deliberate practice, perceived social support).  Interestingly, contextually relevant information emerged pertaining to the developmental stream that participants had taken (i.e., NCAA vs. Major Junior). Overall, our findings are in concert with previous literature that suggests the influence of various psychosocial factors for goal achievement when faced with adversity (e.g., Howells &amp; Fletcher, 2015; Tamminen, Holt, &amp; Neely, 2013).  Additionally, our findings indicate that an athletes’ ability to identify and address weaknesses following adversity is a main contributor to their subsequent success. Although undrafted NHL players were recruited because of their shared adversity, participants shared similar experiences as other elite athletes in describing a variety of adversities that contributed to their eventual achievement (e.g., Sarkar &amp; Fletcher, 2014a).  Future research could benefit from a longitudinal approach building from this study’s design, whereby athletes are interviewed prior to, during, and following the draft process, to gain insight into the timing and implementation of the factors and experiences that facilitate achievement despite adversity.</description>

   <description>Using statistical models, this dissertation investigates the transmission and effects of monetary and fiscal policies in the context of new challenges and environments that emerged following the 2008 global financial crisis. Chapter 2 analyzes an important step in the transmission of monetary policy---the interest rate pass-through from money market rates to consumer retail loan and deposit rates---in Canada from 1983 to 2015 using a nonlinear vector error-correction model. I find that pass-through was complete for all rates before the financial crisis but since the end of the 2008--09 recession, it has significantly declined for deposit rates. Chapter 3, co-authored with Margaux MacDonald, investigates the effects of unconventional monetary policy in Canada. We use recently proposed methods to construct a shadow interest rate that captures monetary policy at the zero lower bound and estimate a small open economy Bayesian structural vector autoregressive model. Controlling for the US macroeconomic and monetary policy variables, we find that Canadian unconventional monetary policy had expansionary effects on the Canadian economy. Chapter 4 shifts focus to fiscal policy. The rise in US partisan conflict following the Great Recession led to a popular belief that uncertainty about fiscal policy was impeding output growth. I explore this hypothesis by nesting it in a standard structural vector autoregression model traditionally used for estimating fiscal multipliers. I augment the model with stochastic volatility (a measure of uncertainty) and allow that to interact with the endogenous variables. I consider various trend assumptions, subsamples, information sets and estimation methods and find that the evidence does not support this hypothesis. The results reveal that there is no systematic relationship between fiscal policy uncertainty and output. Moreover, a time-varying parameter version of the model shows that the lack of consistency across specifications is not driven by changes in the transmission of uncertainty shocks over time.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the preparation and evaluation of a biomimetic scaffold for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tissue engineering. An electrospun poly(L-lactide-co¬-acrylated trimethylene carbonate) scaffold was functionalized with a peptide containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) amino acid sequence to increase mechanotransduction and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production by fibroblasts seeded on the scaffold surface. The peptide was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and conjugated to the polymer via a Michael-type addition, using a cysteine moiety on the peptide and a maleimide functional group on the polymer. The peptide-polymer conjugate was successfully electrospun with the bulk polymer, resulting in an aligned fibre mat that was crimped and crosslinked to mimic the architecture of native ACL tissue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Analysis of scanning electron microscope images demonstrated no difference in fibre diameter or scaffold porosity between scaffolds with and without peptide functionalization. There was also no difference in the Young’s modulus and toe region of the scaffolds prepared with the functionalized and non-functionalized polymer. Therefore, the inclusion of the RGD peptide did not affect the biomimetic architecture of the electrospun polymer scaffolds.&#xd;
&#xd;
ACL fibroblasts (ACLFs) were attached to the scaffolds, to an extent that was independent of peptide functionalization. Further, scaffolds were cultured under dynamic uniaxial tension to examine the effect of mechanotransduction on the cells. The scaffolds, with and without RGD-modification, were exposed to 10% strain at 1 Hz for 1 h per day. After 12 days, ACLFs cultured dynamically proliferated to a lesser extent than those cultured statically, but produced greater amounts of the ECM proteins collagen and glycosaminoglycan per cell.</description>

   <description>Polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (PLECs) were tested by means of bias stress, luminescent imaging and optical scanning probing. These cells were characterized in terms of the effect of doping on the operational lifetime of the cells, the electronic structure of the pn junctions formed in the cells and the average doping levels in the cells.&#xd;
The lifetime performance of sandwich cells was compared in operation with intermediate storage time and in continuous operation. The cells that were stressed intermittently were more prone to black spots degradation than the cells in continuous operation when the total stress time was the same. However, the black spots vanished in the cells’ idle time, which shows that these spots are local highly doped regions. The appearance of the black spots was strongly associated with the storage of the cell in the presence of the aluminum cathode.&#xd;
The doping in planar PLECs was investigated by optical beam induced current (OBIC) and photoluminescence (PL) scanning using a focused laser beam. Both p-n and p-i-n PLEC junctions were identified and the junction widths were extracted. The widths were as small as 0.21% of the cell size being the smallest width identified for PLECs and light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), in general. Exposing the cells to relaxation (de-doping) cycles resulted in shrinkage in the depletion region width, contrary to what is expected. This suggests the presence of submicron structures in the as-activated cells that disappeared after relaxation. In addition, it was observed that relaxation caused a p-i-n junction to emerge from the as-activated p-n junction. The junction doping level was extracted from the OBIC data and was validated via drift diffusion calculations. The calculations showed PLEC doping levels in the range of 10E14 cm^-3 – 10E15 cm^-3 in the junction region. &#xd;
The average doping level in planar PLECs was measured by stress-discharge tests. The measurement offered validation for the used method to estimate PLEC doping levels by integrating the activation charge up to the junction formation. The measurement revealed average doping levels of 10E19 cm^-3 - 10E20 cm^-3, which is much higher than doping levels determined for the junction.</description>

   <title>Calibration of Infrared Photons in Cryogenic Germanium Detectors</title>

   <description>A significant evidence from galaxies and astrophysical observations, suggests that ~ 85% of the matter in our Universe is invisible matter. The observations of the so-called “dark matter” suggest that it consists of non-relativistic, non-baryonic particles, which seldom interact with baryonic matter, or with each other. Many experiments are searching for dark matter, each of which is based on a particular dark matter candidate. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one of the well-motivated candidates for dark matter. So far, no answers were provided by the Standard Model of particle physics to the dark matter puzzle. &#xd;
The Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search experiment (SuperCDMS) is considered one of the pioneer experiments in the direct search for WIMPs. It is based primarily on deploying germanium and silicon detectors at cryogenic temperatures to search for direct WIMP-nucleus elastic scattering interaction through which lattice vibrations are generated and sensed in one of the coldest detectors ever built.&#xd;
The new phase of SuperCDMS experiment at SNOLAB is aiming to be sensitive to the lower WIMP mass scale. Therefore, a lower background and detector threshold energy is a necessity, and the detectors need to be calibrated and tested for the new proposed sensitivity. The tests include high bias voltages, which are required to increase the gain in signal-to-noise ratio and to allow for the detection of low energy events using the phonon signal. However, the upper limit and polarity for the bias voltage need further studies in order to understand the variation of the detector’s response to high voltage. Therefore, we performed the breakdown measurement (chapter 4) at Queen’s Test Facility. &#xd;
Moreover, detectors have to be calibrated before being utilized in measuring low energy interactions, and that is what lead to the use of infrared photons. Once we can calibrate and understand the behavior of infrared photons in germanium detectors, they can be utilized in calibrating germanium detectors at the lower energy scale. Therefore, we performed the infrared calibration measurement which represents the bulk of the work in my thesis.</description>

   <description>The purpose of my dissertation was to assess the relevance of adult attachment in explaining spousal adjustment and relationship functioning in military deployment experiences. Specifically, I was interested in identifying what attachment dimensions are related to spousal coping and relationship perceptions during deployment separations and reunions, when and how attachment dimensions are related to outcomes during across the deployment cycle, and why attachment dimensions are related to such outcomes. This project was sponsored by the Director General Military Personnel Research and Analysis (Department of National Defence) and consisted of three phases. Phase One was cross-sectional, examining civilian spouses/partners of military members experiencing a deployment separation (Group A), and civilian spouses/partners of military members experiencing a deployment reunion (Group B). Group A individuals were invited to participate in a longitudinal study, following them monthly across the separation, as Phase Two. Phase Three consisted of a large-scale survey sent to spouses/partners of military members capturing several indices of coping and relationship functioning for spouses of varying partner deployment status’. In Phase One, for Group A, attachment anxiety was related to compromised coping and relationship perceptions during the separation, and attachment avoidance related to increased coping, but negative relationship perceptions. The relationships between attachment anxiety and relationship perceptions were moderated by time deployed and experience with deployments. For Group B, attachment anxiety was related to decreased coping and negative relationship perceptions during the reunion. The relationships between attachment anxiety and relationship perceptions were mediated by expectations of the return, and were moderated by time reunited. In Phase Two, attachment avoidance was related to negative relationship perceptions including difficulties with emotional support. In Phase Three, attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and their interaction was related to indices of coping and relationship functioning. Further, some of these relationships were moderated by environmental conditions. Notably, recent deployment status moderated relationships among attachment dimensions and perceived relationship and coping outcomes. Finally, I found that emotional fitness mediated relationships among attachment anxiety and coping outcomes, and perceptions of partner support mediated relationships among attachment anxiety and relationship outcomes. Practical and theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.</description>

   <description>Device-based approaches are being developed to measure biological particles such as cells, viruses, proteins, and DNA in dilute samples in situ, on site, or in real time. In many applications, device-based approaches are far more practical or feasible than method-based approaches, which are typically based on microbiological culture or the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, because device-based approaches, unlike method-based approaches, are portable, automated, and rapid. At the heart of device-based approaches is the biosensor, which is an analytical device that integrates a biological recognition element with a transduction element. Dynamic-mode cantilevers are an attractive technology for biosensors because they are highly sensitive, label-free, and can be mass-produced cheaply. Microelectrodes that generate electrokinetic effects are also an attractive technology for biosensors, because they can greatly accelerate the capture of biological particles suspended in liquid. In this context, we develop microelectromechanical devices, which we call electrokinetic cantilever biosensors, that combine the high sensitivity of dynamic-mode cantilevers with the rapid capture of biological particles with electrokinetics using standard micromachining fabrication processes. We make the following contributions to the field of device-based biosensing. We develop a thermal ablation method to remove biological material from the surface of silicon biosensors so that biosensors can be conveniently reused during prototyping. We find that piezoelectric actuation is more suitable than electrothermal actuation and we find that electrode configurations with a small electrode gap (≤ 3μm) are best suited for electrokinetics. We perform real-time measurements of E. coli in samples with concentrations as low as 10^2 cells/ml, which approach the infectious dose of E. coli (≈10 cells/ml). We also develop a gap method, which is based on stiffness-change instead of mass-change, to greatly increase the sensitivity of dynamic-mode cantilever biosensors. In this thesis, we conclude that electrokinetic cantilever biosensors are strong candidates for further research. We recommend conducting further work to study the gap method in liquid and to integrate sandwich electrodes with existing, highly sensitive cantilever biosensor designs.</description>

   <description>With the increasing use of Simulink modeling in embedded system development, there comes a need for effective techniques and tools to support managing these models and their related artifacts. Because maintenance of models, like source code, makes up such a large portion of the cost and effort of the system as a whole, it is increasingly important to ensure that the process of managing models is as simple, intuitive and efficient as possible.&#xd;
&#xd;
By examining the co-evolution patterns of Simulink models and their respective test cases (a useful modeling artifact), it is possible to gain an understanding of how these systems evolve over time, and what the impact of changes to a model are&#xd;
on the relevant test cases. This analysis uncovered opportunities to present useful findings to developers in order to effectively manage model changes. By tracing the impact of a change to a Simulink model block on both the surrounding blocks and the tests associated with the model, developers can ensure that changes are accurately propagated, and can avoid changes that would lead to inconsistencies.&#xd;
&#xd;
To support the model management process, three tools have been produced, each addressing a different aspect of the maintenance process: SimPact is used to identify and highlight the impact of changes to model blocks on tests and the rest of the model, SimTH automatically generates test harnesses for Simulink models, and SimEvo combines these tools into a comprehensive evolution support package, with the ability to interface with existing industry tools. Each of these tools has been evaluated against a large industrial model set, and some are already in current use in industry, demonstrating their effectiveness and applicability to real world problems.</description>

   <description>The ability to design materials with controlled degradation rates has stimulated the development of polyesters for a range of applications, from biomedical to environmental. Although attractive because they become increasingly hydrophilic upon hydrolysis, many polyester materials need high molecular weight (MW) for the good colloidal stability and mechanical properties required for end-use applications. As degradation rates are directly linked to polyester chain length, this precludes potential applications that require both high MW and fast hydrolysis. “Grafting through” radical polymerization (RP) of short-chain polyester macromonomers (1-5 units) decouples hydrolysis time and MW by efficiently imparting polyester material properties onto a much higher MW comb-polymer frame. These macromonomers are synthesized by a ring opening polymerization (ROP) in which the type and stoichiometric ratio of cyclic monomer to initiator controls the final comb-polymer degradability.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, several ROP initiators are implemented to produce four new methacrylate macromonomer families with different end-group functionalities (alkyl, tertiary amine, quaternary ammonium, and carboxyl). The utility of these new end-group functionalities in comb-polymer materials is demonstrated by proof of concept application developments conducted in cooperation with three research groups. Alkyl macromonomers provide a means to delay the onset of comb-polymer hydrolysis, cationic macromonomers are polymerized to produce novel flocculants with hydrolysis-triggered enhanced sediment dewaterability, while a biorenewable material is modified with tertiary amine macromonomers to have both pH responsive and tunable hydrophobicity characteristics. In each application, the ability to easily tune the material’s performance by specifying the functional group density in the ROP step is emphasized.&#xd;
&#xd;
To facilitate the efficient production of comb-polymer materials, macromonomer radical (co)polymerization kinetics are studied in bulk, solution, and micellar media. The alkyl terminated macromonomer bulk homopropagation rate constants determined by pulsed laser polymerization are invariant to the number of polyester units in the methacrylic ester side chain. In addition, macromonomer relative consumption behavior in solution copolymerization with styrene is determined by the chemical identity up to several units away from the methacrylic ester, independent of the polyester type, length, and end-group functionality. As further product development opportunities emerge, this kinetic knowledge will enable improved control of comb-polymer composition and MW.</description>

   <description>The vast majority of English words are multisyllabic (Balota et al., 2007; Baayen, Piepenbrock, &amp; Gulikers, 1995), constituting an increasingly large proportion of the words students encounter in print beginning as early as Grade 3 (Archer, Gleason, &amp; Vachon, 2003; Nagy &amp; Anderson, 1984; Zeno, Ivens, Millard, &amp; Duvvuri, 1995). Students who continue to struggle with word reading through elementary and into secondary school often have a particular difficulty with longer words (Archer, Gleason, &amp; Vachon, 2003; Moats, 1998). This multi-manuscript dissertation reports on two studies of multisyllabic word reading in&#xd;
typically achieving, English-speaking students in grades 4 and 5. The first study examined children’s multisyllabic word reading ability and the relative contributions of five variables of interest: phonological awareness, suprasegmental phonological awareness, morphological awareness, vocabulary, and naming speed. Regression analyses showed that the contribution of phonological awareness (at both the segmental and suprasegmental levels) was fully mediated by that of morphological awareness and that naming speed and morphological awareness predicted children’s multisyllabic word reading accuracy at this stage of reading development. The second study used error analysis to describe the types of errors students made when reading multisyllabic words. Error productions were examined according to reading ability, based on a six-point coding scheme developed to assess decoding and lexical stress errors; good readers made proportionally fewer errors, but were more likely to make errors involving shifts in lexical stress. Error productions were also described in terms of lexicalization (reading the item as a real but erroneous word) and stress regularization (stress shift to the first syllable, in accordance with the majority of English trisyllabic words). Both morphological awareness and vocabulary were positively related to the incidence of lexicalized errors, while both reading ability and suprasegmental phonological awareness were positively related to participants’ tendency to regularize the primary stress of multisyllabic words. Results of both studies are discussed in terms of contributions to theory, instruction, and future research in multisyllabic word reading.</description>

   <description>This thesis contains three essays spanning the  fields of econometrics and empirical&#xd;
macroeconomics. The first essay develops an econometric procedure that enables&#xd;
applied researchers to quantify spatial interactions from panel data where variables&#xd;
exhibit recurrent abrupt shifts in behavior. In empirical macroeconomics, omitting&#xd;
spatial effects is restrictive in many contexts because the units of analysis are regions,&#xd;
the characteristics of which are rarely independent. The second essay employs&#xd;
this methodology to investigate how recessions propagated through small regional&#xd;
economies in the United States from 1990 to 2015. The empirical results identify&#xd;
regions that are potentially at risk of collective economic distress, which is useful&#xd;
for national and regional policy makers. The analysis shows the importance of the&#xd;
spatial (or geographical) dimension in explaining how regional shocks amplify in the&#xd;
economy. The third essay, co-authored with Morten Ø. Nielsen, investigates a unique&#xd;
data set of daily political opinion polls in the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2015.&#xd;
This work explores the forecasting capabilities of the recently developed fractionally&#xd;
cointegrated vector auto-regressive (FCVAR) model. The results show that the&#xd;
FCVAR model delivers superior forecast accuracy relative to a portfolio of existing&#xd;
alternatives. Furthermore, the forecasts generated by the FCVAR model leading into&#xd;
the UK 2015 general election provide a more informative assessment of the current&#xd;
state of public opinion than that suggested by opinion polls.</description>

   <description>The Athabasca oil sands are a significant component of the economy in Alberta. However, they also represent a large environmental risk. At the end of mining operations, companies are expected to begin closure and reclamation activities, which tend to be very costly. The reclamation costs associated with oil sands operations are currently unknown, creating the potential for unprepared operators and leaving the citizens of Alberta and other stakeholders at risk of liabilities.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis aims to create a method of determining the reclamation costs that can be expected for each open pit oil sands operation. A framework is proposed that can be utilized to estimate the reclamation costs associated with various operations. The framework attempts to use a logical thought progression that estimators can follow. The intent is to offer guidance from a large, “big picture” perspective down to minute details, which can then be synthesized into a cost estimate. The framework also makes use of key performance indicators for progress tracking. An example of the framework being applied to a tailings pond is included.&#xd;
&#xd;
Public policies and regulations that have been implemented in the past have been misguided in their attempts to improve the overall sustainability in the oil sands. Although the intentions were good, regulations such as Directive 074 created unrealistic targets and timelines that operators were unable to meet. This thesis discusses these issues and suggest possible improvements to future policies.&#xd;
&#xd;
The state of reclamation in the oil sands is also examined. Historical data from the Alberta Government, the Oil Sands Information Portal, and various oil sands operators is collected and analyzed. The technology being developed by Canadian Oil Sands, Syncrude, Suncor, and Canadian Natural Resources is summarized and the resulting reclamation progress is examined.</description>

   <description>Background: There is concern that patients are waiting too long to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) after presenting to the healthcare system. Previous research has found issues with the availability and quality of colonoscopy resources, a key procedure used to diagnose CRC, including long colonoscopy wait times, regional variations in colonoscopy utilization, and variations in colonoscopy quality. However, no research has described colonoscopy resource availability and quality and its relationship with the CRC diagnostic interval.&#xd;
Methods: This thesis examined colonoscopy resource availability and quality and its relationship with the CRC diagnostic interval in two phases using administrative health data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Phase One used a population-based cross-sectional design to describe colonoscopy resource availability and quality in Ontario between 2007 and 2013. We described regional variations in colonoscopy resources and evaluated associations between colonoscopy resources and colonoscopy utilization. Phase Two used a population-based retrospective cohort design to describe the CRC diagnostic interval for Ontario CRC patients diagnosed between 2009 and 2012 and to evaluate the associations between colonoscopy resource availability and quality and the diagnostic interval. We used quantile regression to model these relationships while controlling for confounding and evaluating effect modification.&#xd;
Results: In Phase One, we found regional variation in the availability and quality of colonoscopy resources in Ontario. Significant correlations between colonoscopy resource characteristics and colonoscopy utilization indicated that reduced resource availability and quality were associated with reduced colonoscopy utilization. In Phase Two, the median CRC diagnostic interval was 84 days (90th percentile 323 days). We observed significant associations between the diagnostic interval and the availability and quality of colonoscopy resources. Patients residing in networks with lower colonoscopist density, colonoscopy completion rates and private clinic access had longer diagnostic intervals. These measures of colonoscopy resource availability and quality were also associated with the care that patients received within the diagnostic interval.&#xd;
Conclusion: This research demonstrated substantial variation in colonoscopy resource availability and quality in Ontario and identified the availability and quality of colonoscopy resources as an important determinant of the CRC diagnostic interval.</description>

   <title>Not Everyone Is a Target: An Analysis of Online Identity Crime Victimization Using Routine Activities Theory</title>

   <subject>Routine Activity Theory</subject>
   <subject>Victimization</subject>
   <subject>Online Identity Crime</subject>
   <description>This study examines online identity theft, consumer fraud and phishing victimization using data from a national survey of Canadians. The goal is to answer the following questions: (1) Is everyone equally likely to be a target of online crime? and (2) What factors might lead to online victimization? This research utilizes Routine Activity Theory (Cohen and Felson 1979) and an extension proposed by Eck and Clarke (2003). This approach specifies that crime is facilitated by an offender’s motivation, the absence of effective guardians, and the availability of suitable targets online.&#xd;
	This research draws on the 2009 General Social Survey (GSS). Logistic regression is used to analyze the relationships between demographic variables, perceptions of risk and online routine activities on identity theft, consumer fraud, and phishing victimization.	&#xd;
	Findings reveal that education has a consistent effect on all three types of victimization when taking into account routine activities. Men are less likely to change passwords regularly and to delete emails on a regular basis compared with women. Men, compared with women, are also more likely to be victims of consumer fraud and phishing. Results show that perceptions of risk are correlated with victimization. Several forms of routine activities (using the internet for banking, making reservations or bookings, and belonging to online social network websites) increase all three types of victimization. In addition, using the internet for purchasing goods or services or using online chat services increases victimization for consumer fraud and phishing. The results also reveal that those who deal with known websites, enter misleading information online, regularly change their passwords and delete emails are more likely to be victims of online consumer fraud and phishing. This could be explained by other ‘risky’ online activities that moderate relationships. &#xd;
	Findings provide support for Routine Activities Theory as an explanation for online identity theft, consumer fraud, and phishing victimization. Further research should explore additional causes, such as ‘risky’ online activities that lead to online victimization. Research should also focus on prevention measures aimed at those most at risk of victimization.</description>

   <description>Slopes are often monitored by measuring deformation rates, or the factor of safety is estimated through the use of limit equilibrium stability models to evaluate the risk of failure.  In this thesis, three novel landslide monitoring technologies are advanced, assessed, and applied using three strategically chosen field sites.   Firstly, it was investigated if acoustic emissions (AE) could be used to measure the displacement of extremely slow-moving landslides.  By installing a shallow and a deep AE sensor as well as a ShapeAccelArray (SAA) in a slope located in Peace River, Alberta, it was found that data from a shallow AE sensor allows noise to be filtered from the deep AE sensor data, and that smaller displacement rates than previously expected can be measured using an AE sensor. The second monitoring advance explored a method of measuring 3D slope displacement using digital image correlation (DIC) performed on hillshade images (image of shaded point cloud data).  Through the use of synthetic movement tests and experimental data, it was found that 3D displacement can be measured using hillshade images at two different view angles and that small deformations leading to failure can be measured allowing the time to failure to be calculated.  Thirdly, point cloud data produced from historical air photos was used to investigate whether historical slope profiles could be produced to serve as a quantitative baseline of historical landslide activity. This hypothesis was tested to investigate the impact of land-use change on retrogressive landslides occurring along a waterway.  Natural revegetation of the area around the creek was observed to result in a significant decrease in the volume of landslide debris generated by geomorphic processes. Finally, back analyses were conducted to estimate the mobilised shear strength at failure through the use of monitoring data from two 3.5 metre high earth dams brought to failure.  This unique dataset provided an assessment of the repeatability of the back analyses and showed that only a small component of apparent cohesion arises from a combination of dilation, unsaturated soil behaviour, or root reinforcement.</description>

   <description>Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effects of desvenlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, on sleep architecture in depressed patients, with a focus on changes in slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and sleep efficiency. Secondarily, subjective changes in sleep quality and illness severity are assessed. &#xd;
Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to receive a placebo or 50mg once daily of desvenlafaxine. Sleep architecture, subjective sleep quality, and illness severity were measured at baseline, after 3-5 days of treatment, and after 28-31 days of treatment. Sleep architecture was assessed using overnight, ambulatory polysomnography. Subjective sleep quality was evaluated using the self-reported Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a visual analogue scale (VAS). Illness severity was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale. &#xd;
Results: Nine patients (two males and seven females), aged 19 to 48 years old, participated. There were no significant differences between the placebo and desvenlafaxine-treated groups on any sociodemographic measures. At baseline, there were no significant differences in sleep architecture or clinical measures between the two groups. At day 3-5, latency to REM sleep was significantly increased for the desvenlafaxine-treated group compared to placebo, and although this measure was still increased at day 28-31, the difference was no longer significant. No differences were found between the two groups at day 3-5 or day 28-31 on measures of sleep continuity or time spent in each sleep stage. Treatment with desvenlafaxine significantly decreased scores on the PSQI, HDRS, MADRS, HARS, and the CGI-S. &#xd;
Conclusion: Treatment of depressed patients with desvenlafaxine decreased illness severity and improved subjective sleep quality. Minimal changes to sleep architecture were observed, with an acute increase in REM sleep latency being the only significant effect. These results suggest that desvenlafaxine may be capable of improving sleep quality in depressed patients, though further research with a larger sample size is needed to confirm and expand on these findings.</description>

   <description>ALS is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons (Gordon 2013). Recently, it has been found that up to 50% of individuals with ALS have evidence of cognitive impairment and approximately 15% meet the diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Moreover, the pathology of ALS has been found to be widespread (Neumann et al., 2006; Robberecht and Philips, 2013). To this day, traditional clinical examinations have been used to assess ALS patients, which have been shown to be subjective. This led us to ask the question: could introducing a novel method of assessment (robotics) give us a more objective and reproducible approach? Also, could using a different method reveal other impairments caused by ALS reflecting the evolving picture of its more widespread pathology? &#xd;
         In this thesis, we assessed 14 subjects, 12 diagnosed with ALS and 2 diagnosed with PLS. The assessment of subjects consisted of two parts: 1) a clinical assessment and 2) a robotic assessment using the KINARM Exoskeleton.   We then correlated the performance of subjects on the robotic tasks with their clinical examination results. &#xd;
        The robotic assessment consisted of 8 tasks, divided into 4 categories 1) Motor tasks which included Visual guided reaching, and Ball on Bar. 2) Motor-cognitive tasks included Reverse visually guided reaching (RVGR), Object hit, and Object hit and avoid. 3) Cognitive tasks included Spatial Span, and Trail Making A and B 4) A sensory task, Arm Position Matching. &#xd;
       The results of this thesis indicate that subjects showed various deficits along a spectrum of sensorimotor and cognitive functions, related to various networks in the brain. Some tasks and parameters were more commonly impaired such as the Reaction Time and RVGR. Some subjects were more impaired in sensorimotor tasks than cognitive tasks and vice versa.  Robotic tasks were shown to be objective and accurate; most subjects could tolerate them. Examining a larger cohort of subjects in the future could enable us to further observe for patterns of impairment and phenotypes within the ALS population.</description>

   <description>This thesis was based on three interrelated studies and offers the following contributions to the epidemiology of depression and diabetes in Canada:&#xd;
&#xd;
1. The first study centres around a validation study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the CPCSSN depression case finding algorithm in patients with diabetes and to estimate the true prevalence of depression in patients with diabetes.  The sensitivity of the depression algorithm was found to be 50.7% (39.1-62.1%) and specificity 92.5% (86.6-96.0%).  The prevalence of depression in patients with diabetes using the CPCSSN case finding algorithm was 19.8% and the validation sample produced a higher estimate of this prevalence rate of 34.5% (28.4-41.2%).  Different sensitivities were observed for males and females, and for seniors and those &lt;65 years of age.&#xd;
&#xd;
2.  The objective of the second study was to determine, among Canadians with&#xd;
diabetes, what is the relative risk of having poor blood sugar control for those patient with depression compared to those without depression.  Factors that impact this relationship and potential treatment disparities for those with depression were also explored.  Patients with depression were more likely to have poor blood sugar control with a crude relative risk of 1.28 (1.16, 1.42) and a fully adjusted relative risk of 1.22 (1.10, 1.34).  Covariates positively associated with poor control included being male, the number of years with diabetes, and having comorbid dementia.  Covariates associated with better control were age over 65 years, having comorbid hypertension, osteoarthritis, or Parkinson’s.  Effect modification was observed for both being obese and being a senior.   No evidence of diabetes treatment disparities were found for patients with depression compared to those without depression.&#xd;
&#xd;
3. The final study adjusts the relative risks from the second study for the misclassification observed in the validation study.  The sensitivity was used to estimate the potential strength and direction of the relative risk had the misclassification not occurred.  The crude corrected estimate of relative risk of poor blood sugar control for patients with diabetes with and without recent depression was 5.99 (5.47, 6.55), which was much higher than the crude relative risk estimated in the second study.</description>

   <description>Exposure to sub-zero temperatures puts plants at risk of freeze-induced damage associated with ice crystal formation causing cellular dehydration, plasma membrane rupture and cell death. Some freeze-tolerant plants induce expression of ice-binding proteins (IBPs), which adsorb to ice crystals and restrict their growth. IBPs can also result in the super-cooling of the apoplast and a modest freezing point depression.  Seven IBPs (BdIRI1-7) from the annual brome grass, Brachypodium distachyon, shaped ice, restricted ice crystal growth, and exhibited low levels of freezing point depression (~0.1 °C at 1 mg/mL). Analysis of the ice-binding domain of one isoform (BdIRI1), suggested it folded as a right-handed beta-helix with two relatively flat ice-binding faces (IBFs). Site-directed mutagenesis verified that both faces were required for ice crystal adsorption, with one face acting as the primary IBF. BdIRI1 also significantly depressed the ice nucleation activity of Pseudomonas syringae extracts, suggesting a dual-function role for ice recrystallization inhibition and anti-pathogenesis. &#xd;
	The first knockdown of ice-binding activity from any organism was achieved in B. distachyon using a pan-isoform microRNA construct. Electrolyte leakage assays showed that genetically-engineered knockdown lines had 13-22% more membrane damage than wild-type plants following freezing to −10 °C. Knockdown lines also showed trends for reduced whole-plant freezing survival following −8 °C treatments, with two lines showing significant decreases. &#xd;
	The localization of IBPs, as well as their ability to confer freeze tolerance to a susceptible host species, was examined by the expression of IBPs from the ryegrass, Lolium perenne in Arabidopsis thaliana. Two isoforms, LpIRI2 and LpIRI3, were localized to the apoplast with the former lacking a signal peptide and presumably being secreted through a non-classical pathway, while LpAFP, an engineered construct with no signal peptide, remained intracellular. Apoplastically-localized IBPs conferred freeze resistance with a significant 13-29% decrease in electrolyte leakage and increased freeze survival at temperatures as low as −8 °C. Expression of multiple isoforms further enhanced survival indicating that IBPs might provide additive freeze protection. Together, this thesis highlights the importance of IBPs in the freezing-stress response and their potential utility in the generation of future cold-hardy crop species.</description>

   <title>A Streamlined Energy Efficiency Indicator for Water Distribution Systems</title>

   <description>The conveyance of water through centralized water distribution systems is energy intensive. With growing urban populations and deteriorating buried infrastructure, these costs are expected to increase. Energy indicators can offer insight into the amount of energy one could theoretically save, provide a method for tracking and evaluating energy improvements over time, allow for comparison between utilities, and inform goal setting.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, a novel energy indicator was developed and validated that resolved problems with existing mechanical energy indicators for water distribution systems. The previous indicators developed for water distribution systems do not provide a detailed method to estimate unavoidable energy losses due to friction and leakage, and do not consider demand-side conservation in the overall unavoidable energy loss estimation.&#xd;
This thesis presents three original ideas in creating an energy indicator that better describes the mechanical energy efficiency of water distribution systems. These include: 1) incorporating demand-side conservation plans in the calculation for minimum energy delivered to end users, 2) developing a detailed methodology to calculate the minimum energy lost due to leakage, and 3) creating a uniform method that estimates minimum energy loss due to friction.&#xd;
&#xd;
By combining these three ideas, this thesis developed a new streamlined mechanical energy efficiency indicator that can be calculated without the need for a hydraulic model. In order to validate this streamlined approach, the energy indicator was evaluated using a hydraulic model and extended period simulation for a variety of synthetic and real water distribution system models. Results suggested that the streamlined approach provides an accurate characterization of the overall mechanical energy efficiency of a water distribution system.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first step to decreasing the energy use of a water distribution system is to assess its mechanical energy efficiency. The streamlined energy efficiency indicator developed in this thesis improves on previous indicators by developing a well-defined methodology in order to calculate all major unavoidable energy losses for a water distribution system. This leads to a more accurate energy efficiency indicator that facilitates comparison across different water utilities, promoting benchmarking and goal setting.</description>

   <description>Ever since its first edition and commentary in 1921, the Beersheba Edict has been regarded as a collection of four inscriptions. It continues to be debated amongst scholars, such as Denis Feissel, because it records a collection of yearly sums from settlements across all three Palaestinae in the sixth century. As the Beersheba Edict does not specify a reason for the annual collection of solidi from these settlements, scholars have put forth numerous hypotheses in order to explain them. This paper does not aim to propose a new hypothesis, nor does it seek to disprove the latest interpretation of the Edict by Leah Di Segni. This paper, instead, prefers to work with the hypothesis of Di Segni by investigating the evidence for hospitality services and general travel along the roman roads connecting settlements recorded in the Beersheba Edict.</description>

   <title>A Roman Frontier Exhibit in Northwestern Ontario: A Theoretical Foundation for Future Work</title>
   <creator>Jeffrey, Marcus</creator>
   <description>This research project provides a foundation for a travelling museum exhibit about life on the Roman frontier, for display in Northwestern Ontario. An effective exhibit depends on an understanding of the many roles museums play in modern society, and the unique challenges they face. This paper examines how today's museums function as centres of tourism, entertainment, and education. It discusses how desired learning outcomes and market data can affect exhibit design, while emphasizing the importance of cooperation with universities for research. A brief examination of how museums approach contemporary issues is followed by a broader discussion on effective exhibit design; topics include accessibility, labels, visitor movement patterns, audio tours, interactive elements, and the use of reproductions. The benefits of cooperating with other museums when creating travelling exhibits are examined, and examples of travelling ancient world exhibits in Canadian museums, both large and small, are used to support the creation of a Roman frontier exhibit for Northwestern Ontario.</description>

   <description>In recent investigations of the child’s relationship with nature, collections such as Sidney I. Dobrin and Kenneth B. Kidd’s Wild Things: Children’s Culture and Ecocriticism (2004) and Amy Cutter-Mackenzie, Phillip G. Payne, and Alan Reid’s Experiencing Environment and Place through Children’s Literature (2011) emphasize the significance of critically recognizing the value and relevance of the child-nature connection in our understanding of diverse environments and places. However, much of this work has remained within non-Canadian literary frameworks, with ecocriticism exclusively, and/or limited to the field of children’s literature. This dissertation fills this gap in criticism through an examination of the child figure and his or her relationship to the natural environment through the lens of bioregionalism in contemporary Canadian coming-of-age fiction. In uniting the Canadian child, nature, and an ecological perspective together, I argue that bioregionalism is relevant to coming-of-age narratives and that four specific bioregional themes or points of view can emerge when such a lens is applied to regional bodies of literature across Canada: nostalgic sustainability (Atlantic Canada), conservation (Central Canada), sustainable dwelling (the Prairies), and the journey of reinhabitation (the West Coast). Each of these themes draw upon at least one of the three key terms that recur most frequently in bioregional discourse – dwelling, sustainability, and reinhabitation – and either appears in combination with coming-of-age motifs, makes use of a distinct characteristic found in a particular regional body of literature, or allows the narrative’s ending to direct how we need to think about the connection between bioregionalism and the child figure. The theme of childhood and youth in Canadian literature is a rich and diverse one; and our continued fascination with youthful experiences reflects that something important is at work, especially when the child’s growth to maturity is linked to our current concerns about the environment. My project investigates the works of Alistair MacLeod, Ernest Buckler, Monique Proulx, Mary Lawson, W.O. Mitchell, Thomas King, Eden Robinson, and Frances Greenslade.</description>

   <subject>Nineteenth-century</subject>
   <description>As British alienists and sociologists in nineteenth-century Britain sought to understand suicide as a disease of the mind, coroners, jurors and lay people became increasingly sympathetic to those who ended their own lives. This sympathy, however, was often tinged with spiritual, philosophical, and moral valuations of a suicide’s life. These judgements were especially pronounced when the suicide was a woman. Speculation on female suicides almost always involved questions of romantic entanglements, pregnancy or moral improprieties. After their deaths, their lives and motivations were interpreted by legal and medical professionals who (re)created their narratives to fit social and cultural expectations. The literary and visual images of the suicidal woman from this period are coded with conflicting messages of life and death, resistance and submission, and eroticization and redemption. The literature I have chosen to focus on, Amy Levy’s dramatic monologues “A Minor Poet,” and “Xantippe A Fragment,” George Eliot’s realist novel, The Mill on the Floss, and Bram Stoker’s Gothic novel Dracula, allow for a cross-genre exploration of the cultural encoding of female suicide in multiple literary genres. These texts feature ambiguous suicides, meaning that the deaths of these characters are not explicitly connected to suicide, and that critics have most often attributed these deaths to causes other than suicide. However, by ignoring the possibility of suicide encoded in these texts, critics have often overlooked the agency of these characters’ actions. The characters become victims of circumstances rather than active participants in the narratives of their death. To pay attention to these ambiguities allows us to reconsider or reclaim the tensions in these texts and see these characters as both victims of and active agents in the circumstances which lead to their deaths. They become liminal figures existing on the boundaries of multiple sites of categorization that collapse the binaries of the Victorian angel in the house and the fallen angel.</description>

   <description>Despite numerous physical and mental health benefits of physical activity, the majority of adult females fail to meet the recommended physical activity guidelines (Statistics Canada, 2015). As a result, women are less likely to achieve optimum levels of health. As childhood physical activity levels are predictive of physical activity in adulthood (Dennison, Straus, Mellits, &amp; Charney, 1988; Telama et al., 2005), it is imperative to understand how previous physical activity experiences continue to affect women. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore young adult females’ previous physical activity experiences, and how these experiences have influenced participants’ current attitudes and behaviours towards fitness. Data were collected from 12 female students between ages 17 and 24 from the Faculty of Education and the School of Kinesiology and Health Studies (SKHS) at Queen’s University, Canada. Participants were asked to complete a short questionnaire assessing basic demographic information and current and previous physical activity involvement. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted. The data were analyzed using a thematic approach. &#xd;
Four key themes emerged from the data: (1) Social Agents, (2) Expectations, (3) Values and Costs, and (4) Environmental Influences. All participants engaged in physical activity as children; however, those women who were less physically active at the time of the study experienced a decrease in fitness levels during adolescence. At this time, the three students who were less active (Semi-Active Students) began to notice individual differences in athletic ability. As their physical abilities were perceived as less developed than that of their peers, they started to feel self-conscious when performing in physical education classes. Parental support also decreased for the Semi-Active Students, as parents tended to prioritize academics. The Active Students (n=9) continued to be physically active and were primarily motivated by their intrinsic interest in sports. Positive feedback from teachers and coaches were also influential. Although certain aspects of these themes affected women in different ways, similar trends among the Semi-Active Students and the Active Students emerged from the data, demonstrating implications for future research and practice.</description>

   <title>Electronic Paper Computers: Interacting with Flexible Displays for Physical Manipulation of Digital Information</title>

   <description>Flexible displays are being widely adopted because of their thinness, lightweight and low power-consumption. Current research on flexible displays has focused on various ways of interacting with a single flexible display similar to that of using a mobile phone. The introduction of thin-film flexible displays has enabled us to represent data as a deck of thin and flexible cards or sheets of standard-sized paper. This is largely an unexplored area of research. This manifestation of digital data opens up newer forms of interaction techniques such as stacking, thumbing through, while supporting traditional tabletop interaction techniques such as collocation, shuffling and reordering documents on a desk.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we present multi-display paper computer prototypes that combine the physical properties of paper with the affordances of digital media. We use the physical affordances of flexible displays, i.e., their thinness, low mass, and flexibility, as design elements to create paper computer prototypes that support spatial, tactile, and asymmetric bimanual manipulation of digital information. With Snaplet, we explore how flexibility provides an interaction context for a wearable device that fits the body. With DisplayStacks, we take advantage of the thinness of displays to explore stacking as an interaction metaphor. With PaperTab, we combine these affordances with the low mass of displays to present a physical computing interface that enables 3D spatial organization of information, as well as parallel access to multiple data streams.&#xd;
&#xd;
We report on a qualitative study to show how PaperTab’s interaction techniques can be easy to learn, without inducing significant physical demands or mental demands. We report results from three Fitts’ law experiments to understand how device mass and rigidity affect interaction efficiency in spatial interactions. We formally define Paper Computers based on our experience developing the prototypes, and our qualitative and quantitative study data.</description>

   <title>The Peloponnesian Fleet: Disputing Thucydides' Land versus Sea Dichotomy</title>
   <creator>Francis, Brandon</creator>
   <subject>Peloponnesian Fleet</subject>
   <subject>Thucydides</subject>
   <description>The clash between Sparta’s Peloponnesian League and the Athenian Delian League is considered one of the most famous events in Classical history. Lasting over two decades, the Great Peloponnesian War engulfed the greater part of the Greek mainland and Aegean, and extended to Sicily and Italy to the West, and Persia to the East. In essence, to the Hellene of the ancient world, this was a Greek World War. One of the major themes which the Peloponnesian War continuously iterated, and one which is emphasized in Thucydides’ narrative, was the dichotomy between the two πόλεις. Thucydides insinuated that the war was based on a polemic juxtaposition of Sparta, the predominant land power, and Athens, the naval juggernaut. Thucydides ultimately used the land versus sea motif to explain how the two city-states intended to fight. However, by doing this, Thucydides heavily disregarded Sparta’s maritime capabilities and even downplayed the Peloponnesian fleet’s role in the war. This paper will argue that Thucydides misconstrued the reality of the war. I believe Sparta pursued naval hegemony during the war and there is evidence for a deliberate naval program.</description>

   <description>An extensive body of literature is dedicated towards understanding acne as either a dermatological or psychological problem. Surprisingly, scholars have yet to write critically or sociologically about a skin disease which affects an estimated 600 million people worldwide. As such, I bring together continental philosophies of the skin/body, science and technology studies, and sociological literature on health and illness to produce an embodied sociology of acne. I argue that pimpled skin becomes meaningful through dynamic interactions between science and culture, forming new epidermal identities and solidarities I term “dermosocialities.” I examine the ways dermosocialities are organized through acne, and begin to analyze some of the political, cultural and scientific consequences of dermosocial collectivization. Altogether, a sociology of acne highlights the need to think about the contemporary relationship between skin and self as medicalized, managed and experienced through an emerging class of skin experts, discourses, practices and objects.</description>

   <description>Location discovery (i.e., Localization) and sensing coverage services in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have received significant attention from the Internet of Things (IoT) research community. The usage of WSNs within IoT mandates taking into account IoT characteristics when considering sensing coverage. These characteristics include heterogeneity, large scale, dynamicity, and multiple ownership. Anchors are typically used to enable localization in IoT settings. Anchor misplacement or errors in anchor location readings can cause significant disruption to location-based services in IoT. This thesis investigates the anchor misplacement problem, provides an analytical study of both localization, and sensing coverage under the presence of anchor misplacement. &#xd;
We utilize two tools from computational geometry Voronoi Diagram (VD) and Delaunay Triangulation (DT) to partition the target region in order to make the problem solvable and easy to follow. We also borrow a graph-theoretic tool called Graph History to more closely understand the impact of anchor misplacement on sensing coverage. These tools allow us to locally study, analyze, and detect the impact of anchor misplacement in its vicinity. We analyze the problem of anchor misplacement, its impact on localization and sensing coverage, and we also identify new types of sensing coverage holes. We also present heuristics to mitigate the impact of anchor misplacement and improve the reliability and accuracy of WSN services. Our research approach and solution for the anchor misplacement problem can be utilized in a multiplicity of localization and sensing coverage applications regardless of the sensors or deployment types including IoT. Results show that our proposed algorithms are far more conducive to IoT context. They provide higher detection rates of misplaced anchors and sensing coverage holes, and more effective mitigation which result in higher enhancement of IoT services.</description>

   <description>The primary objective of this thesis is to design and engineer new platforms with the potential for creating new analytical techniques as well as improving established methods. The first portion of this thesis investigates the utilization of commercially available capillary- and microstructured fiber templates for the synthesis of functional polymeric materials with controllable chemical composition and morphology. This process has also been adapted to form materials in a planar fashion with similar morphology towards the development of robust superhydrophobic materials. In additional work, a laser micromachining system was employed to spatially control the wettability of commercially available superhydrophobic materials and the spontaneous deposition of sub-μL volumes was investigated. Laser spots as small as 100 μm facilitated the deposition of droplets 400 pL in volume. Theoretically, patch sizes as small as 15 μm can be fabricated, however, using the techniques presented there are significant limitations in the ability to quantify the volumes deposited on these patches.&#xd;
The remainder of this thesis looked to design, fabricate, characterize, and post-process novel microstructured fibers for mass spectrometry applications. In these works, the synergistic effects of spatially altering the chemical composition of the fiber and flow-protected wet-chemical etching were used to form microstructured nozzles at the fiber facet. These micronozzle arrays were further tested for their optical lensing and electrospray properties for various applications.</description>

   <title>Self-Assembly Through Coordination And Hydrogen-Bonding; Application To The Synthesis Of Metalloreceptors And To RNA Detection</title>

   <description>Self-assembly plays a crucial role in many natural and artificial systems. This manuscript illustrates the application of self-assembly principles to the design, synthesis and functions of molecular receptors and probes for biological targets.&#xd;
The objective of Chapter 2 was to synthesize macrocyclic metalloreceptors composed of two triazole-pyridine chelates connected via a xylyl spacer. In our design, the spacers provide interaction sites which define hydrophobic cavities for the binding of extrahelical nucleosides. To this end, three novel strand ligands with terminal hydroxyl, allyl, and amine groups were synthesized. Various metal ions were utilized to pre-organize the structure of the macrocycle through the self-assembly of 2:2 metal:ligand complexes. Following metal templation, macrocyclization would be achieved via Grubb’s metathesis, reductive amination or SN2 reaction. Coordination self-assembly studies with the hydroxyl- and allyl-ligands were hindered due to poor solubility. However, preliminary data analysis of the self-assembly of the more soluble amine-ligand with zinc(II) acetate2, as studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, suggests that the desired metal templated complex has been formed. &#xd;
In Chapter 3, two ligands using the bis(pyrazole)pyridine chelate as the central platform connecting two aromatic moieties were synthesized. Upon metal coordination, the conformation of the ligands switches to adopt a shape similar to that of molecular tweezers. To explore the self-assembly of a novel molecular tweezer with two metal-binding sites, a third ligand was synthesized. This ligand is comprised of the tridentate (bis(pyrazole)pyridine) unit connected to two terminal bidentate (triazole-pyridine) chelating units via xylyl spacers. In the presence of coordinating anions, the self-assembly outcome of this ligand with proper metal ions would provide a  metalloreceptor wherein the substrate binding event is controlled by the coordination chemistry of the terminal chelates. &#xd;
In Chapter 4, a technique known as RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH) was used to visualize ribonucleic acids (RNA) in cells. In this method, the detection of RNA relies on the self-assembly of RNA with partially complementary oligonucleotide probes through weak non-covalent interactions. A number of such fluorescein and biotin labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes were therefore synthesized and utilized for the selective detection of particular RNA molecules in archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.</description>

   <description>I argue that the origins of disaster fiction as a literary genre are located in the Long Nineteenth Century. Disaster fiction is a genre as-yet undefined by literary criticism, and my project fills this lacuna by identifying the forms and tropes that constitute the genre. Focusing specifically on natural disasters varying in scope and severity from the local to the global, I relate eco-catastrophic fiction back to the contemporary scientific and sociological condition of nineteenth-century Britain. The discourse of natural catastrophe manifests from increasing ecological awareness and existential anxieties, particularly the confrontation with Deep Time and Deep Space, and the sense of vulnerability that comes from the knowledge of the insignificance of humanity in a vast, ancient, and uncaring universe. Throughout the Long Nineteenth Century, disaster fiction differentiates itself from apocalyptic fiction through a gradual process of secularization wherein the natural sciences rather than theology provide the impetus for catastrophe. The Romantic period lays the foundations of the genre by projecting the potential for destruction found in apocalyptic literature into a divinely ordered environment, where human activity (like pollution) becomes a transgression that merits retribution from catastrophic Nature. Romantic “Last Man” narratives personify Nature as an antagonist and establish the key tropes and images that come to define the genre. While disaster fiction disappears from the marketplace during the mid-Victorian period, surviving in other media, the late Victorian and Edwardian periods see a flourishing of the genre, in part thanks to an ideal niche in the illustrated Victorian periodicals. Disaster fiction becomes popular in part due to the high-profile eruption of Krakatau in 1883, and from a growing awareness of the potentially catastrophic human impact on the environment. Through dramatic destruction (including the ruination of landmarks), disaster fiction highlights the vulnerability of London’s urban infrastructure, making these stories into precautionary narratives. Indeed, disaster fiction becomes a vehicle for writers to advocate the particular social, political, or religious reforms the author sees as necessary to stave off disaster, and the most catastrophic of disasters also provides a moment of radical change that permits the construction of utopia.</description>

   <description>Taking its title from Hamlet’s paradoxical definition of man as “the paragon of animals,” my study examines how pre-Cartesian conceptions of humans as animals assume lines of similitude and difference across species that expose the instability and implications of man’s exalted place among the beasts. In my first chapter I examine the horse as a figure of nobility and governance, and analyze how Philip Sidney’s actual experience atop a horse informs his conception of rhetorical governance as equestrian art in the Defence of Poesy. I illustrate how Sidney refines his equestrian analogy to justify the exclusivity of poetic production, and I analyze how the poet-horseman’s persuasion of the reader-horse presents an elite model of affective communication and instruction that offers insights into the persuasive experience of human and nonhuman subjects alike. The second chapter examines the lion in Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene to consider how the comparison of Una’s lion with Redcrosse, whom Una calls “my Lyon, and my noble Lord” (I.iii.7.6), leads to a continued reassessment of human instinct and masculine aggression by way of the beast’s tempered rage and noble kindness. By tracing the lion’s more aggressive attributes through a series of leonine figures, I show how Spenser’s zoomorphism of human figures reflects his anxiety surrounding masculine aggression, human animality, and material embodiment. The third chapter then turns to the polysemy of “kind” in William Shakespeare’s King Lear to assess how Lear’s use of animal imagery and concern for kind-ness contributes to an increasingly blurred distinction of kind/unkind as well as human/nonhuman. This chapter also examines the play’s domesticated canine figures and considers how Lear’s vision of human animality and vulnerable physicality generates new avenues of kind-ness among fellow sufferers and questions how one may recognize and extend kindness beyond species and social boundaries.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research is to compare the Assembly of First Nations and a northern Ontario First Nation’s definition of Culture Based Education (CBE). The study also explores how the integration of CBE takes place in the local First Nation school system. It incorporates an Indigenous Knowledge framework using qualitative data based on community interviews with Elders, a parent-teacher group and teachers from a local First Nation school. This research is of benefit to both First Nations in the areas of school curriculum planning and to academics seeking to understand CBE and its application in First Nation schools.</description>

   <subject>coronary artery bypass grafting</subject>
   <subject>invasive monitoring</subject>
   <description>Problem:  There is controversy in the literature as to the extent and type of invasive monitoring that is appropriate for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).  The use of pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) has been associated with increased postoperative mortality compared to central venous pressure monitoring (CVP), and the association between transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and mortality has not been examined.  There is limited Canadian data examining these relationships.&#xd;
Methods:  A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using administrative database holdings at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences to identify patients undergoing CABG over a ten-year period (October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2011) and describe their comorbidities and exposure to invasive monitoring on the day of surgery.  Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of monitor use and to examine the association between monitoring type on the day of surgery and 30-day mortality.&#xd;
Results:  There were 52,202 patients in the cohort.  PAC use was the most common (67.2%), followed by PAC and TEE combined (26.5%), CVP alone (3.7%) and TEE alone (2.6%).  Patient comorbidities and institution were important predictors of monitor use in any given patient.  Over the study period, 638 patients died within 30 days of CABG (1.22%).  Overall, no monitor was statistically associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality compared to CVP.  In subgroup analysis, exposure to PAC/TEE was associated with increased mortality compared to PAC alone (OR 1.48, 95% CI [1.22, 1.80].  &#xd;
Conclusion:  Clinicians did not respond to the existing PAC literature by decreasing this monitor’s use.  Despite this, there was no harmful association found in patients exposed to PAC compared to CVP.  Since the addition of TEE to PAC was associated with increased mortality in this cohort, it is recommended that clinicians and institutions critically evaluate the routine need for this monitor in patients undergoing CABG.</description>

   <subject>Population-Based Study</subject>
   <subject>Overall Survival</subject>
   <description>Background: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a lethal malignancy. Surgery remains the only option for cure. Our study aimed to evaluate practice patterns in patients with stage T2 and T3 GBC and describe the association between the extent of surgical resection and overall survival. &#xd;
Methods: This was a population-based cohort study from 2002-2012 including all cases of GBC in Ontario identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR). Those who underwent surgical resection were identified using linked administrative datasets and their pathology reports were abstracted to identify T2 and T3 GBCs. Type of surgical resection was classified as ‘extended’ (cholecystectomy + liver resection and/or bile duct resection) or ‘simple’ (cholecystectomy only). The association between type of surgical resection and OS was explored using Cox proportional hazards regression models.&#xd;
Results: 232 cases of T2 and 138 cases of T3 GBC were identified with 24% (56/232) of T2 cases and 37% (51/138) of T3 cases receiving extended resection. Unadjusted overall 5-year survival for simple vs extended resection was 39.7% vs 49.5% for T2 GBC (p =0.03) and 13.5% vs 22.8% for T3 GBC respectively (p=0.05). In T2 adjusted analysis, extended resection was associated with improved overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 -0.97, P = 0.01), while poor differentiation (HR = 3.42; 95% CI 1.92 -6.08, P = 0.0001), presence of lymphovascular invasion (HR = 1.75; 95% CI 1.16 -2.64, P = 0.03), and positive lymph nodes (HR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.03 -3.08, P = 0.03) was associated with worse OS. In T3 adjusted analysisc, only female sex (HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.43-1.00, P = 0.05) was a predictor of improved OS, while older age (HR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.04, P = 0.0005) was associated with worse OS. On stratified analysis, extended resection demonstrated a trend towards improved survival in node negative cases only (HR=0.20; CI 0.03-1.06, P=0.07). 				                 &#xd;
Conclusions: The use of extended resection for T2 and T3 GBC in Ontario is modest. Extended resection is associated with improved OS in all T2 disease and node negative T3 disease.</description>

   <title>Bayesian Detection of a Change in a Random Sequence with Unknown Initial and Final Distributions</title>

   <description>Quickest detection is a class of detection problems whereby the objective is to identify a change in distribution of an observed sequence of random variables as quickly as possible. Quickest detection has been applied to a wide range of applications, such as process monitoring, quality control, and disaster detection. In each of these applications, the initial state of the observed sequence is generally known. Considering these applications, there is an abundance of literature considering formulations of the quickest detection problem where the initial state of the sequence is assumed to be known. However, in some applications, the assumption of knowledge of the initial state of the observed sequence is not valid in general. Recently, spectrum sensing, the process of identifying wireless channel characteristics for the application of cognitive radio, has been cast as a quickest detection problem. Upon, first observation, the radio performing spectrum sensing would not know the initial state of the channel, rendering previous formulations of the quickest detection problem unusable here.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, an alternative formulation of the quickest detection problem is considered where the initial state of the observed sequence is assumed to be unknown. The problem is formulated as an optimal stopping problem, and a quickest detection scheme is developed based on Bayesian hypothesis testing and an assumed set of costs. The proposed sequential change detector tracks the minimum-risk hypotheses using a time-recursive algorithm which achieves constant computational complexity. It is shown analytically and via simulations that (i) the probability of detecting a change from an incorrect initial distribution asymptotically vanishes over time under suitable parameter choices, (ii) cost parameter choices trade off the probability of early detection of a change (false alarm) against the average delay to detection of a change, and (iii) cost parameter choices determine the certainty with which the initial distribution of the sequence is identified, trading off the probability of detecting a change from an incorrect initial distribution with the ability to detect early changes.</description>

   <description>While much scholarly attention has focused on Southwestern Louisiana’s white Cajun communities, comparatively few academics have explored the traditions of the Creoles, a mixed-race Francophone group whose members often identify as black. Cajuns and the Creoles have much in common—shared geographic place and a deeply linked history, with much overlap in food and musical traditions—yet prejudice causes cleavages between the two groups, and a lack of attention to Creole lifeways has caused resentment. Discrepancies in the value afforded to Cajun and Creole traditions have risen to the fore in recent debates about limiting or banning Creole cultural activities, primarily recreational horseback riding or “trail-riding,” from certain municipalities. Vociferous public conversations play out in tandem with Creoles continuing to vie for recognition of their heritage and culture on a state, national, and international level on par with that of the Cajuns, whose history and image generate extensive attention and tourist dollars. Black/Creole residents note that their music and foodways have been repackaged as Cajun or subsumed under the Cajun label and that they are unable to take advantage of the benefits that Creole-oriented tourism could bring to a region in which half of the counties are designated "black high poverty parishes."&#xd;
&#xd;
Drawing primarily on the bodies of geographical scholarship on racialization, memorial arenas, public space, and mobility, this thesis brings empirical analysis and social theory to bear on the complex socio-political landscape of Southwestern Louisiana. I use ethnographic methods—structured interviews and participant observation—and archival analysis to explore how identity-affirming activities, such as trail-riding and rural culture broadly constituted, create a space of belonging for Creole-identified community members as well as uphold a link to the ancestral lifeways that structure and support their present-day lives. Despite a lack of mainstream recognition and commemorative silences within the region’s memorial arena that perpetuate a hegemonic social order, Creoles continue to embody their rural French roots, their Western heritage, and their black identity, often simultaneously, demonstrating both their exceptionality and belonging in contemporary Southwestern Louisiana society.</description>

   <description>In nearly all countries of the world, at every level of education, physics as a field of science is failing to recruit and retain women. This phenomenon is believed to relate to girls’ educational experiences from K-12, but the reasons for the gender gap in physics are not fully understood. The purpose of this phenomenological research is to explore and understand the barriers encountered by Ontario female high school students during their physics education and the meanings attributed to those barriers by these young women. &#xd;
This research is guided by social cognitive career theory (SCCT) and uses the concept of physics identity as a lens through which the influence of contextual barriers can be understood. Nine participants, selected via snowball sampling from an Eastern Ontario university, together participated in four semi-structured focus group meetings and individually participated in a single in-depth, one-on-one interview. Audio data was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a general inductive approach. &#xd;
Emergent themes are descriptively presented as the findings of the research study: perceiving the high school physics experience, experiencing high school physics education, and identity and gender in the high school physics experience. Sub-themes presented include limited prior experiences, negative perceptions of physics, images of physics learners, decision-making, reactions to pedagogy, learning needs, physics identity, gender-dependent influences, and making meaning of the experiences in high school physics. The shared experience of high school physics education for young women is understood as both a richly challenging and rewarding experience.&#xd;
Based on the findings of this research, recommendations are made for practical and research settings, and for future work in this area. Drawing on literature on underrepresentation of women in physics, this research contributes to the physics education research community and beyond; it offers voices of Ontario female high school students, and an understanding of the barriers and the meanings associated with their experiences in high school physics.</description>

   <description>This qualitative multiple case study explores the educational experiences of students with mild to moderate hearing loss (MMHL) through in-depth interviewing towards a goal of developing a conceptual framework for understanding their inclusion. Students with MMHL, who have a disability not readily apparent or visible to others, account for an estimated 15% to 23% of the student population (Niskar et al., 2001; Science.gc.ca, 2016). These students negotiate compromised speech comprehension in adverse listening environments, inconsistent use of supportive communication strategies by teachers and peers, and social-emotional implications of negative perceptions of disability and difference (Bradley &amp; Sato, 2004; Dalton, 2010; Leigh, 2010). Yet, few if any interventions or communication supports are provided to these students by classroom teachers. The first purpose of this research was to reveal the educational experiences of four students with MMHL from their own perspectives. The second purpose was to explore the personal and communication strengths of these students, as they negotiate learning and inclusion with MMHL in a hearing world. To enhance educators’ understanding of the nuances and implications of managing MMHL and inclusion, the third purpose of this study was to assess the potential of the Shared Burdens of Communication (SBC) conceptual framework, developed for this dissertation. With individual case analysis, the framework was found to be robust and effective in enhancing understanding of a broad range of nuanced considerations and implications of managing MMHL in educational contexts. Emerging data themes were identified as understanding speech, disclosing learning challenges, individual school experiences, disability, social identity, self-identity, and disclosing disability. In cross-case analysis, the SBC framework’s structure was determined to be overly complex as a tool for practitioners to effectively achieve clarity about the complex individual experiences of MMHL. Framework reorganization as a tripartite structure suggests that educators and researchers can readily ascertain and implement inclusive management of MMHL when considering characteristics of (a) curriculum access, learning, and behavioural implications, (b) social stigma and its implications, and (c) balanced and reciprocal support. Discussion includes a framework critique, an insiders’ perspective, and recommendations for practitioners and researchers.</description>

   <description>This dissertation explored the health needs of children with IDD in Accra, Ghana, experiences of caregivers in accessing healthcare for the children and views of caregivers on how to improve healthcare for the children. The aim was to provide policymakers and administrators with direction for critical decision-making and policy reforms to improve healthcare for children with IDD towards Ghana’s policy commitment on the international front to provide equitable healthcare for all. This research was grounded in interpretive description, a form of qualitative inquiry. Semi-structured caregiver interviews were the primary means of data collection. The interview protocol was guided by the Andersen Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization and the protocol explored the health needs of children with IDD, experiences of caregivers in accessing healthcare for the children and views of caregivers on how to improve healthcare for children. Twenty-five caregivers of children with IDD between ages three and eighteen years in Accra, Ghana, participated in this study. Constant comparison, an analytic method originally from grounded theory but also used in interpretative description, was used for data analysis. The findings revealed that children with IDD in Accra were affected by several health conditions, including sensory disorders, respiratory disorders, cardiovascular disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. Further, the children and their caregivers encountered both facilitators and complex structural and psychosocial barriers in accessing healthcare. The facilitators and barriers included financial means, social connections, access to transportation, and attitudes of healthcare providers and the general public toward children with IDD. The findings imply that although children with IDD in Ghana might be affected by several health conditions, they confront complex structural and psychosocial barriers in accessing healthcare to undermine Ghana’s commitment on the international front to provide equitable access to healthcare for all.</description>

   <title>An Empirical Analysis of GNU Make in Open Source Projects</title>

   <description>Build systems, the tools responsible for compiling, testing, and packaging software systems, play a vital role in the software development process. Make is one of the oldest build technologies and is still widely used today, whether by manually writing Makefiles, or by generating them using tools like Autotools and CMake. Despite its conceptual simplicity, modern Make implementations such as GNU Make have become very complex languages, featuring functions, macros, lazy variable assignments and more. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis is an exploration of Make-based open source build systems in two parts. First, our feature analysis looks at the popularity of features and the difference between hand-written Makefiles and those generated using various tools. We find that generated Makefiles use only a core set of features and that more advanced features (such as function calls) are used very little, and almost exclusively in hand-written Makefiles. Second, our complexity analysis introduces indirection complexity -- a simple metric for measuring maintenance complexity in Makefiles using the same feature data compiled in the first analysis. We show how this new metric can provide a better way to measure which Makefiles will require more cognitive overhead to understand than traditional metrics. &#xd;
&#xd;
Both analyses utilize our framework, built with the TXL source transformation language, to obtain a detailed parse of Makefiles in our corpus. This corpus consists of almost 20,000 Makefiles, comprised of over 8.4 million lines, from 271 different open source projects. &#xd;
&#xd;
Through these analyses, we aim to gain a better understanding of how the Make language is used in the open source community (some of the most advanced users of Make).</description>

   <title>Scientific Examination of the Painting Entitled While Baby Sleeps</title>

   <description>Scientific examination of the painting entitled While Baby Sleeps was undertaken&#xd;
due to concerns raised during a conservation treatment in 1986 regarding its attribution to&#xd;
Canadian painter Paul Peel. At this time, doubts were cast regarding the signature in the&#xd;
lower left corner, “PAUL PEEL/PARIS -1888,” since it was soluble in the solvent mixture&#xd;
used to remove the varnish layer, suggesting it had been placed on top of the varnish.&#xd;
Furthermore, paint texture with no relation to the present image was detected, as well as&#xd;
evidence that the lower right hand corner of the painting had been scraped down.&#xd;
&#xd;
For this thesis, cross-sections were excised from the P and U in PAUL. The cross-section&#xd;
from the letter P showed a more complex layered structure than that obtained from&#xd;
the U. Additionally, the U cross-section showed clear evidence that it had been reinforced&#xd;
in the past, since the final paint layer appeared over the varnish layer.&#xd;
&#xd;
Non-contact analytical techniques such as x-ray radiography, UV-induced&#xd;
fluorescence, and infrared reflectography indicated the presence of a previous composition.&#xd;
Micro-destructive samples were obtained in the form of cross-sections and paint&#xd;
microsamples and were used to evaluate whether any paints contain elements indicative of&#xd;
materials not available during Peel’s lifetime. None of the samples tested by SEM-EDS&#xd;
revealed any such incongruencies. The findings do not shed definitive light on the&#xd;
attribution debate surrounding While Baby Sleeps. Therefore, Peel cannot be excluded as&#xd;
the artist of this work, nor can his authorship be proved beyond the shadow of a doubt.&#xd;
The subject matter depicted in While Baby Sleeps is in keeping with Peel’s style, however&#xd;
very little information regarding its provenance before arriving at the Agnes Etherington&#xd;
Art Centre (AEAC) is known.</description>

   <description>Haptic simulation systems allow kinesthetic interaction between users and virtual environments. These environments are represented using mathematical models which simulate the contact dynamics of real objects. However, the discrete and quantized nature of conventional haptic systems limits the mechanical impedance of the virtual environment and thus degrades the realism of the simulation. Digital haptic systems are particularly limited in their ability to render highly damped environments. Analog control is proposed as an alternative for implementing high impedance virtual environments, and a study of analog haptic stability is presented. A mixed analog-digital is also proposed which uses nonlinear analog feedback and real-time parameter update algorithms to render complex and multilayer analog environments. &#xd;
&#xd;
The accuracy of environment models is critical for realistic haptic simulations. Soft environments with limited deformation have been shown to be more accurately described using the nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model than linear models. The thesis also proposed a novel real-time Hunt-Crossley identification algorithm based on a polynomial approximation. Experimental results point at superior accuracy and convergence rate as compared to existing Hunt-Crossley estimation algorithms. The proposed identification method can also be used to facilitate robotic contact tasks.</description>

   <title>Amphiphilic Diblock Copolymers as Stabilizers in Emulsion Polymerization</title>

   <description>Emulsion polymerizations, used to produce many commodity materials, require stabilizing agents to prevent phase separation. Incorporation of these stabilizers in the final polymer may have negative effects on product properties, so the design of new stabilizers is worthwhile. Amphiphilic diblock copolymers are a promising type of emulsion polymerization stabilizer and are the focus of this work. First, the tolerance of an amphiphilic diblock copolymer stabilizer’s performance to high molecular weight dispersity and homopolymer impurity has been investigated. Polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) block copolymers were studied due to their previously demonstrated efficacy as stabilizers in emulsion polymerization, and their similarity to commercially important polystyrene-r-poly(acrylic acid) stabilizers. Neither greater molecular weight dispersity nor homopolymer impurity was found to negatively impact the stabilization performance of these block copolymers, suggesting that the economically unfavorable conditions required to achieve low molecular weight dispersity and homopolymer impurity may be avoided. In addition to improving the economic outlook of amphiphilic block copolymer stabilizers, this work has also improved their technical feasibility. Novel polystyrene-b-[polystyrene-r-poly(acrylic acid)] block-random copolymers have been introduced which stabilize emulsion polymerizations with up to 50 weight percent solids content, exceeding what was possible using polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) block copolymers. The block-random copolymers were also observed to have unusual solution behavior, self-folding rather than self-assembling. Emulsion polymerizations stabilized by these block-random copolymers had a total particle surface area which was directly proportional to the stabilizer concentration and was unaffected by polymerization kinetics. A novel “seeded-coagulative” emulsion polymerization mechanism has been proposed to explain these results, which were unexplainable by any known emulsion polymerization mechanism.</description>

   <description>Background: Perceived stigma is a public health concern that causes harm by discouraging help-seeking behaviour and treatment participation amongst individuals with mental illnesses. Some individuals, however, resist stigmatization by either ignoring or confronting public stigma. Psychological well-being, a modifiable personal factor, might empower stigma resistance. This is the first study to examine psychological well-being and its relationship to perceived stigma and help-seeking behaviour.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The first objective was to examine the association between psychological well-being and perceived stigma due to mental illness amongst Canadians who received treatment for a mental health problem in the year prior to the survey. The second objective was to examine the association between psychological well-being and help-seeking behaviour for mental health care amongst Canadians who experienced at least one select mental or substance use disorder in the year prior to the survey.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Data were derived from the first nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of mental health stigma experiences in Canada (N = 25 113). Stata 14 was used to conduct complex survey data analyses, all of which incorporated the recommended sampling weights and bootstrap variance estimation procedures. Logistic regression and modified Poisson regression were used to examine the associations between psychological well-being scores and the outcomes of interest. Considered covariates included: age, disorder type, sex, education, income, and population density.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Higher psychological well-being scores reduced the odds of reporting mental health experiences of stigma (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.99). Higher psychological well-being scores decreased the likelihood of help-seeking behaviour amongst respondents who met the criteria for at least one selected mental disorder (RR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.984). The observed associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for the effects of all relevant covariates. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: Higher levels of psychological well-being might facilitate stigma resistance amongst individuals suffering from mental or substance use disorders. However, longitudinal studies using context-specific measures of stigma experiences and expectations are needed to: (a) untangle the directionality of the observed correlations, (b) determine whether psychological well-being facilitates stigma resistance in the mental health care context, and (c) clarify the association between psychological well-being and help-seeking behaviour.</description>

   <description>The geomembrane (GMB) properties and those of the welds connecting the GMB sheets are key factors affecting long-term liner performance. Thus, a series of accelerated immersion tests are used to examine the effect of landfill leachate and brine on HDPE geomembrane (GMB) sheet and seams. The effect of ageing in these solutions was investigated at: (a) the GMB sheet well away from the weld (SAW); (b) the heat affected zone beside the weld (HAZ); and, (c) the welded zone (Weld). The initial, post-welding, Std-OITo and HP-OITo were greatest for the GMB away from the weld, and least for the GMB in the weld. A comparison of the degradation of sheet material in tension with the weld in shear, peel, or tension showed faster degradation of the weld than the sheet material immersed in brine and leachate. No physical degradation of the welds occurred until after the Std-OIT was depleted when immersed in MSW leachate, whereas in brine the shear and peel strength and elongation started to decrease before Std-OIT and HP-OIT had depleted to a residual value. No failure was observed in the welded seams themselves. Rather, failure was observed at HAZ adjacent to the weld in peel, shear, and tensile tests. The time to nominal failure (i.e., 50% of the initial value) for a seam was about 67% and 45% in brine and leachate, respectively, of that for the sheet aged under the same conditions based on both tensile strength and elongation; thus, the welds are likely to dominate the service-life of the GMB. &#xd;
Brine is shown to have a greater effect on the physical properties than landfill leachate based on all common indicators (i.e., shear break strength, shear break elongation, and peel break strength), resulting in shorter time to nominal failure, tNF, in brine (despite a high percentage of antioxidants remaining in the GMB at tNF).</description>

   <description>Current research regarding the stigmatization of mental illnesses focuses mainly on quantitative data. There is insufficient data regarding the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of people with mood disorders. This thesis aims to understand the extent of stigmatization that people with mood disorders have experienced. A total of 212 participants with depression and bipolar disorder took part in this study. The Inventory of Stigmatizing Experiences (ISE), a 36-item questionnaire evaluated experiences with stigma. 16 open-ended questions emerged with responses suitable for coding. Responses were deconstructed sentence by sentence to identify themes. A total of 18 themes and 17 sub-themes emerged. When asked to elaborate on their experiences, responses rates were minimal, between 10-30%. Question 18 asked for an example of ‘stigma that had occurred in the past year’ and response rates averaged 40%, the most common theme was ‘stigmatizing experiences.’ This indicates that the stigma of mental illness is still prevalent. Question 27 asked ‘how do you cope with stigma,’ and response rates hovered around 55%. Coping techniques tended to be positive with themes such as ‘education,’ ‘humour,’ and ‘exercise.’ The data was re-arranged by gender, age, diagnosis, age of first symptoms and education to search for similarities and differences. When comparing genders, Question 18 resulted in women discussing the theme of positive experiences 19% compared to 31% of men. Non-parametric T-tests searched for statistically significant differences between groups. Significance was met in question 18, under the theme ‘positive experiences’ (p = .044) and ‘stigmatizing experiences’ (p = .001). In Question 22 when the data was rearranged by education, university learners reported the most stigmatization (51%), compared to college (38%), and high school (45%). When asked in Question 35, ‘what causes stigma,’ response rates averaged 70%. The theme of ‘ignorance’ was most common. &#xd;
This data could be useful to further anti-stigma campaigns by reminding people that mental illness affects diverse types of people. This study indicates that mental illness stigma is still a barrier that needs to be over come. By lowering the stigma associated with mental illness, we could expect higher treatment adherence and remission rates.</description>

   <description>Stressful experiences during youth can lead to a maladaptive behaviour profile in adulthood, including an increase in anxiety and aggression-related behaviours in humans. Rats exposed to the intermittent physical stress (IPS) paradigm in early-adolescence (PD 22 – 34) have lasting increases in anxiety-related behaviour. Greater anxiety-related behaviours have been shown to be associated with greater aggression-related behaviours. Therefore, I hypothesized that stress during early-adolescence would also lead to increases in aggression. In addition, greater anxiety and aggression have been associated with altered serotonergic function in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus. However, it is unclear whether a similar mechanism accounts for the enduring impact of stress during adolescence on those responses. In this experiment, I examined if IPS during early-adolescence increased anxiety-related behaviour in the elevated plus-maze and shock-probe burying test, as well as increased aggressive behaviour in the resident intruder test. In addition, I determined if there were changes in serotonin fibre density in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus. Male Long Evans rats (N = 24) were randomly assigned to either the early-adolescent stress or no-stress control groups. Rats were exposed to IPS stress (involving foot-shock, water immersion and elevated platform exposure) during early-adolescence and tested in the elevated plus-maze, shock-probe burying test and resident intruder test in adulthood. At the end of behavioural testing, brain tissue was examined for serotonin fibre density in the regions of interest using immunohistochemistry. Animals exposed to early-adolescent stress did not display greater levels of anxiety; however, they did display lower levels of aggression and an increase in serotonin fibre density in the prefrontal cortex. These results support that early-adolescence is a period of vulnerability of emotional development and raise the possibility that the impact of stress in adolescence on aggression in later life depends on when the stressors were experienced.</description>

   <description>Suicide is a severe societal problem with nearly 1 million people dying by suicide each year worldwide (National Institute of Mental Health, 2009). The goal of the current research was to explore potential risk factors in order to help improve researchers’ and mental health professionals’ ability to identify high-risk individuals who are more likely to conceal their feelings and thoughts from others. The present research examined the relationship of two personality traits, self-concealment and perfectionistic self- presentation, to two suicide related concepts, psychache and suicide ideation, as well as the role of social support within this context. Results of Study 1 indicated that individuals higher on self-concealment and individuals higher on perfectionistic self-presentation were more likely to report psychache as well as concealment of psychache from others. The goal of Study 2 was to replicate and extend the finding that the two traits are significant predictors of suicide ideation, as well as to examine two potential mediators, concealment of psychache and social support, to explain this relationship. Both traits were significant predictors of suicide ideation and concealment of psychache mediated the relationship of suicide ideation with self-concealment and two subcomponents of the Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale. Social support mediated the relationship between one of the subcomponents of the Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale and suicide ideation. The goal of Study 3 was to further examine the two personality traits, social support, and concealment of psychache, using an experimental design. More specifically, participants were instructed to either describe situations in which they had social support or describe situations in which they had no social support. Results indicated significant differences between participants assigned to the high compared to the low social support conditions in perceived social support, self-concealment, and each of the subscales of the Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale. A series of moderated regressions indicated that at low and moderate, but not high, levels of the perfectionistic self-promotion and nondisclosure of imperfection subscales of the Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale, higher levels of social support were associated with lower levels of concealment of psychache. The implications of the current research and possible recommendations are discussed.</description>

   <title>Efficacy of using robotics to characterize impaired upper-limb function in a non-human primate model of stroke</title>

   <description>Rationale: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and has the largest socioeconomic burden of any disease in Canada. Unfortunately, thousands of stroke therapies that proved successful in animal preclinical trials failed in subsequent human populations. Non-human primates (NHPs) closely resemble humans and may represent an animal model that could help bridge the translational gap preceding clinical trials. Additionally, robotic technology has been proven to provide objective determination of outcomes in human stroke populations and it is possible that these outcomes are conserved across species. This study investigated the efficacy of using robotic tasks as a behavioural assessment tool in a NHP model of stroke. &#xd;
Methods: Stroke was induced in 2 cynomolgus macaques through transient 90-minute right middle cerebral artery occlusion. At 2.5 years post-stroke, neurobehavioural outcomes were assessed using a visually guided reaching (VGR) and a postural perturbation (PP) KINARM exoskeleton robotic task. Stroke NHP task parameters were compared to control performance (2 healthy, age matched controls) for both the affected and unaffected-arms to determine impairment. &#xd;
Results: In the VGR task, stroke animals made reaches with their affected-arm that were less accurate, had more corrective motions, travelled a greater distance, and took longer as compared to controls (p&lt;0.01). In the PP task, responses of stroke animals to perturbations to the affected-arm were further displaced, took longer to stop, had more corrective motions, and took longer to return to centre as compared to controls (p&lt;0.01). Several, specific unaffected-arm deficits were also identified for both stroke NHPs. &#xd;
Conclusions: The KINARM tasks were able to consistently quantify specific sensorimotor deficits in stroke NHPs in a way similar to that previously achieved in human populations. This study proves the efficacy of robotic assessment in a NHP model of stroke and supports the feasibility of this model in translating future stroke therapies from preclinical to clinical trials.</description>

   <description>Peroxide vulcanization of polypropylene (PP) based thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) is hindered by PP’s susceptibility to radical degradation. PP degradation occurs through chain scission of tertiary alkyl macroradicals, reducing molecular weight, and negatively effecting TPV blend morphology. Nitroxyl chemistry using acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (AOTEMPO) was exploited to control the dynamics and rheological outcomes of peroxide polyolefin modifications. PP melt viscosity was partially retained by introducing a competition between macromonomer oligomerization and β-scission. Further improvements were observed when synergizing the polymer-bound acrylate functionality of AOTEMPO, with trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) a multifunctional coagent. Resulting TPVs contained smaller, more dispersed crosslinked elastomer particles when compared to peroxide-only formulations, owing to the retention of PP molecular weight. &#xd;
&#xd;
A follow up investigation into the effects of AOTEMPO on TPV physical property performance was completed for low elastomer content blends (0-20wt%). AOTEMPO formulations provided improved particle dispersion compared to peroxide only formulations, owing to the retention of melt viscosity. These improved particle dispersions led to better impact performance for AOTEMPO formulations over peroxide only formulations. Additionally, AOTEMPO formulations provided improved tensile properties compared to peroxide only formulations, owing to the branched architecture formed during polyolefin modification.</description>

   <title>Origin of Visean (Mississippian) Frobisher Group Coated Grainstone Shoals in the Williston Basin: Deposition and Diagenesis</title>

   <description>The Frobisher Beds of southeastern Saskatchewan are part of an extensive conventional oil and gas play hosted in grainy carbonate rocks, long interpreted as marine oolites. This sedimentological and diagenetic study of core from the Frobisher in the Bryant and Pinto areas of southeastern Saskatchewan concludes that the ubiquitous coated grains in these rocks are in fact predominantly pedogenically modified rather than purely marine in origin. Areally, Frobisher grainstones form elongate finger-like carbonate sand bodies, persistently supratidal, separated by interpreted marine channel deposits. These shoals consist of numerous stacked shallowing-upward, cyclical deposits composed of peloids, coated grains and compound grains. Unmodified true marine ooids are a minor component. Units within paleochannels consist of allochems of open marine origin and lack the cyclicity seen in shoal units. The Frobisher succession consists of six facies: 1) Fenestral Peloid Packstone, 2) Peloid Coated Grain Grainstone, 3) Coated Grain Grainstone-Rudstone, 4) Multiple Crust Complex, 5) Argillaceous Mudstone/Wackestone, and 6) Skeletal Packstone-Grainstone/Rudstone with variable oolite. Facies 1 to 5 are found within shoal units, whereas Facies 6 occurs only in the channel deposits. Grains within Facies 2 and 3 display shrinkage cracks, inverse grading and irregular coatings, features which are common indicators of pedogenesis in a vadose environment. Mudstones of Facies 5 and complex crust horizons in Facies 4 suggest that the shoal was subject to early diagenetic alteration in an arid subaerial environment. In contrast, Facies 6 contains broken and abraded open marine allochems (bryozoans, crinoids, coral fragments and foraminifera) interpreted to have been deposited and transported in marine channels. Coated grain lithoclasts within the channel deposits suggest active erosion of the finger-like shoals, whereas well ordered ooids-pisoids on the shoals may have originated in the marine channels. These observations demonstrate that there is an alternative interpretation to the published subtidal ooid sand shoal model. In this revised interpretation each shoal cycle shallows up from a thin marine or restricted peritidal facies at the base to grainstones and rudstones of coated grains and complex carbonate crusts, interpreted as a paleo calcrete. Such pedogenic alteration is characteristic of an arid climate and occurred during base level falls which exposed the shoals, and occasionally the intervening channels.</description>

   <description>Radical solution polymerization is a common method to produce a variety of plastics and coatings. Particularly in the automotive industry, large scale semi-batch operations are used to (co)polymerize monomers of the styrenic, acrylate and methacrylate families. To reduce solvent content, traditional non-functional feedstocks have been replaced or augmented with functional monomers like 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) or 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) to produce reactive polymer chains of lowered molar mass. The introduction of such polar and functional reactants affects the radical copolymerization kinetics and introduces solvent dependencies. The goal of this thesis is to identify and characterize these kinetic effects. Using specific kinetic parameters, a comprehensive model will be developed to describe copolymerizations under industrially relevant conditions, while also determining experimental limitations of comonomer incorporation.&#xd;
Due to the limited availability of reliable kinetic parameters, initial studies focused on the determination of copolymerization parameters involving HEA. The IUPAC recommended pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) technique in combination with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine propagation rate coefficients and reactivity ratios for HEA with both butyl methacrylate (BMA) and butyl acrylate (BA). Kinetics systematically diverged from classic kinetic behaviour and were solvent dependent. It was proven that hydrogen bonding causes these deviations by comparing HEA copolymerization to that of methoxyethyl acrylate. Simple terminal model predictions or implicit penultimate unit effects were used to represent chain growth kinetic parameters.&#xd;
Further experimentation was performed to determine the influence of these changing kinetic parameters during production of low molar mass functional HEA copolymers in relevant solvents such as ketones or esters under starved-feed semi-batch operating conditions, similar to those used in industry. H bonding effects on kinetics were found to be well controlled to HEA contents of maximum 50 wt%. The BMA/HEA copolymerization in ketones is very well represented by a comprehensive copolymerization model that considers relevant methacrylate and acrylate side reactions and uses the kinetic chain growth parameters measured by the PLP investigations.</description>

   <title>Distortions in Government Contract Awards, Executive Compensation, and Asset Prices: Three Essays in Finance</title>
   <creator>Boland, Matthew</creator>
   <contributor>Purda, Lynnette</contributor>
   <subject>Finance</subject>
   <description>In this thesis, I present three papers in finance. Chapter 1 introduces the thesis. Chapter 2 presents the paper Competition for Government Contracts and the Payoff to Political Activism. This paper exploits three shocks to the competition for procurement contracts including a Presidential memorandum, the formation of the Department of Homeland Security, and Hurricane Katrina. I find that greater competition disrupts the positive relationship between political activism by firms and government contract awards such that politically active firms receive reduced benefits. Chapter 3 presents the paper Discrimination in the C-Suite: Do Discriminatory Pay Practices Exist for the Positions of CEO and CFO? I test for discrimination in the C-suite by comparing the compensation and pay-performance sensitivity of white men and individuals belonging to a designated group (women and visible minorities). I find little evidence of discriminatory compensation practices against visible minority executives; however, I find that women receive less compensation in male-dominated industries. Chapter 4 presents Pricing in Auction Markets for Alternative Assets a coauthored paper with Dr. Daniel Thornton. We present a model of an auction market for collectibles and empirically test it using experimental data. Results indicate that overbidding by non-professionals forces professionals out of the market, ensuring that investments in collectibles return less than zero net present value.  Chapter 5 concludes.</description>

   <title>Ediacaran Discs: Elucidating the Form and Function of the Discoid Fossils at the Root of Metazoan Evolution</title>

   <description>Recent suggestions that Ediacaran discs, the most common and ubiquitous fossils of the Ediacara biota, represent the holdfasts of fronds has led them to be relatively unstudied in recent years.   This thesis utilizes biometric, sedimentologic, and morphologic data from Ediacaran sites in Avalonian Newfoundland and NW Canada to elucidate the biological and preservational nature of Ediacaran discoid fossils. &#xd;
&#xd;
A study on the Avalon and Bonavista peninsulas of Newfoundland comparing Conception-style preservation of fronds visibly attached to discoid holdfasts to Fermeuse-style preservation of isolated discoid fossils confirmed that isolated specimens of the discoid fossils Aspidella and Hiemalora represent holdfasts whose petalodia were not preserved. Taphonomic studies suggest that taxa such as Charniodiscus and Primocandelabrum had holdfasts at the sediment-water interface, whereas taxa such as Charnia had holdfasts that were buried in the substrate.&#xd;
&#xd;
Morphological and sedimentological studies of Aspidella, Eoporpita, and Hiemalora from the “June beds” in the Mackenzie Mountains of NW Canada showed considerably more internal complexity than has previously been described for Ediacaran discs.  Aspidella appears to represent a membrane-bound exterior surface that surrounded a tiered series of laterally-adjacent, hollow, club-shaped lobes within the holdfast that, if found separately, would be referred to the discoid genus Eoporpita. &#xd;
&#xd;
Restudy of the enigmatic, Cryogenian-aged “Twitya discs” of Bluefish Creek in the Mackenzie Mountains of NW Canada reveals probable examples of Aspidella. This discovery extends the known time range of Aspidella by nearly 80 Ma and offers a glimpse of deep-water benthic organisms that presaged the Ediacara biota. The lack of a visible stem or petalodium on either specimen of Aspidella from Bluefish Creek may be taphonomic, in which case complex multicellularity may range considerably down into the Cryogenian.  Alternatively, it may imply that the disc was the ancestral structure, and that the overlying frondose structure evolved later as an oxygen-collection structure under the low and fluctuating oxygenation conditions that characterized Ediacaran seas.</description>

   <title>Studying the Perceived Quality Consistency of Cross-Platform Mobile Apps</title>

   <description>In order to generate more revenue and reach more users, developers build cross- platform apps. To implement cross-platform apps, developers can either use multiple native development frameworks, or they can use hybrid development frameworks that generate cross-platform apps for each platform. Such hybrid apps are based on one single codebase. Hence, developers only need to implement and maintain one codebase and the hybrid development framework will then generate apps for each supported platform.&#xd;
&#xd;
Little is known about the consistency in the perceived quality of cross-platform apps. The majority of existing work on the consistency of cross-platform apps are from a developer’s perspective (e.g., the CPU utilization of cross-platform apps). Consistency in the perceived quality of cross-platform apps is reflected in star ratings and user reviews. Studies show that users rely heavily on star ratings and user reviews to determine the quality of apps. Good star ratings and user reviews of an app increase the number of downloads and eventually generate more revenue.&#xd;
&#xd;
The goal of this thesis is to understand the consistency in the perceived quality of cross-platform apps. In particular, we study the consistency in star ratings and user reviews of cross-platform native apps and cross-platform hybrid apps.&#xd;
&#xd;
We first study the consistency in star ratings and user reviews of cross-platform na- tive apps. We identify 19 native cross-platform apps from the set of the most popular apps in Android and iOS. We find that cross-platform native apps lack consistency in star ratings and user reviews. Users perceive the quality of the studied cross-platform native apps differently across platforms. For the same app, users complain differently across platforms.&#xd;
&#xd;
We then study the consistency in star ratings and user reviews of cross-platform hybrid apps. We identify 24 hybrid cross-platform apps from the set of most popular apps in Android and iOS. We find that cross-platform hybrid apps have better con- sistency in star ratings and user reviews. However, the improvement in consistency is small and developers should not rely on hybrid development frameworks to achieve consistency in star ratings and user reviews. We further analyze the releases of cross- platform hybrid apps. We find that releases consistency of cross-platform hybrid apps is still lacking. Hybrid development frameworks offer little help to developers who wish to keep a consistent release schedule across their supported platforms.</description>

   <description>Software quality plays a vital role in the success of a software project. The probability of having defective modules in large software systems remains high. A disproportionate amount of the cost of developing software is spent on maintenance. The maintenance of large and complex software systems is a big challenge for the software industry. Fixing defects is a central software maintenance activity to continuously improve software quality. Software Quality Assurance (SQA) teams are dedicated to this task (e.g., software testing and code review) of defect detection during the software development process. Since testing or review an entire software system are time and resource-intensive. Knowing which software modules are likely to be defect-prone before a system has been deployed help in effectively allocating SQA effort. &#xd;

Defect classification models help SQA teams to identify defect-prone modules in a software system before it is released to users. Defect classification models can be divided into two categories: (1) classification models that classify a software module is defective or not defective; and (2) regression models that count the number of defects in a software module. Our work is focused on training defect classification models such classification models are trained using software metrics (e.g., size and complexity metrics) to predict whether software modules will be defective or not in the future. However, defect classification models may yield different results when the experimental settings (e.g., choice of classification technique, features, dataset preprocessing) are changed.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we investigate the impact of different experimental settings on the performance of defect classification models. More specifically, we study the impact of three experimental settings (i.e., choice of classification technique, dataset processing using feature selection techniques, and applying meta-learners to the classification techniques) on the performance of defect classification models through analysis of software systems from both proprietary and open-source domains. Our study results show that: (1) the choice of classification technique has an impact on the performance of defect classification models --- recommending that software engineering researchers experiment with the various available techniques instead of relying on specific techniques, assuming that other techniques are not likely to lead to statistically significant improvements in their reported results; (2) applying feature selection techniques do have a significant impact on the performance of defect classification models --- a Correlation-based filter-subset feature selection technique with a BestFirst search method outperforms other feature selection techniques across the studied datasets and across the studied classification techniques. Hence, recommending the application of such a feature selection technique when training defect classification models; and (3)meta-learners help in improving the performance of defect classification models, however, future studies employ concrete meta-learners (e.g., Random Forest), which train classifiers that perform statistically similar to classifiers that are trained using abstract meta-learners (e.g., Bagging and Boosting); however, produce a less complex model.</description>

   <description>A new method is presented for registration of two partially overlapping noisy point clouds that is robust to noise and data density variation with improved computational efficiency. The registration is driven by establishing correspondences of virtual interest points, which do not exist in the original point cloud data and are defined by the intersection of three implicit surfaces extracted from the point cloud. Implicit surfaces exist in abundance in both natural and built environments and can be used to represent stable regions in the data, which in turn leads to repeatable virtual interest points. Large regions in a point cloud can be represented by a few implicit surfaces, which reduces the computational cost of registration and also makes the algorithm robust to noise and data density variations.&#xd;
The main contribution of this work is to represent the point cloud as implicit surfaces that results in repeatable interest points. The effect of noise is reduced during the modelling phase. Additionally, the feature descriptors computed for the virtual interest points are significantly different from the state of the art techniques. Surface properties and their relationships with each other are used to define a descriptor that is robust to data density variations compared to conventional support region based descriptors. Furthermore, the transformation between two point clouds can be computed by only one true correspondence, which makes the technique efficient compared to recently proposed competing techniques.&#xd;
Experiments were performed on 11 data sets to characterize robustness to noise and data density variations as well as computational efficiency. The data sets were extracted from natural scenes, including as plants, rocks, and indoor architectural scenes such as offices and laboratories. Similarly, several 3D models were also tested for registration to demonstrate the generality of the technique. A range of sensors was used to collect the data sets, including the Microsoft Kinect version 1 and version 2, Swiss Ranger, and a NextEngine 3D scanner. For most data sets, the proposed method outperformed the Iterative Closest Point (ICP), Generalized Iterative Closest Point, a 2.5D SIFT-based RANSAC method, Super 4-Point Congruent Sets (4PCS), Super Generalized 4PCS (SG4PCS), and the Go-ICP method in registering overlapping point clouds with both a higher success rate and reduced computational cost. The convergence rate of VIP method was more than 75 % for all data sets. The minimum improvement ratio for computational efficiency was more than 1.5 as compared to 4PCS, SG4PCS and Go-ICP for all data sets except Sailor.</description>

   <title>Ontario Outdoor Integrated Curriculum Programs: More than "just a fun semester"</title>

   <description>Integrated curriculum programs (ICPs) in Ontario consist of two to four secondary course credits taught by a single instructor to a cohort of students for a semester. ICPs often have a focus on outdoor and environmental education, and emphasize experiential and integrated learning. Despite challenges that such programs face (such as instructor burnout and limited administrative support), their prevalence has grown, with about 100 programs as of 2015 compared to 30 in 2000.&#xd;
	While research provides evidence to suggest positive outcomes of outdoor ICPs with regard to the student experience, it has primarily focused on current students. Research investigating the long-term impacts of ICP experiences, and across multiple programs, is limited. Thus the purpose of this study is to explore further the long-term influence of a variety of outdoor ICPs on students’ lives. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight former Ontario ICP students (4 to 13 years post-program) representing six different programs. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically using an inductive approach. 	&#xd;
	The findings suggest that former students representing a variety of outdoor ICPs recall their experiences positively, even years later. During their programs, former students valued the sense of community they experienced, the educational approach, their personal growth throughout the semester, and the instructor. Outdoor ICPs also resonated with participants beyond their respective semesters, leaving them with a lasting connection to the program, influencing their academic and career goals, and driving them to enact environmental consciousness.</description>

   <title>Information and Estimation Theoretic Approaches to Data Privacy</title>

   <description>Warner [145] in 1960s proposed a simple mechanism, now referred to as the randomized response model,  as a remedy for what he termed “evasive answer bias” in survey sampling. The randomized response setting is as follows: $n$ people participate in a survey and a statistician asks each individual a sensitive yes-no question and seeks to find the ratio of "yes" responses. For privacy purposes, individuals are given a biased coin that comes up heads with probability $a\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$. Each individual flips the coin in private. If it comes up heads, they lie and if it comes up tails, they tell the truth. Warner derived a maximum likelihood unbiased estimator for the true ratio of "yes" based on the reported responses. Thus the parameter of interest is estimated accurately while preserving the privacy of each user and avoiding survey answer bias.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we generalize Warner's randomized response model in several directions:  &#xd;
(i) we assume that the response of each individual consists of private and non-private data and the goal is to generate a response which carries as much "information" about the non-private data as possible while limiting the "information leakage" about the private data, (ii) we propose mathematically well founded metrics to quantify the tradeoff between how much the response leaks about the private data and how much information  it conveys about the non-private data, (iii) we make no assumptions on the alphabets of the private and non-private data, and (iv) we design optimal response mechanisms which achieve the fundamental tradeoffs.   &#xd;
&#xd;
Unlike the large body of recent research on privacy which studied the problem of reducing disclosure risk, in this thesis we formulate and study the tradeoff between  utility (e.g., statistical efficiency) and privacy (e.g., information leakage). Our approach (which is two-fold: information-theoretic and estimation-theoretic) and results shed light on the fundamental limits of the utility-privacy tradeoff.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to explore the sport experiences of six U Sports (Canadian Interuniversity Sport) male hockey players (three past CHL players and three past NCAA Division I players) through one-on-one interviews with them. The focus was the exploration of how parents, coaches, and peers had influenced current U Sports hockey players’ overall well-being in the transition through the CHL (Canadian Hockey League) or NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). This study included male participants only, because the CHL, one of the two development leagues investigated, is for males only. Interviews revealed meaningful hockey experiences within the CHL and NCAA, in climates that affected players' motivation, expectations, and goals. The key findings of this study arose from the analysis of these interviews: (1) coaches need to have a better knowledge of the ‘psychology of performance’ for their athletes; (2) coaches should provide feedback in a more ethical way regardless of competition level; and (3) all social agents, including the athletes themselves, need to create informed and appropriate expectations to avoid realizations that can result in negative outcomes to well-being. Future research should be expanded by broadening the range of interview questions, diversifying the participant pool, and targetting policies in addition to practices.</description>

   <description>Our novel study investigated how the anti-saccade training can influence cognitive capabilities of healthy and Parkinson’s disease participants. The rationale is that the anti-saccade task requires top-down control and involves cortical cognition areas in the frontal and prefrontal cortices. We hypothesized that anti-saccade training may induce plastic changes in these brain areas resulting in improved top-down control, which would transfer to other unpracticed executive tasks. We conducted two experiments using a pretest-training-posttest design. In our first experiment, we tested the impact of 10 days of interleaved pro/-anti saccade training on cognitive functions in participants with Parkinson’s disease compared to healthy older controls. We tested 9 Parkinson’s and 11 healthy older participants in a spatial working memory task, decision making task, and visual search task before and after training. We compared performance after training to before training. Both Parkinson's and healthy older participants showed some improvements after training; however, these were limited to the visual search task in Parkinson's participants and visual memory and decision making tasks in older heathy participants. In the second experiment, we tested the validity of anti-saccade training; we trained a group of younger participants on the interleaved pro/anti-saccade task and a second group on a pro-saccade only task and compared performance on several cognitive tasks after training to before training. Overall, we observed an improvement after both types of training, with the exception of two tasks, the interleaved pro/-anti saccade task and an oculomotor capture tasks. These two tasks showed benefits only with the interleaved training. A significant interaction between group and testing time was observed for the interleaved task in which participants who performed the pro-only training made significantly more anti-saccade errors in the post-test. This could mean that the pro-only training had a maladaptive effect on anti-saccades. Taken together, the two studies suggest that anti-saccade training has promise to improve some cognitive functions in participants with Parkinson’s disease as well as older controls, however there is insufficient evidence to attribute the improvement to anti-saccade training specifically. Further research is required to address the current study limitations before a final conclusion can be reached.</description>

   <description>This study argues that expressions of national identity in modern and contemporary English-Canadian fiction often conceive of the nation as having bifurcated into, on the one hand, ethnic, and, on the other hand, pluralist or self-consciously immigration-based models, and that the former is frequently, if seldom explicitly, valorized at the expense of the latter. It examines fiction by Laura Goodman Salverson, Frederick Philip Grove, Margaret Laurence, Rudy Wiebe, Gwendolyn MacEwen, and Timothy Taylor (in comparison with novels by SKY Lee, Eden Robinson, and Dionne Brane), arguing that the separation of these two national models in such works results in a Euro-Canadian identity that endorses a pluralist existence “beyond the nation” and that disavows nationalisms based on ethnicity even as it subtly reaffirms (European) ethnicity as the central component of the ostensibly multicultural nation. &#xd;
&#xd;
It makes this argument by reading the above works through the lens of the ethno-symbolist theory of Anthony Smith, in turn positing the latter as a productive alternative to the constructivist strain of political theory (exemplified by Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities) that has dominated critical engagements with Canadian literature. In providing a framework for remaining attuned to the persistence of subjective notions of ethnicity in contemporary constructions of nation, the study traces the emergence of a Canadian identity that continues to privilege whiteness but that also creates a new understanding of ethnicity in which a personalized alterity within defines post-national subjectivity. It ultimately suggests that the Euro-Canadian fixation on the inseparability of ethnicity and nation may result in a broader legacy of essentialism that is still being felt in even the most progressive Canadian writing, which sometimes manifests a related essentialism based not on renewed faith in the connection between nation and ethnicity, but rather in broader cultural or race-based essentialisms that pose such identity categories as at once constructed and natural—a contradiction that is directly descended from the Euro-Canadian understanding of ethnicity as the necessary precursor to and condition for membership in the nation.</description>

   <description>The electrochemical quartz-crystal nanobalance (EQCN) is an electroanalytical technique used to measure in-situ minute mass changes (Δm) associated with interfacial electrochemical phenomena.  The results acquired by combining the EQCN and electrochemical techniques provide a new insight into the nature of electrochemical processes and contribute to the understanding of their mechanisms at the atomic/molecular level.  The EQCN has been used for over three decades; however, its limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) have never been studied.  We propose a methodology for determining the values of LOD and LOQ for Pt electrodes in aqueous H2SO4 solutions.  The values of LOD and LOQ decrease as the concentration of the electrolyte decreases.  The EQCN measures changes in frequency (Δf) of a quartz-crystal resonator, which are converted into Δm using the Sauerbrey equation containing the characteristic constant (Cf); Cf is determined by physical parameters of the quartz and refers to an atomically smooth surface.  However, real electrodes are not atomically flat and it is unknown how surface roughness factor (R) affects Δm.  We examine Δm associated with H adsorption/desorption and surface oxide formation/reduction on Pt electrodes.  The value of R is fine-tuned through Pt electrodeposition and the surface morphology is examined using atomic force microscopy.  The results reveal linear relationships between Δm and R, and their extrapolation to R = 1.00 leads to the determination of Δm for atomically flat polycrystalline Pt electrodes.  The values of Δm for R = 1.00 are analyzed in terms of the number of electrolyte components interacting with each Pt surface atom.  A modified Sauerbrey equation, which takes into account the surface roughness, is proposed.  Also, we calibrate the system using Ag electrodeposition, and the experimental characteristic constant (Cf,exp) values are determined by analyzing the slopes of charge density versus Δf plots for the Ag electrodeposition.  They are different than the value of Cf and increase logarithmically with R.  The Cf and Cf,exp values are used in a comparative analysis of Δm for complete cyclic-voltammetry profiles.  It reveals that the employment of Cf instead of Cf,exp provides inaccurate values of Δm, and the magnitude of discrepancy increases with R.</description>

   <description>Road mortality contributes significantly to the population decline of many turtle species. Roadside drainage culverts can act as safe movement conduits, offering turtles a safe means to transverse busy roadways. My research explored two areas relating to herpetofauna use of culverts: 1) the creation of turtle-friendly beaver exclusion devices, and 2) the development of best practices for the use of cameras in monitoring herpetofaunal use of mitigation infrastructure. &#xd;
A literature review was conducted to determine if a turtle-friendly beaver exclusion device currently exists that allows turtles to pass through the device in order to access the culvert inlet. Results show that very few devices have been designed to specifically accommodate turtles, and though various modifications exist that can be used with existing beaver exclusion devices to make them more turtle friendly, the effectiveness of these are largely unknown. Without providing access through the device to the culvert inlet, turtles are unable to make use of culverts as movement conduits. Suggestions were made on which beaver exclusion devices could be used in combination with these modifications, which is the first known attempt at modifying multiple existing beaver exclusion devices to accommodate them specifically for turtles. &#xd;
A second literature review was conducted addressing the second research area, to determine if a standardized protocol or list of best practices has been developed for camera-based monitoring of herpetofauna at road mortality mitigation infrastructure. The understanding of cameras for this application is limited compared to mammals, largely because cold-blooded herpetofauna have a smaller thermal footprint and are not captured as often by cameras as a result, making results unreliable or inconsistent. Following best practices can help consolidate camera study methodologies, possibly improving the effectiveness of camera traps. Reliable monitoring studies can help determine the use and effectiveness of various mitigation structures, which can be implemented in future road development projects. Results indicated that a protocol does not exist, and a list of recommendations and best practices identified from the literature was developed. These recommendations act as a benchmark, and can be built upon in future studies, until standardized protocols can be developed.</description>

   <title>Long-term (2003 - 2016) dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes from paired High Arctic catchments</title>

   <description>Climate change is expected to have strong impacts on permafrost and the frequency of landscape disturbances are expected to increase in response to warming temperatures and overall permafrost change. These disturbances can increase the export of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from High Arctic catchments, having important effects on downstream aquatic ecosystems, thus motivating the need to better understand the impact of permafrost change on nitrogen exports. This study examined fluxes of DIN (ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-)) from paired catchments at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory, Nunavut. Water samples were collected from the outlet of the rivers during the melt season from 2003 to 2016. A range of surface water draining different landscape types were also sampled during the 2016 season to identify how specific locations in the catchments control downstream DIN concentrations. Both physical disturbances, including active layer detachments (ALDs), and thermal perturbations related to widespread deepening of the active layer in response to warm summers, occurred during this record. Widespread physical disturbances occurred at the end of the 2007 field season in response to exceptionally warm temperatures and a large rainfall event. Additionally, 2012 was the warmest sampling year, and is one of the warmest years on record (1970 – 2016).&#xd;
&#xd;
River NO3- fluxes increased in 2008, responding to the 2007 disturbance, as the nitrification and mobilization of nitrogen is inferred to increase as soils were brought to the surface and exposed to flushing. The DIN fluxes recovered rapidly at the catchment scale, reaching pre-disturbance values by 2010. DIN fluxes increased strongly in 2012 as warm temperatures are assumed to result in deep active layer thaw and increased subsurface flow, resulting in high DIN export, especially during the baseflow and stormflow hydrologic periods. Recovery from widespread permafrost thaw was not observed after four years.&#xd;
&#xd;
Fluxes are similar between the rivers, with minor deviations associated with variations in catchment morphology. Spatial analysis of the DIN concentrations from upstream locations along the rivers does not show a distinct pattern throughout the season, but rather indicates a complex interaction of inputs, dilutions, and biogeochemical transformations.</description>

   <title>Polypropylene Thermosets by Functional Nitroxyl-Mediated Radical Crosslinking</title>

   <subject>Polypropylene</subject>
   <description>New chemistry for preparing polypropylene (PP) thermosets is described, wherein radical degradation suffered during conventional peroxide treatment is overcome using a nitroxyl additive bearing a polymerizable functional group.  A small amount of 4-vinylbenzoic-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-N-oxyl (VBTEMPO) is used to trap peroxide-derived, alkyl radical intermediates during the early stages of the modification process, yielding a macromonomer derivative in situ that crosslinks in the later stages through side-chain oligomerization.  This process has proven capable of producing thermosets with gel contents in excess of 90%, while providing the induction period needed to shape the formulation before it rendered thermoset. Control over PP crosslinking dynamics and yields have been gained by appropriate selection of peroxide initiator, polymerizable functional structure, and additional cure formulation components.  The thesis concludes with preliminary assessments of the stability of PP-derived alkoxyamines, and their potential to confer oxidative stability to a thermoset.</description>

   <description>In compression ignition engines, the soot-NOx paradox is an extremely challenging unresolved issue. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is one of the most promising solutions that combine the benefits of both Spark ignition and Compression ignition combustion modes. Fuel-lean premixed combustion helps to reduce or eliminate the formation of NOx and soot. HCCI engines have a high heat release rate at high load that results in knock. A unique variable compression ratio rotary engine based on the HCCI combustion mode (patented by Customachinery Inc) is under development at Queen’s University. The present study includes a computational fluid dynamics analysis of the air induction and compression, fuel injection, fuel and air mixing, and ignition process using Ansys Fluent. A unique dynamic mesh was adopted that allowed for the modeling of a fixed stator and rotating lobed rotor, as well as novel gates that extend and retract. A default Fluent fuel spray model was used and the optimum fuel injector location and orientation were determined. Two different combustion models (single-step and detailed chemistry) were investigated, and it was found that the results have significant differences. The detailed chemistry predicted a two-stage ignition process typical for heptane fuel that a single-step model cannot predict. The effect of other parameters such as compression ratio, fuel load, and fuel injection time on the ignition and combustion process were also studied.</description>

   <title>Targeted 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis of E. coli contaminated private drinking well waters in southern Ontario</title>
   <creator>Pogoda, Kamila</creator>
   <description>Given that water is essential to sustaining life, contamination of drinking water sources poses a potential threat to human and environmental health.  In Ontario, a proportion of private well water supplies, which are the primary source of drinking water for the majority of rural Ontarians, are at risk of becoming microbially contaminated, which is of utmost concern given water remains a significant pathway of infectious disease transmission. Microbial indicators of water health and quality, particularly when measured using traditional culture or molecular methods, are only successfully detected for a small portion of contaminating microbes and limit the study of the diversity of groundwater health indicators. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, bypasses the need for isolation or cultivation of microorganisms, providing insight into the environmental metagenome; this technology promises to give rise to a grander understanding of microbial communities and pathogens inhabiting drinking water environments. &#xd;
This study investigates the metagenomics of private well waters of previously determined regions at increased risk of Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination in southern Ontario, and is among the first to investigate the bacterial metagenome of private drinking well water.  Traditional and alternative fecal indicator bacteria, E. coli and species-specific Bacteroides species, were investigated in the context of the drinking well water metagenome. The microbial community analysis revealed that a distinct drinking water community exists within E. coli positive drinking well waters.  The lack of correlation and disagreement between the fecal indicators (E. coli and Bacteroides) with fecal associated families within the bacterial community highlights the research need to investigate techniques and indicators that are capable of designating a true positive or negative result for fecal contamination in private well water supplies.  Although not expected to be feasible for routine application in laboratories, further investigation of the well water microbiome and fecal signatures within these communities may enable discovery of better assessment tools for private drinking well water quality and source water protection.</description>

   <description>A detailed petrologic and metallogenic study was conducted on the eastern flank of the Northern Ultramafic Centre (NUC) of the North Lac des Iles Complex (North LDIC) to understand the petrogenesis of cyclically layered ultramafic cumulates and the processes involved in the formation of the PGE mineralization. Additional investigation of historical PGE-Cu-Ni prospects in the North LDIC provides insights into the styles of mineralization and how these styles compare with the stratiform PGE mineralization of the NUC and the Pd deposits hosted by the mafic Mine Block Intrusion of the South Lac des Iles Complex (South LDIC).&#xd;
	Field relationships, mineralogical, textural, mineral chemical, and lithochemical data from the NUC reveal the presence of two distinct paragenetic sequences of cumulate rocks.  Cyclic Unit A (CUA) is characterized by an upward progression of Ol+Cr-SpOl+Opx+Cpx±Cr-SpCpx+Opx Pl+Opx±Cpx. Cyclic Unit B (CUB) exhibits a cumulate stratigraphic progression of Ol+Cr-SpOl+Cpx.  CUA sequences are interpreted to have formed by fractional crystallization of more siliceous ultramafic magmas relative to CUB parent magmas.&#xd;
	Stratiform PGE mineralization of the Sutcliffe Zone is typically hosted within four different CUA units. PGE mineralization is commonly associated with >2% disseminated Cu-Ni sulfide, and is characterized by mantle-like S/Se ratios, Pd tenors in sulfide &lt;1000 ppm, and Pd/Pt ratios &lt; 5.  The Sutcliffe Zone is interpreted to have formed by a combination of fractional crystallization and dynamic recharge and mixing of CUA and CUB parental magmas.&#xd;
            The majority of PGE-Cu-Ni prospects in the North LDIC share similar host rocks, sulfide and platinum group mineral compositions and textures, trace element signatures, Pd tenors, S/Se and Pd/Pt ratios as the stratiform PGE mineralization at Sutcliffe Zone, similar genesis. &#xd;
            Similarities between stratiform PGE-Cu-Ni mineralization in the North LDIC and the magmatic breccia-style Pd mineralization in the South LDIC include the prevalence of orthopyroxene, widespread magmatic alteration, low sulfide content, Pd-rich PGE mineralization and the dominance of Pd-bismuthotellurides. Despite these similarities, the two styles of mineralization remain distinct in terms of structural controls on mineralization, host rocks, base metal sulfide and PGE mineralogy, PGE tenors of sulfide, and the source of parental magmas.</description>

   <description>This dissertation expands upon the vibrant field of medieval queer studies by considering literary instances of medieval sexual power play via theory on contemporary BDSM (bondage and discipline, domination and submission, and sadism and masochism). It begins with a chapter outlining the history and theory of BDSM. The remaining chapters explore concepts of fantasy, performance, consent, and eroticized violence in three Middle English texts, Sir Gowther, The Book of Margery Kempe, and the Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale, from the perspective of kinky reading, a methodology that draws on the traditions of feminist and queer theory and the new field of kink studies. BDSM has historically been pathologized, but this study interprets kink as a form of queerness rather than an expression of illness because of its non-reproductive, non-genital focus and embracing of fluid sexual identities and power dynamics. In each text this dissertation considers, reading with awareness of BDSM clarifies power dynamics and finds relationships between sex and power that can be both arousing and empowering for the characters involved. &#xd;
Erotic discourses in these texts express the struggle of an individual character to relate to larger social power structures, a struggle complicated by race for Gowther and by gender for Margery and the Wife. Like contemporary BDSM, these texts manipulate and exaggerate existing power dynamics for erotic impact. In Sir Gowther, the queerness of sadism is ultimately displaced onto foreign enemies, while temporary masochism allows Gowther to secure his aristocratic position. Increased attention to eroticized violence and consent reveals how Margery’s relationship with God enables her to reclaim her body and both resist and demand recognition from Church authorities. A kinky approach to the erotic content of the Wife’s Prologue and Tale provides a solution to the feminist critical impasse over the Wife; this rereading argues that her texts advocate for flexible power dynamics and embrace sex as a positive part of life. This dissertation makes connections between medieval and modern sexualities that illuminate kink as an intense form of desire and a resistance to heteronormativity.</description>

   <description>This work improves surgical navigation by combining electromagnetic tracking and personalized guides in a novel system.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Surgical navigation assists a surgeon by tracking instruments relative to the anatomy of interest, typically by optically tracking specialized markers.  One recent navigation aid is a personalized guide, which is a mechanical device that is customized to a patient based on preoperative images.  A small "negative surface" physically registers the guide to the patient, and typically one or more through-holes in the guide constrain a physical path during surgical drilling.  A personalized guide may incorporate a surgical plan into their design but offers no means of intraoperative adjustment or correction.&#xd;
&#xd;
Electromagnetic tracking uses a small antenna that is localized within an electromagnetic field. Advantages of electromagnetic tracking include small sensor weight and not being constrained to a line of sight; drawbacks include a lower positional accuracy than  optical tracking, and interference from nearby electrically conductive objects.&#xd;
&#xd;
This work is based on a paired-lines registration algorithm that was used to create tracked guides for small, delicate bony anatomy. Electromagnetically tracked guides were applied to additively manufactured bone models.  The guides were compared to optical tracking in the presence of common metallic surgical instruments.  In every analysis, EM-tracked guides were found to statistically significantly outperform optical tracking.  A pre-clinical cadaveric case study demonstrated comparable performance to optical tracking.&#xd;
&#xd;
This work suggests that EM-tracked guides successfully combined the flexibility of tracking with the simplicity of physical registration in surgical navigation.</description>

   <title>The Influence of Secondary Mineral Phase Crystallization on Antimony and Arsenic Mobility in Mine Drainage</title>

   <description>Mine waste containing high concentrations of the potentially toxic metalloids antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) poses a risk for the natural environment since they are toxic to various organisms. To assess this risk, it is necessary to understand the role of mineralogy, particularly the influences of solubility and variable chemical composition of minerals.&#xd;
The sites selected for this study allow an insight into the Sb behaviour in three different systems: freshly deposited stibnite-containing tailings at Beaverbrook Sb mine (Newfoundland), historical mine waste at Špania Dolina-Piesky (Slovakia) where tetrahedrite is the main Sb host, and several historical Sb deposits in Slovakia where the Sb association with colloids was investigated. Water analyses using ICP-AS-OS, HG -AAS were combined with mineralogical analyses conducted using a combination of SEM, EMPA, MLA and synchrotron-based μXRD, μXRF and μXANES (see the list of abbreviations).&#xd;
The study of tetrahedrite weathering reveals that after being released from primary tetrahedrite, Sb becomes a part of a structure of secondary Sb minerals tripuhyite and pyrochlore which are stable in near-surface conditions, whereas As and Cu are contained in µXRD-amorphous phase. It is concluded that Sb is not very mobile when tetrahedrite is weathering under oxidizing, near-neutral conditions.&#xd;
At Beaverbrook, Sb is rapidly released from stibnite in tailings deposits to the pore water in an oxic environment where it transforms to highest oxidation state Sb5+. Arsenopyrite oxidizes less rapidly, and the formation of oxidation rims contributes to its slower dissolution. The formation of less soluble Sb-Fe secondary phases, and formation and dissolution of easily soluble brandholzite contribute to Sb cycling in the environment of freshly deposited tailings.&#xd;
In mine drainage from several historical mine sites, it was determined that colloids influence As mobility more than Sb mobility. At the sites where As is the main contaminant, abundant Fe-As-Si-O colloids were detected on the surface of 0.01 µm filters. Only very high Sb concentration (above 6600 µg/L) promoted precipitation of low amounts of Fe-Sb-Si-O±S colloids.&#xd;
Secondary Sb minerals with different stability are formed in mine waste environment. Understanding the conditions of their formation and their characteristics allow the prediction of potential environmental issues.</description>

   <title>Incorporated: Student Mental Health Discourse and Higher Education in Canada</title>

   <description>“Student mental health” has recently emerged as a pervasive discourse on Canadian postsecondary campuses, characterized by non-profit organizations’ expanding role in defining and managing students’ mental health, students’ active participation in shaping and perpetuating discourses of distress and wellbeing, and institutions’ promises to build thriving communities. Prior to 2011, students’ psychological wellbeing received little concerted attention, but a number of student suicides propelled the topic onto the national stage. Although media coverage framed the problem in part as the crisis of a generation struggling to succeed in an inhospitable, overly demanding education system, the postsecondary sector embraced the language of “student mental health” and quickly transformed it into an institutional branding strategy. I address this seeming contradiction by considering the cultural, political, and economic work that student mental health discourse does to benefit the institution of postsecondary education. &#xd;
&#xd;
Influenced by the theoretical perspectives of Nikolas Rose and by cultural studies methodologies, I map the shifting discursive terrain of student mental health discourse, focusing on three main figures: the student in distress, the campus community charged with identifying and responding to that student, and the student mental health leader. I examine documentary evidence including institutional reports, strategic plans, mental health models, organization websites, media reports, press releases, and student mental health campaign materials. I articulate these with public displays of student mental health promotion, through which students perform their understandings of distress as signs of biomedical problems and of mental health as something “we all have.”  &#xd;
&#xd;
My findings reveal that acknowledging student distress has become integral to Canadian postsecondary education’s corporatization process. Such acknowledgement prompts the emergence of a “caring community” that operates in the interest and image of the corporate world, melding the values and goals of the postsecondary sector’s market logic with the hopeful acts of the students who seek out the validation, warmth, and professional potential offered by this extracurricular education. I argue that student mental health discourse both draws in and retains willing student participants, thus intervening in postsecondary corporatization’s potential depletion of one of its greatest resources: human capital in the form of the student body.</description>

   <title>The Role of Polarized Macrophages in LCMV Infection</title>

   <description>Macrophages (MΦ) are a heterogeneous population of innate immune cells serving as the first line of defense during infection and as regulators of tissue homeostasis. During viral infections, MΦ rapidly sense infecting viruses to process and present antigen of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I for activation of virus specific CD8+ T cells. Moreover, through detection of pathogens and responding to environmental cytokines, monocytic derived bone marrow and peritoneal MΦ differentiate into polarized pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) states. However, little is known regarding the polarization capabilities of tissue resident MΦ, such as those of the spleen, which are of non-monocytic origin and how polarization influences CD8+ T cell immunity during viral infections. &#xd;
Therefore, we tested to what extent spleen derived (Sp)-MΦ polarize into M1 and M2 states and the functional consequences of polarization. We found that Sp-MΦ respond concordantly with bone marrow (BM)- MΦ to M1 stimulation to increase expression of iNOS and produce NO, or to M2 stimulation induce Arginase and Urea production. In addition, polarization impacted the phagocytic function of MΦ. Thus in this section, we established the novel polarization capabilities of polarized Sp-MΦ and the outcome on phagocytosis an important MΦ function. &#xd;
Next, we tested the MHC-I restricted antigen presenting abilities of polarized Sp-MΦ. To our surprise, we observed that M2 cells were proficient in inducing IFN-gamma secretion by effector CTL during peptide stimulation or following Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) infection.  However, M2 MΦ exhibit a deficiency in their ability to stimulate memory CD8+ T cell proliferation, which was reversed by additional IL-2. These findings highlighted previously unreported functions of polarized MΦ with regard to direct antigen presentation. &#xd;
Finally, we tested how virus priming into an in vivo M2 micro-environment influences subsequent CD8+ T cell immunity. In this study, we observed IL-4 pretreatment dramatically increased the quality of CD8+ T cell response enhanced viral clearance. The CD8+ T cell enhancement was prolonged into the memory phase of infection. &#xd;
Taken together, this thesis provides novel information regarding the polarization of tissue MΦ and how such polarization influences CD8+ T cell immunity and the outcome of viral infection.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines how neoliberal discourses of diversity operate at the university level through the administration’s policies, reports, and responses to racism. The perception of inclusion and acceptance, as present in the rhetoric of diversity policies and procedures, has shaped and obscured cultural perceptions of race (specifically the experiences of students and faculty of colour) while also upholding white supremacist logic. Using Queen’s University, a medium sized elite institution in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, as a case study, I discuss how academic spaces have been structured to reflect a vested interest in neoliberal capitalism, with the institution using diversity narratives to bolster excellence in reputation. In bringing together theories of race and education, as well as anti-racist theories that forefront racialization alongside issues space and belonging, this thesis argues that Queen’s University uses “diversity” to manage race.  Specifically, I explore how reports, assessments, workshops and courses name and/or teach “diversity” without comprehensively challenging practices of racism, colonialism, and white supremacy. The thesis concludes with a brief discussion of how racialized students and other collectives on campus have responded to racism at Queen’s University.</description>

   <description>With the explosion of data that are generated every second, there is an emerging need for big data analytics using scalable systems and platforms for exploration, mining and decision making purposes. To gain better business insights, the business users are interested to integrate different kinds of analytics to achieve their goals. These analytics may involve accessing the same data for different purposes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Modern data intensive systems co-locate the computation as close as possible to the data to achieve greater e ciency. This placement of computation close to the data is called data locality. Data locality has a significant impact on the performance of jobs in a large cluster since higher data locality means there is less data transfer over the network.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, we examine data locality in parallel processing frameworks and propose approaches to optimize it. First, we conduct a literature review of the existing systems that maximize data locality while processing big data analytics workflows.&#xd;
&#xd;
Second, we provide YARN Locality Simulator (YLocSim), a simulator tool that simulates the interactions between YARN components in a real cluster to report the data locality percentages. This tool gives the users better insights about the expected performance of the computing cluster.&#xd;
&#xd;
Third, we develop YARN Dynamic Replication Manager (YDRM), which is a new component in YARN that interacts with the existing YARN's Resource Manager to improve the data locality.</description>

   <description>This thesis is a study of the effects language and culture on military operations using the experience of the 1st Polish Armoured Division under command of the II Canadian Corps in North Western Europe in August 1944. The challenges in multinational operations have been, and remain, understanding both allies and the environment in which one is going to be conducting operations. Rapid mutually intelligible communication is a key factor to mission success, whether during high tempo operations or while conducting deliberate planning and administrative work with non-English speaking allies. &#xd;
This dissertation begins with background material on the cultural and linguistic effects on multi-national military operations, examining literature on the diaspora Polish communities and what has been said about the Polish and Canadian armies’ performances in North-West Europe in August 1944. This is followed by a description of the Pigeau-McCann common intent factors that will be used as a framework to highlight what could be done to overcome the effects of language and culture on the employment of military units and formations. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of culture on leadership in both interpersonal and staff interactions, using the Pigeau-McCann Balanced Command Envelope (BCE) as a subsidiary model to help describe the effect that two commanders, Maczek and Simonds, had on the achievement of common intent. &#xd;
&#xd;
Despite the linguistic and cultural challenges encountered, the 1st Polish Armoured Division fared well in combat and could possibly have done better had more emphasis been placed on bridging the gaps caused by linguistic and cultural differences, joint training, common understanding of the use of liaison teams and liaison officers and emphasis on concise written directions. These conclusions remain relevant in making more effective today’s multinational and, more often than not, multi-lingual military coalitions. There are valuable lessons that have been identified from the past; the time to learn from them is before commitment to operations.</description>

   <subject>Bi-free probability</subject>
   <description>In non-commutative probability theories, many different notions of independence arise in various contexts. According to the early classification work, there are only five such notions that are universal/natural in the sense of Speicher and Muraki, with free independence playing a prominent role.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis follows Voiculescu's recent generalization of free independence to bi-free independence to allow the simultanous study of left and right non-commutative random variables. We consider similar generalizations of other types of independence in the literature and show that many of the important concepts such as cumulants, convolutions, transforms, limit theorems, and infinite divisibility have counterparts in the new setting. While many of the results in this thesis were to be expected, some peculiarities and difficulties do occur in this left-right framework as things become much more complicated.</description>

   <title>Recasting Reform: An Analysis of Electoral Reform Initiatives in Fourteen Parliamentary Democracies</title>

   <description>While successful electoral system change has received considerable scholarly attention in recent years, comparatively little is known about the vast majority of cases where reform was unsuccessfully attempted or never attempted at all. Yet understanding these outcomes is vital to explaining the phenomenon of electoral reform. This dissertation illuminates the important spectrum of outcomes between stasis (no-change) and successful reform. In doing so, it examines the first step toward any potential voting system change: reform proposals and investigations. It asks how and when governments investigate electoral reform. Do reform investigations follow the same patterns as successful reforms? Using survival analysis of original data from 14 parliamentary democracies, this dissertation tests two complementary sets of hypotheses inspired by empirical studies of successful electoral reform and informed by different theoretical approaches to the study of institutional change. The first is a functionalist argument that suggests reform tends to occurs in order to bring "poorly performing" electoral systems closer to a better-functioning ideal. The second is a path-dependent explanation that emphasizes the self-reinforcing nature of political institutions. The analysis finds that reform is rarely proposed in response to apparent "failures" of the electoral system. Instead, the nature of the party system and the degree of institutional consolidation appear to be far better predictors of reform investigation.</description>

   <title>Fine-Scale Mechanisms Influencing Germination Success, Seedling Growth and Survival in an Alpine Forest-Tundra Ecotone</title>

   <description>Despite the expectation that treeline will advance as climate continues to warm, it has only done so in approximately half of all sites studied. One of the explanations for the nonresponse of treelines is based on reproductive limitations including seed production, germination, establishment and growth of young seedlings. To that end, I studied the white spruce (Picea glauca) alpine treeline in the Kluane region of southwest Yukon to explore two important questions related to treeline ecology: (1) Is there sufficient viable seed dispersed at and beyond treeline for successful advance? (2) What are the most important variables influencing germinant presence, seedling growth and seedling survival in the alpine treeline ecotone? Four specific investigations were used to answer these questions, each one addressing a key aspect of seed production, germination, and seedling growth:&#xd;
&#xd;
(1) Seed production, dispersal, and predation were quantified across the treeline ecotone. Results demonstrated that over 88% of seeds were damaged or not viable prior to dispersal. Less than 2% of all seeds were dispersed into alpine tundra. Additionally, germinant losses were also one third higher when seedlings were not protected from predators. &#xd;
&#xd;
(2) Germination success was highest in partially scarified quadrats relative to unscarified and completely scarified quadrats. This was likely due to higher soil moisture and decreased temperature range. In non-experimental areas, naturalized seedlings were found at a higher frequency in areas with evidence of fine-scale soil disturbance.&#xd;
&#xd;
(3) The most important variable that explained the presence of seedlings was the presence of shrubs: the higher the shrub cover, the greater the likelihood of finding tree seedlings up to a certain threshold, after which the probability declined.&#xd;
&#xd;
(4) Tree seedlings grew at a slower pace in the presence of shrubs, but had significantly less tissue damage and higher survivorship than in plots where shrubs had been removed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Collectively, my results suggest that seedling success is contingent on many factors, most notably the amount of erect shrubs in the immediate vicinity. Understanding the variables that influence seedling dynamics is critical, as treeline advance will only occur with the successful emergence, survival and growth of new individuals.</description>

   <title>Self-Assembled N-Heterocyclic Carbene Monolayers on Gold as a Tunable Platform for Designing Biosensor Surfaces</title>

   <description>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensing is an excellent tool to probe the recognition process between biomolecules in real-time, without need for labels. Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold have been widely used as linker layers for biosensor chips used in SPR. However, their use is hampered by the gold-thiol linkage’s high propensity for oxidation in ambient atmosphere. To this end, a new family of materials based on N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) has emerged as an alternative anchor for surface modiﬁcation. Most importantly, the NHC SAMs outperform thiol analogues under a wide range of harsh conditions.&#xd;
Here, we compare the performance of an alkylated NHC SAM on gold with a commercial thiol-based analogue, a hydrophobic association (HPA) chip. Compared to the thiol-based sensor surface, the NHC sensor surface features a desired list of performance merits, including lower non-specific binding capacity, better chemical stability, higher reproducibility, shorter equilibration time, and longer life span. We also demonstrate that the NHC sensor surface can be used for rapid and efficient formation of a hybrid lipid bilayer for use in membrane interaction studies.&#xd;
A sensor surface consisting of an NHC SAM coupled to carboxymethylated dextran was also developed. Standard SPR instrument tests demonstrated the NHC-dextran surfaces to be homogeneous and sufficiently responsive to meet performance standards. In terms of the real life biosensing validation, we found that the NHC-supported dextran surfaces yielded comparable performance to commercial thiol supported biosensor surfaces in kinetic analysis of drug/plasma protein and antibody/antigen interactions. Three types of NHC-based dextran surfaces derivatized with affinity capture functional molecules to enable specifically oriented binding of ligands for biosensing applications were developed: NHC-Streptavidin (SA), NHC-Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), and NHC-Protein A. Our results show that, when properly designed and applied, the NHC-based platform has the potential that allows facile tuning of surface properties in a highly divergent fashion, enabling various ligand to be efficiently immobilized for reliable biomolecular interactions. These results highlight the potential viability of chemical modifications to gold surfaces using NHC ligands as a robust and versatile platform to enable efficient evaluation of a wide range of biomolecular interactions.</description>

   <description>This research undertakes a policy analysis of the Local Immigration Partnership (LIP) program.  Initiated in Ontario in 2008, this national policy takes a local approach to the settlement and integration of immigrants. An objective of the Canada-Ontario Immigration Agreement, the LIP is a community-built, multi-stakeholder strategy to attract and retain greater numbers of immigrants in small- to medium-sized municipal and regional areas in Ontario, and across Canada. The program serves to understand immigrant needs in these communities and to coordinate settlement service supports. Drawing on governmentality literatures, I seek to understand the process of policy localization as well as how this process and the enactment of policy in and through the local sphere governs immigrant settlement and integration. Between 2013 and 2015, I undertook a strategic analysis of existing federal-level immigration policies, federal-provincial agreements, provincial strategies, and LIP documents, and conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants such as government officials, political leaders, LIP coordinators and council members, and community stakeholders in Guelph-Wellington, Kingston, and Peterborough. Findings indicate a neoliberal reorganization of immigration management to control immigration, economic markets, and the outcomes of immigrants. Responsibility for aspects of settlement and integration are increasingly decentralized, but without an equal transfer of authority, leaving actors in the LIP organizations limited in their ability to make decisions and advocate for change. Federal funding and established measurements for project outcomes add layers of uncertainly for program success and sustainability. This research contributes to governmentality literatures as well as policy debates by offering new links between immigration policy and practice under advanced liberalism in Canada.</description>

   <description>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been used to map extensive networks within the cortex, but its use to study resting-state connectivity in the brainstem (BS) and spinal cord (SC) has been limited. This is because of the challenge associated with using fMRI in this region. One reason for this is the small cross sectional area of the SC. The proximity of the BS and SC to the heart and lungs increases the amount of noise arising from physiological sources. The noise has a larger effect on the MR data acquired from the BS and SC than the cortex. Therefore, having a larger source of noise makes it harder to identify the source and separate from the data. The studies presented in this thesis try to tackle this problem. Data for both studies in chapters two and three, were obtained from 16 healthy participants. The study in chapter two used axially acquired images at the level of the periaqueductal gray, the rostral ventro-medial medulla and the sixth cervical SC segment. The study presented in chapter three used sagittal slice images from the thalamus to the T1/T2 vertebral disk spanning 9 sagittal slices centered on the SC.  The results of the study in chapter two identify specific sources of noise and quantify their contribution to the overall signal variance. The largest contributor to the signal variance was bulk motion (19%). Cardiac-related motion accounted for 14% of the signal variance followed by non-specific signal variations detected in white matter (10%), respiratory-related motion (2.6%), and end-tidal CO2 variations (0.7%). Significant left-right connectivity was detected in the dorsal horns and ventral horns of the SC after the noise was removed from the data. The study presented in the chapter three saw extensive connectivity within and across the BS and SC. Resting-state networks were observed between the BS and SC which involved primarily dorsal or ventral SC regions, and included specific anatomical regions within the BS as well. These results demonstrate the presence of resting-state connectivity within the BS and SC and are an important step towards developing rs-fMRI in this region.</description>
