   <description>In 1998, the Chief of Review Services (CRS) assessed the Canadian Forces (CF) had fell short in reaching “full integration,” a goal which the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) gave the Canadian military in 1989. The CRS noted, from interviews of servicewomen, that leaders would say “the right thing,” yet leaders seemed “unaware of problems” and appeared to “condon[e] negative behaviours.” Therefore, in the 1989-1999 phase of gender integration, leaders did not express a commitment to gender integration in word and conduct. In fact, in the CF culture of leadership during the 1990s, inaction, breach of discipline, ambivalent attitudes, and deceit were common practices. This thesis explores how a toxic leadership culture rife in the Canadian military during the 1990s (also known as the “decade of darkness”) contributed to the shortcomings of gender integration, in that it let the development of a climate antagonistic to women that infiltrated all ranks of the CF, and affected the behaviours of subordinates and peers, both male and female.</description>

   <description>Undesirable host responses to implants commonly lead to impaired device function. Biomaterial-based strategies focused on neutrophil behavior to improve host responses to implants have not been significantly researched. As the first immune cell to respond to inflammation, neutrophil activation resulting in the release of antimicrobials and neutrophil extracellular traps primes this microenvironment for macrophages and other infiltrating cells. Methacrylic acid (MAA) and methyl methacrylate (MM) based polymers modulate healing responses through altered macrophage behavior and vascularization. This project investigates the neutrophil response to MAA and MM copolymerized with isodecyl acrylate (IDA) (MAAcoIDA and MMcoIDA) and hexamethylenediamine-functionalized MMcoIDA coatings (HMD-MMcoIDA). &#xd;
In this research, MAAcoIDA and MMcoIDA were coated onto glass coverslips and MMcoIDA. MAAcoIDA coatings had 4975 ± 580 nmol/cm2 of carboxyl groups at the surfaces while MMcoIDA was further functionalized to add 58 ± 18 nmol/cm2 of amine groups to the surfaces via aminolysis with HMD. The HL60 cell line and murine bone marrow derived neutrophils (BMDN) were then incubated with the coatings to study neutrophil-material interactions. HL60 gene expression and viability were assessed to determine inflammatory and anti-inflammatory characteristics induced by the different surface chemistries. NETosis, indicated by citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), elicited by the coatings was visualized for both HL60 cells and murine BMDN, and protein synthesis was additionally quantified for BMDN. &#xd;
HL60 cells demonstrated increased viability when incubated with MAAcoIDA relative to MMcoIDA. HL60 viability on HMD-MMcoIDA decreased after 48 hours, coinciding with increased citH3. HL60 cells exhibited increased expression of ICAM-1 and TNF-α when incubated on aminated coatings compared to those with MMcoIDA or MAAcoIDA after 48 hours.&#xd;
Murine BMDN displayed lower ratios of viable cells on the coatings than uncoated glass, and cells with MAAcoIDA coatings underwent less histone citrullination while HMD-MMcoIDA elicited increased histone citrullination, relative to MMcoIDA. BMDN secreted varied concentrations of MIP-1α and MIP-2 in response to coatings with no added stimulus after 2 hours and increased over 16 hours, although no significant differences were noted between surface chemistries. Future work looks to characterize these coatings and examine protein-material interactions, as well as follow up studies with these materials in vivo.</description>

   <description>Application-specific parsing can be used to extract application data presented in a format that is customized to a particular application.  Effective parsing of application data found in network traffic sets a solid ground to develop application-level traffic analysis software. An example application of application-level traffic analysis software is an intrusion detection system that works at the application-level.  In this thesis, we  present  our  work  on  message  categorization  and  targeted parsing  of  text-based network  protocol  messages.   We  categorize  protocol  messages  into  types  and  parse each message with a parser targeted for that type of messages.  We created a parser specification  language  to  automatically generate  custom  parsers.   The  specification language is used to define the types of protocol messages, names of the grammars to be used for parsing, application data parts of a message and functions to be applied on  the  parsed  data.   We  use  the  parser  generation  framework  ANTLR  to  generate parsers for our system.  We tested our parser approach on network traffic generated by four different applications running over text-based protocols.  Our parser was able to parse any application data found in the network traffic.  We created a Constraint Engine to demonstrate how our parsing system can be used to validate application-level constraints on network traffic.</description>

   <description>This dissertation gives an overview of imperial reform as one of many responses to late colonial rule which existed alongside and in conversation with anticolonialism. I argue that the argument for imperial reform in India sought to institutionalize Indian settler citizenship within white settler citizenship. I delve into the importance of the interwar period as one in which Indian “nationalism” stood for many different possibilities for engagement with the struggle against imperial hegemony, including both reform and anticolonial nationalism, among others. Indian liberals put forward the case for imperial reform during meetings of the British Commonwealth in the aftermath of the First World War. They tried to act as brokers between the Government of India, Indians overseas, white settlers, and Indian public opinion in order to facilitate programs for imperial reform which they negotiated for at meetings of the British Commonwealth. The history of imperial reform was entangled with that of Indian subimperialism. Imperial reform was an argument that fell in and out of favour within a global network of concern for Indians overseas. The Indian Reciprocity Act marked Indian liberals’ disillusionment with the possibility of empire as the framework upon which Indian inclusion within a global system of liberal states could rest. This dissertation challenges the teleologies of postcolonial nationalist histories which assume the inevitability of anticolonial nationalism and the postcolonial nation-state as the exclusive responses to imperialism. The history of Indian liberal politics during the interwar years only becomes possible when the container of contemporary South Asia’s borders are set aside as units of analysis. Understanding responses to imperialism and critiques of empire outside of anticolonialism is only possible when the artificial barrier separating the histories of the global Indian diaspora and the Indian subcontinent during the interwar years are collapsed.</description>

   <description>Braille is crucial for social and economic opportunity and has been linked to higher rates of employment, education, financial self-sufficiency, and self-esteem. Braille literacy is decreasing, and the National Federation of the Blind has declared a braille literacy crisis. One area of the world particularly impacted by braille illiteracy is the Philippines. In 2016, Digital Learning for Development and All Children Reading released a “Grand Challenge for Development” that challenged researchers to address the need for assistive technologies to help children with sensory disabilities learn to read in the Philippines.&#xd;
The work of this thesis aimed to address the need for a device that helps children in the Philippines learn to read braille. A comprehensive set of ideal design criteria for a device for braille literacy education in the Philippines was developed. A parallel, iterative, and co-design process was undertaken to develop a prototypical device, BrailleBunny. The extent to which the device fulfilled the design criteria developed, and directions for future development were determined through a series of case studies with end-users.&#xd;
The results of this thesis highlight that a device for braille literacy education in the Philippines should promote transferable braille literacy skills including writing with a slate and stylus, provide real time auditory and tactile feedback, be accessible, durable and reliable, safe, easily and independently operable, and enable co-play and cooperative learning. To entice students to use the device, it should be engaging, motivational, and portable. The device achieved all criteria with the exception of being accessible, durable and reliable, and enabling co- play or cooperative learning. Directions for future development to further meet all criteria are presented.&#xd;
The design criteria developed, and suggestions for improvement provide important insight for designers developing devices for braille literacy education.</description>

   <description>Cyanobacterial blooms can produce toxins which can be fatal to organisms, including humans. Biomanipulation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) aims to proactively prevent their formation by maintaining continuous foraging pressure on cyanobacterial populations by increasing the number of some selected foraging organisms in the affected water body. Previous successful cases are limited to small scale operations, and organisms have included only herbivorous fish and zooplankton. Freshwater gastropods are diverse and abundant, and can be used in biomanipulation because they are easily collected and transported. Specifically, the freshwater snail species Viviparus georgianus has demonstrated filter-feeding characteristics and can live at high densities in eutrophic lakes. The aim of this thesis is to assess the potential use of this snail species as a potential means for biomanipulation of the cyanobacterial species Microcystis aeruginosa. We assessed this by using chlorophyll a (chl-a) as a measure for cyanobacteria in the upper and lower water columns of an ex-situ microcosm experimental system with and without the presence of snails, over an approximate 9-day time period. Our results demonstrated that in a clearwater system, the snails were unable to reduce the amount of chl-a present by ingestion. However, with the addition of silt and clay at varying turbidity levels, greater elimination of chl-a by snail ingestion was observed. Specifically, the addition of clay provided the most promising results. Overall, it was concluded that V. georgianus is able to eliminate Microcystis cells through ingestion, under specific conditions. Therefore, the application of this potential CHABs control method would have to be used in combination with the addition of sediment (silt or clay), or in a habitat that already has the minimal required amount of sediment present for successful results.</description>

   <description>Molybdenum disulfide, a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), has a direct band gap of 1.89 eV when thinned down to a single molecular layer. Exciton recombination pathways and lifetimes have been previously studied, but a consensus has not yet been reached on the physical origins of the reported lifetimes, which range from 2 ps to 10 ns.&#xd;
&#xd;
We study the excitonic properties of a particular TMD, MoS2. We conduct photoluminescence experiments to characterize the number of layers in our samples, and understand their exciton recombination pathways. We observe PL that is non-linearly dependent on pump fluence, which we attribute to exciton-exciton annihilations. We use a technique that is novel to single layer TMDs, femtosecond excitation correlation spectroscopy (FEC), which exploits the non-linear pump-power dependence. With FEC, we extract exciton-exciton annihilation rates in the high exciton density regime, and a decay rate for lower density regimes. We obtain a low density decay rate of Γ = 0.18 ± 0:02 1/ps, and an exciton-exciton annihilation rate of Γₙₗ = 2.4 ± 0.4 nm²/ps.</description>

   <description>Recent climate warming and changing precipitation patterns have both thermally and physically disturbed permafrost watersheds across much of the Arctic, increasing the mobility of dissolved and particulate material from terrestrial to aquatic environments. The overarching objective of this research was to determine the spatial and temporal scale of the impact permafrost disturbances, both thermal and physical, have on all of the major components of fluvial material fluxes. This research significantly expanded on long-term field observations (2003- 2017) at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) in the Canadian High Arctic (~75 ºN). &#xd;
&#xd;
Thermal disturbance (deep active layer thaw) significantly alters the export of dissolved ions at all spatial scales observed and fluxes remain elevated after a decade of observation, post-disturbance. Localized physical disturbances (active layer detachments: ALDs) were shown to change fluvial systems from dissolved to particulate dominated export in small, headwater-slope streams. Particulate fluxes respond immediately to and recover rapidly from localized ALDs, but remain elevated ten-years post physical-disturbance. Despite increased particulate erosion from small, headwater-slope streams, localized ALDs have not increased the downstream, watershed-scale flux of particulate material beyond an immediate, short-lived pulse at the outlet of both watersheds. This indicates that the impact of localized ALDs on particulate material fluxes does not spatially scale-up to the larger watersheds at the CBAWO, which is largely explained by: (1) the propensity toward net in-channel and extra-channel sediment storage along the main drainage network, (2) changing hydrometeorological conditions, and (3) limited contemporary fluvial energy to mobilize additional sediment in this setting. &#xd;
&#xd;
This research has substantially advanced our understanding of how different types of permafrost disturbance alter the composition and magnitudes of fluvial fluxes in discernible ways that improve our understanding of changes to circum-Arctic environments. This thesis provides essential constraints on the temporal persistence of the impact of differing permafrost disturbances on fluvial systems. Results from this thesis will help inform coupled climate-terrestrial models and will help to spatially-scale the impact of permafrost changes on fluvial systems across the circum-Arctic.</description>

   <title>Biosynthesis of Fluorinated Natural Product Nucleocidin</title>
   <creator>Sequeira, Suhaylah</creator>
   <contributor>Zechel, David</contributor>
   <subject>Fluorinated Natural Product</subject>
   <description>Nucleocidin is a fluorinated adenosine analogue produced by Streptomyces calvus. It is one of only six known fluorinated natural products. The 4’-fluorine substituent on nucleocidin requires a unique two-step fluorination mechanism: C-H bond cleavage followed by stereospecific glycosylation of the fluoride ion. Although the gene cluster encoding for nucleocidin has been predicted, the fluorinase gene remains unknown. The biosynthetic gene cluster of nucleocidin has been successfully cloned into a phage P1 artificial chromosome library of the S. calvus genomic DNA, yielding six clones containing the predicted gene cluster. In this thesis, the plasmids containing the nucleocidin gene cluster and large flanking genomic sequences have been introduced into Streptomyces albus and Streptomyces lividans 1326 for the purpose of heterologous expression of nucleocidin. Identification of which clones possess the ability to produce nucleocidin coupled with genomic insert sequencing data has allowed the location of the fluorinase gene to be narrowed down to a ~35 kbp region of the Streptomyces calvus genome. On a second front, an amidinotransferase enzyme encoded by the nucN gene within the predicted nucleocidin gene cluster has been successfully purified, and an initial assessment of its function within the biosynthetic pathway has been conducted.</description>

   <title>Analysis of Relaxed User Orthogonality for Wireless Multi-user MIMO Downlink Transmission</title>

   <description>Efficient resource allocation at the physical layer of wireless communication systems is closely linked to performance. Time and space are examples of such resources. In a densely-deployed multi-antenna, multi-user wireless downlink, finding a low-interference group of spatially distributed users in conjunction with spatial-domain multiple access beamforming represent techniques for efficient use of spatial resources. However, in practice, finding a perfectly orthogonal interference-free group of users to receive concurrent service is unlikely, thus wasting the transmission period or temporal resource. In this work, we set out to analyze the allocation of competing spatial and temporal resources in the context of the wireless downlink. The intention of this analysis is to investigate the orthogonality criteria that underpin many practical user selection algorithms. Deeper understanding of such criteria has potential for designing improved interference-mitigating algorithms in this sense, and in other related scenarios. A relaxed definition of orthogonality between users in group is investigated for practical amplitude and quadrature modulation schemes. Motivated by widely-linear processing techniques, new relaxed user orthogonality on the complex hyper-sphere illustrates temporal benefits and trade-offs associated with various system parameters. Beamforming and user selection are analyzed jointly for key scenarios of interest to gain insights into the interaction between these spatial resource management techniques. System throughput and reliability performance analysis is also developed, and applied to these scenarios to gain further insights.</description>

   <title>Development and Feasibility Trial of a Cognitive Behavioural Self-Management Program for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>

   <description>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic illness marked by inflammation of the digestive system that is associated with physical and psychosocial symptoms. Psychotherapy interventions for IBD have yielded inconsistent results that could be contributed to by clinical and methodological limitations. Specifically, most studies did not include pre-screening for study inclusion, protocols were either not developed or not sufficiently described, and Randomized-Controlled Trial (RCT) designs were not implemented in many studies.&#xd;
The primary aim of this dissertation was to develop an empirically supported psychotherapy intervention for IBD. Several objectives were completed to facilitate program development. First, mediators of the relationship between pain and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) were examined using cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models to identify intervention targets. In a cross-sectional mediation model, pain catastrophizing and illness-focused coping mediated the relationship between pain and HRQoL. In longitudinal models with pain at time 1, pain catastrophizing and illness-focused coping at time 2, and HRQoL at time 3, parallel mediation was not evident. However, there was a serial mediation effect. Pain predicted future pain catastrophizing, which predicted contemporaneous illness-focused coping, which then predicted future HRQoL. This suggests the importance of targeting these constructs during therapy in order to create long-term improvements in HRQoL. &#xd;
The second objective was to develop a research-informed therapy program. This resulted in the selection of a CBT orientation, a group self-management modality, and a manualized protocol. In addition, pre-screening for anxiety, depression and HRQoL was implemented to ensure study participants had psychosocial symptoms of adequate severity to require psychotherapy. The third objective was to examine the usefulness and applicability of the program using with an advisory panel. IBD patients provided feedback on the therapy program and several changes were implemented based on suggestions that were consistent with the research literature. &#xd;
The final objective was to conduct a feasibility trial of the program. Results indicated the program was effective for improving anxiety, depression, generalized catastrophizing, stigmatization, and shame. Long-term improvements at 3-months and 6-months post-therapy were evident for systemic HRQoL and a composite measure of anxiety and depression. The results led to considerations for future studies.</description>

   <description>The Streptomyces are a genus of soil-dwelling Gram-positive bacteria that produce a variety of secondary metabolites; they have even been dubbed as ‘antibiotic factories’ as a typical genome can contain as many as 30 clusters of genes responsible for biosynthesis of metabolites.  Yet many of these compounds are not observed in laboratory cultures suggesting the products are locked by regulatory signals.  One unique regulatory mechanism present in these organisms, the bldA gene, depends on the translation TTA codons within the genome.  These codons are quite rare but are frequently found in other regulatory regions and in regions responsible for the biosynthesis of natural products. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis applies mass spectrometry to explore changes in the whole proteome of Streptomyces calvus in response to the bldA gene.  S. calvus pTESa-bldA can undergo morphological differentiation and produces different secondary metabolites than the native strain.  Hypothesized to be due to the action of a TTA codon containing pleotropic regulator AdpA, we observed that AdpA is expressed in the wild type at the protein level.  Additionally, there was an increase in expression of other regulatory systems in reaction to bldA including the two-component system regulators controlling the phosphate management system and MtrAB system known to control cell division.  Both systems have been previously demonstrated to have an impact on secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation.&#xd;
&#xd;
Furthermore, a combination of bioinformatics and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to identify and guide purification of two natural products from Streptomyces curacoi in response to bldA.  A non-ribosomal peptide, curacomycin, and a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide, curacozole, both were isolated and characterized from S. curacoi pTESa-bldA.  Curacozole was produced with a high titre, 42 mg/L, that allowed for extensive antibacterial testing where it was found to be highly active against antibiotic resistant Gram-positive bacteria.  Lastly, custom electrospray emitters were fabricated with significant signal enhancement to aid mass spectrometric investigations of these biological systems.</description>

   <description>As the game of power politics plays on, scholars have another chance to identify other early warning indicators of a seismic shift. In this dissertation, I offer a soft power mechanism that helps us understand the process of how great power rivalry leads to systemic change, which I call normative balancing. Normative balancing is when states align with a competitor vis-à-vis its norms. Alignment happens when a state voluntarily agrees with the norms of another state or complies with those norms. The argument rests on three core claims. One, competing great powers endorse different norms. Two, secondary states align with the norms of one competitor and balance against another. And three, secondary state alignment increases a competitor’s soft power at the other competitor’s expense. To test my argument, I turn to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC): a microcosm of global politics and great power competition. In terms of data collection, I coded all vetoed draft resolutions and meeting records between 1961 and 2018, inclusive, and all non-unanimously passed and failed draft resolutions and meeting records between 1994 and 2018, inclusive, which sums to 546 primary source documents. My data reveals some interesting trends. China and the US (United States) endorse different UN norms at different times, much like the US and the Soviet Union (USSR) did during the Cold War. Through the endorsement of different norms, great powers identify themselves as alternatives. My analysis also reveals that secondary states use normative balancing in response to great power rivalry as a way to contribute to the systemic outcome of the competition. In the lead up to the end of the Cold War, Council member-states aligned with the US and engaged in normative balancing against the USSR. Since the turn of the millennium but most notably over the past five years, alignment with China has increased substantially. Following from that, I find that such alignment is giving way to a more equal distribution of power between China and the US in the context of the UNSC. In sum, this dissertation highlights the role of soft power in the system’s balance of power, the ability of secondary states to impact the structure of the system, and the possibility of a new leader to operate under an existing world order.</description>

   <description>This project aims at examining some of the core themes and concerns of Solarpunk, a newly emerging genre. Placing Solarpunk in contrast to one of its nearest literary predecessors, Cyberpunk, I work to unify the disparate definitions of the Solarpunk genre, while examining the ways in which it departs from its Cyberpunk roots while retaining a radical critical mode. By mapping and defining some of Solarpunk’s primary concerns in this way, this project aims to set the groundwork for additional critical work on the Solarpunk genre, providing a foundation from which other scholars may work.&#xd;
Throughout the thesis I work primarily with the four English language Solarpunk anthologies, Solarpunk: Ecological and Fantastical Stories in a Sustainable World, Wings of Renewal: A Solarpunk Dragons Anthology, Sunvault: Stories of Solarpunk and Eco-Speculation, and Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Summers.&#xd;
In Chapter One, I examine the interrelationship of social ecology, technological progress, and social progress with questions of community and society, in order to demonstrate the ways in which Solarpunk promotes its ideal, social ecology inspired future.&#xd;
In Chapter Two, I build on the generic interest in progress in order to examine Solarpunk’s optimistic treatment of the posthuman in relation to questions of physiological and capitalist consumption, and fears over the loss of humanity.</description>

   <title>The Dynamics of Quantum States of Light in Lossy Coupled-Cavity Systems</title>

   <description>Nonclassical states of light possess unique properties such as squeezing, antibunching, and entanglement,  which have led to various interesting applications in quantum computing, quantum teleportation, and quantum information. However, practical implementation of some of these potential applications are hindered due to our lack of insight into how to treat loss in the system. The inclusion of loss is very important, as it can in some cases largely destroy the nonclassical properties of the light. &#xd;
The focus of this thesis is on squeezed states, as these are one of the most useful and important quantum states of light. First, I present a theoretical treatment of the nonclassical properties of squeezed states generated via parametric down conversion in a leaky cavity. By solving the Lindblad master equation for such a system, I analytically demonstrate that the exact time dependent solution is a squeezed thermal state. In addition, I examine the dynamics of generated nonclassical states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems. I then apply the formalism developed to a coupled resonator optical waveguide structure and present the results for squeezed vacuum states. I next examine the coupled-cavity optical waveguide system as a platform to produce counterpropagating continuous variable entangled states. Using a tight-binding approximation, I develop analytic time-dependent expressions for the number of photons in each cavity, as well as for the correlation variance between the photons in different pairs of cavities. These expressions can be used to engineer the pumping configurations as well as the physical properties of the structure. Finally, employing a numerical singular value decomposition method, I show how the biphoton wave function can be Schmidt decomposed numerically, which together with the previously-developed analytic expressions provides a powerful computational platform. This is important as it can not only be used to check the validity of the approximations made in obtaining analytic expressions but can also be used to explore some interesting cases that were not possible to treat analytically.</description>

   <title>A Smart Agent Framework for Personalized Service Composition</title>

   <description>End-users face a massive amount of services when selecting and composing the desired services to meet their personal preferences. For example, people frequently use the Internet to perform on-line activities (e.g., on-line shopping and banking) and control their IoT devices (e.g., turning off home light). The ever increasing amounts of services available could be overwhelming to end-users. To relieve end-users' cognitive overloading when performing on-line activities, agents can be designed and developed to act autonomously on end-users' behalf.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, the autonomous and cooperative natures of agents make it complex to design and implement by developers.&#xd;
General speaking, developers face the following challenges to adopt agents for service composition: 1) difficult to program agents; 2) lack of domain knowledge to identify necessary tasks for composite services; and 3) lack of a standard interface to integrate various services (e.g., IoT devices) with web services by agents.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we present a smart agent framework that facilitates the design and implementation of agents for service composition. More specifically, our approach consists of 5 aspects: 1) we propose an easy-to-understand semi-natural language syntax that allows developers to specify the functionalities of agents; 2) we use natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify service related tasks from on-line sources, e.g., on-line how-to instructions; 3) we propose an approach to transform functionalities of IoT devices to web services using the standard web service infrastructure; 4) we propose a deep learning based model (i.e., DeepCont) to predict end-users' ratings on services, using user reviews and service descriptions; and 5) we use a ranking algorithm (i.e., RankBoost) to automatically learn user preferences from the service usage history, and integrate the learned user preferences to recommend a collection of services for end-users. A series of case studies demonstrate that our approaches are effective to develop agents and recommend personalized services for end-users. Our approaches relieve the required efforts from developers to design agents for personalized service composition.</description>

   <description>Sexual violence is an over-arching term describing sexual acts where consent is not freely given. Registered nurses employed as Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) provide care to help address the medical and legal needs of victims/survivors of sexual violence. Trauma-informed care (TIC) is an organizational approach recommended in the care of individuals who have experienced trauma, however, little is known about how SANEs use TIC in their practice. The purpose of this study was to understand how SANEs incorporate trauma-informed approaches in the care of adult and post-pubescent adolescent victims/survivors of sexual violence in Ontario, Canada. &#xd;
The research question was addressed with a qualitative interpretive description approach. Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners employed in Ontario were purposively recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Eight consenting participants completed interviews, which were recorded using online teleconferencing. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative data analysis as outlined by Miles, Huberman, and Saldana. The methods of enhancing the trustworthiness of the research included, for example, member checking and verbatim transcriptions, reflexivity activities, and frequent peer debriefing.&#xd;
Six main themes emerged: (1) the importance of understanding the patient’s experience; (2) personalized connection: developing a safe nurse-patient relationship; (3) choice: the framework of how we do things; (4) re-building strengths and skills to support healing and post-traumatic growth; 5) a wonderful way to practise: facilitators and benefits of trauma-informed practice; and (6) challenges to trauma-informed practice. The main themes were expanded into sixteen sub-themes.  &#xd;
Overall, the findings help our understanding of how the principles of TIC are incorporated into the practise of a sample of SANEs. From the findings, four summary key points are discussed: (1) valuing trauma-informed care; (2) choice as a paramount priority; (3) the need for education and continuing competence; and (4) the realities and vicarious trauma. The results of this research indicate the need for support of providers who deliver TIC, and for education about TIC beginning in undergraduate curriculums. More research about this topic is warranted to strengthen the evidence base for trauma-informed practice in SANE programs and across health care settings.</description>

   <title>Reading Beyond Irony: Exploring the Post-secular “End” of Postmodernism in David Foster Wallace</title>
   <creator>Minifie, Shannon</creator>
   <contributor>Wallace, Molly</contributor>
   <subject>David Foster Wallace</subject>
   <description>David Foster Wallace’s self-described attempt to move past the “ends” of postmodernism has&#xd;
made for much scholarly fodder, but the criticism that has resulted focuses on Wallace’s&#xd;
supposed attempts to eschew irony while neglecting what else is at stake in thinking past these&#xd;
“ends.” Looking at various texts across his oeuvre, I think about Wallace’s way “past”&#xd;
postmodern irony through his engagement with what has come to be variously known as the&#xd;
“postsecular.” Putting some of his work in conversation with postsecular thought and criticism,&#xd;
then, I aim to provide a new context for thinking about the nature of Wallace’s relationship to&#xd;
religion as well as to late postmodernism. My work builds on that of critics like John McClure,&#xd;
who have challenged the established secular theoretical frameworks for postmodernism, and&#xd;
argue that such post-secular interventions provide paradigmatic examples of the relationship&#xd;
between postmodernism and post-secularism, where the latter, as an evolution or perhaps a&#xd;
mutation of the former, signals postmodernism’s lateness—or at least its decline as a culturalhistorical&#xd;
dominant. I also follow other Wallace critics in noting his spiritual and religious&#xd;
preoccupations, building on some of the great work that has already been done to explore his&#xd;
religious and post-secular leanings. Noting similarities between the post-secular perspective,&#xd;
which admits that the role of religion in the postmodern (and beyond) must be reconsidered, and&#xd;
a key function of irony, which is to create an ambiguous space of reflection and complexity, I&#xd;
show that irony in Wallace’s work is a strategy not necessarily to undermine in order to ridicule&#xd;
the spiritual or religious ideas his characters represent in these texts; but rather, because irony is&#xd;
not only a dissembling tool but also a way of destabilizing meaning in the text, it serves to create&#xd;
a constructive tension which opens up a tenuous middle position that ironists and post-secularists&#xd;
always inhabit.</description>

   <description>Organic Thin-Film Transistors are carbon-based semiconductor devices. Their simple fabrication makes them an ideal candidate for disposable, wearable technologies; an implementation being aptamer-based biosensors. This project produces organic semiconductor aptamer-based biosensors for quantifying biomolecules in synthetic samples mimicking bio-fluids.&#xd;
There are two main effects in a field effect transistor; capacitance and resistance. The semiconductor between the source-drain electrodes is a transient resistor. Capacitance is created by voltage differences across the gate dielectric insulator. Charge buildup at the semiconductor-insulator interface induces a conducting channel through the semiconductor. Channel current can be increased by modulating the source-gate voltage until the current saturation point is reached. The transconductance, ratio of voltage to current change, is device-specific and based on resistance and capacitance.&#xd;
Electrolyte media incorporated within the OFET framework as part of the gate dielectric permits label-free analyte sensing. The liquid-sample/solid-dielectric interface has an electric double layer capacitive effect that alters with biomolecule concentration change, causing the OFETs to experience transconductance change. &#xd;
These sensor devices were fabricated using simple, low-temperature processes. The semiconductor and dielectric stacks were spun on the source-drain electrodes to form the bottom surface, and the top gate was an in-house designed conductive polymer bilayer with a thin PMMA layer then functionalized with aptamers, DNA oligomers that specifically interact with a certain biomolecule. This produces label-free sensors with highly correlated current modulation due to changes in device transconductance.&#xd;
The characterized devices were used to create current vs concentration curves for biomolecule solutions of known concentration. The generated response curves were used to directly correlate device output current to biomolecule concentration. &#xd;
The extensive material and processing optimization work conducted in the thesis yielded several performance outcomes comparable to high fabrication requirement OFETS, such as charge mobilities of ~ 0.1 – 0.2 cm2/V-s. The OFET on/off ratios is 1.3x104. The OEGFET device detects 1-2 orders of magnitude change in dosage with a limit of detection of 0.01 µM. An OFET device optimized with a novel dielectric stack demonstrated significant improvements in operating parameters and shelf life.</description>

   <title>On an Emerging Paradigm of Tepid Stars: Assessing the Magnetic Desert and the Magnetic Origin of Surprisingly Common Star Spots</title>

   <description>The past decade has seen several significant shifts in the field of stellar magnetism, particularly on the observational front. A new generation of dramatically more efficient, high-resolution spectropolarimetric instruments have enabled measurements of magnetic fields hosted by intermediate mass stars to be obtained with unprecedented precision. Moreover, the Kepler and TESS spacecraft have yielded optical light curves that are sensitive to flux variations on the order of parts per million. Both of these advancements have facilitated potentially paradigm shifting discoveries including (1) the emerging picture of a "magnetic dichotomy" in which the magnetic fields hosted by a small fraction of intermediate mass stars are either very prominent (B > 200 G) or ultra-weak (B &lt; 1 G); and (2) that a large fraction of these tepid stars may not be as quiescent as previously believed, as demonstrated by the surprising detection of variability that is consistent with rotational modulation, which is interpreted to be a consequence of magnetic activity. In this thesis, I will present the results obtained from three related studies that have expanded upon these recent discoveries. The first study was designed to test the validity of the magnetic dichotomy and elaborate on properties of the "strong field" population of stars by carrying out a volume-limited survey of magnetic intermediate mass stars within 100 pc. The second study focuses on the unexpected result obtained using Kepler -- the widespread detection of rotationally modulated light curves of A- and B-type stars -- which suggests that a much larger fraction of intermediate mass stars than has previously been believed may be magnetic. The third study consists of a search for A-type stars that exhibit similar rotational modulation in their light curves obtained with the recently launched TESS spacecraft.</description>

   <description>In August 1576 five men serving the Elizabethan explorer Martin Frobisher disappeared following an Inuk guide at Baffin Island. Over the next two years the English tried various methods of communication with the Inuit – including miming, drawing, writing and kidnapping “interpreters” – but were unable to recover their lost men or even learn their fate. During this frustrating period English-Inuit relations deteriorated steadily from friendliness to bloodshed. Frobisher’s experiences with the South Baffin Inuit illustrate how limited communication could be between European explorers and Indigenous peoples during early contact and offer a unique glimpse at the mechanics of how this nonverbal communication functioned. &#xd;
&#xd;
Despite its centrality to understanding early contact, studies specifically focused on the initial experiments with nonverbal communication are rare. Many historians gloss over the subject, assuming miming occurred and that little can be discerned about this process. However, a close reading of certain explorer narratives reveals descriptions of how these makeshift exchanges took place. These texts also indicate the types of assumptions made by communicators when creating and interpreting messages and the preconceived notions that produced such assumptions. This dissertation examines communication in three English ventures in sixteenth century Northeastern America: The Frobisher Encounters with the South Baffin Inuit (1576-8), The Davis Encounters with the Greenland Inuit (1585-7) and the Roanoke Encounters with the Carolina Algonquin (1584-7). This study will serve as a point of departure for researchers to consider the uncertainties surrounding early communication and the implications this has for both methodological approaches and traditional historiographical interpretations.</description>

   <description>Model-driven Development (MDD) is a software development approach that advocates using models rather than source code. MDD can decrease complexity by raising the level of abstraction, and increase productivity by automation, e.g., code generation. &#xd;
Developers spend around 50% of their time on debugging and fixing bugs, and the cost of debugging, testing, and verification account for almost 50-75% of the software development budget. Existing MDD tools do not provide proper support for the debugging of models. Thus, developers often debug the generated source code in order to debug their models, which contradicts MDD principles, as many of the benefits of the abstraction are lost. This thesis introduces a novel approach to platform-independent model-level debugging, with the help of model transformation that equips the model with support for debugging services. The approach does not rely on program debuggers, and any changes to, e.g., the code generator or the hardware platform, leave the debugger unaffected. Based on the approach, a model-level debugger MDebugger is created that allows the debugging of UML-RT models. &#xd;
The typically iterative and incremental nature of software development implies that many development artifacts are incomplete until later stages of development. None of the model-level debuggers, including MDebugger, allows the debugging of incomplete (i.e., partial) models, because the model execution techniques (interpretation and code generation) cannot execute partial models. This often prevents useful analyses that would allow the detection of design flaws and bugs early in the development process, when they are easiest to fix. We propose a conceptual framework to execute partial models. Based on the framework, an execution engine of partial models (PMExec) is developed that allows the debugging and execution of partial UML-RT models at any stage of the software development process, assuming that the structural models are defined and proper input is provided. &#xd;
Finally, to keep pace with program debugging services, and optimize the PMExec and MDebugger we introduce a new approach for live modeling that allows the updating of model elements during the execution.</description>

   <title>Investigating the Role of Camp-Signaling in the Regulation of Angiogenic Sprouting</title>
   <creator>Mackeil, Jodi</creator>
   <contributor>Maurice, Donald</contributor>
   <subject>Angiogenesis</subject>
   <description>Angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels from pre-existing vascular structures, can contribute adaptively or mal-adaptively to a myriad of conditions, including ischemic heart disease and cancer. During angiogenic sprouting, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) either function as “tip cells”, which guide blood vessel lumen formation, or proliferative “stalk cells” that lengthen the newly forming vessel. While the molecular mechanisms that govern tip and stalk cell specification are well-established, the systems that regulate individual EC functions during sprouting remain poorly understood. Importantly, the cAMP second messenger system has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis; however, the role of individual cAMP effector proteins, and the involvement of distinct cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms in controlling cAMP effector function during angiogenic sprouting, remain ill-defined. The studies presented in this thesis investigated the ability of the cAMP-signaling to regulate EC functions during angiogenic sprouting, Here, we identify a role for protein kinase A (PKA), but not exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), as an intrinsic, negative regulator of EC sprouting both in vitro and ex vivo. At a cellular level, we demonstrate that constitutive PKA activity regulates EC sprouting by restricting podosome rosette biogenesis, proteolytic breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the invasive capacity of vascular ECs. Upon investigating the molecular mechanisms through which PKA regulates EC sprouting function, we found that PKA reduces the level of active cdc42 by promoting its interaction with the regulatory inhibitor, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα). Given that specificity of cAMP-signaling is achieved when PDEs act to locally control the “pool” of cAMP, which in turn activates a specific cAMP-effector protein, we investigated whether distinct PDEs were responsible for regulating PKA during angiogenic sprouting. We found that reduced expression of PDE3B or inhibition of PDE3 enzyme activity led to a corresponding increase in PKA activity, which markedly impaired EC sprouting. We further demonstrated that PDE3B and PKA interact within perinuclear regions of vascular ECs to regulate downstream cdc42 activity during EC sprouting. Overall, our work identifies a novel PDE3B-PKA signaling complex in vascular ECs and provides mechanistic insight into cAMP-dependent regulation of angiogenic sprouting.</description>

   <title>Reducing Diagnostic Uncertainty in First-Episode Psychosis: A Neuropsychological Approach to Differentiating between Cannabis-Induced and Primary Psychotic Disorders</title>

   <description>Background: Cannabis use is highly comorbid with psychotic disorders, especially among young people experiencing their first episode of psychosis. The high rate of cannabis use in this population has led to uncertainty between diagnoses of cannabis-induced psychosis and primary psychosis, often with cannabis comorbidity (primary psychosis). The similarity of the clinical presentations of these disorders often renders them indistinguishable, creating difficulties in intervention and treatment. Attempts to identify differentiating features have been variable and narrow in scope, with a focus limited to self-report, patient history, and symptoms. Despite the abundance of research identifying cognitive deficits and abnormalities in eye movements and speech as core biological and neurological symptoms of primary psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia), limited research has pursued such biomarkers as potential targets for differentiation in first-episode psychosis. &#xd;
Purpose: The current study aimed to assess individuals diagnosed with either cannabis-induced or primary psychosis using cognitive, visual processing, eye movement, and speech tasks, which are each associated with well-recognized and specific deficits in primary psychotic disorders. &#xd;
Method: Sixteen participants with cannabis-induced psychosis and twelve participants with primary psychosis were recruited in the Kingston, Ontario community. Cognitive performance, backward visual masking, pro- and anti-saccade eye movements, and semantic coherence were assessed for the first time in this population, alongside clinical symptoms, trauma, substance use, premorbid functioning, and illness insight. &#xd;
Results. Relative to individuals with primary psychosis, individuals with cannabis-induced psychosis demonstrated significantly better performance on the pro-saccade task, a faster reaction time on both the pro- and anti-saccade task, more coherent speech, better premorbid adjustment, more cannabis use, and a higher degree of insight into their illness. The use of these variables in a discriminant analysis successfully classified cases with 88.5% accuracy.  The ability to reliably differentiate these disorders is crucial to early intervention and treatment in first-episode psychosis.</description>

   <description>This dissertation is the first comprehensive study to trace the evolution of military dishonour and dismissal from an historical perspective in the Canadian armed forces during the First and Second World Wars. Using extensive general court martial records, archival documentation, and restricted personnel files, this study examines judicial sentences of cashiering and dismissal as well as administrative punishments used to deprive officers of their commissions for misconduct, inefficiency, and incompetence. An officer’s failure to follow the formally and informally enshrined rules and values recognized as honourable in military culture deprived him of the right to respect among peers and the right to command subordinates. As this thesis is concerned with the construction of the concepts of honour and dishonour within the officer corps of the Canadian army and air force, I analyze the complicated social, economic, medical, and cultural consequences of officers’ disgraceful termination from military service. Examining institutional responses to officers’ misconduct offers important insights into the espoused values, beliefs and practices prioritized in both military culture and in the wider society. Derived from a British military heritage the idealized form of martial masculinity was best exemplified by dual identity of a man as an officer and a gentleman. Within the martial justice context, examining the nature of officers’ crimes and misbehavior provides historians with the opportunity to explore the boundaries of acceptable forms of gentlemanliness. Perceptions of what exactly constituted ungentlemanly and scandalous conduct in the military exposed the contradictions that underpinned divergent codes of masculinity. The model officer and gentleman was at once expected to be restrained and dignified while also exhibiting aggressiveness and virility. Misbehaviour whether in the officers’ mess, in public settings before civilians or on the battlefield revealed how the social conventions and commitments fundamental to an officer’s identity often depended on a sense of honourableness that was not nearly as stable as government and military authorities preferred to believe.</description>

   <description>The software development process is steadily evolving into a collaborative, distributed, and knowledge-intensive venture. This evolution has led to growing demands towards supportive technologies and tools. These demands have been addressed using a spectrum of social and communication channels, that are continuously evolving and growing. As a result, a wealth of knowledge has emerged around the intensive use of the social and communication channels, and can potentially be leveraged to benefit the software development process.&#xd;
&#xd;
 In this dissertation, we describe the empirical studies conducted to understand how mining the social knowledge of software systems can improve aspects of the development process. We look into three types of social knowledge: a) the crowdsourced feedback from the end-users, b) the organizational structure of the developers, and c) the developers' wisdom. We investigate the value of monitoring the end-users' feedback posted on non-developer oriented social media platforms, such as Twitter. Our findings demonstrate that the end-users feedback can possibly allow an earlier discovery of the bugs that are critical to a large user base. Next, we look into how the developers self-organize on social coding platforms, such as GitHub. We are able to identify the organizational structures that are associated to better project outcomes, such as faster merge time of code contributions. To learn from the wisdom of the developers, we perform user studies for two purposes. First, we focus on the mechanisms adopted for the informal communication of the developers, specifically the chat-based services. Our investigation highlights the affordances and impacts of such mechanisms, to allow for a more efficient and informed use of the chat-based services. Second, we ask the developers to reflect on their experiences using a set of communication channels. Results from the survey and from an associated quantitative analysis reveal interesting insights to guide the developers in setting up the communication flow of their projects. Overall, the research conducted in this dissertation highlights the value of accounting for the social aspects of the software development process, to improve the efficiency of the tasks and make informed decisions about the communication mechanisms used in the software projects.</description>

   <title>Preparing Elementary Preservice Teachers to Integrate Information and Communications Technology in Teaching and Learning: Exploring the Intended, Enacted, and Experienced Curriculum</title>

   <subject>Elementary Teacher Education</subject>
   <description>The goal of this case study was to understand and identify the supporting factors to prepare elementary preservice teachers to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) in teaching and learning. My interest in examining these factors lies within the context of the intended (what the University and/or Faculty of Education planned to do), enacted (what course instructors did to prepare and deliver their courses), and experienced (what preservice teachers reported that they learned) curriculum. Data were collected from 16 stakeholders associated with a Bachelor of Education program (primary/junior level) at a large Canadian university. Data collection included interviews with three participant groups (university administrators, course instructors, and elementary preservice teachers), researcher observations, and document analysis. The results of the qualitative analysis indicated that four key supporting factors for the integration of ICT in teaching and learning existed: Strategic curriculum, standardized technology, blended learning, and integrated learning. Findings further suggested that TPACK (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) might be envisioned as a prescriptive, rather than just a descriptive model, offering a preliminary look at effective processes to prepare preservice teachers. Finally, the results suggested that three key theoretical models: Ertmer’s (1999) First and Second Order Barriers to Technology Integration, Puentedura’s (2006, 2009) Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR) framework, and Mishra and Koehler’s (2006) TPACK model, might be best used in conjunction with one another to effectively prepare preservice teachers to integrate ICT in teaching and learning. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as limitations associated with this case study are discussed.</description>

   <title>Using Microfluidics to Study Magnetotactic Bacteria</title>

   <subject>MAGNETOTACTIC BACTERIA</subject>
   <description>The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the swimming behavior of magnetotactic bacteria 1) in flow conditions and 2) in porous media; and further 3) to exploit their unique characteristics towards bio-actuation of small droplets. Bacteria are found in every habitable niche on Earth. In their planktonic lifestyle they often inhabit dynamic environments where their motility is influenced by flow and the proximity to different surfaces. Recently, considerable interest has been demonstrated in the use of bacteria to perform complex tasks, such as carrying cargo for targeted drug delivery. &#xd;
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) found in both freshwater and marine environments can orient to, and swim along, the geomagnetic field lines, a behavior called magnetotaxis. While foraging in their native habitats, their ultimate swimming path originates from the competition between magnetotaxis and hydrodynamic influences related to flow and nearby surfaces. MTB have advantages over other bacteria as microbiorobots for controlled transport due to their motility and steerability. However, how MTB interact with complex environments in aquatic environments has remained poorly defined. Therefore, to better exploit the abilities of MTB for in vivo applications, understanding their behavior in relevant environments is crucial.&#xd;
By using microfluidics and microscopy techniques, I have demonstrated in this thesis that magnetotaxis enables directed motion of Magnetospirillum magneticum over long distances in flow conditions relevant to both aquatic environments and biomedical applications. These MTB can overcome higher flow velocities when directed to swim perpendicular to the flow as compared to upstream. In addition, I showed that magnetotaxis enables MTB to migrate effectively through both homogenous and heterogeneous porous micromodels, interacting with obstacles and overcoming tortuous flow fields. These results bring new insight into MTB navigation in environments similar to their natural habitats, and their potential in vivo applications as microbiorobots. Lastly, I have presented a biologically-driven magnetic actuation of droplets on a superhydrophobic surface using MTB. With magnetotaxis for navigation, it is possible to harness MTB to transport microdroplets, thus suggesting their potential for lab-on-a-chip applications.</description>

   <title>Lewis on the Construction of Worlds:  the Metaphysical, Epistemic and Practical Costs of Modal Realism</title>

   <subject>David Lewis</subject>
   <subject>Counterpart Theory</subject>
   <description>This thesis considers the metaphysics and logic of modalities. In the first section, I give a background to modal realism and present Lewis’ motivations for proposing such a view. In the second section, I explain what it means for a theory of modality to be ‘successfully reductive’, why a reduction of modality is important and why Lewis’ view is considered successfully reductive. In the third section, I explain Lewis’ commitments regarding trans-world individuals. In the fourth section, I explain Lewis’ views on impossibility. The final sections will be dedicated to clarifying Lewis’ metaphysical commitments towards the largest domain of possibility and working out their metaphysical, ontological and practical implications. To be clear, this thesis is not intended as a refutation of modal realism. Such a refutation is impossible. Lewis defends modal realism on the grounds of a cost benefit analysis. He believes that the benefits that come with accepting modal realism are enough to justify one’s belief in it. An empirical refutation is impossible because there is no way to verify or falsify the existence of Lewis’ plurality. Every possible world is spatiotemporally isolated from the actual world. Instead of attempting to refute modal realism, this thesis is intended to clarify the fundamental metaphysics of modal realism for the purpose of highlighting the fact that some metaphysical, epistemological and practical costs come with embracing modal realism. The costs I outline are aspects of modal realism that ought to be considered before embracing modal realism.</description>

   <description>A scattering medium is a material in which light does not travel in straight paths. The light travels a certain distance, changes direction, and has a chance of being absorbed by the medium. Three coefficients and a phase function determine the behaviour of light in this medium. The primary contribution of this thesis is an algorithm to determine these material coefficients and phase functions in a heterogeneous medium from a series of measurements. These measurements are the position, direction, and intensity of light exiting the medium, measured for various positions and directions of light entering the medium. Other contributions include a noise analysis for scattering media with multiplexed illumination, an experimental setup to scan photon distributions in a liquid scattering medium, and a distribution-based linear reconstruction approach.</description>

   <title>Geological Controls on Strainbursting in Deep Mining Drifts</title>

   <description>Strainbursts are sudden dynamic failures of rock that pose a serious hazard to mine workers and mine production. The current state of research is limited, and it is not possible to identify when, where, and particulars about how a strainburst occurs. This limits the tools available to engineers for identifying hazardous conditions and designing risk mitigation strategies. The knowledge gap is addressed by identifying strainburst mechanisms based on local geological characteristics and improving the understanding of the underlying rock behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms leading to strainbursting provides leverage for the design of hazard identification and risk mitigation strategies.&#xd;
&#xd;
Two distinct underlying sources of localized instability are identified, with the common theme that local geology causes local instability. First, shear localization on smooth planar discontinuities or plastic shear strain in weak narrow veins, can cause mixed compression – extension loading. Second, the local loading system stiffness (LSS) is softened by shear displacement on discontinuities. The local LSS close to the discontinuities is not a constant and can soften suddenly to trigger time-delayed strainbursting.&#xd;
&#xd;
Nonlinear elasticity is identified as an important factor when investigating brittle rock failure. This behaviour is implemented in FLAC3D using a nonlinear, rotating, transversely isotropic, elastic constitutive model, and shown to differentiate high and low potential for mixed compression – extension strainbursting. Nonlinear elasticity demonstrates that the linear-elastic Kirsch equation overestimates tensile stress around a circular opening in an anisotropic stress field. Linear-elastic fracture propagation models overestimate Mode I crack propagation and underestimate shear stress at the tip of a sliding crack.&#xd;
&#xd;
This model is further applied to continuum plasticity models for brittle rock. In the Damage Initiation Spalling Limit model (DISL), the spalling limit depends on the degree of nonlinearity. As nonlinearity increases, the confinement required to suppress spalling is reduced, reducing potential for brittle failure. The Cohesion Weakening, Friction Strengthening model (CWFS), is updated to include a normal stress dependent Mode II fracture toughness, confinement dependent plastic limits, and time dependence. Nonlinear elasticity also increases friction mobilized during shear failure. These effects improve the realistic prediction of localized brittle rock failure during notch formation around underground excavations.</description>

   <description>We herein developed a synthetic method to access new B, N, B-doped derivatives of [4]helicene in three steps from commercially available starting material. The key synthetic step comprises in an advanced version of a Friedel Crafts Borylation and allows the decoration of the B, B´ positions with various electron withdrawing and electron donating groups in a highly divergent manner. All 7 derivatives were bright luminophores with emission colours ranging from sky blue to yellow and low singlet triplet energy gaps ΔEST between 130 meV and 190 meV. Furthermore, donor substitution enabled a rare temperature turn-on fluorescence which, in combination with the low ΔEST rendered the corresponding compounds as promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).</description>

   <description>The most consumed construction material in the world, concrete, is largely composed of coarse aggregate. Thus, the physical and mechanical properties of aggregates play a significant role in determining the performance of concrete. Nowadays, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is increasingly replacing natural aggregate to reduce the pressure on natural quarries and to minimize the demolition of waste and create resource recovery.  Most research studies have been conducted on the mechanical behaviour of RCA concrete made with full or partial replacement with RCA. However, the shear strength of RCA concrete at or after exposure to high temperature has not been studied extensively. Thus, more knowledge regarding the residual strength after exposure to high temperature will provide important information to assess the capacity of concrete structures after fire exposure. &#xd;
This thesis examines the residual shear strength of concrete made with different types of coarse aggregate after exposure to elevated temperature. In total, 48 initially un-cracked push-off specimens were prepared from six concrete mixes (round river gravel, Kingston red granite, crushed limestone, and RCA concrete with three RCA replacement ratios (30%, 70%, and 100%)). Half of the specimens were tested at ambient temperature (22±2oC) and the remainder were tested after heating to 500oC. In addition to linear potentiometer (LP) measurements for the shear slip and crack width at the middle of the specimen, digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were performed to observe the field level shear displacement. Eighty-eight cylinders were prepared to observe the compressive and splitting tensile strength on the same test regime.  &#xd;
The shear transfer strength of concrete was found to be independent on the type of coarse aggregate for both heated and unheated specimens. RCA concrete has comparable compressive, splitting tensile and shear transfer strength compared to similar concrete made with other types of natural coarse aggregate. The reduction in residual shear transfer strength of the concrete is more severe than the reductions in compression and splitting tensile strength of the concrete. Greater load versus crack width and slip responses were recorded for heated specimens compared to their unheated counterpart specimens.</description>

   <title>Can genomic tools aid conservation of an arctic seabird, the northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis)?</title>

   <description>Human activities and climate change threaten Arctic ecosystems. Population genetics and genomics may help conservationists appropriately manage threatened species both by (1) determining the population genetic structure of a species, so that management can be designed to maximize conservation of genetic variation, and (2) enabling assessment of impacts on breeding populations of mortality during the nonbreeding season in migratory species. The northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) is a seabird that breeds in colonies throughout the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Though not currently considered at risk, several concerns, such as increased levels of toxins and ingested plastics, warrant investigation to aid conservation of northern fulmars. Up to 1% of the global population is killed annually through unintentional capture in commercial fishing activities, and northern fulmar survival appears to be negatively affected by climate change. As northern fulmars are migratory, the impact of these mortality sources on specific colonies is often unknown but may be important to inform management strategies. In this thesis, I use restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to provide 6614 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the genetic structure of the Atlantic northern fulmar, using 127 samples from six breeding colonies, one non-breeding location, and fishing activities in the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait region. I found weak genetic differentiation and suggest that Atlantic northern fulmar populations are genetically connected, experiencing high levels of gene flow. Determining the exact breeding origin of the bycatch birds was difficult due to the lack of differentiation between colonies. However, the birds appear to be from Arctic Canadian colonies, suggesting that the impact of the fisheries is on local colonies, and may be contributing to the 3% annual decline that has been observed at these locations.</description>

   <description>Dark matter remains one of the most intriguing mysteries of modern physics, and has sparked numerous experimental efforts to uncover its particle nature. Direct detection experiments using low threshold detectors in clean, underground environments to look for nuclear recoils have proved to be an effective way to search for particle dark matter. The PICO experiment is one such effort, operating bubble chambers with fluorocarbon targets and offering unique sensitivity to spin dependent dark matter scattering. This thesis describes the motivation behind PICO and then presents a new retroreflector design for PICO-40L, the most recent PICO detector. The new design gives improved optical coverage in the detector with fewer radioactive contaminants than in PICO-60, the previous detector. The physics reach of future detectors is then explored, with particular focus on the sensitivity to coherent neutrino scattering and annual modulations within a dark matter signal. A new neutrino floor is calculated using timing information, and the sensitivity to annual modulations of a dark matter signal in the future PICO-500 detector is quantified.</description>

   <title>Evidence for effects of phoenixin on neurons of the paraventricular nucleus</title>

   <description>The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus has been implicated in autonomic regulation. Through projections to the pituitary gland, median eminence and hindbrain, the PVN plays a role in stress response and other autonomic functions. Recent findings have indicated that both phoenixin (PNX), a peptide involved in such responses, and its receptor, GPR173, are expressed throughout the PVN. PNX is thought to sensitize the pituitary gland to releasing hormones, as well as contribute to regulation of reproductive and stress hormone release. Recently, specific stress-related effects of this peptide in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) have been demonstrated. In this study we investigated the effects of PNX on PVN neuronal activity using in vitro extracellular recordings. Recordings from a total of 824 neurons showed that 16% (n= 130) of these cells were activated by bath administration of PNX, while 14% (n= 117) were inhibited. Remaining cells tested showed no obvious changes in spike frequency. Furthermore, we observed that both these excitatory and inhibitory effects are still observed when recordings are obtained in low-Ca2+/ high-Mg2+ artificial cerebral spinal fluid (to block synaptic release of neurotransmitters and thus synaptic transmission). A total of 187 neurons showed that 5% (n= 7) are excited and 22% (n= 43) are inhibited in the low calcium condition, supporting the conclusion that the effects of PNX on PVN neurons are both direct and indirect as both response types are observed in both conditions. These results implicate PNX in autonomic function, specifically in the central regulation of stress response, fluid and electrolyte balance, food intake, and reproductive function.</description>

   <title>Investigation of Natural Products from Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea and The Expression and Purification of a Serine Protease HtrA Protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</title>

   <description>To mimic the native environment of P. luteoviolacea 2ta16 and to potentially turn on silent gene clusters, including an alterochromide-like cluster, cotton scaffolds were added to the culture media. Modification of culturing conditions such as time, temperature, and culture size, along with the addition of cotton scaffolds, appears to produce significant changes in culture phenotype, and with UPLC-PDA-MS analysis, differences in metabolite production are also observed. Supplementation of the cultures with coumaric acid, a key molecule involved in the biosynthesis of alterochromides, was also investigated. New metabolites with distinctive UV absorbance have been observed, and efforts are ongoing to isolate, purify, and characterize these peaks using HPLC, high-resolution mass spectrometry and NMR analysis. &#xd;
&#xd;
Emerging data has begun to show the bidirectional interactions between the gut, the microbiome, and the brain. Decreased levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) in the gut have been associated with irritable bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. It appears that secretory products of F. prausnitzii act on protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR-4) on gut neurons; PAR-4 activation is anti-nociceptive.&#xd;
Genomic analysis of F. prausnitzii revealed several possible serine proteases encoded in the genome. Two of the encoded serine proteases appear to be the most plausible proteins responsible for the observed anti-nociceptive effects. One serine protease is hypothesized to be membrane-bound, while the other is a high temperature requirement A (HtrA) serine protease. Since previous studies examined the supernatant of commensal bacteria, it was postulated that the serine protease would not be membrane-bound and the HtrA serine protease was investigated. To determine what role the serine protease HtrA might play in the gut, the protein was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli.</description>

   <description>Climate models suggest that temperatures will increase by at least 1.5-2°C by the end of the 21st century due to climate change. Similar patterns were observed during the mid-Holocene when the American prairie region displayed drier conditions while the American northeast was wetter. Published pollen records in northeast Ontario give conflicting perspectives and, it remains poorly understood whether this area was drier or wetter during this period. The overall objective of this dissertation is to better understand paleohydrological variability and change over the Holocene in the Timmins region of Ontario and to investigate the role of groundwater connectivity in how lakes respond to hydroclimatic changes. &#xd;
&#xd;
Based on lake-water geochemistry, Chapter 2 shows that elevation is the main control on lake-water-groundwater interactions at the landscape level and that the water balance in lakes varied between field campaigns with upland lakes showing a greater sensitivity to short-term and seasonal hydroclimatic change as well as to evaporative drawdown. &#xd;
&#xd;
In order to understand how water levels varied over a long-term perspective, sediment cores were retrieved from two adjacent lakes: one located upland and limited to the local groundwater system (Irrigation Lake); and the other positioned at a lower elevation and embedded in a regional aquifer (Charland Lake). Chapters 3 and 4 aim at reconstructing past hydrological conditions using pollen along with carbonate stable isotopes, and sediment elemental chemistry respectively. Both chapters concluded that water levels were lower between 9,500 and 6,500 years Before Present (BP) after which they rose rapidly between 6,500 and 5,200 years BP to reach stable water highstands between 5,200 and 1,600 years BP, after which levels decreased slightly while remaining relatively high from 1,600 years BP to present. This implies that northeast Ontario is synchronous with the American northeast and asynchronous with the American prairie region. However, those changes were less pronounced in Charland Lake, indicating that buffering from groundwater dampens even sustained long-term hydroclimatic change, in comparison to the higher elevation record from Irrigation Lake. This suggests that lakes will respond differentially to future climate change based on their degree of connectedness to the groundwater system.</description>

   <description>This study explores the issue of touch in yoga classes in the context of #MeToo. Presently, there are no ethical standards which guide yoga teachers in “adjusting” or “enhancing” bodies in a yoga class. The use of touch as a teaching method in Modern Postural Yoga (MPY) classes has increasingly been a topic of discussion in the broader yoga community, particularly through the rise of #MeToo. The purpose of this study was to explore how yoga teachers are approaching touch during yoga classes and if yoga teachers have changed their “hands-on” teaching practices in response to #MeToo. I recruited eleven yoga teachers in Kingston, Ontario and divided these teachers into two focus groups and four individual interviews to explore why yoga teachers touch their students, how yoga teachers approach touching students, and what yoga teachers think about the issue of consent in yoga. Five themes emerged from the data: trust, intention, observation, power, and scope of practice. For the teachers in this study, #MeToo was not a factor in their decision to use or not to use touch during a yoga class. This study suggests that yoga teachers do not follow a consistent approach to receiving consent when offering hands-on assists during a yoga class, but that many yoga teachers would like to challenge existing standards in order to enhance teachers’ qualifications and skills in the areas of safe practice, ethical teaching, and student-centered instruction. The results show that a teacher’s decision to touch is informed by their personal intentions related to teaching, their relationship with students, and their careful observation of students’ bodies during a yoga āsana (shape). While some teachers are questioning the use of touch in relation to social context and social movements like #MeToo, this study suggests that yoga teachers may benefit from evaluating their teaching practices (including touch) in relation to broader public movements like #MeToo.</description>

   <description>Leadership research has a long and impressive history in identifying how followers are affected by their leaders’ behaviours. Such research, however, has tended to study one leadership “style” at a time, which does not answer the question of the effects of leader inconsistencies on followers. The study of attitude ambivalence has the potential to meaningfully enhance our understanding of how followers view and react to their leaders. In the current research, I consider how inconsistencies in leaders’ behaviours and attributes influence followers’ attitudes toward their leaders and their own well-being. To do so, I draw on the work stress framework, the attitude literature, implicit leadership theories and empirical evidence.  Results across three studies using different methodologies (experimental and survey), different samples (full-time employees and students) and different operationalizations of leader inconsistency (i.e., leader behaviours and leader attributes) provide support for a conditional indirect effect such that leaders’ inconsistent behaviours and attributes predict an array of follower outcomes through the mediating effect of followers’ subjective ambivalence. In Study 3, leader gender moderated the relationship between leaders’ perceived warmth and competence, and followers’ subjective ambivalence, with the impact of leader inconsistencies being more pronounced for female than male leaders. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</description>

   <subject>Feasibility</subject>
   <description>Background&#xd;
Adults with degenerative spine disease constitute a significant proportion of referrals to Ontario neurosurgeons.  By 2024, the demand is projected to increase by 67%.  Wait times for patients to be seen by a spine surgeon in southeastern Ontario are the longest in the province.  &#xd;
Purpose of Study&#xd;
A three-phase intervention study was designed to determine whether an Advanced Practice Physiotherapist (APP) Spine Triage model was feasible within the context of the Neurosurgical Referral Clinic.&#xd;
Methods&#xd;
Sample. In Phase I and III, three categories of participants were sampled using a consecutive sampling technique: patients scheduled for a spine assessment; healthcare providers who referred patients to the Neurosurgical Referral/APP Spine Triage Clinic; and, Neurosurgical Referral/APP Spine Triage Clinic and hospital stakeholders.   In Phase II, key stakeholders were recruited to participate in the planning and development of the new APP role using a purposive sampling technique.&#xd;
Procedure. Phase I assessed the current Neurosurgical Referral practice using a descriptive observational cross-sectional design.  Phase II used a modified case study design to determine the satisfaction with the APP role development process amongst stakeholders while Phase III utilized a cross-sectional multiple methods study design to determine the acceptability and feasibility of this new role.&#xd;
Instruments. Various quantitative and qualitative tools were used to collect data related to demographic and symptom characteristics, self-perceived pain, function, quality of life, wait times, and stakeholder satisfaction.  &#xd;
Results&#xd;
The APP Spine Triage Service for adults with neck and back pain was feasible within the context of the Neurosurgical practice with higher rates of stakeholder satisfaction and very strong support for the new model of care.  The findings in the current study are in line with existing literature that the APP model provides access to patient-centred care that is timely, informative, coordinated and integrated to better meet the health needs of patients with neck and back pain.&#xd;
Implications &#xd;
The APP model of care will provide early identification of patients for whom non-surgical management has been deemed the most appropriate approach along with education, reassurance, and evidence-based self-management strategies that will be linked to local programs and resources.</description>

   <description>This thesis details the design and functionality of BitDrones, a programmable matter interface (PMI) composed of micro cuboid drones. Each self-levitating BitDrone represented a tangible voxel and possessed four degrees of freedom to position itself in three dimensions and control its orientation about the z-axis. A single BitDrone consisted of a custom designed quadcopter suspended inside a carbon fiber wireframe cube with onboard RGB LEDs for illumination. As a swarm, these drones formed a human-computer interface that could be physically manipulated via manual user input as a Real Reality Interface (RRI). RRIs render interactive digital experiences via the manipulation of physical matter but faced several functional limitations until now. Historically, RRI elements were not self-levitating and could only create structurally stable models, or such elements had self-levitating capabilities but were not tangible and could only create sparse three-dimensional models. The spatial independence, tangibility and self-motility of each BitDrone voxel granted more versatility than previous RRIs, and this versatility enabled BitDrones to meet the functional criteria of a PMI as defined in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) literature. This work presents the evolving design of the BitDrones, the key components of the computational architecture that governed the system, as well as the tangible interactions, tools and controllers designed to use the BitDrones display. Several academic explorations over the development timeline are also presented which were completed as the BitDrones system matured.</description>

   <title>An Exploration of the Victim-Offender Relationship in Sexual Offending: Predicting Severity and the Presence of Violence</title>

   <subject>sexual offending, sexual offender, sex crime, sexual violence, victim-offender relationship, rational choice, deterrence</subject>
   <description>Research indicates that 19% of women and 2% of men will have been raped in their lifetime (The National Center for Victims of Crime 2018). The most recent literature on sexual offenders examines the effectiveness of current sex offender registration and notification laws. However, the bulk of the literature on sexual offending addresses the potential risk factors and predictors associated with the development of sexual offending, with a niche pocket of research exploring the decision-making processes of sex offenders. Only limited research exists with respect to the victim-offender relationship, and no research to date has applied rational choice and deterrence models to the exploration of the victim-offender relationship. Thus, the current study examines 1,758 randomly sampled registered sex offender profiles from the official New York State Sex Offender Registry database in order to determine whether the victim-offender relationship can predict the level of severity and presence of violence in sexual offence cases. While the study yields mixed findings, results open the doors for multiple avenues for future research.</description>

   <description>Constant frequency LLC converters reported in literature guarantees optimal efficiency only at nominal operating conditions and lose zero voltage switching (ZVS) at reduced load and high-end of the input voltage range. Traditional variable frequency LLC resonant converter requires wide switching frequency range and a high quality-factor (Q) of resonant circuit for voltage regulation at light loads. A high Q results in large size of the resonant circuit, increased magnetic losses and high circulating current for a wide range of load and input voltage variations. Low-Q LLC resonant circuits may allow efficient operation of the converters due to low voltage stress across the magnetics and capacitors, but they will lose ZVS operation at light loads. This thesis presents the analysis of low-Q LLC resonant converters and also proposes a new control technique.&#xd;
Frequency domain modeling of the low-Q LLC resonant circuit is not possible without considerably sacrificing the accuracy of the design results. This is because for low-Q LLC resonant circuit, the voltage waveform at the output of the circuit is not defined. An accurate time-domain analysis of the resonant converter is, therefore, required and proposed in this thesis.&#xd;
A novel light-load modulation scheme is proposed for achieving ZVS operation from part-load to extremely light-load conditions at high end of the input voltage range. In the proposed scheme, both duty cycle and switching frequency of the full bridge inverter are varied. A time domain model has been developed and resulting non-linear transcendental equations solved using Newton Raphson method.&#xd;
An experimental prototype of 380V/300W LLC converter operating between input voltage 20-40V, is developed for validating the analysis and performance of the proposed LLC converter. An efficiency improvement of upto 6% is observed for the loads below 10% of the full-load.</description>

   <title>The developmental and functional characterization of glutathione-s-transferase omega 2 (GSTO2) within eutherian spermatozoa</title>
   <creator>Hamilton, Lauren</creator>

   <description>The eutherian sperm head has three main components: the nucleus, acrosome and perinuclear theca (PT). The PT is a dense cytosolic protein layer that lies between the nucleus and acrosome and houses proteins involved in spermiogenesis and fertilization. This thesis identifies two new PT constituents as isoforms of glutathione-s-transferase omega 2 (GSTO2) and characterizes their developmental and functional importance. &#xd;
We demonstrate that GSTO2 localizes to the postacrosomal sheath (PAS) of the PT and adheres to the developmental mechanisms of other PAS constituents, utilizing the microtubular manchette for protein transport during spermiogenesis. The PAS is of high functional significance, as the first region of the sperm head to solubilize after gametic fusion.&#xd;
The early release of GSTO2 from the sperm head and its ability to facilitate glutathione-centered reduction reactions suggests it may function in glutathione-dependent processes of early embryonic development. Past findings demonstrated that the sperm nuclear transition is centered on these reduction reactions but the enzymes involved remain elusive. Therefore, we hypothesized that PT-anchored GSTO2 facilitates the sperm nuclear transition, as ooplasmic constituents are being recruited. Through the use of intracytoplasmic sperm injections coupled with enzymatic inhibition, we have shown that blocking GSTO2’s functionality causes a delay in sperm nuclear decondensation in the mouse fertilization model. Additionally, we demonstrated that delays accrued persist through development leading to decreased embryo viability and blastocyst development.&#xd;
A secondary localization of GSTO2 was also discovered on the sperm plasmalemma. GSTO2’s high dehydroascrobate reductase activity coupled with an elevated concentration of ascorbic acid in seminal fluid suggested that GSTO2 may also function in a regulatory capacity on the plasmalemma during sperm capacitation. To test this hypothesis, we catalytically inhibited GSTO2 during in vitro capacitation and investigated the consequence on sperm performance parameters. GSTO2 inhibition resulted in a significant decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation activity and in turn negatively impacted acrosome exocytosis and motility, leading to the sperms inability to penetrate the oocyte. We conclude that surface-borne GSTO2 may function in a regulatory capacity during capacitation. &#xd;
Together, this thesis provides a comprehensive developmental and functional assessment of the importance of GSTO2 before, during and after fertilization.</description>

   <title>The Regulation of Sexual History Evidence: A Historical-Doctrinal Study of its Origins, Judicial Treatment, and Contemporary Limitations</title>

   <description>This is a long-term historical-doctrinal study of the law governing the admissibility of sexual history evidence. It begins in the period before 1982, when Canada’s original rape shield legislation was enacted. It (mostly) ends in 2000, when the Supreme Court held that Canada’s current rape shield legislation, enacted in 1992, was constitutional. (A brief coda to this thesis surveys more recent developments.) The historical parts of this thesis examine, among other things, the social and political processes that compelled Parliament to begin regulating the use of sexual history evidence, how a feminist defence of rape shield legislation was organized in the late-1980s amidst challenges to its constitutionality, and the legal and ideological contexts in which all this occurred. In telling this story, this thesis focuses largely on the lobbying and litigation efforts of self-consciously feminist legal actors, examining the nature and ideological origins of the legal claims they made to Parliament and the Supreme Court, and describing the receptivity of each of those institutions to those claims. The doctrinal parts of this thesis, which are weaved into its historical narrative, address two interrelated topics. First, they consider the extent to which the Supreme Court has over time understood the purpose of rape shield legislation in terms of women’s right to equal benefit and protection of the law, and how this has affected the Court’s assessment of it. Second, they engage with the way in which legal actors have historically understood the law around sexual history evidence as effecting a balance between the rights and interests of (a) people accused of sexual assault, (b) sexual assault complainants, and (c) Canadian society more generally. They also examine critically a more recent view that rape shield legislation does not, in fact, put these rights and interests into conflict.

   <description>Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental health issue which features a breadth of symptoms and variable presentations. Subsequently, the method of diagnosis/treatment is not one with a clear and infallible structure. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate resting-state functional connectivity and symptom severity, as determined by sleep architecture and clinical scales, in order to investigate group differences of participants currently in a major depressive episode (MDE). The secondary objective is to provide preliminary data to aid in the analysis following the unblinding of all investigators in CAN-BIND12.&#xd;
Methods: This was an 8-week, double blind randomized control trial. Participants were placed in two separate groups, such that mean MADRS scores did not significantly differ. Resting-state functional connectivity changes across the 8 weeks were evaluated for each group. Differences in clinical scores (mood, anxiety, and sleep quality) and sleep architecture were determined between-groups as well as within-groups. All measures were collected at baseline and week 8. &#xd;
Results: GROUP B displayed higher symptom severity, as seen by significantly greater MADRS and PSQI scores, compared to GROUP A. GROUP B was also the only group to show any significant changes in functional connectivity. The regions identified in the analysis have either been implicated in the Default Mode Network, the Salience Network, or sensory processing. Sleep architecture measures did not greatly differ in both the between-groups and within-groups analyses. &#xd;
Conclusion: The incidence of functional connectivity changes in the group with greater symptom severity across the 8 weeks, may be indicative of a relationship between whole-brain functional connectivity and depressive symptoms. Due to the fact that this difference was seen in a group solely compromised of clinically depressed individuals, fMRIs may be a useful tool when parsing through the many individual differences experienced by those with MDD. These results will also provide a basis upon which further conclusions can be made at the completion of CAN-BIND12, specifically the relationship between probiotics and functional connectivity.</description>

   <description>Dense deployment of wireless local area networks (WLANs) will support the prolific data traffic in future wireless networks beyond fifth generation (B5G), either as small cells for cellular data offloading or last-miles for high throughput broadband connectivity. Interference and contention from large numbers of concurrent spectrum sharing nodes, spatial reuse and coexistence of multiple radio access technologies (RATs) are some of the challenges in high density WLANs. This thesis focuses on improving performance of dense WLAN in the presence of interference and contention among densely distributed stations (STAs) and access points (APs).  &#xd;
&#xd;
Interference inherently depends on the distribution of users among the available APs. To that effect, multiuser (MU) based AP association is proposed to associate groups of users to an AP to maximize sum-rate, as opposed to several single-user (SU) frameworks in existence. The MU-AP association problem is solved using a proposed graph-theoretic polynomial time algorithm and a proposed dual ascent method, which require channel knowledge to perform MU-AP association. To avert constant a priori channel information, an alternative framework is proposed to efficiently perform association based on spatial statistics of a network.  &#xd;
&#xd;
For spatial reuse, the physical carrier sensing (PCS) and the energy detection (ED) thresholds determine separation of multiple concurrent transmissions in space. PCS threshold is used by Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) WLAN nodes to detect WiFi-like signals from active transmissions while ED thresholds are used to detect non-WiFi preambles. Using stochastic geometry tools, frameworks are proposed for efficient selection of the PCS and ED thresholds that are network-specific and improve spatial average throughput. With efficient separation of concurrent transmissions, interference is further reduced. &#xd;
&#xd;
To jointly address the user-AP association and PCS threshold selection problem, a rate-maximizing framework is proposed. A user-AP association solution is first obtained. PCS threshold selection is then optimized based on the achieved user-AP association. Densification, inevitable in future WLANs in improving performance in the presence of large numbers of contending nodes, is critical to delivering the required service level in next generation wireless networks. Analysis of the tradeoffs between densification and overall throughput is provided to determine node densities that achieve maximum rate.</description>

   <title>Fair-weather liberalism: institutional preparedness for severe climate change</title>

   <description>What if we fail to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and so face its more severe impacts? I argue we must take this possibility seriously and doing so reveals a new obligation of climate justice – contingency planning for severe climate change. Contingency planning prepares us for undesirable possible futures. I argue for its philosophical grounding in an epistemology of futurity – possibilism – that imagines the future as a broad range of possibilities to be prepared for. I set out to draft a contingency plan that looks to safeguard liberal democracy against the impacts of severe climate change including scarcity, violence, and migration. I argue that many of liberalism’s most immediate theoretical resources are unhelpful in acknowledging the obligation of contingency planning, and in detailing the normative content of these plans. Much of liberalism is fair-weather. It either fails to properly identify the problems posed by severe climate change, misreads their normative contours, or fails to offer adequate solutions to them. But mapping these failures also helps us see the possibility of a new, climate-robust liberalism that can build institutional preparedness for severe climate change.</description>

   <description>Gynephilic (attracted to women) men’s sexual responses are strongly dependent upon the gender of a sexual target, while androphilic (attracted to men) women’s sexual responses may be more dependent upon contextual cues other than gender (like physical attractiveness). Research suggests that our nervous systems have been shaped through sexual selection to respond preferentially to cues of attractiveness (as they provide meaningful cues of health and reproductive viability of potential sexual partners). Research also suggests that women’s preference for cues of attractiveness may be highest during periods of the menstrual cycle when conception is most likely. The effect of attractiveness cues on men and women’s sexual arousal has never been tested directly.&#xd;
&#xd;
This dissertation employs one large, within-subjects design, using concurrent measurement of self-reported arousal, genital arousal, self-reported attention, and visual attention patterns to examine three objectives: (1) men and women’s genital and self-reported arousal to cues of attractiveness and gender; (2) women’s sexual arousal to these cues across the menstrual cycle; and (3) men and women’s attention to cues of attractiveness and gender and its relationship with sexual response.&#xd;
&#xd;
Gender and attractiveness proved to be important determinants in men and women’s self-reported and genital arousal, self-reported attention, and visual attention patterns. Though patterns of response varied somewhat between dependent measure and participants’ gender, generally, men and women were found to respond more to attractive than unattractive stimulus types and to their preferred, relative to their non-preferred, genders. Though clear menstrual cycle effects did not emerge among women’s responses to cues of attractiveness and gender, women’s self-reported arousal, genital arousal, and self-reported attention were found to vary by testing order (if they were tested first in the follicular or luteal phase of their menstrual cycles), such that women tested in their follicular phase first showed greater differentiation in their responding to attractive relative to unattractive sexual targets, than women tested in their luteal phase first. Finally, self-reported (but not visual) attention patterns were found to be meaningfully related to men and women’s self-reported and genital arousal to cues of gender (but not cues of attractiveness). Implications and future directions are discussed.</description>

   <description>Several studies have shown that the Hippo pathway plays an important role in tissue growth, organ size control, and cell death.  Deregulation of the Hippo pathway contributes to loss of cell contact inhibition and continuing cell proliferation, which is observed during tumorigenesis. Although many studies have been done to clarify the role of the Hippo pathway in various biological functions, currently the connection between the Hippo pathway and its potential upstream kinase regulators is not very clear. Since the overexpression and deregulation of receptor protein kinases (RTKs) have a pivotal role in many cancers, we hypothesize that RTKs may be involved in tumorigenesis by inhibiting the Hippo pathway.  To test the hypothesis, we developed a biosensor based on split-luciferase complementation assay. To find new RTKs which regulate the Hippo pathway, gain of function and kinase-inhibitor screenings were performed. We found that the many of RTKs could regulate the Hippo signaling activity. We further characterized several of these novel relationships VEGFR, [TAM family members (TYRO3, AXL, METRK),RET, and FGFR family members (FGFR1 and FGFR2)] and found that the Hippo effectors YAP/TAZ are central mediators of the tumorigenic phenotypes (e.g., increased cell proliferation, transformation, increased cell motility, and angiogenesis) induced by these RTKs and their extracellular ligands (Gas6,GDNF, and FGF) through either PI3K or MAPK signaling pathway. Remarkably, we found three new tyrosine-phosphorylation sites on YAP, which regulate its function. Our studies indicate that some RTKs also regulate the Hippo pathway through interaction or phosphorylation of LATS, YAP, and TEAD. In conclusion, these findings highlight the pivotal role of the Hippo pathway in mediating RTK-MAPK/PI3K signalling and provide a compelling rationale for targeting YAP/TAZ in RTK-driven cancer therapies.</description>

   <title>The Effects of Variable Levels of p75 Expression on Aberrant Sympathetic Axon Sprouting Into Sensory Ganglia of Mice Overexpressing Levels of NGF Production</title>

   <description>Growth and regeneration of nervous tissue in adult mammalian organisms is limited to a few&#xd;
locations in the body, and to special circumstances that induce proliferation. One way that neuronal trophism can be initiated is by overexpressing the gene coding for Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) under active promoters, causing an aberrant growth of sympathetic axons into the sensory ganglia of an animal. This phenomenon has been shown in certain environments in the presence of p75 neurotrophin receptor and found to be missing in absence of the same receptor. However, previous research has not looked at situations where only one allele of the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor (p75NTR) is present. To fill this gap in the literature, a rodent model with elevated levels of NGF, and a single functioning allele of p75NTR was investigated and quantitatively assessed against its genetically alternate littermates to determine the impact on sympathosensory sprouting in animals having one mutated p75NTR allele. It was discovered that while the mutation of the p75NTR allele had minimal impact on the morphology of sympathosensory sprouting into the brains of these animals, it induced not only greater sympathetic sprouting into sensory ganglia than its wildtype and knockout counterparts, but also augmented the density of the peculiar perineuronal plexuses found forming around a subset of sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia and the trigeminal ganglia. This study suggests that satellite glial cells are a key component of sympathosensory sprouting, and that the gain-of-function mutation within these heterozygous animals could be used as a model for further research into sympathetically maintained pain.</description>

In terms of scope, this project examines British women’s travelogues written between the 1890s and 1920s as well as writings by Iranian women from the same time period. This genealogical framework can, I argue, inform contemporary transnational feminist debates in light of the growing marketability of Middle Eastern women’s life narratives in the Western literary market.&#xd;
Chapter 2 explores the dual work that representations of Iranian womanhood performed in British women’s travelogues in terms of both documenting the Oriental Other and relationally defining the self. As this chapter shall discuss, to the female British travelers writing between the 1890s and 1920s, the travelogue – which occupied an important place in England’s colonial project – provided ample opportunity for self-exploration. In this context, representations of the Iranian Other came to serve as a counterpoint against which the narrator’s image of an autonomous, liberated self could be textually enhanced.&#xd;
Chapter 3 analyzes Astarābādī’s Ma’āyib-i Rijāl (1894) and the memoir of Tāj us-Saltanih (c. 1914), both of which were autobiographical and drew upon the author’s personal life experiences as grounds from which to broach broader social issues such as women’s rights and reform. This chapter illustrates how the textual and ideological ambivalences of Tāj’s memoir were rooted in the growing influence of Eurocentric prejudices that promulgated cultural misrepresentations of Iran as backward and corrupt.&#xd;
Chapter 4 is divided into two parts. Part 1 explores the ways that the early women’s journals of the 1910s legitimized women’s rights to publication by adopting the eugenic elements of Iran’s nationalist discourses and emphasizing the role that women would play in the modernization of the nation. Part 2 examines how (both male and female) contributors to the late-1920s journal Peyk-i Sa’ādat-i Nisvān adopted the rhetorical potentials of the first-person narrative form to address collective issues of reform and national progress. As this chapter demonstrates, the strategic use of women’s narratives alerts us to the potential limits of the “genuine” use of the first-person voice.</description>

   <description>Following Gaia Data Release 2, observations of spiral structure in the vertical phase space of the Milky Way have been made. In this thesis we set out to explain these structures, using a combination of analytic modeling, simulations, and Dynamic Mode Decomposition to study explicitly their formation and evolution in the presence of self gravity. In doing so, we have demonstrated the first application of DMD to collisionless, self-gravitating systems.&#xd;
&#xd;
We show by comparison of self-gravitating and independent-particle simulations in a realistic Milky Way model, that the timescale of phase space spiral formation is drastically dependent on whether or not stars mutually interact. This is followed by the proposition that mutually interacting stars in a background potential conducive to oscillations can produce a persisting spiral in their phase space distribution, existing on much longer time scales than predicted by traditional kinematic phase mixing arguments. &#xd;
&#xd;
Our proposition is investigated with use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition, which facilitates determining eigenfunctions of the time evolution operator of a system from data snapshots. We apply this to two one-dimensional models for the vertical structure of the Milky Way: the homogeneous slab, and the isothermal plane. We found that the eigenfunctions, or modes, determined for a self-gravitating system undergoing phase mixing comprise a set of modes similar to what is expected from linear perturbation theory. Particularly, the disequilibrium distribution function can be modeled as the superposition of an equilibrium mode and a combination of perturbative modes, all computed directly from snapshots of the system. &#xd;
&#xd;
DMD solutions are determined for the isothermal plane model with a variable relative dominance of self-gravity and background potential. We find that there is a regime of relative dominance where modes of the distribution function containing pronounced spiral structure can persist on extremely long time scales. This implies that a single snapshot of a phase space spiral could belong to an evolution where the distribution function remains in a spiral for long times, driven by mutual interactions, as opposed to the spiral being a short lived transient response as in kinematic phase mixing.</description>

   <description>This thesis aims to map out the relationship between fascism and settler colonialism in Canada. In the first chapter, I go through a number of theories of fascism, including by contemporary historians and 20th century Marxists. I draw on the work of Deleuze and Guattari and their distinction between molar and molecular (or micro) fascism. In the context in a country like Canada, in which fascism has not taken on a molar form on the state level, I argue that we need an account of fascism that is sensitive to its molecular expressions. I highlight three tendencies of fascism that we should keep an eye on if we are concerned about its emergence. In the second chapter, I explore the role of the settler state in cultivating and producing microfascist affects, feelings, and beliefs. I examine the deputization of settlers by the Canadian state in order to expand and protect territory and the way this cultivates racist affect and encourages (often fatal) acts of violence. Finally, I consider the way whiteness in Canada becomes a territorializing force, and sketch out a model of private property I call settler whitespace. In the third chapter, I consider the fascist rhetoric around “the great replacement” and “white genocide” in relation to the structure of settler colonialism. I consider the logic of replacement in Canada as not just a territorial project, but one that also creates a racially exclusionary idea of Canadian nationalism. Fascist rhetoric not only echoes the Canadian history of eugenics, it inverts the practices of replacement and genocide inherent to the settler state, and engages in what I will call a biopolitics of the nation.  This inversion is not just a coincidence, it is part of what makes this rhetoric so affectively compelling. I will conclude by arguing that given the intimate relationship between fascism and settler colonialism in Canada, anti-fascist action must follow the lead of practices of Indigenous resurgence.</description>

   <description>The research program presented in this dissertation describes a multimethod investigation of women’s sexual arousal. Across three empirical studies, alternative approaches to sexual psychophysiology research were adopted to further develop the ways in which women’s sexual arousal is elicited and measured in the laboratory. In Chapter 2, two direct measures of genital response—the litmus test strip and the laser Doppler imager—were used concurrently to provide the first empirical evidence of the positive relationship between genital lubrication and blood flow during sexual arousal. Both measures detected a genital response and were suitable for repeated measurement within a single session; however, only the laser Doppler imager detected low levels of genital response. Chapter 3 validated the only direct and continuous measure of genital blood flow in women—laser Doppler flowmetry. The study showed that laser Doppler flowmetry is a valid and sensitive measure of genital response that is reliable across testing sessions, and results indicated that genital blood flow assessed by flowmetry is highly responsive over time. In consideration of the way in which sexual arousal is elicited in the laboratory, Chapter 4 applied a novel stimulus selection task, which enabled the direct comparison of using participant- versus researcher-selected sexual stimuli to elicit sexual arousal. The study demonstrated the feasibility and utility of using participant-selected sexual stimuli in sexual psychophysiology research, such that a participant-selected sexual stimulus elicited equal or greater sexual arousal than a researcher-selected one. The studies that comprise this dissertation represent alternative approaches to the dominant methods used in sexual psychophysiology research. The studies described herein have implications for experimental and applied sexual arousal research. The multiple methods used to elicit and measure sexual arousal in this program of research are novel and show promise for enhancing the study of women’s sexual arousal.</description>

   <title>A Window to the Mind: Validation of a New Method to Measure Thought Dynamics Using Brain Network Meta-State Transitions</title>

   <description>In addition to what people are thinking about, researchers are also increasingly interested in how humans flow continuously from one mental state to the next (i.e., the flights and perches of thought; James, 1890). Can we pinpoint these moments of flight directly from neural signals? I drew upon the Human Connectome Project’s Young Adult functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset to characterize the psychological meaning of changes in functional connectivity during movie-viewing and at rest. I began with a representation of brain activity at each timepoint as the set of activations across 15 networks, and used new methods to embed this high-dimensional network representation onto a two-dimensional space of possible network configurations (network meta-states). Furthermore, I identified large jumps between consecutive timepoints in the reduced space, which I call meta-state transitions and should reflect prominent changes in the configuration of active networks. &#xd;
&#xd;
I found that participants’ meta-state transitions were strongly related to the progression of meaning across events within movie stimuli. Meta-state transitions also shared many characteristics across movie and resting fMRI data, including concurrence with activation of brain regions associated with spontaneous thought, suppression by engagement of attention regions, and trait-like rates of occurrence. Based on these features, as well as the centrality of semantics to thought, I argue that meta-state transitions correspond to the initiation of new thoughts, and that characterizing transition features may serve as a direct neural measurement of how one thinks (i.e., their mentation). By exploring neural and behavioural correlates of meta-state transition rate and transition group alignment during movie-viewing, I also illustrate how this approach can contribute insights to emerging research on thought dynamics by bridging the gap between behavioural assessments and traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques.</description>

   <title>The influence of persistent genital arousal (PGA) on romantic relationships</title>

   <subject>Relationships</subject>
   <description>Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is characterized by sensations of physiological genital sexual arousal that occurs in the absence of subjective feelings of sexual desire. Although partner factors have been examined in prior research among other conditions affecting the genital region and sexual response, to date no research has focused on the interpersonal context within which PGAD occurs. There are gaps in the current literature on (1) the relationship, sexual, and psychological well-being of individuals with PGAD who are in a relationship, (2) whether individuals disclose their symptoms to romantic partners, and (3) whether interpersonal variables (such as partner responses, symptom disclosure, and catastrophizing) are related to relationship adjustment and symptom severity. Seventy-six individuals (N = 62 women, N = 10 men, N = 2 Non-Binary, N = 1 Two-Spirit) with symptoms of persistent genital arousal (PGA), as well as 76 age- and sex-matched controls participated in a one-time anonymous online survey. Individuals with PGA reported significantly lower relationship and sexual satisfaction, greater sexual distress, and more symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to controls. Over three-quarters (85.5%) of the PGA sample disclosed their symptoms to their partners in some way. Greater supportive partner responses and lower symptom catastrophizing were related to better relationship adjustment among participants with PGA. Greater symptom catastrophizing also predicted greater PGA symptom severity. Partner responses were not related to PGA symptom severity. Results of the current study suggest that when one member of a couple experiences symptoms of PGA, there may be associated consequences for relationship, sexual, and psychological well-being. Although interpersonal factors have been linked to symptom severity in chronic pain and genital pain conditions, the results of the current study suggest that interpersonal factors may play a slightly different role in PGA symptom experiences and in the conceptualization of PGAD more broadly. Results and implications are discussed in the context of interpersonal models of sexual and relationship functioning.</description>

   <title>The Impact of Acute Social Stress on Approach and Avoidance Motivation in Individuals with Depression: An Examination of Behavioural and Neurophysiological Indices of Motivation</title>

   <description>Stress is considered proximal to the maintenance of depression. However, precise mechanisms linking stress to depression maintenance are largely unknown. Depression is characterized by decreased motivation for, and response to, reward. Further, both exposure to stress and subjective response to stress have been shown to negatively affect several reward-related processes in healthy individuals. The goal of the current study was to examine the impact of acute stress exposure and response on behavioural approach and avoidance motivation, defined as willingness to expend effort for reward/to prevent loss, and frontal EEG alpha asymmetry, a neurophysiological index of motivation. Depressed (n= 57) and non-depressed (n= 44) participants were randomized to social exclusion versus inclusion on a Cyberball task. EEG was recorded in 2-minute blocks immediately before and following Cyberball. Following Cyberball, participants completed the Need Threat Scale (NTS), as a measure of response to social exclusion, and a modified version of the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) that included both reward and loss trials. Individuals with depression showed lower approach and avoidance motivation on the EEfRT than healthy comparisons. With regards to social stress exposure, individuals in the Cyberball exclusion condition showed higher avoidance motivation compared to individuals in the inclusion condition. There was no significant effect of stress exposure on approach motivation, nor significant interactions between stress exposure and diagnostic group for either approach or avoidance motivation. With regards to stress response, there was a significant interaction between stress response and diagnostic group for both approach and avoidance motivation. Specifically, lower NTS scores (i.e., greater threat to fundamental needs in response to Cyberball) predicted lower approach motivation and higher avoidance motivation but only for individuals with depression. With regards to frontal alpha EEG asymmetry, as predicted individuals with depression showed lower relative left frontal asymmetry compared to healthy comparisons when controlling for comorbid anxiety symptoms. Contrary to hypotheses, across groups, individuals in the exclusion condition showed greater post-stress relative left frontal asymmetry compared to those in the inclusion condition. These findings are discussed in light of previous literature and with regards to study strengths and considerations.</description>

   <description>This work investigates the coupling between flow, sediment transport and changes to geometry of river dunes. It aims to broaden the understanding of this coupling by examining: a) intrinsic differences between flow and sediment transport over equilibrium and non-equilibrium dunes; and b) whether the equations relating flow conditions to dune development and geometry developed for sand dunes are equally applicable to gravel dunes. To this end three novel laboratory experiments were carried out. Two experiments build upon a previous test by Wiebe (2007) in which equilibrium dunes were developed and then subjected to a sudden decrease in flow depth. The equilibrium dunes in the test under consideration were recreated and immobilized. For the first experiment this enabled the study of the flow field at equilibrium state, and just after the flow depth was suddenly decreased. In the second experiment a 2 cm layer of sand was placed over two of the dunes enabling the measurement of sediment transport for the aforementioned two flow conditions. For the third experiment three different flow conditions were run over a flat bed and the bed profiles were measured as gravel dunes developed and migrated. The findings of this work are as follows:&#xd;
1)	No differences were found in the patterns of time-averaged velocity and turbulence characteristics over the equilibrium and non-equilibrium dunes which would explain the observed changes in dune geometry.&#xd;
2)	An attempt was made to predict bed shear stress over the dunes. Fits were used to extend viscous stresses calculated by a RANS numerical model below the bed surface to the theoretical wall. Shear stresses calculated in this way exhibited significantly different patterns under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions and could be used to accurately predict bed changes. The validity of this method, however, has yet to be proven.&#xd;
3)	The downstream derivatives of bed surface elevation and the bed-load rate was found to be proportional to each other at equilibrium state. &#xd;
4)	The geometry and time of development of gravel dunes appears to be well predicted by equations previously developed for sand dunes while their wave spectra are not.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we develop and apply a novel algorithm to understand the evolution of stellar discs in ΛCDM cosmological haloes. Three main scientific areas are addressed: the effects of evolving stellar discs on their host haloes, understanding bar formation in cosmological settings, and the formation of vertical disc structure in response to the host halo.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, we find that the presence of central concentrations of baryons in dark matter haloes enhances adiabatic contraction causes an overall modest reduction in substructure. Additionally, the detailed evolution of stellar discs is important for the inner halo density distribution. However, properties of the halo such as the subhalo mass function are broadly unaffected by the evolution of a realistic stellar disc.&#xd;
&#xd;
Next, we find that stellar bars invariably form in Milky Way-like galaxies. The strength of these bars is less dependent on properties like the dynamical temperature of the disc in a cosmological setting. Instead, the disc thickness plays a leading&#xd;
role in determining the overall bar strength. Our discs undergo notable buckling events, yielding present-day pseudobulge-disc-halo systems. We show that these are qualitatively similar to the observed Milky Way.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, we show that a wide variety of vertical structure forms when stellar discs are embedded in cosmological haloes. We further show that through a variety of mechanisms, similar vertical structure is excited. By examining twelve simulations of&#xd;
discs in cosmological haloes, we show that the Sgr dSph need not be as massive as 10^{11} solar masses to be consistent with observed vertical structure in the Milky Way. In fact, the recent buckling of the Milky Way’s bar and its present interaction with the LMC are more likely culprits for some of the observed structure in the Milky Way’s thin disc.</description>

   <title>The Effect of In Utero Benzene Exposure on Fetal NF-KB Cell Signalling in CD-1 Mice</title>

   <description>In utero exposure to benzene, a known carcinogenic environmental toxicant, is associated with the development of childhood leukemia. We have previously demonstrated that in utero exposure to benzene in CD-1 mice can alter the expression of the transcription factor NF-KB, which regulates genes involved in cell proliferation and programmed cell death, however, a full characterization of benzene’s effects on fetal NF-B is still needed. Since NF-KB regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, inappropriate activation can result in the proliferation of damaged cells potentially leading to the development of leukemia. We hypothesize that benzene metabolism in the maternal liver leads to fetal changes in NF-KB signalling. To test this hypothesis, pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to 200 mg/kg benzene or its vehicle control on gestational days 8, 10, 12, and 14. Dams were sacrificed at 1, 2, 6, or 24 hours after the last benzene dose. Fetal livers were collected, and immunoblotting was done to assess changes in protein levels of phospho-p65, phospho-p38-MAPK, p50, and inhibitor of NF-KB (IKB-α). Results show that after in utero benzene exposure, protein levels of nuclear p50, phospho-p65 and phospho-p38-MAPK did not change significantly after benzene treatment but protein levels of IKB-α significantly increased 6 hours after the last benzene dose. However, there were no observed changes in the mRNA level of IKB-α. There were also no observed significant changes in the DNA binding activity of NF-KB following in utero benzene exposure. In conclusion, these results suggest that in utero benzene exposure does not alter NF-KB signalling in CD-1 mice fetal liver aside from the increased IKB-α protein levels. Further studies should be done using techniques that do not possess the limitations in this study.</description>

   <title>Explicit-Implicit Attitudinal Ambivalence in Romantic Relationships:  Antecedents and Outcomes</title>

   <subject>Relationships</subject>
   <description>Previous research has shown that the attitudes individuals hold towards their romantic partner often greatly impact relationship outcomes. Traditionally, attitudes towards one’s romantic relationship were assessed using explicit measures. Implicit measures however recently gained popularity owing to the fact that they have been demonstrated to provide attitudinal information beyond that which is communicated through explicit measures. Given the recent advent of the incorporation of implicit measures into relationship research, and previous conceptualizations that framed attitudes as bipolar, relatively few studies have assessed both explicit and implicit attitudes, let alone explicit-implicit ambivalence. Those that have, have shown explicit-implicit attitudinal ambivalence to influence thoughts and judgments, and predict behaviour/behavioural intentions. Few studies however have taken an interest in the interplay between explicit and implicit measures, and whether antecedents and outcomes differ as a function of a participants’ explicit-implicit ambivalence profile. The present research extends previous literature by examining the antecedents and outcomes specifically associated with each of the two possible attitudinal ambivalence profiles in a relationship context. This study is therefore unique in its’ intentions to investigate and contrast the unique psychological underpinnings of differing relationship-specific ambivalence profiles, while using a never-before combined selection of explicit measures, implicit measures, antecedent and outcome variables. Results indicated significant, positive correlations between explicit measures. Conversely, correlations among the implicit measures were extremely weak. With regards to the explicit-implicit measure correlations, one of the explicit measures consistently produced significant correlations when combined with each of the implicit measures. Both antecedents and outcomes were differentially associated with each of the two ambivalence profiles. Individuals who were low in ambivalence and attachment-related avoidance were more likely to display explicit-implicit ambivalence such that their attitudes were more positive on the implicit measure than the explicit measure. Further, it was when avoidance and ambivalence decreased that the explicit-implicit discrepancy increased.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this project was to create a website by which teachers could readily seek strategies to motivate their middle school readers and in doing so, increase their reading comprehension. The accompanying paper provides a brief review of the literature and a website user guide, with a focus on using blogging as a strategy to increase motivation and reading comprehension in middle school classrooms. The website is an avenue where knowledge accumulated through peer-reviewed research and classroom experience (both personal and that of others) is shared. Research has shown that motivation to read in and out of school decreases as students progress through middle school (Kelley &amp; Decker, 2009). Furthermore, results from grade ten students in Ontario on EQAO assessments have shown a decrease in achievement for literacy across subject areas over the last five years. This new website, Engaging Middle School Readers, is a combination of blog posts, educational book summaries, video modules, and suggested online resources suitable for teachers, students, and parents – all made accessible in hopes to counteract the decrease in motivation, and encourage the frequent use of comprehension reading strategies.</description>

   <title>Does Gerontological Nursing Education and Personal Attitudes Toward Older Adults Influence New Nurses’ Intentions to Work in Aged Care Settings?</title>

   <subject>New Nurse</subject>
   <subject>Nursing Education</subject>
   <subject>Aged Care Nursing</subject>
   <subject>Gerontology</subject>
   <description>Background: In Ontario, the older adult population is steadily increasing, and the healthcare system is not equipped to effectively care for their needs. This is evidenced by the large number of Alternative Level of Care (ALC) beds within hospitals, and lengthy wait times for admission into a Long-Term Care (LTC) facility. As new LTC spaces are created, new nurses will be critical members of the healthcare team required to care for these patients. However, there is no current evidence about the intentions of registered nurses (RNs) and registered practical nurses (RPNs) who are newly registered with the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) to work in aged care facilities. There is also no data regarding their attitudes toward older adults, or how their nursing education influences these variables.&#xd;
&#xd;
Aim: The aim of this study was to examine how pre-licensure geriatric nursing education and personal attitudes toward older adults influence newly registered RNs’ and RPNs’ intentions to work in aged care.&#xd;
&#xd;
Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used. A questionnaire that included the Kogan’s Attitudes Toward Old People (KAOP) Scale was mailed to newly registered RNs and RPNs across Ontario (n=1103). &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Participants (n = 181) reported positive attitudes toward older adults (KAOP mean score = 166, SD = 24); however, their attitudes were not influenced by their education, and did not influence their intention to work in aged care. Forty-five percent of participants reported that their gerontological nursing education provided them with the knowledge, skill and judgement to care for the older adult population, and 14% of participants intend to work in an aged care setting within the next five years. Participants’ intentions to work in an aged care setting was positively associated with having multiple gerontological clinical placements (ß = 1.76, p &lt; 0.05), and having a clinical placement in a LTC setting (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.30; p &lt; 0.01).&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: The findings support the need to provide nursing students with high quality gerontological nursing curriculum and clinical placements. Qualitative research is recommended to understand why new nurses in Ontario may not intend to work in aged care settings.</description>

   <title>The Influence of the Level of Representation of Information on Belief Formation and Change</title>

   <subject>Belief Change</subject>
   <description>The upward extrapolation of information from an individual to a category and the downward extrapolation of information from a category to an individual are pervasive social-cognitive processes. People can form beliefs using upward and downward extrapolation processes, as well as by learning information directly about an object (i.e., a process with no extrapolation). These three processes can be conceptualized as levels within the variable: the level of representation of information. Although extrapolation processes have been long recognized in many literatures, level of representation has been largely disregarded as a property of attitude structure and a property of persuasive messages. This program of research consisted of four studies that examined the effects of level of representation on persuasion. Studies One and Two examined upward extrapolation processes. Study Three examined downward extrapolation processes. Study Four examined upward and downward extrapolation processes simultaneously. &#xd;
The findings supported several key principles. First, messages represented at the level of target are generally the most persuasive. Second, messages become decreasingly persuasive as they require more extreme extrapolation processes. Third, the persuasiveness of messages is contingent on the level of representation at belief formation about the target. Persuasive messages represented at the target level are similarly effective irrespective of the level of representation at belief formation, while the persuasiveness of messages represented at non-target levels varies across different levels of representation at belief formation. When the initial beliefs about a target are based on target-level information, persuasive messages represented at a non-target level are generally less effective than a message represented at the target level. However, when the initial beliefs about a target are based on information that requires an extrapolation process that is equally as extreme as or more extreme than the non-target-level message at persuasion, the non-target-level message becomes more effective and the difference in effectiveness between the non-target-level message and the target-level message diminishes. Overall, this program of research has demonstrated that level of representation should be seriously considered as a property of attitude structure and a property of persuasive messages, and thus, should be further investigated as such.</description>

   <description>The last decade has witnessed a growing demand for reliable, continuous and accurate positioning and navigation with the growth of a wide range of new applications that rely predominately on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), including Global Positioning System (GPS). The widespread of these applications and their integration in many aspects in our day-to-day activities made GNSS receivers appealing targets for disruption or jamming. Although, GPS signals employ direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation that provides some level of robustness to intentional&#xd;
and unintentional radio frequency (RF) interference; GPS signals are vulnerable to interference and jamming as they reach the receiver antenna below the noise floor.&#xd;
A jamming signal can degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which results in deterioration in the acquisition, tracking and navigation stages within the receiver. The resultant degradation or interruption of the GPS service due to signal jamming could lead to significant consequences and risks. Loss of time synchronization, disruption of communication and network operations, and potential loss of life are examples of these consequences, to name a few. The primary objective of this thesis is to provide a GPS-based reliable and uninterrupted positioning solution in the presence of interference signals, particularly continuous wave (CW) and swept continuous wave (SCW) signals. To tackle this challenge,  first, a robust vector-based software defined receiver has been implemented, and its performance was assessed in degraded signal conditions including the presence of interference. Second, two pre-correlation jamming mitigation techniques are proposed. The first technique is based on transforming the incoming signal into time-scale domain using wavelet packet transform (WPT), in which the jamming signal can be better identified and isolated. The second is a high-resolution spectral analysis technique that is based on fast orthogonal search (FOS), in which the jamming signal is modeled using a set of candidate functions and then suppressed from the received signal. These two techniques were augmented with the vector-based software receiver and their performance was assessed using various static and dynamic scenarios.</description>

   <title>Testing Photometric and Kinematic Algorithms to predict Next-Generation Telescope Survey Statistics</title>

   <description>Reconciling the velocity function of dark matter halos in collisionless simulations with those derived observationally requires understanding how galaxies are embedded in their dark matter halos. Widefield neutral atomic hydrogen surveys with Square Kilometre Array pathfinders such as WALLABY on the ASKAP telescope will address this issue since they will resolve the kinematics of representative samples of galaxies beyond their optical disks. These statistical samples afford constructing a velocity function out of resolved galaxies, including those with distorted kinematics that recent hydrodynamical simulations suggest make up a significant fraction of nearby systems. To do so, however, the kinematics of the thousands of poorly resolved galaxies that will comprise the majority of WALLABY detections will need to be modelled using novel techniques, and we will require ancillary photometric inclination estimates. Several new codes have been developed to model kinematics, but few have been tested in the marginally resolved regime. We explore our ability to constrain photometric components using DiskFit and galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies, determining that we can estimate ellipticity correctly to within δƐ=0.083. Then, using empirical scaling relations for disk galaxies in the local volume, we generate an extensive suite of resolved, WALLABY-like synthetic galaxy observations and use them to test how well galaxy kinematics can be recovered using the Fully Automated TiRiFiC 3D modelling code. We then simulate a mock WALLABY volume of resolved galaxy detections, use our model-fitting results to determine the reliability with which the kinematics of each can be recovered, and predict the resolved galaxy velocity function that WALLABY will measure. Our ability to model galaxies with fewer than five beams across their major axes significantly increases the number of resolved detections that could contribute to the sample. We discuss how the predicted WALLABY velocity function is impacted as the sample size grows to contain these more poorly resolved galaxies, and find that we can recover the velocity function down to 25 km/s, an improvement upon the predicted lower limit of  50 km/s based on the limitations of legacy algorithms.</description>

   <description>The secondary mathematics curriculum in Ontario has gone through many revisions and renewals during the past 60 years. Current curriculum and policy documents are readily available, yet previous documents are not easily accessible. There is a dearth of literature on historical changes to the Ontario secondary math curriculum, especially from the perspective of the mathematics education leaders. By performing a document analysis of historical secondary mathematics curriculum in Ontario and then interviewing mathematics leaders who have been involved in several change/revision processes, this descriptive study seeks to document the changes to and influences on the Ontario secondary mathematics curriculum since the 1960s.&#xd;
&#xd;
	This study identified keys trends in changes to Ontario mathematics curriculum documents. These trends include an increased focus on teaching methodologies within the document, removal of topics such as conics and proofs with the reduction of the secondary program to four years and an overall increased focus on calculus.  By contrasting document changes to both previous literature and interviews conducted in this study, possible triggering events, such as mathematical movements or new political parties elected, were identified for each curriculum revision. By comparing and contrasting experiences of leaders with existing literature suggestions for future curriculum revisions processes are proposed such as a provincial scoping survey prior to the start of the writing process and sufficient time for field testing and implementation.</description>

   <title>Chronic Health Conditions in the Classroom: A Pan-Canadian Assessment of Adolescent Psychosocial Functioning</title>

   <description>Due to a variety of factors (e.g., absence from school, being physically unable to take part in certain activities), students with Chronic Health Conditions (CHCs) are at a greater risk of low academic achievement and less fulfilling social relationships than their otherwise healthy peers (Hoffmann et al., 2018; Thies &amp; McAllister, 2001). Teachers’ insufficient understanding of the psychosocial functioning (i.e., affective, cognitive, and behavioural characteristics) of students with CHCs results in a lack of educational programing to suit those students’ health and educational needs, compounding the risk of low academic achievement and less fulfilling social relationships (Hopkins &amp; Hughes, 2016). The purpose of this research is to establish patterns of psychosocial functioning in order to inform teacher practice, and It has been guided by the following research question: Are there significant differences in psychosocial functioning (affective, behavioural, and cognitive) of Canadian adolescents with and without CHC?  The methods involved the development of a model of affective functioning, one of the three domains of psychosocial functioning. The model comprised three factors: interpersonal home (feeling emotional support, understood, trusted, happy, listened to), interpersonal school (feeling trust, belonging, fairness, a nice place accepted), and general intrapersonal (feeling left out, lonely, hopeless, and the desire to be someone else), which speak to those inward feeling. Follow-up t-tests that adolescents with CHCs functioned significantly poorer than adolescents without CHCs on all affective factors, and ANOVAs revealed that specific affective functioning varied significantly among the types of CHCs. Additionally, sex and grade are significant factors in reported affective functioning. Measures should be taken to help support the affective functioning of adolescents with CHCs in the school environment. It is recommended that efforts should be taken to support students’ sense of belongingness, as it should in turn foster affective psychosocial experiences. Additionally, teachers should be made knowledgeable of students who are more at-risk of poor affective psychosocial functioning, namely, females, those in higher grades, and those with multiple CHCs.</description>

   <description>Ethereum is a blockchain platform that hosts and executes general-purpose computer programs known as smart contracts. Users execute smart contracts by sending transactions to one of the functions of the contract. The execution of smart contracts in Ethereum has a cost that is measured in Gas unit. Executing a function of a smart contract burns a certain amount of gas units (a.k.a., gas usage). The total gas usage depends on how much computing power is necessary to carry out the execution of the function. Ethereum follows a free-market policy for deciding the transaction fee for executing a transaction. More specifically, users choose how much they are willing to pay in cryptocurrency for each unit of gas (a.k.a., gas price). Miners process transactions to gain mining rewards, which come directly from the paid transaction fees by users. However, neither the user nor the miner know, beforehand, the gas usage of a transaction. In this thesis, we analyze the Ethereum transaction data spanning between Oct. 2017 and Feb. 2019 (the Byzantium period) to conduct two studies that examine how gas usage and price impact the transaction processing dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain platform.&#xd;
&#xd;
In our first study, we examine the strategies that are adopted by miners to prioritize transactions, the stability of the gas usage of contract functions, and whether the gas usage of a contract transaction can be predicted within a reasonable margin.  We observe that most miners follow the default strategy for prioritizing transactions (which solely relies on gas price), a significant amount of contract functions have a very stable gas usage history, and it is possible to provide a real-time estimation of the gas usage of a transaction for these contracts with a median Adjusted RSquared of 0.86.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second study, we focus on understanding gas prices. We analyze how users commonly set gas prices and whether the contracts that are involved in user-to-contract transactions influence gas prices. Subsequently, we build a regression model to discover the factors that are strongly associated with the gas price of transactions. We observe that the gas prices set by users assume a wide range of values, vary considerably over time, and change based on the user. We also observe that the gas price of user-to-contract transactions differ significantly across contracts and functions. Lastly, we observe that different factors are more strongly associated with gas prices at different times.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our findings can help researchers to focus on the vulnerabilities of the current gas mechanism in their future work, provide developers insights on how to improve their decentralized applications (DApps) regarding transactions, motivate users to make an informed decision when issuing a transaction, and help miners to adopt optimized mining strategy.</description>

   <description>Testing models of modern Real-time Embedded (RTE) systems is not straightforward&#xd;
due to timing constraints, numerous if not infinite possible behaviors, and complex&#xd;
communications between components. Software testing tools and approaches that&#xd;
can generate test cases to test these systems are therefore important. Many of the&#xd;
existing automatic approaches support testing at the implementation level only. The&#xd;
existing model-level testing tools either treat the model as a black box (e.g., random&#xd;
testing approaches) or have limitations when it comes to generating complex test sequences (e.g., symbolic execution). This thesis presents different test case generation&#xd;
techniques for models developed in UML-RT, a UML profile and a domain specific&#xd;
language for modeling RTE systems. We present a novel approach and tool support&#xd;
for automatic unit testing of UML-RT models by conducting concolic testing, a hybrid&#xd;
testing technique based on concrete and symbolic execution. Our technique conducts&#xd;
automatic concolic testing in two phases. In the first phase, the model is isolated from&#xd;
its environment, transformed to a testable model and integrated into a test harness.&#xd;
In the second phase, the harness tests the model concolically and reports the test&#xd;
execution results.&#xd;
To make the test case generation efficient for UML-RT models, we present a novel&#xd;
slicing technique and its tool support. The slicer takes the input model and a criterion,&#xd;
and constructs a slice by taking into account the input criterion. The slice contains&#xd;
only those (behavioral and structural) elements of the original model that depend on&#xd;
the input criterion. Therefore, a slice is possibly a smaller model (compared to the&#xd;
original model) that can make the test case generation more efficient.&#xd;
We describe implementations of each of the techniques in the context of PapyrusRT, an open source Model Driven Engineering (MDE) tool based on the modeling&#xd;
language UML-RT, and report the results of applying our techniques to a set of&#xd;
benchmark models to validate our approach.</description>

   <description>Since 2009, Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, has been in a serious humanitarian crisis emerging from insurgency headed by militant jihadist organization: Boko Haram. The group has carried out deadly attacks on civilians in northeast Nigeria leading to mass internal displacement and forced migration of affected persons in the region to more stable areas of the country. The conflict has done abysmal damage to the region and nation, causing thousands of deaths and dispossessing over 3 million people of their properties and livelihood. Women and children remain hot targets of the group’s numerous abductions, torture and sexual violence both during and post active attack periods. These issues have forced many to flee their communities, seeking safety in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps cross- country. However, a majority of the camps are in a deplorable state and grapple with overcrowding, poor living conditions, insecurity, environmental health risks and other dangers. The aim of this study is to explore how these issues affect women’s wellbeing, particularly in Durumi IDP camp, Abuja. The end goal of the study is to find crucial gaps in the camp’s conditions and operations, and develop strategies/ recommendations that adhere to sustainable approaches in addressing the pressing living conditions in the camp, particularly decent shelter.</description>

   <title>Something Got Into Their Minds: The Rise of Radicalization Discourse in Canada</title>

   <description>This dissertation examines the rise of radicalization discourse in Canada. Drawing on postcolonial theories of Orientalism and affect, I contend that radicalization is a racially-charged concept that characterizes anti-Western violence in ways that relieve Western states of culpability for their colonial provocations. Evidence of such provocations is diluted through prevailing radicalization discourses that inform counter-terrorism frameworks and shape popular understandings of terrorism. Such frameworks rely heavily on race-based assumptions painting Muslim-looking subjects and communities of colour as especially susceptible to extremism and terrorist violence. These assumptions construct an ostensibly scientific framework for radicalization that transforms mundane behaviours into “indicators” of suspiciousness and risk amongst people of colour. This leads to what I term a “pretrapment” logic whereby thoughts and behaviours racially tagged as “Muslim” are used to justify pre-emptive interventions designed to halt a future terrorist attack. Additionally, radicalization discourse paints Muslim communities as “suspicious allies” that are perceived as both breeding grounds for radicalization and necessary agents of surveillance for the state. Against this backdrop, sport is constructed as a key catalyst for deradicalization interventions on susceptible subjects who may otherwise slip into violent, extremist thoughts and action. Sport’s role in deradicalization helps augment colonial discourses that align with imperial myths of benevolence, western characterizations of Muslim culture as universally misogynistic, and the construction of Muslim-looking people as constant outsiders within western civilization.</description>

   <description>The use of plants to remediate contaminated lands is of growing interest to the scientific community because of its ease of implementation, cost effectiveness and ability to stabilize contaminated soils. A novel Populus tremula x Populus alba mutant named fuzzy with an increased trichome density, an elevated growth rate, enhanced pest resistance and a predicted root phenotype was investigated for its ability to tolerate and accumulate arsenic and cadmium in soil. The chlorophyll, hydrogen peroxide and proline contents of fuzzy tissues were assayed, its tissue metal content was measured using ICP-MS and its wet biomass was quantified. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing homologous gene of that overexpressed in the fuzzy poplar were grown on gel media and their roots were measured to corroborate the root phenotype of fuzzy poplars. The fuzzy poplar was found to have lower levels of hydrogen peroxide in its tissues after arsenic and cadmium exposure than control poplars, suggesting it has a reduced oxidative stress response when exposed to high levels of arsenic and cadmium. This low hydrogen peroxide content was not due to reduced arsenic and cadmium accumulation in fuzzy trees, as they did not accumulate different amounts of arsenic or cadmium than control plants. Proline and chlorophyll levels were not significantly different between metal treatments, or between fuzzy and control poplars. fuzzy poplars exhibited significantly higher root biomass than control poplars, and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing a homologous gene to the one that causes the fuzzy phenotype had significantly longer roots than control plants. All poplars exposed to arsenic and cadmium in this trial contained the majority of these compounds in their tissues in roots. The root biomass phenotype, low hydrogen peroxide content and root metal accumulation in the fuzzy poplar make it an ideal candidate for bioremediation and soil stabilization of contaminated soils.</description>

   <title>Simulating solute transport in discretely fractured rocks: Computational limitations and a hybrid method</title>
   <creator>Campbell, Wesley</creator>
   <contributor>Novakowski, Kent</contributor>
   <subject>Solute transport, discrete fracture networks, hydrogeology</subject>
   <description>To investigate the computational limitations arising when simulating large-scale groundwater flow&#xd;
and solute transport using a 3D control volume finite element model (the FE model) in discrete-fracture&#xd;
mode, numerical simulations were matched to a semi-analytical solution for radial divergent&#xd;
solute transport in a single fracture. Discretization parameters and computation times were&#xd;
compared for two sets of simulations. Depending on the model parameters, transport simulations&#xd;
in the FE model can take longer to compute with parallel versus serial processing. The transport solution&#xd;
was the largest limiting factor with respect to computational cost for our models. Transport&#xd;
computations, for example, took 86-98% of the total computation time, and the relative flow and&#xd;
transport times changed little with increasing scale. Next, an efficient hybrid numerical-analytical&#xd;
method (the NA method) for simulating solute transport in 2D fracture networks is proposed. The&#xd;
NA method can be used to compute solute breakthrough curves in a 2D network of fractures of&#xd;
varying aperture and fluid velocity by applying the Tang et al. (1981) solution to an equivalent fracture&#xd;
pathway (EFP) which is generated by a numerical model. The NA method was verified at&#xd;
three different transport scales (i.e., 10m, 50m and 250m) using a range of realistic fracture apertures,&#xd;
matrix porosities and hydraulic gradients, by comparing simulated breakthrough curves to&#xd;
those generated by the FE model. Solute dilution can be accommodated by scaling a breakthrough&#xd;
curve using discharge ratios in the fracture segments before and after dilution. The validity of&#xd;
this method depends on the ratio of the Péclet number and the matrix porosity, which can serve&#xd;
as an indication of the cases in which the NA method will be valid for a given fracture spacing&#xd;
and transport distance. A 2k factorial analysis was also conducted which shows that increasing the&#xd;
number of fracture intersections diminishes the ability of the NA method to match the FE model.&#xd;
Simulations of realistic 2D fracture networks however show that in natural fractured rock systems,&#xd;
the NA method could be a useful tool to simulate solute transport at an up to 85% reduced&#xd;
computational cost.</description>

   <title>Procedures to Analyze and Design Decentralized, Distributed Sensor Networks for Change Detection</title>

   <description>The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has reinvigorated interest into the distributed quickest change detection problem within wireless sensor networks. Although a number of system designs addressing this problem exist in literature, the vast scale of IoT has highlighted limitations of existing methods when adapted to large networks. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate and propose both system designs and design methodologies that perform well in large networks.&#xd;
&#xd;
Numerical analysis techniques are developed that allow for accurate threshold design of the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) and Cumulative-Sum (CUSUM) procedures with respect to desired error metrics. Tests designed using these procedures are compared with those using Wald’s approximation to highlight the impact of sequential test overshoot on test design. These techniques are shown to also provide insight into the operation of these procedures over time.&#xd;
&#xd;
Leveraging these techniques, two system designs are proposed to solve the distributed quickest change detection problem. With large sensor networks in mind, multiple simultaneous transmissions within the network are permitted and analyzed uniquely by a fusion center (FC), and the problem of limited bandwidth is considered.&#xd;
&#xd;
These designs use the CUSUM procedure at local sensors to quantize local sensor observations into binary summary reports that are transmitted to the FC, indicating the outcome of each local sensor's CUSUM in each time slot.  Probability mass functions describing the probability of the fusion center receiving one or more reports from local sensors in each time slot are computed using the developed CUSUM analysis techniques. Accurate characterization of the local sensor reporting process allows the fusion center to implement procedures based on Bayesian and minimax formulations to the quickest change detection problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is shown that using the minimax-based system design may perform well when a number of assumptions are satisfied. This design is capable of scaling to large networks and a methodology by which global and local thresholds may be chosen to meet a desired false alarm rate constraint is proposed. It is also shown that the performance of this design can be numerically computed for different choices of system design variables.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents inverse rectification, a novel method for establishing correspondence in depth estimation. The rectifying homography of the projector-camera pair is used to warp a pattern of vertical dash features. The pattern imparts upon the system the property that projected features will fall on distinct conjugate epipolar lines of the rectified projector and acquired camera images. This reduces the correspondence search to a trivial constant-time table lookup, and leads to robust and extremely efficient disparity calculations. A projector-camera range sensor is developed based on this method, and is shown experimentally to be effective, with bandwidth exceeding some existing consumer-level range sensors.</description>

   <description>Polymer rheological properties are important to modern manufacturing, and though polymers have been studied for decades, we still do not fully understand how polymers flow. Subjecting a polymeric liquid to oscillatory shear flow is a common method for probing polymer rheology. Oscillatory shear flow provides rheologists with necessary information on the dynamic behavior of polymers. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of polymer flow by generating a comprehensive modernization of molecular theories that predict polymer behavior during oscillatory shear. Additionally, this work provides a detailed investigation of rigid dumbbell macromolecular theory by dissecting the orientation distribution function to find the pieces that contribute to important rheological properties like the shear stress response and the normal stress differences. Orientation is the source of all rheological property predictions for rigid dumbbell theory. Thus, this thesis also provides a comprehensive experimental analysis of macromolecular orientation. Specifically, light scattering measurements are conducted on a wormlike micelle solution that is simultaneously subjected to large-amplitude oscillatory shear. These light scattering measurements provide information on micelle orientation throughout an oscillatory shear cycle. We compare these experimental orientation results with the orientation predictions of rigid dumbbell theory. We find that rigid dumbbell theory cannot capture all aspects of wormlike micelle rheology during large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) flow. Rigid dumbbell theory is especially incapable of predicting scattering caused by concentration fluctuations arising from micelle breakup, when the flow changes direction. Additionally, rigid dumbbell theory predicts orientations that are entirely out-of-phase with the measured orientations, such that there are no times during an oscillatory shear cycle when rigid dumbbell theory and orientation measurements match. We complete this study by blending different light scattering theories to formulate a descriptive model for our results.</description>

   <description>Single point incremental forming (SPIF) is a dieless sheet metal forming technique that can manufacture customised sheet metal components in a cost-effective manner. However, the process is still in the developmental phase and hasn't been utilised industrially due to low geometrical accuracy, fracture at high wall angles and long cycle times. The goals of this research are to study the feasibility of the already existent strategies to eliminate geometrical errors and enhance formability and to, introduce a methodology to successfully generate vertical walls with the least geometrical errors and thickness variation within the manufactured component.&#xd;
&#xd;
 The impact of friction on sheet interface and formability is reported by recording the temperature obtained by increasing the tool rotation speed and feed rate. A flat tool is used in the study and an upper limit of the tool rotation speed is reported. The limit is much lower than the hemispherical tool reported in the literature and two heat generation zones is the justification. High tool rotation speed and feed rate are found to reduce the geometrical errors but still are unacceptable.&#xd;
&#xd;
Multi-stage strategies such as the conventional downward, DDDU and IO-OI are implemented to manufacture a C-channel designed to support a plane fuselage for vibration testing. Tunnel strategy is also employed. Vertical walls are only conceivable using a conventional downward strategy and a series of steps followed for the toolpath development are reported in the form of an algorithm. The results show that the developed component is affected by severe geometrical inaccuracies and extreme thickness variation.  Cost analysis reveal high costs associated with multi-stage forming in the design stage.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, it is concluded that cost-effective and industrially acceptable flat base geometries are inconceivable through SPIF. The apparatus of Two Point Incremental Forming (TPIF) is modified and a new tool path strategy is developed to manufacture the vertical walls. The results show that the novel strategy is capable of manufacturing vertical walls with much lower thickness variation and geometrical errors. The developed method is cost-effective and easy to implement but requires a die.</description>

   <title>Social Media and Law Enforcement: A Study on the Adoption and Use of Social Media Monitoring in Canada</title>

   <description>Police agencies globally now have access to several technologies that monitor social media, exploiting its data and content for investigative purposes. Such practices fit into larger discussions of policing shifting towards more proactive methods of crime control that seek to pre-empt crime and disorder. This exploratory research draws on 15 interviews from members of law enforcement from two local police agencies in Southern Ontario (referred to as ‘metropolitan’ and ‘medium-sized’) in order identify how local police in Canada monitor social media and what justifications prompted these agencies to do so. What this research study reveals is that social media monitoring needs to be understood in a context of larger socio- cultural, political and economic developments of late modernity, and in particular, growing concerns over risk (Garland 2001), rather than merely internal policing conditions. Such developments have shaped police adoption and use of social media monitoring. This research study also reveals that social media monitoring involves the use of automated and/or manual searching practices used to exploit social data and/or its content. These are two different sets of practices that are distinguished as ‘manual’ and ‘automated’. The former is linked to the exploitation of content, while the latter is linked to the exploitation of data. More often than not, they operate concurrently.  Third party software enable automated searching practices and includes both purchased and open source software, while manual searches include the use of built-in search features within social platforms. Police often monitor social media for a specific purpose, or to respond to an external complaint. The practice can be either continuous, or targeted. Social media is often used in targeted ways to proactively monitor the so called ‘usual suspects’ (Sanders and Hannem 2012). It is used in continuous ways to monitor major events including student ‘keg parties’ and political demonstrations. Social media monitoring may enable more (cost)efficient ways to keep tabs on individuals and to ‘socially sort’ (Lyon 2002) users in order to identify ‘problem populations’. Such surveillance practices further add to a growing ‘culture of control’ (Garland 2001) that has reshaped criminal justice institutions and crime control policies.</description>

   <title>Causal Uncertainty and Romantic Relationships</title>

   <subject>causal uncertainty</subject>
   <subject>romantic relationships</subject>
   <description>Causal uncertainty (CU) is a social cognitive construct where individuals believe that they may not accurately understand the cause and effect nature of social events (Weary &amp; Edwards, 1994). Research examining how CU in stranger, roommate, and friendship dyads has demonstrated that CU is associated with negative perceptions of these relationships (i.e., decreased liking), but the research on CU and romantic relationships is limited (i.e., Boucher, 2015; Needham, 2015). Therefore, I conducted three studies to examine how CU is associated with conflict conversations concerning a recent issue (Study 1), conflict conversations about why a recent argument took place (Study 2) and relationship variables over time (Study 3).&#xd;
In Study 1, data were collected from 100 romantic dyads who engaged in a conversation about a recent issue in their relationship. I used the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) and found a significant CU actor by CU partner interaction. Examining this interaction further I found that at higher levels of partner CU, higher actor CU was associated with viewing a conflict conversation as more effective (p = .039). Whereas, at lower levels of partner CU, higher actor CU was associated with perceiving the conversation as being less effective (p = .023).&#xd;
&#xd;
In Study 2, data from 73 romantic dyads were used to examine perceptions of two conversations about why their last disagreement took place. APIM analyses demonstrated that higher actor CU was associated with finding both conversations about why a recent argument took place as less appropriate (ps ≤ .002).&#xd;
&#xd;
In Study 3, I examined several relationship variables over an approximate 8-week period for 533 undergraduates. I conducted linear regression analyses using CU scores at Time 1 to predict Time 2 dependent relationship variable scores, controlling for relationship variable scores at Time 1. &#xd;
&#xd;
Higher causal uncertainty was associated with greater belief that disagreement within a relationship is unhealthy. Further research focusing on this belief could help untangle how high causally uncertain individuals engage in conflict conversations and implement conflict coping strategies. In addition, research could help disentangle when appropriateness versus effectiveness are important for high causally uncertain individuals to successfully navigate a conversation.</description>

   <title>Beyond the Selfie: self, time, and visibility in young people’s engagement with social media</title>

   <description>Over the last ten years, the use of smartphones and social media has become a highly significant aspect of communication. The convergence of interconnected communication systems, handheld screens, social media platforms, and images has prompted scholarship around the digitally-mediated nature of self-presentation, performance, and everyday interaction. Young people, in particular, are thought to live increasingly ‘mediated lives’ where visual social media now provide the context for the most basic forms of self-understanding and sociality.   &#xd;
&#xd;
In this context, this dissertation examines how young people’s routine use of visual social media is shaping their sense of self and their perceptions and experiences of digitally-mediated visibility. The ways in which high-school and university students (aged 14-22) access Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat through smartphones as part of daily activities form the key context for examination. The dissertation provides insight on the following: 1) How and in what ways the production, curation, and circulation of images shape how young people manage and negotiate their self-identities; 2) How and in what ways the maintenance of a visually ‘mediated presence’ in social media shapes young people’s construction and presentation of self; 3) The visibilities that digital devices and social media allow, encourage, or constrain and how young people understand and negotiate these. The empirical aspects of the research draw upon in-depth interviews (n=35) and social media platform analyses with the same participants, focusing on emerging ‘practices of looking’ as well as the content of images. Findings provide insight into how routine practices of looking that are facilitated by smartphones and social media are adding a significant new component to how young people experience everyday life, particularly in terms of precise social expectations and conventions around managing the ‘new visibilities’ of mediated life.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, different approaches are developed and compared to deal with a noninvertible Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) when designing sequential model-based (e.g., A, D, and V-optimal) experiments. Proposed approaches for dealing with this problem include: i) a “leave out” approach where problematic parameters are identified and left out of the design problem (LO approach), ii) a pseudo-inverse approach where the Moore Penrose pseudo inverse is used (PI approach), iii) an approach where modelers select new experiments based on their prior knowledge without using a formal experimental design technique (MS approach), a simple Bayesian approach that adds prior parameter knowledge to the FIM when designing experiments and therefore making it inventible. This study focuses on sequential A- and V-optimal design because these optimality criteria are relatively easy for modelers to interpret and are the most readily usable design criteria for situations where the FIM is noninvertible. Different case studies are investigated including two case studies involving production of pharmaceutical agents. The results for comparing LO, PI and MS approaches indicated that LO is the superior approach on average compared to two other approaches for both A- and V-optimal experiments. In addition, results indicated that, designing experiments using either LO or PI approaches are better than picking the corners of the design space as new experimental conditions, even for situations where the FIM is noninvertible. Next, a simple Bayesian approach is developed that adds the prior parameter knowledge to the FIM and makes in invertible for sequential MBDoE. Comparing the results of the Bayesian and LO approaches indicated that, the Bayesian approach is superior than the LO approach for MBDoE and the LO is better on average for parameter estimations.</description>

   <title>Modulation of neurogenesis and apoptosis in the adult enteric nervous system</title>

   <description>Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are often accompanied by a loss of enteric neurons, leading to GI dysfunction. Although a population of enteric neural stem cells (ENSCs) resides within the adult enteric nervous system (ENS), postnatal neurogenesis has been difficult to demonstrate in vivo. However, when enteric neurons are dissociated in culture, the brake on neurogenesis is released and ENSCs give rise to new neurons. Thus, the disruption of neuronal networks appears to release the proliferative brake on adult ENSCs. We hypothesized that neurotransmission is the factor that is disrupted by dissociation which may inhibit the proliferation of NSCs within the adult ENS, and that removal of this inhibition will give rise to neurogenesis. Longitudinal muscle and myenteric plexus (LMMP) preparations from adult mouse colon were organotypically cultured in vitro for one week while inhibiting various forms of neurotransmission. Immunohistochemistry for Human C/D (HuC/D) was used to identify myenteric neurons while the thymidine analogue, ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU), was used as a marker of cell proliferation to detect neurogenesis. Inhibition of cholinergic, purinergic, serotonergic, and nitrergic neurotransmission increased enteric neurogenesis. Surprisingly, although neurogenesis increased, neuronal number remained constant. Inhibiting apoptosis in vitro using the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (80 µM) increased neuronal number within the myenteric plexus but had no effect on neurogenesis. Furthermore, inhibition of nitrergic neurotransmission using 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 30 µM), in the presence of zVAD, led to an increase in neurogenesis and enteric neuronal number. However, when attempting to recreate our findings in vivo, inhibition of nitrergic neurotransmission, using 7-NI (30 mg/kg), had no effect on neurogenesis or neuronal density within the myenteric plexus. Together, our results indicate neurotransmission modulates the proliferative capacity of ENSCs, but caspase-dependent apoptosis regulates the neuronal population in vitro. By understanding the mechanisms underlying enteric neurogenesis, a viable therapeutic avenue to restore enteric innervation following GI injury may be identified.</description>

   <description>Increasing evidence has suggested that vagal afferent neurons can mediate gut microbiota induced effects in the brain and immune modulation during gut inflammation. However, the mechanisms behind the alteration in the activity of vagal afferent neurons by gut bacteria and during inflammation are yet to be fully characterized. The present thesis tests the hypothesis that the gut microbiota and inflammation modulate the excitability of the vagal afferent neurons.&#xd;
 	Perforated and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on dissociated nodose ganglia (NG) neurons to measure rheobase and to study the properties of voltage-gated ion channels respectively. I examined the effect of intestinal microbiota on mouse vagal afferent neurons in two ways: 1) incubating dissociated neurons in vitro in supernatant from a community of commensal gastrointestinal bacteria derived from a healthy human donor (Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutics; MET-1); and 2) by inducing microbial dysbiosis in vivo by oral administration of a non-absorbable antibiotic (vancomycin 50 ng/ml). Both exposures to MET-1 supernatant (1:100) in vitro and vancomycin-induced microbial dysbiosis increased the excitability of NG neurons, decreasing the mean rheobase by over 25%. The increase in excitability was reversed using a cysteine protease inhibitor (E-64, 30 nM) and a protease-activated receptor 2 antagonist (PAR2) (GB-83, 10 µM). Furthermore, voltage-clamp recordings revealed that incubation of NG neurons with MET-1 and antibiotic treatment hyperpolarized the voltage dependence of half-activation of Na+ conductance. Together, these findings suggest that cysteine proteases, in vitro and in vivo, increase the excitability of vagal afferent neurons by the activation of PAR2. &#xd;
To determine the effect of inflammation on vagal afferent neurons, the excitability of dissociated NG neurons from mice with DSS-induced colitis was measured. DSS treatment increased the excitability of NG neurons by decreasing the rheobase by almost 30%. The serum from DSS treated mice recapitulated the effect of DSS administration on NG neurons, which was blocked by a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) antagonist suggesting that circulating mediators that activated NF- κB signaling pathway increased the excitability of NG neurons. Taken together, these studies suggest modulation in activity of vagus nerve can influence the effect of gut microbiota and inflammation on brain.</description>

   <title>Transparent Omniphobic Coatings that are Flexible and Wear Resistant</title>

   <description>Omniphobic or anti-smudge surfaces require good mechanical durability to ensure that they are suitable for practical applications.  In general, the abrasion resistance of a surface depends on its hardness.  However, when a coating is very hard, it is usually brittle and lacks flexibility.  New coating materials that impart high degrees of hardness and flexibility without sacrificing the excellent anti-wetting properties and optical transparency would have many potential applications.  However, the fabrication remained an elusive goal.  &#xd;
       Reported herein is a molecular composite that combines these desirable properties.  The composite is prepared via the photo-initiated cationic ring-opening polymerization of the epoxide rings of glycidyloxypropyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (GPOSS).  While the desired hardness is rendered by the silica core of GPOSS, the flexibility is imparted by the glycidyloxypropyl network.  In addition, oil and water repellency is achieved without adversely affecting the other properties by incorporating into the coating a low-surface-tension liquid lubricant polydimethylsiloxane.  Various organic solvents and water readily and cleanly glide off the final coating, while complex fluids such as ink and paint facilely contract on this surface.  These properties are retained after an initially flat coating sample is rolled into a U-shape 500 times or is abraded with steel wool.  While the reported coatings have various applications, the insight gained from the research will also facilitate the design of other analogous materials.   &#xd;
        This thesis also reports the preparation of such a flexible hard omniphobic coating via the thermal curing of another formulation.  The formulation consists of blends of poly(ethylene-alt-maleic anhydride)-graft-polydimethylsiloxane (PEMA-g-PDMS) and cycloaliphatic epoxy-functionalized oligosiloxanes (CEOS).  The anti-wetting agent of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was covalently attached to poly(ethylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PEMA) via the reaction between the terminal amine group of PDMS and maleic anhydride group of PEMA.  The resultant grafted polymer was further heat-cured with the chemically blending of cycloaliphatic epoxy-functionalized oligosiloxanes (CEOS).  Only 2.8 wt% of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) existing in the coating matrix can impart the anti-smudge properties.  Test liquids with various surface tension such as water, hexadecane, dodecane can easily slide off the omniphobic surface without leaving a residue.  Moreover, the improvement of the coating matrix hardness can significantly increase its omniphobic durability.  This coating is also transparent, foldable and has good adhesion to a flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate.</description>

   <description>Previous explorations of quality participation in physical activity opportunities for persons with disabilities (PWD) have yet to address whether one’s perception of quality participation can change over time. Using triangulation within a mixed methods approach, this study sought to explore the participatory experiences of PWD in a community-based exercise program. Over one year, five individuals completed a baseline interview grounded in a life course approach, and subsequent interviews at 4-, 8-, and 12-months. Participants also completed questionnaires at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-months to quantitatively elicit their perceptions of quality participation. Situated within social constructionism, (a) dialogical and structural narrative analysis of interviews were conducted; (b) the mean scores from the quantitative measures were ‘qualitized’, and (c) holistic profiling took place to explore similarities and differences between the two types of data, on a case-by-case basis. Five distinct narrative types represented the progression of quality participation over time, with each case drawing upon existing discourse and socioultural narratives of disability (i.e., tragedy and dependence), and participation in society (i.e., quest, restitution). The findings illustrate the immediate and latent psychosocial, emotional, and physical complexities that accompany participation in a community-based exercise program for PWD. These unique, temporally-nuanced understandings of quality participation offer insight into the highly contextualized nature of how PWD might achieve full and effective participation, and may be used to inform the development and delivery of optimal community-based exercise programming.</description>

   <description>Opacity is a property of systems which guarantees that an outside observer cannot distinguish some behaviour of the system (secrets) from other behaviours (non-secrets). Many companies and government agencies like to make some aspects of their processes opaque to any observer while still needing to reveal some information. To enforce opacity, discrete-event systems have been employed and many algorithms are proposed. One naive way of achieving opacity is to hide everything. However, in many applications this is not possible either due to legal obligations or due to the requirement of sharing as much information as possible with other companies or with the public. Some algorithms have been developed that reveal as much information as possible while keeping a system opaque. However, these algorithms are very computationally complex and they treat all the revealed transitions equally (which might not be a reasonable assumption in real-world applications). Thus, to solve the complexity problem we propose using a dynamic programming approach, which relies on the solution to the longest common subsequence problem. This approach can lower the complexity of the solution at least for some cases (namely, systems with no loops). Secondly, we propose to add utilities for revealing transitions and provide algorithms that enforce weak opacity while guaranteeing a maximum payoff. The correctness of the algorithms are proven and their computational complexities are computed.</description>

   <description>The internationalization of education is happening in secondary schools across Canada. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of international students arriving in Canada increased by 41 percent. Ontario alone hosted over 121,000 international students in 2017, and the numbers are projected to go up. Research has shown that both rural and urban school boards are actively recruiting international students. This phenomenon is resulting in increased numbers of English Language Learners (ELLs) in mainstream secondary classrooms. The study examined the effects of this internationalization from the perspective of the lived experience of a small sample of rural secondary mathematics teachers. Unlike those teaching in urban city centres who are likely to have more experience working with ELLs due to historical immigration patterns in Canada, those teaching in rural areas may not be as prepared to work with the linguistic, social, and cultural demands that come with working with ELLs. This qualitative study used open-ended, semi-structured interviews with five rural secondary mathematics teachers and examined the personal and professional challenges faced by these teachers working in a domain-specific class that also requires a knowledge of a specialized language to understand the content. Three themes emerged from the data: (a) Contextual Situation of the School Environment, (b) Teacher Perceptions of International Students, and (c) Teaching Practice. The study makes a significant contribution to the limited research surrounding rural secondary mathematics teachers working with international students in a Canadian context and a discovery of a large gap in research-based strategies and resources for these teachers, specifically those provided by the Ministry of Education of Ontario. The study highlights the need for improved teacher education, for both pre-service and in-service teachers, to increase awareness and understanding of culturally responsive pedagogy and the teaching of language in content classrooms.</description>

   <title>Exploring Changes in the Father's Role and its Association with Child Outcomes in Mongolia</title>

   <description>Background. Over the last three decades, Mongolia has experienced the effects of dramatic macro-environmental changes with implications on the lives of Mongolians. One area of concern is the influence of broader societal changes on family life and child well-being. This study explores the changing father’s role and its association with child outcomes in Mongolia.&#xd;
Objectives. 1) To explore patterns of father presence and engagement with children under age five between 2000 and 2013 and 2) identify whether the father’s role is associated with illness and education outcomes in children aged 3-4 years in 2013.&#xd;
Methods. This historical cross-sectional study analyses data from UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013. The first manuscript involves a descriptive analysis of patterns in the point-prevalence of father presence and engagement over time and were described according to various demographic subgroups. Sample sizes ranged from 3547 to 6184 across four time points. The second manuscript examines the father’s role and its association with acute illness and preschool attendance in 2220 children aged 3 and 4 using multivariate regression modelling.&#xd;
Results. Point-prevalence of father presence ranged from 78-83% (Ptrend&lt;.0001) and engagement from 40-49% (Ptrend=0.33) between 2000 and 2013. Fluctuations varied by region of residence. In unadjusted analyses, father presence (OR=1.06; 95% CI 0.72, 1.56) and engagement (OR=1.04; 95% CI 0.95, 1.14) were not associated with acute illness in children. Unadjusted analysis showed that father engagement was associated with preschool attendance (OR=1.12; 95% CI 1.04, 1.20) but was no longer significant after adjusting for demographic factors (OR=0.95; 95% CI 0.88, 1.03). Father presence was not associated with preschool attendance in either unadjusted (OR=0.79; 95% CI 0.60, 1.04) or adjusted analyses (OR=0.91; 95% CI 0.66, 1.26).&#xd;
Conclusion. Father presence fluctuated at a national and regional level in Mongolia while engagement fluctuated at a regional level from 2000-2013. Despite these fluctuations, the 2013 data suggests that the father’s role is not associated with acute illness and preschool attendance in children aged 3-4. However, we should continue to monitor changes in the father’s role in Mongolia and its relationship with other child outcomes.</description>

   <description>Background: When measured in milligrams of morphine equivalents (MME) dispensed, Canada has the second highest rate of opioid prescribing in the world. Prescription opioids have been associated with adverse health outcomes, including opioid use disorder (OUD). This study will help to understand how patterns of initial prescription opioid use affect the risk of being treated for OUD.&#xd;
Objectives: To examine population-level patterns of opioid prescribing among previously opioid naïve individuals who initiated prescription opioid treatment for non-cancer pain, and to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists between average daily dose (in MME) at initiation and time to treated OUD.&#xd;
Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study among opioid naïve individuals dispensed opioids for non-cancer pain between 2013 and 2016 in Ontario, Canada. The primary exposure was average daily dose (MME) at initiation of opioid therapy. Secondary exposures included opioid formulation type and total days’ supply. The outcome of interest was treated OUD. Individuals were followed for a maximum of 57 months (to March 31, 2018). We performed Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariable Cox regression to examine factors associated with risk of treated OUD.&#xd;
Results: 1,607,659 opioid-naïve individuals initiated a prescription opioid within the study period. The median age of individuals at initiation was 47 years (IQR 30-61), 52% were female and 88% lived in an urban community setting. The incidence rate of treated OUD within the study period was 86 cases per 100,000 person-years. Compared to an average daily dose of &lt;20 MME at initiation, higher average daily doses were associated with greater hazard of treated OUD, 20-50 MME (HR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.21), >50-90 MME (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.44), >90-150 MME (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.56), >150-200 MME (HR 2.49, 95% CI: 1.54, 4.03) and >200 MME (HR 4.15, 95% CI: 2.89, 5.97). &#xd;
Conclusions:  Certain demographic, clinical and opioid prescription characteristics at initiation are associated with shorter times to treated OUD. Results suggest a dose-response relationship between average daily dose and time to treated OUD. This study highlights the importance of adhering to clinical practice guidelines when weighing the risks and benefits of prescription opioid initiation.</description>

   <description>Over the lifetime of operations at Terra Mine, an abandoned silver-copper mine in the Northwest Territories, an estimated 500,000 tons of tailings containing 540,000kg of arsenic (As) were deposited into Ho-Hum Lake. Arsenic is being released from the tailings to the overlying surface water, resulting in dissolved As concentrations in the surface water of Ho-Hum Lake of 50-80µg/L, exceeding the 5µg/L Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guideline for the protection of aquatic life. The elevated As concentrations in the surface waters of Ho-Hum Lake present a concern for the local vegetation and aquatic life and the local indigenous communities.&#xd;
The objective of this study is to characterize solid and aqueous phases of As present in Ho-Hum lake subaqueous tailings and porewaters and identify the most significant geochemical processes driving the behaviour of As hosting phases. Surface water, pore water and lake bottom sediments were collected and analyzed. Water chemistry results were analyzed using speciation modeling to model mineral stability and aqueous speciation. Solid phase As speciation and mineral association was determined using synchrotron-based bulk X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electron microprobe analyses. &#xd;
Results indicate that tailings cover the entire bottom of Ho-Hum Lake. Primary As phases are stable wherever they are under permanent water cover. Where surface water is shallow near the shore of Ho-Hum lake, available sulphate and biological activity allows for the precipitation of secondary As sulphides. Where positive Eh conditions are observed in subaqueous tailings, As adsorbed to Fe (oxy)hydroxides are stable. Under slightly acidic to neutral pH and reducing conditions, Fe (oxy)hydroxide phases are undergoing reductive dissolution. Where porewater conditions are alkaline and Eh is negative, As adsorbed to Fe (oxy)hydroxides are stable but are sensitive to changes in pH, temperature and organic matter. &#xd;
The proposed remediation plan of lowering the lake level and expanding the outlet wetland would likely destabilize primary As phases near the lake shore and negatively affect the stability of Fe (oxy)hydroxides under negative Eh and alkaline conditions. Leaving Ho-Hum lake as-is would likely result in less As entering the local ecosystem in the long term.</description>

   <title>A Grounded Theory of Creative Identity</title>

   <contributor>Bolden, Ben</contributor>
   <subject>Creative Identity</subject>
   <description>It is no small irony that studies of creative identity have themselves tended to lack creativity. Drawing on interviews with participants who self-identify as creative, this study goes beyond conventional notions of creative identity as either a fixed reality or a mere state of mind, or both. Creative identities are formed and reformed constantly, over time, as individuals enact their own role repertoires. Role repertoires, in turn, are created, expanded, and altered as individuals relate and react to an array of primarily social factors unique to the creative enterprise—threat of failure, partial social inclusion and exclusion, artistic collaboration, and reward.&#xd;
A constructivist grounded theory design was employed to examine the meaning of being a creative individual and the associated creative processes utilized by the self-identified participants. The data collected were used to develop a theory of creative identity for the self-identified participants. In this study the researcher was additionally interrogated through the use of heuristic inquiry.&#xd;
The theory constructed from data reports on the social construction of the meaning of being a creative individual. The data on the meaning of being a creative individual revealed three subprocesses that contributed to the participants’ construction of a creative identity: role repertoire, role performance and self-efficacy. The analyses of the data on creative process revealed three conditions for creativity: isolation, collaboration and creative constraints.</description>

   <title>Numerical Modelling of Methane Emissions From Peatlands</title>

   <subject>Modelling</subject>
   <description>Peatlands could play a significant role in global warming for two reasons: 1) peatlands release methane (CH4), which is a very potent greenhouse gas estimated to be responsible for a quarter of the temperature rise the world has experienced to date, and 2) peatlands are a natural source of atmospheric greenhouse gases, which means that unlike anthropogenic sources, they cannot be controlled through regulations or sustainable policies. Because emissions from peatlands are inevitable, it is paramount that they are quantified, and accounted for in the climate models used to determine emission reduction targets. Quantifying CH4 releases from peatlands is challenging because peatlands are highly variable ecosystems, and as a result they generate highly variable emissions. CH4 gets released from peatlands by diffusion in the aqueous phase, or by ebullition in the gas phase. Since diffusion is a constant process, it is more easily measured in the field, and therefore most previous emission estimates have been based solely on diffusion. However, it is now believed that ebullitive emissions make up the majority of methane emissions from peatlands.&#xd;
Ebullitive releases are poorly understood and are therefore challenging to predict. In order to better understand peatland CH4 emissions, a numerical model of CH4 flux from the water table in peatlands was developed. The model is based on physical processes and simulates diffusion, ebullition and gas-water mass transfer, and is populated by parameters measured in peat. The model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis on the effect that different conceptual models of the peat profile have on emissions. It was found that changing the physical parameters of peat, such as its degree of decomposition or heterogeneity, did not affect the total flux from the water table, but did affect the magnitude and distribution of ebullition events. This is an important finding because large release events may bypass consumption above the water table and result in considerably more CH4 reaching the atmosphere than previously anticipated. It was also found that if only CH4 was modelled, and the carbon dioxide that is also present in peat was ignored, the outputs were comparable to reducing the CH4 generation rate by an order of magnitude.</description>

   <description>This study investigates single-event ignition of diesel fuel injected into methane-air that is applicable to  compression ignition dual fuel engine conditions. Post compression cylinder temperature and pressure conditions were created behind a reflected shock wave in a 76 mm square-channel shock tube. A common-rail piezoelectric diesel injector with 8 tip orifices was mounted in the centre of the shock tube end wall to replicate in-cylinder placement. A single pass 150 mm diameter z-type high-speed schlieren system was used to capture ignition in a 250 mm long optical section. Additionally, direct photography was used in some tests to identify the location of ignition via the first emission of visible light. Tests were carried out at a nominal reflected pressure of 10 bar and temperatures in the range of 880 – 1500 K, with the aim of studying ignition delay within and beyond the negative temperature coefficient regime. The test gas was composed of synthetic air, with argon replacing nitrogen. Both schlieren video and pressure-history were used to measure ignition delay time. The high-speed photography showed that premature ignition was promoted by metal particles in the bottom half of the channel. By filtering out the premature ignition events it was found that the ignition delay time, for both diesel spray and premixed methane-air, correlated well with an Arrhenius  temperature dependency. Diesel experiments were carried out with two injection durations (0.15 and 0.5 ms), and it was found to play an important role in the ignition location but not the ignition delay time. For a 0.15 ms injection time no ignition was observed for temperatures below 1050 K because of overmixing. Methane-air tests were carried out primarily at equivalence ratios of 0.25 and 0.5, a limited number of tests were carried out at stoichiometric conditions. Two-stage ignition (mild and strong) was observed in methane-air for temperatures above 1000 K and 1100 K for equivalence ratios of 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. Constant volume model predictions using two reaction mechanisms from the literature compared unfavorably with the measured ignition delay time. The methane-air ignition delay time showed some dependency on equivalence ratio.</description>

   <title>Detonation Propagation in a Liniarized Representation of a Rotating Detonation Engine</title>

   <subject>Detonation Combustion</subject>
   <subject>Rotating Detonation Engine</subject>
   <description>There has been increasing worldwide interest in research and development of Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) as a propulsion system. A study was conducted to examine detonation behavior in a linearized representation of an RDE. The two-dimensional nature of the phenomenon in such a geometry permits the use of classical detonation visualization techniques. A predetonator was used to generate a steady detonation wave upstream of the test section. The test section was separated from the predetonator by a sealing door such that it could be filled with inert gas replicating the nonreactive properties of the combustion products in an actual RDE. The top wall of the test section contained a linear array of small holes through which premixed stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen flowed into the inert gas filled test section to form a stratified layer just prior to the arrival of the detonation wave. The test section was equipped with windows to permit high-speed schlieren photography. The soot foil technique was used to capture the detonation cellular structure in the resulting stratified layer. The layer height was varied by changing the time that elapsed from when the hydrogen-oxygen injection started to when the detonation wave arrived at the test section. The minimum layer height required for detonation propagation accommodated 10-11 detonation cells. This is significantly larger than the three detonation cell requirement reported in previous studies carried out with sharp interface homogeneous-mixture stratified layers. &#xd;
&#xd;
An alternate rendition of the test was conducted whereby a finite axial-length stratified layer formed by a buoyancy driven predetonator gravity current. In these tests, the stratified layer occupied roughly half the test section height and the equivalence ratio was used to vary the predetonator detonation cell size. The fuel-rich propagation limit corresponded to an equivalence ratio of 2.5, for which roughly three cells were accommodated by the stratified layer. Tests carried out with nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the test section showed a strong effect of the inert gas, indicating that substantial mixing occurred at the leading edge of the gravity current.</description>

   <description>Background:  Incident Learning System (ILS) data are used by radiotherapy (RT) quality assurance (QA) programs for the purpose of improving quality and safety of RT delivery for patients.  The objectives of this thesis were: 1) to develop an analytic framework for ILS data analysis that can be used to statistically explore factors that are associated with error detection throughout reported incidents; 2) to apply the analytic framework to identify and assess factors associated with error detection by RT QA processes using a real-world ILS dataset; and 3) to apply the framework in a pre-post study to explore the effect of various changes made to RT delivery on error detection by RT QA processes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods:  We developed an analytic framework for ILS data analysis that combined relevant incident theory with core concepts and principles of quantitative research that are common to epidemiology.  The analyzes utilizing the analytic framework were conducted on an ILS dataset from the Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre (TOHCC), Ottawa, Canada.  The TOHCC ILS dataset contained 4620 characterized incidents reported at the centre from 2007-2017.  Epidemiologic methods were used to identify and assess factors that were associated with error detection by specific QA processes throughout the reported incidents.  &#xd;

Results:  The analytic framework was successfully piloted on the TOHCC dataset.  The RT treatment technique, treatment intent and the error domain of origin were identified as factors that were associated with successful error detection by certain RT QA processes.  Changes that were made to RT delivery process at TOHCC also appeared to have both positive and negative effects on error detection by certain RT QA processes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions:  We developed and piloted an analytic framework that can be used to statistically analyze ILS data to explore factors associated with error detection by RT QA processes.  We have shown that with careful interpretation, this analytic approach can be used to identify factors that may contribute to error detection by redundancy implemented throughout the RT workflow sequence.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the international, national, and urban dimensions of refugee governance and the geographies of survival in two major refugee hosting cities in the global North and global South: Paris, France and Nairobi, Kenya. I situate this work within two ongoing migration events—long-standing and chronic displacement in the Horn of Africa and the more recently prevalent migration in the European Union (EU). A central impetus of this study is to comprehend the governance of refugee survival within wider discussions of global political economy (GPE) with particular attention to interlinked racial and class-based forms of marginalization in urban spaces of racial capitalism. Refugee governance is understood as the multi-scalar management of refugee bodies from country of origin to various sites of relocation, occurring concurrently within neoliberal and racial forms of capitalism. Refugee survival hinges on three important and interrelated features impacting long-term refugee viability upon relocation in terms of political belonging, shelter, and labour or entrepreneurial access. My main theoretical aim rests on an exploratory exercise into the applicability and meaning of racial capitalism with regard to refugees as racialized disposable populations. In terms of methodology, the North-South comparison seeks to disrupt and reimagine the terrain of refugee governance and displacement. I employ a multi-sited case-study approach that allows for an examination of variegated processes of marginalization in the global North and global South. In particular, the Paris case shows the effects of disciplinary labour linked to conceptions of citizenship in the context of rising French nationalism. The Nairobi case reveals the disciplinary effects of entrepreneurship and finance in light of a virtually non-existent welfare state and ongoing neoliberalisation.  In short, I seek to provide empirical evidence to how racialized regional and national policies influence the urban scale and everyday lived experiences of refugees upon relocation.</description>
